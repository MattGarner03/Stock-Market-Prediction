===== 2025 Q1  (2025-05-07 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Verisk First Quarter 2025 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you operator and good day everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2025 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP result because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning everyone and let me welcome you to today's call. I'm very pleased to share that 2025 is off to a positive start at Verisk, as we delivered solid first quarter results, underscored by double-digit subscription growth, strong overall topline growth, healthy margin expansion and profit growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.9% was driven by 10.6% subscription growth which was broad-based across most of our business units. Our focus on cost discipline delivered 130 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in OCC adjusted EBITDA growth of 9.5%. Elizabeth will provide the details in our financial review but these results are a demonstration of our emphasis on delivering consistent and predictable growth and our results-oriented culture. One of the hallmarks of Verisk's business model is that we have delivered consistent levels of growth across varying macroeconomic and insurance-specific operating environments. The current industry backdrop in which we are operating has strengthened as premium increases are better matched to levels of risk, thus driving improved trends. In fact, according to data collected by Verisk and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, the insurance industry returned to profitability in 2024, recording an underwriting gain of $25 billion marking the first game recorded in 4 years. That said, the industry still faces an uncertain risk environment ahead as challenges, including inflation, regulatory changes, rising reconstruction costs, social inflation and the potential impact of tariffs and severe weather events are making it more complex to operate. Speaking of severe weather, last year marked the second worst year for catastrophic losses since 1950 with the vast majority of damages stemming from hurricane and severe convective storms, including the back-to-back hurricanes of Helene and Milton and that trend has continued in 2025 as the year started with the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles which have had a profound impact on individuals, businesses, communities and our insurance industry clients and which Verisk estimated would result in $28 billion to $35 billion in insurance losses for the industry. At Verisk, we are focused on supporting our clients with the most advanced data, analytics and insights to help them better understand risk and navigate through these dynamic times. The changes to our go-to-market strategy that we implemented in 2024 have enabled us to get ever closer to our clients, delivering better service, improved customer satisfaction and strong sales results for Verisk. We are now taking the learnings from 2024 and applying this improved sales model to a broader group of our business units in 2025, including our new growth vectors. Through our strategic and elevated dialogue with clients, we continue to hear 3 key resounding areas of need. Specifically, our clients are asking for, one, greater and more timely insights; two, connection across our data sets and capabilities; and three, a more efficient and effective ecosystem. Let me spend a few minutes on each and detail how we are leaning in on investment toward invention to create new solutions on behalf of the industry. First is the demand for greater insights. Data and insights that help our clients understand risk across their portfolio is the foundation of the work we do. And through our Core Lines Reimagine project, we are converting data into insights with greater speed and frequency, helping our clients navigate these dynamic market pressures. In particular, the Actuarial Hub within our Core Lines platform provides insights into loss cost trends 12 months earlier than usual to help clients address the evolving pricing needs of the market. Additionally, our Executive Insights reports leverage our statistical data across the 6 largest lines of insurance to help with benchmark analysis and to evaluate individual client performance measures. We are also delivering more granular insights throughout our underwriting data and analytic solutions, as we are incorporating a broader range of data sources, including aerial-derived analytics, permit data, property records, real estate and claims data to enhance our property databases and offer a more comprehensive risk profile of buildings and building condition. And finally, our reconstruction cost data is updated monthly to provide granular material and labor cost information and analysis to help our clients estimate costs and align insurance to value. Our comprehensive database includes over 23,000 line item activities, assembled from over 14,000 material, equipment and labor components. Our team of researchers and analysts survey and report pricing for these line items and components at market level for over 470 geographies in North America. In periods of rapid economic change, we often complete bimonthly updates to our research to ensure we are providing the most up-to-date market information. In today's volatile economic environment, our clients depend on precision to maintain appropriate coverage levels and competitive pricing in the market and they turn to Verisk as the trusted partner for our commitment to data accuracy and timeliness. We recently published our quarterly reconstruction cost analysis which provides reconstruction cost trends at the national and state levels. The analysis is derived from building cost research using our property estimating solution. In an effort to support our clients with detailed data to navigate the changing operating environments, this quarter's report includes detailed coverage of cost changes, inclusive of recent severe weather and macroeconomic events. The second area of need for our clients that I referenced is better connections across our datasets and capabilities and we have many active projects here. One such example is our Enterprise Exposure Manager, a cloud-native solution that combines the unique capabilities from our Specialty Business Solutions and Extreme Events businesses. Enterprise Exposure Manager is a scalable solution that enables users to evaluate enterprise-wide risk across billions of locations with performance and stability, providing an improved understanding of global exposures and insights into portfolio-wide risk accumulations to enable better-informed business decisions. This solution can utilize and analyze clients' data across insurance and reinsurance to create real-time insights, including identifying the risk of multiple claims from a single event as well as trend in comparative analytics. This new solution is also creating opportunities for us to address the needs of Chief Risk Officers across our clients, a newer constituent for our services. Another example of our work to connect our data and capabilities is in our Extreme Events business. We are reimagining the core catastrophe modeling software platform into a fully cloud-native, scalable workflow solution, we are calling, Verisk Synergy Studio, launching in 2026. We recently engaged in more than 100 live one-on-one client demonstrations of Verisk Synergy Studio at our Verisk Insurance Conference last month and client interest and reception was very strong. Upon release, Verisk Synergy Studio will provide a flexible, fast and stable platform on which our full global suite of catastrophe models will be deployed at a lower cost of ownership, allowing for a better understanding of the near-present climate risk impacting the global insurance market. Importantly, Verisk Synergy Studio can also serve as a platform to connect the functionality of Verisk products and data sets and serve as an ecosystem hub for all Verisk's clients. We are excited about this rollout and are in active dialogue with clients ahead of the launch. The third demand we are addressing is the need for an efficient and effective ecosystem that benefits all parties, namely insurers, reinsurers, brokers, regulators and ultimately policyholders. The insurance industry is strengthened through the many ecosystem players being linked together and our ability to drive connectivity enables us to support many constituencies through data relationships and partners. Specifically, we are continuing to grow our ecosystem by continually adding new partners to our various platforms across underwriting and claims, including property estimating solutions and anti-fraud. This is driving increased revenues for Verisk, more choice for clients and more connectivity and interoperability within the industry. We are also creating new platforms to connect different parts of the ecosystem, such as Regulatory Data Exchange launched in April to regulators. This platform streamlines data sharing between regulators and carriers across multiple jurisdictions. RDX enables regulators to review data elements that have been requested in prior data calls, both in their own and other jurisdictions in order to make regulatory data calls more consistent, efficient and less costly to insurers. And finally, just last month, we closed on the strategic acquisition of Simplitium from NASDAQ, a SaaS platform that will be part of our Extreme Events business. Simplitium supports an open ecosystem, where specialized model partners make models, hazard data and analytics available to the industry to help assess the global insurance protection gap. This acquisition will provide our clients with access to over 300 third-party models, providing unique niche views of risk across the globe, supporting the entire risk transfer ecosystem. Now let me turn the call over to Elizabeth to review our detailed financial results for the first quarter.
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee and good day to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, first quarter revenue was $753 million, up 7% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth across both underwriting and claims. Net income was $232 million, up 6% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share, or EPS, were $1.65, up 9% versus the prior year. The increase in diluted GAAP EPS was driven by strong operating performance and a lower average share count. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated continued broad-based growth across both underwriting and claims. In the first quarter, OCC revenues grew 7.9% with growth of 7.2% in underwriting and 9.6% in claims. This strong revenue growth represents a solid start to the year and reinforces our ability to deliver consistent levels of growth across varying macroeconomic and insurance-specific operating environment. Our subscription revenues which comprised 83% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 10.6% on an OCC basis during the first quarter. We experienced solid growth across most of our largest subscription-based solutions with strong price realization in our renewals, expanded relationships with existing clients and solid sales of new solutions. We also continue to see a benefit from the conversions to committed subscriptions from previously transactional contracts. Within forms, rules and loss costs, we continue to see improved value capture through pricing, as we digitize our content, expand our insights and release more client-facing innovations as part of Reimagine. This quarter, we expanded Executive Insights and the ISO Experience Index to another major line of insurance, commercial auto and brought several new innovations to market, including reimagined ratings for homeowners and personal auto. We also introduced a generative AI tool within our Mozart Form management platform to help clients efficiently compare changes in our proprietary forms and migrated additional circular content to our new client platform. In anti-fraud, we experienced underlying strength in the business augmented by strong sales of new solutions like claims scoring as well as the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription of previously transactional clients. And within Extreme Event solutions, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit subscription growth, driven by strong multiyear renewals with existing clients as well as the addition of new logos to Verisk. In our marketing business, we have experienced a recovery and growth from our insurance clients but continue to experience headwinds in other client segments that are more economically sensitive. Our transactional revenues which comprised 17% of total revenues, declined 4% on an OCC basis during the first quarter. We have had continued success converting transactional revenues to committed subscriptions, including the 1 discrete contract that we have previously mentioned which has reduced our transactional revenue growth. In addition, we continue to experience soft results in our personal auto business as well as lower levels of service revenue in certain of our software-related businesses. This decline was partially offset by better-than-expected transactional growth within Extreme Event Solutions related to securitization. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 9.5% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 55.3%, up 130 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. This level of margin expansion reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, the timing of certain expenses and our ongoing cost discipline, including the benefits from our global talent optimization efforts. This level of expansion also embeds the self-funded investments back into our business for invention and future growth. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA margins were 55%, up 110 basis points over last year's levels. Moving down the income statement. Net interest expense was $36 million in the quarter compared to $29 million in the same period last year, resulting from higher debt balances and higher interest rates. During the first quarter, we issued $700 million of senior notes at 5.25% due 2035. And subsequently in April, retired $500 million of 4% notes that were due in June 2025. While we still expect our full-year interest expense to be in line with the previously guided range, the net effect of these transactions is that our ongoing quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year will be higher than in the first quarter. That said, we are comfortable with our current leverage which stands at 2x the EBITDA and is at the low end of our targeted range of 2x to 3x EBITDA. Our reported effective tax rate was 21.6% compared to 20.3% in the prior year quarter. This year-over-year increase was primarily related to a one-time tax benefit in the prior year period. We continue to believe our tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 25% for the year. So there could be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity. Adjusted net income increased 4.5% to $245 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 6.1% to $1.73 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation expense, higher interest expense and a higher tax rate. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 20% to $445 million, while free cash flow increased 23% to $391 million. This was driven by an increase in operating profit and the timing of certain tax funds received in the quarter. As of March 31, we had $1.1 billion in cash on our balance sheet. However, on April 21, we retired $500 million of our 4% notes due June 2025, reducing our cash balance. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders. During the first quarter, we paid a cash dividend of $0.45 per share, a 15% increase from the prior year. We also initiated a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program which was completed in April. We continue to have $1.4 billion in capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We are pleased with our strong results for the first quarter and reiterate our outlook for 2025, or specifically, we expect consolidated revenue for 2025 to be in the range of $3.03 billion to $3.08 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion and adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 55% to 55.8%. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25% and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7.10. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. We are pleased that 2025 is off to a solid start. Our execution priorities are unchanged, as we remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable growth while allocating capital back towards investment for future growth. Our heightened strategic engagement with clients has strengthened relationships and fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry, where we can invest at scale to drive value for clients, employees and shareholders. Our durable subscription-based economic model and strong cash flow enable us to continue to invest in our business while also returning capital to shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: I was hoping you could give us your latest observations and thoughts on the Marketing Solutions, particularly, you called out the non-insurance business seemed like that was a bit of a drag this quarter on the transactional side. I was really wondering is this core to your business or are there synergies that you have with your insurance marketing solutions and that's why you have it or just wondering if it makes sense to continue to be in that business. And just any color on the outlook for the marketing business overall in '25, especially if we were to see a bit of a macro slowdown.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Toni. Yes, the marketing business that we entered a couple of years ago does present us an opportunity to access some of the spend that takes place at our insurance carrier clients. And that part of the business has continued to grow. As you know, we entered those businesses from acquisition. And so those remain exposed to a couple of other customer segments, particularly within financial services and mortgages. And those have been going through some headwinds over the last couple of years. And then as we look ahead with potential pressures on discretionary spend, that could be a challenge for the balance of the year.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research.
Kelsey Zhu: You called out strong pricing realization in forms, rules, loss cost. I was just wondering what's contributing to trends you're seeing there. Obviously, we know 20% to 25% of your revenues come from contracts that have a direct input based on premium growth from 2 years ago. I was wondering if that was the main driver of that strong pricing realization. And just how much did pricing contribute to overall growth in Q1?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Kelsey. Of course, our main focus in that business is delivering the value to clients. And as you've heard us talk about the developments in Core Lines Reimagine, I think they're getting to be more and more tangible that they can see and feel and experience that's contributing to that sense of value. That is supported by the strong premium environment. And so for those contracts with a premium input, the full-year '23 premium strength was very strong at over 10%, around 11%. So both of those things are factors.
Lee Shavel: And I might add, Kelsey, that this is one example. We have also seen this in other product areas. And I think we've talked previously about the strength of the performance in our Extreme Event solution. It's a function of not only investing but also elevating the dialogue and the awareness of the value that we're creating across the enterprise that I think is supporting that. And in terms of ongoing developments, I'm going to ask Saurabh Khemka, who is with us, to talk about some of the features that we're continuing to roll out over the next year or so that will add to the value, the incremental value that we're providing to clients.
Saurabh Khemka: Yes, absolutely. Happy to, Lee. So on 2 fronts, one, we've talked about on the Executive Insights, the Experience Indexes which provide more insights and thus, more value to our customers, as they think about this -- their pricing in this environment. There's also a lot of tools that we're providing for automation and that are driving efficiencies in their operations. So they see value both from an insight perspective but also from a cost savings perspective.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy: So, I wanted to ask about margins. You've had really strong margin performance over the last couple of years. And even now, you've been above sort of the long-term level of margin growth that you had talked about. So I'm curious. I know you mentioned some timing of expenses. But maybe talk a little bit about where you are in the journey of the -- your global talent optimization efforts and how we should think about efficiencies in the business going forward.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Faiza. It is -- margin efficiency has become a discipline that I think has become really embedded into our processes. And there's always more that we can do on the efficiency front. That said, as you've highlighted, we had a couple of years of very, very significant focus on margin expansion. And I think the trajectory of margin expansion from here may taper a bit as our guidance indicates. For the quarter itself, it was a pretty strong margin expansion. Some of that reflects. As I said, the timing of spend can vary quarter-to-quarter which is why we always tend to look at the trailing 12 months. The other thing I mentioned is we had a benefit -- it was a relatively strong revenue performance quarter. It did include and maybe we'll get to this, there was a modest benefit of some storm-associated revenue in the property estimating solutions business which always comes at high incremental margin.
Lee Shavel: And Faiza, I would add one other thing which is the counterbalance to those operating efficiencies, is our level of investment intensity. And so what we are always trying to do is balance that incremental investment that will support growth and even efficiency down the road with the more immediate margins. And so it's going to vary from quarter to quarter. But that is also a moderating influence that we think is in the best long-term interest for our shareholders.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.
Andrew Nicholas: Lee, in your prepared remarks, you talked about bringing the improved sales model to a broader group of businesses and your new growth vectors. Could you spend a little bit more time fleshing that out? I mean, is that specific to speaking to executive groups more regularly, being more in tune with their needs? Or is there something beyond that? And maybe what it looks like in practice in terms of fleshing that out and bringing it to other groups within the organization?
Lee Shavel: Right. Thank you, Andrew. And so it really relates to when we did the review of our go-to-market strategy, it was focused on our largest businesses and so our Claims Sales team, our Extreme Events Sales team, our Underwriting Decision Analytics Sales team. We obviously wanted to identify where we could have the biggest impact across those large businesses. And what we're referring to from extending that is bringing some of the disciplines and what we have learned from the very positive impact we've had across those larger businesses to some of our growth businesses. So with our Life Insurance business, with our SBS business, with Verisk Marketing Solutions, how can we leverage some of that -- some of those learnings against those businesses. And so we're hopeful that we'll see a similar level of success that we've had in some of the larger businesses. So that's the extension. You referred to the broader elevation of our strategic dialogue. I think that's already in place. I do think that, that has been focused on our largest customers but those skill sets are something that we will look to, to expand and be part of our philosophy in terms of how we think about serving our -- all of our clients with more of a relationship and enterprise orientation.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alex Kramm: Just wanted to come back to the, I guess, uncertain environment over the last couple of months, tariffs, et cetera. I think your end market is generally fairly insulated against that. But obviously, you already mentioned with the marketing side that there's some other industry. So just wondering, across the business, are you seeing any delays in decision-making? Or is it true as it always been that the insurance industry seems to be very immune to some of what's going on? But anything you're seeing would be helpful.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks a bunch for the question, Alex. It's certainly something that we've been monitoring very closely. From our own business, from a Verisk financial perspective, we don't believe we have kind of a material direct exposure to tariffs and the implications. I think -- for the insurance industry overall, I think there are potential impacts. If there were to be an environment with higher costs, that would translate into higher costs for claims and claims fulfillment. And so that could potentially lead to lower profitability in the insurance industry in the short term. And so that's something that our clients are monitoring very closely and we're working with them. Indeed, our data and analytics is doing a lot to try to support them in measuring and assessing the environment that they are in. So those are kind of some of the factors that we have been following.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Elizabeth, could you -- on Slide 10, the guide, could you just focus just a little bit more on the D&A line? I know I asked you about this last quarter. Do you feel like D&A as a percentage of revenues will kind of stay in this range going forward from here? Like is there a bias upwards? Is there a bias downwards, again, D&A as a percentage of revenues? And what the implications on ROIC are going forward?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes, Andrew. Thanks for the question. It is something that we take a look at. We haven't given a long-term forecast for D&A as a percent of revenue. The D&A is a direct consequence, obviously, of the CapEx and the projects that we've placed in service. And I think for this year, in these quarters, you're seeing the impact of some projects placed into service that were actually fairly long-term builds, both the work we've been doing on the Core Lines Reimagine program as well as the next-generation financial models that were developed in Extreme Events solutions. So both of those things were some long-term builds that are being placed into service. I think from where we are now, the growth rate of that D&A will probably -- well, the number will converge with the CapEx. I think the growth from here will probably be a bit hair below the CapEx because we're reflecting some of those longer-term builds.
Lee Shavel: And Andrew, it's Lee. I can't resist a return on invested capital question. And I just want to make certain that you understand when we are looking at our return on invested capital, depreciation and amortization which is an expensing of that CapEx is removed, we put all of our CapEx into invested capital. So our returns which would be a classic net operating profit loss after tax, excludes any accounting expense related to that. The CapEx is the capital element or the invested capital element that we're engaging a return off of.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeff Meuler: Do you expect the increased contribution to forms, rules and loss cost revenue growth from 4 lines to play out over kind of the 2- to 3-year adoption period? Or can it extend beyond that with ongoing better innovation and starting to implement AI and whatnot, I guess at the very least help us with cross-sells and other businesses in conjunction with the enhanced go-to-market effort?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes, I'll start with that. I think, look, the goals in the investments that we're making in Core Lines Reimagine is absolutely to be a platform to continue to deliver long-term value for clients and to continue to innovate as the possibility of what you can do with data and analytics and now incorporating GenAI can do over time. So we expect to continue delivering more core value.
Jeff Meuler: Yes. And one thing I would add is for a majority of our clients, they are signing long-term contracts with us. So as they are signing these contracts, they are seeing this value being accrued to them over long term, as we do the contracts today.
Lee Shavel: Yes. And Jeff, thanks for the question. I think one dimension of this is that we are enabling the deeper and more efficient integration of our data sets into their processes which then becomes just part of the way that they're doing business. And so I think there's inherently a real long-term benefit and value to them from that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James.
Gregory Peters: I appreciate your comments at the opening about helping your clients become more efficient with their ecosystems. It seems like that's a pretty ripe area. I was wondering if you could just build on some of your information in that because it feels like even though you have a cloud-based approach and using up-to-date technology, a lot of your customers are operating on legacy platforms that are funky and outdated to say the least. Maybe you could just give us some color on how challenging it is to deploy your solutions when you're dealing with these legacy systems which are old to say, as a -- to say the least.
Lee Shavel: Greg, thanks for the question. I mean I think it's a very relevant question. And the way I would answer it is that there are 2 factors here. One is I think that the industry is taking more steps than ever to modernize that infrastructure through work with third-party vendors, many of which are partners of ours. And so that is facilitating our ability to enable some of the benefits from our Core Lines Reimagine investments for their benefit. So I think we are seeing that. A lot of our work isn't necessarily directly with the carriers but with their vendors and integrating that dataset. And I also think that a variety of technologies that are facilitating more connectivity within the -- with the industry is helping that regard. In that vein, our role as a connector within the industry and within specific functions, like claims or in risk modeling, are providing a level of connectivity and integration that is very costly to your point for a lot of our customers to handle on their own. And I'll give you a specific example. And so you've heard us talk about our efforts to make our claims platform and the -- our property estimating solutions or exact core platform a more open ecosystem. And that was based on a lot of feedback that we had from clients where there were complementary vendors or service providers that much of the industry had to invest time in diligencing and connecting into their systems which was problematic. But with our existing connection to insurers, contractors, adjusters, clients on that platform, it was much more efficient and easy for us to be able to validate, ensure security standards for those vendors and that's an inherent efficiency. And we're doing that in claims. I think we're increasingly doing that on the underwriting side. And as you hear us talk about Synergy Studio, that is also a connective network that I think is facilitating that greater efficiency on behalf of the clients.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: I wanted to go back to your point on improved price realization. It sounds like this is a structural change to your approach to pricing. Can you talk about what proportion of your broader business you've begun to accelerate your pricing increases? And how long it may take to close the gap between pricing and value provided at the broader company level?
Lee Shavel: George, thanks for the question. I'd say, look, the avenues have been focused on where we are making investments based upon feedback from clients on how we can create value for them and recognizing that, that requires investment on our part. And I think that dialogue which has benefited from that higher level, more strategic dialogue has helped us clarify and improve an understanding of where we are creating value for them and how we participate in that value creation. And I think you asked around which channels. I think it's really all of our major channels on the underwriting side, extreme events within our claims business that has been part of what we have improved in our ability to achieve a stronger price realization through that. Now, in terms of closing the gap, I don't know that you ever get there. There's always going to be a difference in perception between how we think we're providing value and where our clients are providing value. I think there is a gap. The objective is to continue to use that as a means for us to deliver more value and capture that with our clients. So in that sense, I think it's a continuous journey.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: I have a question on just the broader market. And so it looks like in commercial P&C, pricing is starting to get a little bit more competitive. We're also seeing that on the personal auto side. Are you seeing any early signs that your customers are getting a little bit more focused on expenses?
Lee Shavel: David, thanks for the question. I would say that our customers have been focused on efficiency pretty consistently at an enterprise level. And I don't think that the -- it wouldn't be our observation that trends in pricing have a material impact. I certainly think that when the -- when overall profitability is challenged and you're seeing greater combined ratios, there's a natural inclination to try to find greater and greater efficiencies. But the general trend that we've observed and which we referenced in the opening comments, is that 2024 was the first year in the past 4 years where you had an underwriting gain and we saw, I think, 96% combined ratio for the industry. So I would say, generally, the premium growth has led to more appetite for investment to support continued efficiencies across it. So I think that's just a general trend. We haven't seen a particular inflection point based upon trends in commercial P&C or personal auto from my perspective.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.
David Paige: This is David Paige on for Ashish. I was wondering on the buyback, can you just maybe give a rough cadence or just for full year 2025? How are you thinking about buybacks for 2Q and 4Q?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, David. We don't give a forecast for buyback amount for the year. And the real reason for that is that we follow our capital allocation framework. So we prioritize organic investment in the business. We look -- we explore M&A opportunities. We've obviously committed to the dividend return and then, we balance kind of balance sheet availability and attractiveness of share repurchase. But to the extent, we don't have a need for capital. We will continue returning it to shareholders in the form of buybacks as well as dividends.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic.
Russell Quelch: So Elizabeth, you made some remarks in your opening comments but maybe you could give a clearer breakdown on the various drivers of the 4% year-on-year fall in transaction revenue and disclose perhaps what the growth in transactional revenue was excluding the impact of onetime conversions. I'm also particularly interested in why there was not a positive tailwind to transactional revenue growth from the -- in the auto shopping sector given the strong J.D. Power data in the quarter? Maybe you could discuss that as well.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Russell. I'll take that as a 2-parter. So first, the transactional and the 4% decline, we quantified for you the one contract conversion that we've called out in the past. This is the last full quarter of that. And that's an impact of 200 to 250 basis points for the quarter. Other headwinds in transactional more generally is contract conversions and we've talked about that before in our antifraud space and we had, in the past, great success with the TPA customer segment and it's a playbook that's been very successful for us to continue to get customers to commit to committed contracts. So we will continue playing that in other customer segments as we see the opportunity. In addition, some of our ecosystem partners are now shifting to committed contracts. So that's a benefit for us. But apart from that one single contract we haven't and aren't able to quantify the full aggregate impact of it. Finally, some of our transactional revenue comes from implementation of software programs and so those can be sometimes lumpy in the start of ongoing subscription. So our Specialty Business Solutions had some significant projects last year that were now comping the impact of. So again, that transactional revenue is really the output of how we run our business in the aggregate rather than something we are managing as a bucket in and of itself. So that was the first part of your question. I think the second part of your question was on the auto business and on some of the transactional headwinds there. The shopping activity does continue. So that business is -- has balanced results. I think we talked in the last quarter about some attrition, particularly in the InsurTech customer segment and our overall mix in that auto business may not be an exact match for the market as a whole. The final point -- the final dynamic that's going on in the auto segment. We've talked about our non-rate action business. As rates overall have recovered in the industry, there's been less activity on that non-rate action deal as carriers shift their focus.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo.
Jason Haas: I'm curious if you've seen any change in client conversation in the quarter-to-date period given the macro uncertainty, if you're seeing any pause in projects or anything like that. And then, maybe you could talk more big picture about -- curious which parts of your business you see as most economically sensitive and which parts are more resilient and even potentially countercyclical.
Lee Shavel: Sure, Jason. Thanks. I'll start off generally saying as, in terms of our dialogue with our clients, I don't think we have seen a fundamental change in terms of their priorities and what they need to accomplish day-to-day and how we serve that. Naturally, there is some greater focus on the impact of tariffs, particularly to the extent that any inflationary factors are beginning to affect their claims costs. And that's something that we're very well positioned to address, as Elizabeth described earlier, where through our Property Estimating Solutions business, we track a great deal of specific supplies and materials costs as well as labor costs associated with rebuilding. And so we have already had conference calls and put out reports tracking any sensitivity and we'll continue to do so. So I would say that's the one area that they have been focused on in understanding the potential impacts of the tariff situation.
Elizabeth Mann: I was going to add -- you were asking about other customer segments and economically sensitive customer segments, so I was just going to add that we are watching the macroeconomic impact on some of our non-carrier customer segments. We talked last quarter, the federal government contributes less than 1% of our revenues. So it is a small impact but we are seeing cost pressure across federal agencies. And so that's one that could have some sort of discretionary spend impact as well as the marketing segments that we've already talked about.
Lee Shavel: So we do have some small segments that are, I would describe as, more economically sensitive but of course, the vast majority of our revenues are from insurance-related clients that are relatively insensitive to the tariff impact.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Brendan [ph] on for Manav. Just wanted to ask on M&A opportunities, we could see valuations come down maybe alongside public equities at some point this year, so I guess, what kind of areas would you like to kind of augment your capabilities? And kind of what are you seeing there?
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Brendan [ph]. I appreciate the question. So certainly, the uncertainty in the market and the impact on valuations is a potential benefit. We also have observed that the private equity community generally has been more challenged in monetizing some of their investments. So I do think that the environment has improved. What we continue -- have been and will continue to look for is where are their products that have demonstrated an ability to add value to the insurance industry that we can improve either by accelerated distribution or integration into our products to enhance their business as well as potentially contributing datasets that are valuable to our analytics business. So we have been actively monitoring that sector. You saw recently a small deal with the acquisition of Simplitium from NASDAQ. So it's a sign that we are watching for opportunities with a primary focus on how do we add value to those businesses leveraging the relationships and the capabilities that we have.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.
Jeff Silber: In your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the weather impact on the industry. I'm just curious, is it possible to parse out what the impact was on your business in the second quarter in terms of claims from some of those events?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. From a wildfire perspective which I think is what we are talking about there, it has very little sort of de minimis impact. I did mention that we had a very modest benefit from weather-related effects in PES that relates primarily to a small tail from the fourth quarter hurricanes as well as actually a pretty active severe convective storm environment across the U.S.
Lee Shavel: And I would say, Jeff, I think your fundamental question was what Elizabeth addressed but with regard to the wildfires, clearly, that has been an important topic. And as we have said, we were the first to submit our wildfire model to the California Department of Insurance. And we've gotten a lot of questions and interest from clients around our wildfire model and I want to ask Rob Newbold, who's with us just to give us an update in terms of the level and the quality of dialogue that we have been hearing from clients on that model in particular.
Robert Newbold: Yes. Thanks, Lee. We were really pleased to bring an updated view of risk for California wildfire to the market last summer, in June 2024. Our client dialogue has been really excellent on the value that model is providing to people's overall risk management. As Lee noted, we're engaging with the California Department of Insurance, allowing that model to be used for rate-making in the state and continue to be excited about the possibilities that will open up to bring global resilience to that particular market.
Lee Shavel: We continue to believe that the severe weather that we're experiencing continues to point to the value of the analytics and the models that we provide to our clients.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For the opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in our call today. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered strong fourth quarter results, underscored by 11% subscription growth and solid margin expansion, translating into double-digit profit growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.6% and was a sequential improvement from the third quarter driven by underlying sales momentum along with certain benefits from elevated storm-related transactional activity from hurricanes Helene and Milton. Despite the storm benefits, transactional revenues were down slightly in the quarter due to the ongoing conversion of transactional revenues into committed subscription contracts that we have spoken to you about [indiscernible]. This fourth quarter capped off a solid annual performance that compounded on top of strong growth in 2023 and was in line with our guidance and the longer-term expectations we set at Investor Day in 2023. For 2024, Verisk delivered OCC revenue growth of 7.1% and OCC adjusted EBITDA growth of 9.9% and 120 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in 16% EPS growth. Elizabeth will provide the financial details in her review, but these results are further demonstration of our predictable growth trajectory and our results-oriented culture. We built strong momentum throughout the year and delivered these results by focusing on three key initiatives: one, enhancing our go-to-market approach; two, elevating and intensifying our strategic dialogue with clients; and three, investing in innovation at scale on behalf of the industry. Let me spend a few minutes on each and discuss how we plan to further advance on them in 2025 to deliver another year of strong growth, profitability and invention. First, in 2023, our businesses worked with an outside consultant to incorporate sales enhancement strategies tailored for each business. As a result, in 2024, we aligned sales territories and account teams for improved client coverage, and implemented new sales force compensation plans that better match with business needs and industry best practices. Additionally, we introduced product integration in certain businesses for a simpler sales process. Finally, we introduced pricing optimization strategies and tools to drive a more value-based conversation with clients. Specifically, in our Extreme Events business, where we recently introduced our global suite of Next Generation Models, we benefited from this new client-centric approach as we are capturing strong value-based price realization and extending duration in contract renewals. After a year of record new sales across all of Verisk, our sales teams are energized as we enter 2025 as they have identified further areas to improve, including cross-business unit sales collaboration opportunities. Our second initiative has focused on enhancing and deepening engagement across the broader industry-wide and C-suite level. This approach has given Verisk deeper insights into our clients' enterprise needs, broadened and strengthened our relationships, and opened new opportunities with carriers, intermediaries, reinsurers, regulators and other ecosystem participants. These stronger connections have allowed us to discuss with clients the value we bring to the ecosystem and have resulted in stronger renewals and improved sales outcomes. This impact has been especially significant within our largest clients where we have achieved accelerating growth. In 2025, we are expanding this approach with more clients, reinforcing our trusted partnerships. For example, our broadened approach to industry engagement has created new opportunities for our anti-fraud business to serve the state insurance departments and the National Insurance Crime Bureau. By leveraging our core ClaimSearch platform and advanced analytic tools, we help automate and triage the increasing number of criminal referrals and leads these agencies receive every day. Our work is helping state fraud bureaus operate more efficiently and effectively, ultimately saving the system money while improving benefits to the consumer. We have identified further opportunities to scale this initiative into additional states over time. Our third initiative is investing in innovation at scale on behalf of the industry. Our strong free cash flow generation allows us to invest both in improving the value of our existing solutions and inventing new solutions to address industry needs. Our Core Lines Reimagine project is a prime example of the greater value we are driving for our clients. Throughout 2024, we introduced new features onto the digital platform, like the Actuarial Hub, which provides tools and risk insights to help insurers leverage ISO loss cost data quickly and confidently to address the evolving pricing needs of the market. Additionally, our Future of Forms tool is helping underwriters quickly analyze and react to form changes that are impacting filings, driving efficiency and faster speed to market. And just in the fourth quarter, we introduced Future of Forms and Filing Intelligence for the Businessowners line. We also introduced a new ISO Forms Library experience with the replatforming of our Forms Library from our legacy ISOnet. The new Forms Library experience includes an improved search function, a more intuitive user experience and the ability to bulk download forms from the library. In total, we introduced 13 modules across Core Lines Reimagine in 2024, and we are slated to introduce an even greater number of modules throughout 2025. In our Extreme Events business, our sustained investment behind cutting-edge science and advanced technologies has delivered models that have proven to be accurate and loss predictive through the recent hurricanes and wildfires. In June of 2024, we released an update to our California wildfire model that included the impacts of downslope Santa Ana winds that contributed to the devastating Eaton and Palisades wildfires. We've estimated a loss range of $28 billion to $35 billion for these two events, and clients who are already using the model had access to simulated scenarios that were predictive of the losses that tragically occurred. We are continuing our typical pace of investment to keep our models at the highest levels of predictive science and have plans for an update to our U.S. severe convective storm model to be released later this year. We are also taking the learnings from our elevated strategic conversations with clients and investing behind initiatives that they are most focused on. To that end, this year, we are increasing investment towards new inventions that integrate data sets from across Underwriting, Claims and Extreme Events. At Investor Day, we discussed with you how we are moving from a siloed organization to one that is more integrated, and this invention focus moves us one step closer on that journey. And we are hearing from clients that they too want help flowing information better within their own organizations and across the ecosystem. Verisk is in a unique position to invent solutions with great competitive differentiation that can help bridge these long-standing industry practices. Verisk Augmented Underwriting is one such example. This innovative solution combines our rich property data sets from Underwriting with our software capabilities in Specialty Business Solutions and our catastrophe modeling expertise to provide a seamless end-to-end solution that enables our clients to evaluate large-scale property inquiries to ensure optimal pricing and coverage. Augmented Underwriting offers clients an automated way to evaluate large numbers of property files that they previously could not address with manual processes, enabling better risk selection and, ultimately, portfolio optimization. Additionally, we continue to grow our claims ecosystem to drive more connectivity and interoperability within the industry. Within property estimating solutions, we have added 21 new partners to our ecosystem in the last year, and we now connect over 100 industry participants, which offers our clients more choice from the platform as well as a seamless workflow tool that streamlines operations for improved outcomes. We are also extending that ecosystem approach within our anti-fraud business, with solid growth from three partners in 2024 and plans to add up to 20 new partners in 2025. This will enable the industry to more effectively fight fraud, waste and abuse, and ultimately benefit consumers and policyholders. During the fourth quarter, we sold a small nonstrategic asset called Atmospheric and Environmental Research, or AER, which was part of our Underwriting subsegment. AER's solution set had little strategic or customer overlap with our other businesses, and this sale is further evidence of our active portfolio management. Before I close, I want to take a moment to address the devastating wildfires in Southern California, which have had a profound impact on individuals, businesses, communities and our insurance industry clients. Across Verisk, we are actively supporting our clients during this challenging time. Within our property estimating solutions business, we are equipping claims adjusters and restoration contractors with tools to streamline the claims estimation and rebuilding process. Specifically, we are offering the AI-enabled ClaimXperience solution, including its personal property and additional living expense modules, to help clients collaborate more effectively and deliver faster and more accurate assistance to policyholders. These capabilities not only enhance the efficiency of the claims process but also provide critical support for policyholders as they navigate their recovery. We also have representatives from our survey teams from Underwriting and Extreme Events on the ground to help understand in real time the disruption and impact of the wildfires to ultimately incorporate into our models. Even before this year's fires, Verisk was the first organization to submit a wildfire model as part of the California Department of Insurance initiative to stabilize the insurance market. Models provide insights into natural disaster risks and, we believe, can support increased insurance availability across the state, which will benefit all stakeholders. Notwithstanding the significant losses the industry is bearing related to the L.A. fires, the overall trends of strong premium growth and improving profitability in 2024 are a positive for the industry's interest and capability to adopt and integrate improved data, analytics and technology into their businesses. Now let me turn the call over to Elizabeth to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, as well as provide our detailed guidance for 2025.
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, fourth quarter revenue was $736 million, up 8.6% versus the prior year, reflecting solid levels of growth across both Underwriting and Claims. Income from continuing operations was $204 million, up 12% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.44, up 15% versus the prior year. The increase in diluted GAAP EPS was driven by strong operating performance, a litigation reserve expense in the prior year period and lower share count. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. Our operating results demonstrated growth across both Underwriting and Claims. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 8.6%, with growth of 7% in Underwriting and 12.7% in Claims. This represents sequential improvement in our revenue growth rates across both subsegments and caps off another year of results in line with our longer-term targets that we laid out at our 2023 Investor Day. For the full year 2024, we delivered OCC revenue growth of 7.1%, compounding on the strong 8.7% OCC revenue growth from 2023. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 82% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 11% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter. The drivers of growth in the quarter were consistent with trends we have seen throughout 2024, including strength across our largest subscription-based businesses as well as the continued conversion to subscription from previously transactional contracts. We continue to see positive outcomes in forms, rules and loss costs as our investment in Core Lines Reimagine is delivering additional value for our clients, leading to strong renewals. In Extreme Event Solutions, as Lee mentioned earlier, our enhanced go-to-market strategy is helping drive new customer wins as well as strong renewals with extended terms. Within property estimating solutions, we are seeing strong sales of our advanced analytics, including XactXpert, and our weather applications, which focus on hail and wind. And finally, our pricing and bundling strategy is driving solid growth in our anti-fraud business. Our transactional revenue declined 1.1% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter. This decrease reflects the continued conversion to subscription from previously transactional revenues, including the impact of the one discrete contract we have spoken to you about previously. We also experienced a more normalized level of attrition, particularly within the insurtech customer segment of our auto business. The decline was partially offset by the elevated levels of transactional volume in our property estimating solutions business related to hurricanes Helene and Milton. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 13.5% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 54.1%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. This quarter's margin expansion highlights the effects of strong revenue growth and ongoing cost discipline, including the benefits of our Global Talent Optimization initiatives. We did experience a modest headwind in this quarter's margin from foreign exchange translation, offsetting the benefit that we experienced in the third quarter. For the full year 2024, adjusted EBITDA margins were 54.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year and in the upper half of our guided range. This margin reflects core operating leverage on our solid revenue growth and continued cost discipline while also absorbing the impact of our self-funded investments back into our business to fund future growth. I also would note that while it caused quarterly variability, foreign currency translation had minimal impact on full year results. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $35 million, compared to $28 million in the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher interest expenses from the issuance of senior notes in the second quarter at a higher interest rate, leading to an increased run rate expense going forward. We do have a $500 million maturity coming due in June 2025, and given that our leverage is slightly below the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 3x adjusted EBITDA, we will likely refinance during the year. Our reported effective tax rate was 26%, compared to 24.9% in the prior year quarter, reflecting the timing of certain discrete tax items as well as the tax impact from the disposition of AER in the quarter. On a full year basis, our tax rate was 22.6%, as compared to 25.2% in the prior year, reflecting the benefit from certain onetime discrete items in the current year as well as impact from our energy divestiture in the prior year. Adjusted net income increased 11.6% to $228 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 15% to $1.61 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by the higher interest expense and a higher tax rate. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $6.64 was up 16.3%, reflecting strong operational growth, a lower tax rate and lower share count, offset in part by higher interest expense. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 1% to $255 million, while free cash flow increased 2% to $200 million, reflecting the timing of higher interest payments versus last year and certain onetime items in the prior year. On a full year basis, free cash flow increased 11% to $920 million, a record for Verisk, demonstrating the strong cash flow generation characteristics of our subscription-based business model. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders, and during the quarter, we returned $355 million through repurchases and dividends. 2024 marks the third year in a row that we have returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. And I am pleased to share that our Board has approved a 15% increase to our dividend and an additional $1 billion in share repurchase authorization, demonstrating our confidence in our economic model and our commitment to return capital to shareholders. As Lee discussed, we are entering 2025 energized and with strong momentum. To that end, we are pleased to deliver our outlook for 2025, which builds upon the strong performance we delivered in 2024. Our guidance reflects the divestiture of AER, which contributed $17 million in revenue in 2024 and was included within our Underwriting subsegment. Our guidance also assumes current foreign currency exchange rates, current interest rates and current tax rates. More specifically, we expect consolidated revenue for 2025 to be in the range of $3.03 billion to $3.08 billion. This translates to OCC revenue growth of 6% to 8%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the range of 55% to 55.8% up from 54.7% in 2024. Further down the P&L, we expect depreciation and amortization of fixed assets to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million, subject to the timing and completion of projects. We expect amortization of intangibles to be approximately $65 million. We expect interest expense to be between $145 million to $165 million, as compared to $125 million in 2024, reflecting higher debt balances and higher interest rates. And we expect our tax rate to return to a normalized level in the 23% to 25% range, higher than the 22.6% recorded in 2024 which included some onetime tax benefits. This culminates in adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7.10. We expect capital expenditures to be between $245 million and $265 million as we continue to prioritize organic investment in our business. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel: In summary, our strategic priorities are unchanged as we remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable growth while allocating capital to our highest return on investment opportunities and returning excess capital to shareholders. We have a unique opportunity to invest in data and technology at scale on behalf of the insurance industry and create value for our clients through invention at a lower cost of investment and ownership than an individual insurance company can on their own. We're excited by this opportunity and the team, culture and organization we have in place to pursue it in 2025. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] So your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: I wanted to ask a question on price realization. You mentioned it as one of the drivers for driving that really strong subscription growth rate of 11% this quarter. How much pushback are you getting from customers? I know in the past, there was the sensitivity around raising prices because you get the data from the insurers and didn't want to sort of rock the boat on that. So are you taking more price than usual? And how are you expecting '25 to look in terms of the pace of the elevated pricing?
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Toni. This is Lee. Let me -- and I really appreciate the question, and I think it's been an important part of the momentum that we had in 2024 and what we're looking ahead to in 2025. And I think the point that I want to emphasize is that we have been more successful at driving value-driven price increases. And that has come about as a function of two things. One, I think focusing on delivering more value and then also communicating and orienting our sales efforts around that value orientation. Two very specific examples that I would point to, one that we've talked a lot about before, which is the Core Lines Reimagine investments that we've made, where our clients are telling us that they are now seeing substantial improvements in the value of the product that they're experiencing. We've also heard that from indirect channels, in fact, clients of ours that have communicated that this has been a significant improvement in their productivity. So that is clearly puts us in a position where we have been able to renew these contracts from a pricing standpoint where our clients feel as though they are getting demonstrably greater value from it. In addition, we also saw strength in our Extreme Events business where one of the evaluations that we did with an outside consultant around the sales standpoint is that there was a stronger perception of the value of our underlying models and other EES products. And so from a sales perspective, armed with that information, it put us in a position to be able to communicate and realize that pricing to a stronger extent. I also think in our Claims business, the efforts that we have made to open that ecosystem has created more value for our clients, and that has been helpful. So across the business, that value-driven pricing impact has been one of the key elements of the strength that we're seeing in subscription. And those aren't onetime effects. I think that, that has been an overall structural and philosophical change in terms of how we approach pricing, that we expect to continue to drive results for us in '25 and beyond.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Brendan Popson: This is Brendan on for Manav. I just wanted to ask on the -- obviously, there was more benefit from the conversions to subscription. Just wanted to see, I guess, how to think about that for '25 and then just how to think about maybe longer term the runway there?
Elizabeth Mann: Brendan, thanks for the question. So let me break it into two pieces. We talked about one specific contract conversion. We quantified that in the third quarter and it's about the same impact in the fourth quarter. That will persist through the middle of the second quarter. So kind of the next -- the last full impact would be in the first quarter of next year. But more generally, we've talked about the success in our business of converting transactional revenue or creating license packages, creating subscription packages. That's certainly been an impact that we've talked about in our anti-fraud business, and one that we've seen elsewhere across the business. Specifically in the anti-fraud, we targeted a specific customer set with the third-party adjusters and self-insured. And that specific impact will also continue really through the first half of next year. But more generally across the business, as customers see the value as Lee talked about, and commit to longer-term contracts, that may be a sustained tailwind on the subscription side.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
Keen Fai Tong: Transaction revenue in the quarter benefited from elevated storm activity. Can you talk about how much of a benefit you saw from storms in the quarter and how much of a benefit you expect in 2025?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. George, thanks for the question. On the transactional side and on the impact of the storms, we've previously said that we have a threshold to quantify the exact storm amount of when they are at least 1 percentage point impact to revenue growth. As you heard in my prepared remarks, it did not hit that threshold. But I will say the revenue impact in this fourth quarter was approximately the same as it had been with Hurricane Ian in the fourth quarter of 2022. But the fact of the business is -- the fact of the matter is the rest of our business has grown that, that no longer hits that impact level. As for expectations into 2025, these storms themselves, Helene and Milton happened quite early -- actually late in the third quarter and very early in the fourth quarter. So we don't expect them to -- those storms themselves to have much impact for 2025. As for prospectively, as you know, we don't forecast, but we assume sort of a normalized level of storm activity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.
Surinder Thind: Can you maybe provide some thoughts around just the state of insurance in the sense of what's going on in California and kind of the shift towards the state being the insurer of choice? How does that impact the business from a revenue perspective versus also the insurance companies being or active in the state versus not being active in the state?
Lee Shavel: Surinder, thanks a lot for the question. And it's obviously a very timely question. So I think, certainly, the most immediate impact, of course, are the losses that the industry are bearing from the L.A. wildfires. And we're clearly seeing that in the financial results that they are -- that the carriers are reporting. I think the consequences of that is it certainly points to the need for the heightened risk and the need for increased pricing within that market. And one of the challenges has been that, up until recently, California did not allow forward-looking models as a basis for pricing. And they have since adjusted that. As I mentioned in the remarks earlier, we were very proud to be the first to submit our wildfire model as a basis for pricing. So I think we are headed towards a recognition that the risk environment has changed. That should provide stability in pricing and a path to greater rate adequacy. But the carriers themselves have to evaluate whether they're getting adequate pricing to compensate themselves for the risk. And we'll see -- we think that we will see that play out over the course of 2025. But there naturally is a strong incentive to continue to serve the California market because of its scale, provided that there is a good rationale for acceptable and risk-based pricing there. And I do think that these risks that we are experiencing within California also heightened the general importance of catastrophic risk modeling and greater analytics in understanding and pinpointing where higher levels of risks are within our real estate markets in the U.S. and certainly globally, and we see continued strong demand for the expertise that we deliver to our clients.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous Research.
Kelsey Zhu: So 20% to 25% of your revenues come from contracts that have a direct input of premium growth with a 2-year lag. And 2023 was a pretty strong year for premium growth, but we're also in the third year of elevated premium growth in 2025. So just curious to think about how should we think about pricing contribution to growth in 2025 compared to, I think, historical levels were more closer to 3% to 4%. And if you could quantify pricing contribution to overall growth in 2024, that would be really helpful.
Elizabeth Mann: Kelsey, thanks for that. Yes. So yes, we've previously said that 20% to 25% of our revenue comes from contracts with that input from premium growth. And we continue to experience that. I will say, more importantly for us, we've been using that as an input, but the ultimate outcome of our pricing conversations come from our clients' perception of the value that we're providing. And so I think Lee talked at the beginning about some of the trends and the value that we've been able to deliver to clients. So all of those things are true. Yes, we see the strong pricing input and we do see that continuing off of the 2023 numbers. But the more important conversation for us longer term with our clients is the value.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy: So I wanted to follow up on transaction revenues. So you've had some difficult comps. I'm curious how we should think about that as we look ahead to 2025? And I know, Elizabeth, you mentioned the storm impact and quantified that amount for us, but curious if all of that was in transaction versus subscription because I know you talked about converting some of those contracts to subscription revenue.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question. On that storm, it is primarily transactional. There may be a small piece of it related to subscription from contractors, but really think of it as primarily transactional. As we think about going ahead into 2025, you're right, there are some tough comps on the transactional side. We talked about the contract conversion from one discrete conversion. And as I said, that last through the first quarter, as well as the tail of those anti-fraud conversions. I would also add in 2025 to think about auto, yes, auto -- the auto activity has a tough comp, particularly in Q1. The transactional activity was still quite high in the first quarter. And we've referenced on the auto side, the insurtech segment and some weakness there, which will probably consist -- continue into the year. As you think about transactional revenue, you should also -- we mentioned the sale of AER. That was primarily a transactional business. So from a nominal standpoint, that would be coming out, though, of course, from an OCC standpoint, which is how we typically measure ourselves, that will not be as important. And then on the seasonality standpoint, typically in the first quarter is one with less drivers for transactional growth with weather activity being lower on the property estimating solutions side. The ILS market is typically less active in the first quarter. So I hope those are some of the puts and takes that help you think about 2025.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Elizabeth, just a few really counting punch questions about the guide. One, is there any share buyback in the guide? Two, the interest expense looks materially stepped-up to me. Like, are you making an assumption about the planned refi in that interest assumption? And then three, the D&A also looks stepped up to me relative to last year, relative to '24. What's driving the D&A step-up in '25?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes, Andrew, thanks for those questions. Taking them in order. Yes, we highlighted some of the below-the-line items there because there are headwinds there. On the share buyback, yes, we do assume share buyback activity in 2025. The interest expense, historically, that's not one we've called out, but we thought it was important for you to understand the dynamics there. If you look at our fourth quarter interest run rate, as I mentioned in the call, that was $35 million, so if you just annualize that fourth quarter, that already shows the impact of the -- our 2024 refinancing, and that gets you almost to the level in the guidance without even assuming any refinancing. So that's -- those are some of the headwinds there that we face as with others in a rising rate environment. And then finally, on the D&A, that is a consequence of the investment that we've had in our projects and the CapEx that we've invested. As we put projects into service and as they support the revenue growth that comes in that, that's the D&A that's the consequence.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alex Kramm: Just staying on the guidance for a second, but particularly on the revenue side. I mean, obviously, there's a range and the 6% to 8% is consistent with previous ranges. So just curious if you can maybe bracket a little bit the kind of low end and the high end. Is it all transactional volatility, which you talked about earlier? Or are there other factors that you're really focused on that can you get -- that will get you to the low and the high end? And obviously, how much of that subscription growth is already kind of in the books today?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Alex. You're right, transactional volumes is one component of the swing factors. On the other side, on the low end, we always monitor attrition and potential attrition on the customer side, including potentially if there's customers that temporarily pull back in California, that could potentially have a short-term attrition impact. On the high end, we've talked a lot about some of the new products that we've been investing in, and we're excited about those rolling out in 2025. If there's a greater or faster traction than we've assumed, then you could see upside there. Any of the products we've talked about, from XactXpert in the property estimating solutions side. We've talked about Discovery and Liability Navigator, the Whitespace product in Specialty Business Solutions, the Augmented Underwriting. So there's some opportunity there on the high end. And then finally, maybe just to be a bit more specific, we talked about transactional as a swing factor, but just to enumerate those. We talked on the auto side about the comps there. Weather and ILS can be a driver of variability on the transactional side. And then I'd also mention on the life businesses, our services support for our customers there can be a transactional variability.
Lee Shavel: And Alex, thanks for the question. I think there are always these broader factors that can influence our business despite us having, I think, very good predictability as we've demonstrated and kind of really tight variance around expectations. But we've talked about the weather events, which can influence things on the margin for us. The other thing that we're watching right now is, of course, there is a lot of activity on the government and the regulatory front. As we are sorting out the new administration's elements, we don't see anything immediately that we would identify, but of course, there's a lot that is in flux on that. And then, of course, more broadly, the economic environment and interest rates and FX are factors that will influence us over the course of the year. But despite those -- the vagaries of those broader exposures, I still think beneath that we have a business that has strong momentum, well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity over the next several years. But thanks for the question to kind of feel out some of the elements of variability here.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.
Ashish Sabadra: I just wanted to focus on the M&A. I wanted to see if there is more opportunities for portfolio rationalization, but also how is the pipeline for M&A and thoughts on M&A?
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Ashish. I'd say the pipeline for opportunity remains relatively unchanged. We have been actively engaged in looking at opportunities, and values remain high. I think one additional dimension that I would mention is that as we have opened our ecosystem in a variety of areas, our ability to understand how new businesses are adding value to the industry potentially create opportunities for us to have a better knowledge and understanding of how those businesses might fit within our broader business. And I think that as we are thinking more -- on a more integrated across the -- on a more integrated basis across our business, I think we are finding opportunities for us to expand and enhance some of the value propositions that we're delivering to clients. So the environment, I think, remains unchanged. There continue to be interesting companies that are adding value to the industry. And I think our own knowledge of how we could potentially enhance or improve that value and delivering it to clients is improving.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Motemaden: Lee, you had mentioned that you rolled out 13 modules across Core Lines Reimagine in 2024 and how that's driving better price realization. You had also said that your increase -- or you're introducing a greater number of modules in 2025. Do you think that, that can drive an uptick in price realizations in 2025 versus 2024?
Lee Shavel: So David, thanks for the question. I think the short answer is we believe that each incremental module that we're adding is adding value to our clients, and so becomes an opportunity for us to capture some of that value that we're delivering. But I'm going to hand it over to my colleague, Saurabh Khemka, to describe some of the modules that I think our clients will be excited about in '25 that we're rolling out.
Saurabh Khemka: Yes. Thanks, Lee. As you mentioned, we are delivering these modules across two dimensions. One is providing enhanced insights to our customers from our proprietary databases. So things like our Executive Insights where we're going to be adding another module, the commercial auto module, and our ISO Experience Index, which we're going to be rolling out across all commercial lines in 2025, are things we know that customers are going to be excited about and will provide more value to that. And the second dimension is the digital delivery of our content, which increases the productivity of our customers as they look at these analytics from us. And there, our Future of Forms initiative as well as our ratings reimagine initiatives will have new modules coming out.
Elizabeth Mann: David, I'll just jump in because -- to address -- your question was about kind of the price realization on that. And so I'll add that, for many of our large customers, they are on multiyear contracts. And so the pricing benefit from these new modules that we're introducing is more of a gradual and sustained opportunity, not kind of a onetime uptick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeffrey Meuler: I get that there's been a little bit of help, especially in the back half, from the transaction to subscription conversions. But subscription organic constant currency growth accelerated every quarter of 2024. You're talking about record bookings, the innovation and revenue initiatives, good momentum. That feels like a really good launching off point for '25 exiting at 11% OCC. I know you discussed some headwinds, but it doesn't totally add up to me. So just anything else you can say that would kind of like offset an exit rate of 11%? And is there any like shift in on when pricing or value is kind of realized for you from like the beginning of the calendar year to midyear that's been happening or anything like that?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. I mean we are excited about the subscription strength. It's across our businesses. To the fourth quarter, and specifically, we -- yes, we had a couple of technical helps. We talked about the contract conversion. I think last quarter we said that was about a 60-basis-point help to subscription, as well as the ongoing conversion across our portfolio. And then just for the fourth quarter, there was a slightly easier comp over the year prior. So those were just some of the factors. But all that said, the dynamics that we see, we are excited about the pricing realization, the value recognition from our clients, and the outcomes that we've had.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.
Andrew Nicholas: I wanted to touch on the extended duration of contract renewals, which I think, Lee and Elizabeth, you both mentioned today. Can you maybe describe a little bit more about what is enabling that? If there's any way to maybe quantify the change in average length. And what benefits that creates, whether it be in terms of deal economics or predictability or how you manage those relationships?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. It is a maybe gradual impact, not -- the extension of contract length is one that hasn't been a material change for our business. Maybe a gradual change as our largest customers are looking for certainty in future price outcomes. And some of our businesses have had success in locking in longer-term contracts. But it's an evolution in our business, not a drastic change.
Lee Shavel: Yes. And I would add to that, David. I think that it demonstrates at one level, to move to that longer contract, there certainly is an economic incentive on the part of the client from our standpoint to greater predictability. Obviously, there is growth embedded in those contracts. But I think it's also a reflection of a greater degree of confidence and a stronger strategic relationship that if that weren't in place or that weren't developing, then I think you would see more of our clients wanting to kind of keep those contracts at the shorter end, maintain optionality and flexibility around it. So I view it more broadly as a barometer of our ability to become even more deeply embedded and a comfort that we're adding value, that we're a partner to them, and it gives us other areas to focus on in making those clients more efficient and more effective.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo.
Jason Haas: I'm curious if you could talk about how your marketing business performed in the fourth quarter and what's your expectation for that business in 2025? Because we've seen some pretty good advertising and marketing spending from the insurance industry.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. On the marketing business, the insurance customer segment has seen strong growth, and we see tailwinds on that going into next year. The rest of the customer base still has been more muted based on the advertising and marketing segment overall. And so we're watching that business as it develops into next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic.
Russell Quelch: I wanted to talk about CapEx. I noted that CapEx came in quite far below the prior guidance range in '24. I think it was about 10% below the midrange of what you're guiding for. I'm trying to square that with your comments that you've been investing more in the business. Wondering if you maybe delayed some capitalization of some projects in 2025, especially given you're guiding CapEx up 15% year-on-year to '25. Also more broadly, are there any comments you want to provide on free cash flow growth expectations in 2025?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Russell. On the 2024 number, there wasn't any major decision or forceful delay of projects there. We're just -- we're always going to be mindful of expenses. And if we don't spend it, we'll be cautious. But yes, I think there are some timing factors that just pushed some things into '25. There's also quite a bit of investment that's taking place also in our OpEx space as well. So those two things give what we think is a healthy amount of organic investment into the business. On the free cash flow growth, we don't forecast that, but we were very happy to have double-digit free cash flow growth in the full year this year. And I think a measure of our confidence in the free cash flow growth into next year is the dividend increase that we've communicated.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Silber: Actually, a couple of quick numbers questions. I know it's difficult to quantify some of the, I guess, extreme events. But the California wildfires did happen earlier in the quarter. Is it possible to give us some estimate of what the impact of that might be on your business? And secondly, Lee, I think you had alluded to some of the stuff going on in Washington. Can you talk about your exposure either directly or indirectly to federal government-related revenues?
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Jeff. On the California wildfire side, as we talked about, it definitely has an industry impact, and it's something that everybody is watching. But from a -- just from a brass tacks numerical impact to us, that will be kind of part of the -- that will be hard to quantify. Just for the avoidance of doubt, I want to clarify that while hurricanes can have an impact on our property estimating solutions business as we provide support to the repair, while we do provide that support in the wildfire situations, but they are far less -- they are far more geographically concentrated. So it does not have the financial impact on our business, typically. I'll turn it to Lee.
Lee Shavel: Great. And Jeff, yes, I think it's a natural question to ask. So revenues from -- our revenues with the federal government are less than 1% of our total revenues. Like everyone else, we've been monitoring the changes coming out of Washington closely. And at this point, we don't believe that we have any direct exposure to tariffs or the trade executive orders. As you probably appreciate, our work with state and federal government agencies work to save the industry by offering efficiency and automation and risk management, which we think is still fundamentally interest -- in the interest, not only of the industry, but ultimately, policyholders. And of course, with insurance being a primarily state-based regulatory infrastructure, the involvement of the federal government on the overall insurance regulatory regime is relatively light.
Operator: Thank you, everyone. There are no questions in the queue. This concludes today's call. You may now all disconnect. Have a nice day, everyone.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where we will limit participants to one question so that we can allow everyone to ask a question. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introductions, I would now turn the call over to Valmet Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator. And good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2024 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Stacey. Good morning and thank you for participating in today's call. I'm pleased to share that our operating momentum continued as Verisk delivered another quarter of strong financial results, led by our subscription revenue growth of 9.1% with contributions from both underwriting and claims. Transactional revenues were down slightly due to the strong double-digit growth from weather and shopping activity in the prior year as well as the ongoing conversion of transactional revenues into committed subscription contracts. Returning to overall revenue growth, unaffected by contract transitions from last year, organic constant currency revenue growth was 8% on a two-year compound annual growth basis at the high end of our longer-term targets established at Investor Day. Elizabeth will provide much more detail in her financial review, but these results demonstrate the compounding power of our subscription-based business model, driven by the value we create for our clients. I'm confident that 2024 is on track to be another year delivering on the strategy and financial targets we established at Investor Day. There are two fundamental drivers to the strong subscription growth we've been achieving. First is our enhanced go-to-market approach, which elevates and intensifies our strategic dialogue with clients. The second is the strength of our products and solutions built on proprietary data sets and continuously enhanced as we scale innovation and invest on behalf of the industry. On the first lever, with our client engagement, as I engage across the property and casualty insurance industry, we are seeing improving industry-wide financial metrics, helped by continued strong premium growth. Swiss Re now forecasts that 2024 direct written premiums will grow 9.5%. So there will be variability by line. Profitability across the sector is also improving as net industry-wide combined ratios have improved by over 2 points to 99.4, indicating underwriting profits. While catastrophe losses are expected to be elevated for the remainder of the year due to recent hurricanes, the expectation is that insurance and reinsurance industry participants are in a stronger financial position than in prior years and better able to absorb these cat-related losses. Since our last call, I've had the opportunity to participate in several industry events, including the Rendez-Vous de Septembre in Monte Carlo, the CIAB Insurance Leadership Conference, and our own Valmet Insurance Conference in London. At each of these, the opportunities to engage with the highest levels of leadership has enhanced our understanding of our clients enterprise needs, broadened and strengthened our relationships, and opened new doors to opportunities to work with them. What I have heard consistently and we are acting on is a strong desire to see us connect more of our data sets and analytics for enterprise solutions directly and with our partners. We are pursuing several product initiatives between underwriting claims, extreme events, and specialty business solutions to deliver on that very objective. Another reflection of our broader engagement to find, develop, and leverage solutions for the industry is the opportunity I'll have to engage with insurance constituencies as a member of the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance. With heightened focus on the importance of the insurance industry in the midst of severe weather events, being at the table with industry partners to find ways to improve is an important responsibility for Verisk. I have already participated in discussions on improving community resilience and managing the impact of severe weather events. In addition, we believe the opportunity to serve a broader range of agencies beyond our role in supporting the National Flood Insurance Program and Community Rating System for FEMA and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act program for the Department of Treasury is an important opportunity to support communities and industry. With all client engagements, the follow-up on these opportunities is focused, supported by the enhancements we've made in our client engagement structure and investments in our sales coverage. I believe the strength in our subscription growth reflects in part the progress we are making in elevating our dialogue and relationships, and then capitalizing on the opportunities we create. The second factor driving our subscription revenue growth is the strength of our data and solutions and our ability to innovate through data enhancement and responsibly combining data sets. Let me give you some examples of our progress this quarter. Our most significant initiative to drive more value for our clients is Core Lines Reimagine, which we have discussed with you at length. We continue to advance our progress in delivering proprietary content to clients more digitally, integrating more seamlessly into their workflows, and providing more analytics and insights. To that end, in the third quarter, we had the first release of an initiative we call the Future of Forms. Future of Forms addresses our clients' challenge of understanding and managing through the complexity of major policy updates. The Future of Forms introduces a data visualization for our forms filing with this first release focused on general liability. This new digital experience allows insurers to save time analyzing our content by interacting with our forms filings in an entirely new way. And the early response from our clients has been very positive with specific feedback saying that this new solution is easy to navigate and a significant time saver for their teams. Additionally, as we have previously discussed, we continue to receive interest and inbound inquiries from our clients through the release of our executive insights reports, which leverage our statistical data to provide key trends. In the third quarter, we added to our library of reports by introducing executive insights for personal auto and general liability. We now have executive insights covering five of the six major lines of business, with plans to introduce reports for commercial auto in the first half of 2025. Executive insights not only provides our clients with benchmarking analyses for their book of business, but also provides a deeper look into the broader market. These reports reinforce Verisk's thought leadership position in the industry by providing this granular and unique view of the data in a timely manner. And the new product creates additional fuel for our client engagement teams, serving as a touch point for new C-level conversations and delivers on a consistent request for more insights. As I mentioned earlier, we are also driving value by continuing to enhance our solutions by combining data sets across the Verisk family. To that end, we recently combined Verisk's claims data into Okta's enhanced peril score for the Canadian market. The peril score is powered by predictive analytics and location-specific data to predict severity and the likelihood of claims at a property. The addition of the Verisk claims data has enhanced the model, driving more insightful signals for our clients and leading to reinvigorated sales growth of this solution. Our commitment to driving value and improving efficiency and automation is also a focus within the four walls of Verisk as we innovate around our internal data collection and management processes. We recently launched a new fully mobile application that allows our field representatives to complete engineering assessments and loss cost surveys directly from the field. We expect this initiative to speed up cycle times for surveys, while also including more data validations and further automation of our quality control process. As you might imagine, our continued engagement focuses on issues that are top of mind for our clients and often top of mind for our shareholders as well. Most recently, Hurricanes Beryl, Helene, and Milton have brought renewed attention to climate risks, catastrophe losses, and resilience. Our conversations are focused on the comprehensive suite of solutions we currently offer that help our clients plan for, react, and respond to climate risks. In our extreme events business, we help our clients evaluate and price catastrophe risks by modeling the view of probable outcomes and impacts on their book of business before the events make landfall. Our catastrophe models calculate a view of loss outcomes, incorporating not only the most advanced weather signs, but also detailed understanding of local building codes and construction standards. Investing in mitigation efforts to manage and reduce losses is one of the keys to containing the industry losses from climate change. To that end, Verisk's work in conjunction with FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program helps assess community level efforts to reduce and avoid flood damage to insurable properties. Known as the Community Rating System, this program is based on technical data on flood plain mitigation that is collected and analyzed by Verisk. Through this program, communities can achieve discounts on flood insurance premiums for their property owners, making flood insurance more affordable for the end consumer. And finally, our property estimating solutions and anti-fraud solutions help insurance ecosystem participants respond after the impact of storms. Our solutions power a network that allows carriers, independent adjusters, and restoration contractors to estimate the cost to repair and rebuild storm impacted property in an automated and efficient way while also identifying fraud to make sure that only the valid claims get paid. I'm energized by the opportunity that lies ahead. In my conversations with the leaders of our clients, there is strong appetite to invest in technologies that can drive value in the form of better risk selection, more automation efficiency, and they are turning to Verisk as the trusted partner to help them. Now let me turn the call over to Elizabeth to review our financial results for the third quarter and year-to-date basis.
Elizabeth Mann : Thanks, Lee. And good day to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, third quarter revenue was $725 million, up 7% versus the prior year, reflecting consistent levels of growth across both underwriting and claims. Income from continuing operations was $220 million, up 17.4% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.54, up 19.4% versus the prior year. The increase in diluted GAAP EPS was driven by strong operating performance, a litigation reserve expense in the prior year period, and a lower effective tax rate. Moving to our organic constant currency results for the third quarter, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. Our operating results demonstrated consistent growth across both underwriting and claims. OCC revenues grew 6.8%, with growth of 6.5% in underwriting and 7.4% in claims. The solid revenue growth is compounding from the 9.4% OCC revenue growth from the prior year and reflects improvement from the second quarter in both the underwriting and claims businesses, as well as in our total subscription and transactional revenues. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 82% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.1% on an OCC basis during the third quarter, building upon the 9.3% OCC growth we delivered last year. This quarter's growth was broad-based across most of our subscription-based solutions, especially in our largest businesses. In particular, our forms rules and loss costs business led the contribution to subscription growth where our engagement efforts and the enthusiasm around Core Line Reimagine continues to deliver strong outcomes during contract renewal as we are focusing on the value we are creating for our clients, supported by the tailwind of premium growth. In anti-fraud, we experienced strong growth in our claim search and claims essential solutions, primarily driven by the continued success of our pricing and bundling strategy, with a focus on third-party administrators. Growth was also augmented by a strong uptake of some of our newer solutions, including claims coverage identifier and claims scoring. In extreme event solutions, we delivered another quarter of very strong growth. We are hearing from our insurers, reinsurers, and brokers' clients that they value our continuous updates to our models incorporating the most recent data and science, including in our next generation models. This momentum has led to an additional 10 new clients signed in this quarter alone, as our sales teams are capitalizing on the growth of certain client segments, including excess and surplus lines of insurance and managing general agents or MGAs. Finally, this quarter's subscription growth does also reflect the benefit of ongoing conversions to subscription from previously transactional contracts, including the one discrete government contract that we mentioned last quarter, which contributed approximately 60 basis points to the third quarter's subscription revenue growth. Our transactional revenues, representing 18% of total revenue in the quarter, declined 2.5% on an OCC basis. This decline was a function of the strong results reported last year, which benefited from elevated levels of weather auto shopping activity and the non-rate action deal. This decline also reflects the impact of the conversions to subscription from previously transactional revenue. If you normalized for the one discrete contract conversion previously mentioned, transactional revenue growth would have been essentially flat. Partially offsetting the decline, we did experience double-digit growth in international underwriting, including life, health, and travel business. A modest transactional benefit from the storms in our property estimating solutions business and strong transactional growth in our personal lines property solutions as our carrier clients are turning to Verisk data to help them navigate rising premiums in that line of insurance. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results, OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.2% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 55.2%, up 120 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. As we have mentioned previously, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of expenditures. Therefore, we find it useful to examine our margin on a trailing 12 month basis, which stood at 54.6% at the end of the third quarter, up 130 basis points year-over-year. This level of margin expansion highlights the effects of strong revenue growth, ongoing cost discipline, and our global talent optimization initiative, offset in part by continued investment in our finance transformation and higher medical benefit expenses. Additionally, our margins benefited from a foreign exchange translation impact, which helped margins by approximately 60 basis points in the quarter. This FX benefit was not contemplated in our guidance, as we do not forecast or hedge foreign currency. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect our margins to remain in the 54% to 55% range. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our margin expansion targets, while strategically investing in future growth opportunities. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $32 million compared to $29 million in the same period last year. This increase is primarily due to higher interest expenses from the issuance of senior notes in the second quarter at a higher interest rate, leading to an increased run rate expense going forward. Our current leverage remains at 2 times, which is at the lower end of our targeted range of 2 to 3 times adjusted EBITDA. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.9% compared to 25% in the prior year quarter. The prior year quarter's rate was elevated due to one-time items that did not repeat. For the fourth quarter, we believe that our tax rate will be in the previously provided range of 23% to 25%. There could always be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity. Adjusted net income increased 7.8% to $239 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9.9% to $1.67 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate, and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 18% to $296 million, while free cash flow increased 23% to $241 million, demonstrating the strong cash flow generation characteristics of our subscription-based business model. We are committed to returning capital to shareholders, and during the quarter, we returned $455 million through repurchases and dividends. This includes our new $400 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in October, and our cash dividend of $0.39 per share, an increase of 15% from 2023. We are pleased with the third quarter and year-to-date performance. Our outlook for 2024 remains unchanged. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. Below the line, we expect fixed asset depreciation to be at the high end of the range as we continue to put new projects into service. Combined with the slightly higher net interest expense due to our refinancing, the net result is that we still expect adjusted earnings in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel : Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our strategic priorities are unchanged as we remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable growth while allocating capital to our highest return on investment opportunities and returning excess capital to shareholders. Our focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients has strengthened relationships and fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for our clients, employees, and shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Just given where we are in the year, I'm trying to think of through the dynamics for 2025. So I think there was 10% net premium growth in the industry in 2023. So the part that's tied to your premiums should be pretty strong. And transactional has pretty easy comps over the next four quarters. And then it seems like extreme events and life and international are going really well. So I guess my question is, is 2025 setting up for an outsized year of growth? Or are there any headwinds that we should be thinking about?
Elizabeth Mann: As we think about 2025, I think you've articulated well the tailwinds that we see in the business, the subscription momentum that we feel and the continued strong premium environment. As we think about potential headwinds that could offset it, we are going into the third year of elevated premium growth. And so, that is a longer cycle that the pricing momentum can feel those challenges. I think another element we are in an environment where the carriers are very focused on their profitability. They're evaluating lines of business and which ones that they are in, as well as kind of evaluating their overall spend. So that is one element of headwind. And then finally, you could start to see a normalization of attrition, which has been a boost for us over the last couple of years. So those are some of the headwinds. Then as an unknown, there is the weather factor. But in general, as we think about it, we do see strong momentum in the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.
Ashish Sabadra: Is there a way for us to estimate the tailwinds from the hurricanes Helene and Milton in 4Q, but also the tailwinds for the property estimating solutions going forward.
Elizabeth Mann: As we think about the fourth quarter – and both Helene and Milton hit in the fourth quarter, Helene was the very end of September, Milton obviously in early October – it is early to tell and quantify the impact to us. You can look at the estimates of insured losses that have been published. Verisk's estimates, which our extreme events business has published, had insured losses estimated at $6 billion to $11 billion for Helene and $30 billion to $50 billion for Hurricane Milton. As you look at those combined, you could say on average they're similar to Hurricane Ian. But the flow through to us can vary based on the number of assignments, the type of peril, whether it's wind or flood, the overall area covered by the storm. And from what we're seeing, it does take time for the claim to actually be filed as everyone there is focused on getting those communities back on their feet. The other thing I do want to put in context as you think about those – the impact of those storms in the fourth quarter. You've heard us talk in general across the business about converting contracts from transactional to subscriptions and from customers increasing their usage and committing to higher tiers. And that's happening in this property estimating solutions business as well. We've seen customers increasing their usages and then adapting their subscription contracts to reflect that higher usage. So how that could play out over time could mean less transactional swings on the impact of one single storm proportionally because the customers may be less likely to be in overage. So that transition to subscription has in general been a win-win for our business and you've seen it play out in our subscription growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu with Autonomous.
Kelsey Zhu: It's just on subscription revenues in Q3. I was wondering if you can share a bit more colors on what drove the acceleration of growth. I know you've highlighted a number of segments where you've seen really strong growth and one of them is property estimating solutions. Now I was wondering if that is also impacted by kind of demand around Hurricane Helene and Milton as well.
Elizabeth Mann: As we looked at, you're right, we've seen accelerating subscription growth even sequentially from last quarter. When you really look at it, it isn't any one thing or one area of our business. Obviously, we've now called out and quantified the impact of the contract conversion, but the underlying subscription growth really hits across all of our businesses and the drivers are the ones that we really highlighted in the prepared remarks. It's the two factors, our focus go-to-market and customer client engagement and then the strengths being driven by our product development and innovation. And those two things are supported by the tailwind of premium growth. But in general, what you're seeing is the momentum from new sales from conversions to subscription and from upsizing usage and adding products from Verisk.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.
Surinder Thind: As we think about just the current health of the insurance companies and all of the change that's kind of pending, how do we think about this idea that insurance companies are trying to enter this period of much more focused profitability and you hear about – you see what's going on in Florida, California, some of the topics that we've talked about in the past. How are you guys assessing that? I don't want to call it a headwind, but just that transition that the industry seems to be going under in this part of the cycle.
Lee Shavel: Surinder, thank you very much for the question, particularly value the context and looking at the industry as a whole, which as you know, we spend a lot of time thinking about. From our perspective, I think when you look at the premium growth, you look at the improvements in the combined ratios and overall profitability of the business, and particularly in light of the significant storms and some of the hits that the industry has taken, I think it's a reflection of continued interest in the data and the analytics that we provide to them to make better risk decisions, which will continue to be a driver of opportunity for us because we can gather that information, we can apply analytical methods across – that can be utilized across the industry. But also to your point in terms of moving into this more focused profitability dimension, our work to identify where we can improve their internal processes by automating more of their functions, integrating data into the workflow has been a very active component of those higher level enterprise discussions that we're having. And it's a conversation that is happening at the chief information officer level and the CEO level or the heads of business that are interested in improving their process. And then a second element of that is how do we integrate external parties that are part of the insurance ecosystem in what they're doing to improve overall efficiency. A great example of that is what we have been doing in London with our white space platform where we are integrating brokers and underwriters to both improve the efficiency of that interaction, but also improving the data quality that the underwriters are utilizing to make to make placement decisions. So I think everything that you're that you are describing encourages continued engagement with us on finding and developing those solutions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy: I wanted to ask about the benefits that you've been highlighting from Core Lines Reimagine. I'm curious of where we are in that journey and maybe if you could share with us sort of what percentage of your clients or any metrics you want to share are sort of on that Core Lines Reimagine program. And I think you talked about the new initiative called the Future of Forms. Should we expect that to be sort of a continuing or a similar level of value driver as we look ahead to 2025 and beyond?
Lee Shavel: I'm delighted to talk about that. I'm actually going to ask Saurabh Khemka who leads that business and has been an architect and a driver of that Core Lines Reimagined. And I'll just say that if both qualitatively the feedback and the engagement that we're getting from clients, we referred a little bit of that in terms of the executive insights that we're providing to them, but also the very specific dynamic of our ability to capture the value of that through the repricing of our longer term contracts and what we're hearing. But allow me to have Saurabh give more color in terms of what he's hearing directly from clients there.
Saurabh Khemka: I think you had asked three things. First, in terms of where we are with the program, we are slightly more than halfway through the program as we think about the investment and where we are in terms of bringing new innovations to the customers. Second, you talked about how do we think about KPIs and how do we think about KPIs internally about the program. One of the things we look at is the number of new insights that we're bringing to market and the number of new insights that customers are benefiting from. So we've talked about the experience index where we've now launched that for five out of the six major lines of business. We'll launch the sixth one next year. The Future of Forms that we talked about, we started with our major general liability update. We expect that to become part of our major updates going forward. So you will see that next year as we bring in new updates to our BOP program. You're going to see that. So that is a continuous innovation that we're going to bring to market. And one thing that I just want to highlight that brings it all together for us as we think about customers and their engagement, we have a new engagement platform at core.verisk.com and we're highlighting that to our customers. And what we're seeing is as we're putting these new content and our existing content on this new platform, the engagement level is multiple times what we had previously. So we're excited that these new innovations are driving usage at our customers, which, as you know, drives the value for us from a core lines perspective.
Lee Shavel: And if I could add in a broader sense, I think that this is a reflection of several things. One, it's improving our ability to utilize the data sets because we've effectively had to pull those data sets out, manipulate them in ways in order to deliver them to our clients more effectively, which facilitates more fluidity analytically in what we can do and coupled with both the strong response that we're getting from clients to the product and our higher level of engagement. It is, I think, a change in the culture in which we're approaching developing our business. And while there are specific targets and product enhancements that we're pursuing, I think that it actually opens up a broader opportunity for us to think about how we utilize those data sets in new ways, serving other constituencies within our clients.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman: When you were talking about 2025 headwinds, and I appreciate the business has a lot of momentum, it's just prudent to mention the headwinds as well. One of the things you didn't list there is kind of the continued conversion from non-subs to subs. And we had that dynamic. You were kind enough to help us quantify it this quarter. But do you feel like that's going to be a notable headwind going forward?
Elizabeth Mann: The impact of that one conversion will be felt for approximately a year from the second quarter. So you'll see that. But we were talking about the business in aggregate. That's just a geographic shift from transaction to subscription, which is why I didn't call it out as a headwind overall.
Lee Shavel: I think that is an important distinction. And that's the reason why I pulled back to the overall growth. That adjustment was a specific geographic just shift from transactional to subscription. But that doesn't impact, I think, the longer term, the longer term opportunity for growth that we see in both the transactional and the subscription businesses.
Andrew Steinerman: Lee, when you said 8% in your prepared remarks, you just meant all in total organic review growth a year ago. It was nine 9.4%. And this quarter was 6.8%. And you just did the two year stack for that. Right?
Lee Shavel: That's exactly right, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeff Meuler: Can you just give us any sense of, I guess, bookings, trends or quota attainment? The reasons you're citing as the primary drivers of the subs acceleration and momentum sound like better solution sales, not just the industry written premium tailwinds and transaction to subs conversion. But just if you can give us any sense on how bookings are trending.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes, they are trending well. That subscription growth is a function of strength overall, strength in acquiring new customers, strength in selling – all of the factors we talked about, cross sell and upsell and adding some of our new products and data sets.
Lee Shavel: I would broaden it to say, I think we are – the sales results have been strong relative to our expectations, given this performance and I think reflective of some of the changes that we made in our go-to-market strategy, focusing some of our territories, changing incentives, making some adjustments there, coupled with the higher level engagement, which is opening up opportunities for us to make a more value driven sale at a senior level. And so, it's a complementary impact of that higher senior level engagement and then more effective follow up and engagement on the sales front.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Just a somewhat similar question. But, Elizabeth, I think in your remarks, you mentioned how Core Lines Reimagined, the progress there, was leading to better renewals. You mentioned pricing, but also it sounded like there was a volume component. So I was just hoping for some examples of how and what with that Core Lines Reimagined upgrade like are you – is the customer buying more of? I understand there's probably a pricing element because it's upgraded, but just some help there just to visualize that would be helpful.
Elizabeth Mann: For Core Lines Reimagined, there isn't exactly a volume component per se. So we're referring more to addition of new data sets, particularly in the underwriting data and analytics solutions business, as well as there's some growth products affiliated with Core Lines Reimagined, things like electronic ratings content and other ratings of the service. So, those are some of the types of additions that clients could be adding.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Andrew Nicholas: I wanted to ask on extreme event solutions. Elizabeth, you talked about or cited 10 new customer wins in the quarter in a few of the different customer segments where you're having success. Could you flesh that out a little bit more? Where are those wins coming from? What specifically is driving that increased interest from clients? And then also, like within that, are those competitive takeaways or are those taking advantage of white space on the extreme event front?
Elizabeth Mann: Of those 10 new customers, 9 of them are new to the modeling space entirely. So, I think this this shows and reflects the broader interest of adding more specific modeling information around the climate change and climate impacts that we're seeing. And I called out specifically some of the segments including excess and surplus lines of insurance and the managing general agents, which has been a significant growth area in the insurance industry, and focusing on those areas is something that has driven strength across our business, but the extreme events business has seen that as well. Let me also add my colleague Rob Newbold who runs that business to see if there's anything he'd add to that.
Rob Newbold: I'll just add to the point that, obviously, there have been heightened catastrophe loss activity for the past several years as we've referenced in past calls. Helene and Milton have already been mentioned. And you see an increasing number of market participants looking to better understand and quantify the risk from these events and that's driving interest in extreme event modeling solutions.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alex Kramm: Just maybe quickly on the auto shopping trends, I think this was the first quarter where it finally turned from a tailwind to a headwind. So, maybe you can help us a little bit in terms of the potential outlook here, maybe if we stay flat at these current levels how much that would weigh on the growth in the next 12 months or maybe if it's down whatever 10%, 15%, what that would mean for overall growth if you can be that specific.
Elizabeth Mann: You've heard us call out over the past five, six quarters now the strength in the auto shopping activity and more generally the transactional revenue growth in our auto insurance data business. And so, those headwinds are now playing out in the quarter as expected. I'm not sure we can quantify them in the future other than to say that the comps continue to be challenging on the transactional side for the auto business.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Jeffrey Silber with BMO Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Silber: You reaffirmed your 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, but it applies a pretty wide range for the fourth quarter. Are you being overly conservative or can you at least give us some indication what would be at the top end of the range or the low end of the range in terms of what's driving those assumptions.
Elizabeth Mann: As you know, for our guidance, our intention has always been to provide a full year estimate and not to give kind of quarterly mark-to-market. Obviously, here where we are, there's one quarter left. So, you're inferring that. But I think from everything we see, we are very much in line with that full year range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Knudsen with Evercore.
Peter Knudsen: Thank you for the helpful color and the prepared remarks on some of the new initiatives and products Verisk has rolled out and been working on. I'm wondering if you could share some more color specifically on the Discovery Navigator tool, if there are any adoption or utilization metrics you could share, that would be great. And maybe just more generally on any of your Gen AI capabilities. How are those going and what kind of conversations are our clients having with you around those products?
Lee Shavel: On your question, I'm going to ask Maroun Mourad, who has responsibility for our claims business and the Discovery Navigator feature to talk a little bit about how our clients are interacting with that. And then I'll circle back and provide some more color on a number of the Gen AI initiatives that we've been pursuing.
Maroun Mourad: Within claims, we have been thoughtfully and responsibly deploying Gen AI solutions, both internally to drive productivity and externally to help our clients on their talent augmentation, modernization, as well as productivity journeys. To your specific question around Discovery Navigator and our casualty and bodily injury space, Discovery Navigator is effectively an AI driven automation innovation in the medical data extraction space that helps us extract specific data elements, organize and catalog them, and in addition, provide an executive summary to case files. And the technology has been developed with the help and supervision over a 12 to 14-month period of our highly experienced medical, as well as legal staff within the casualty business. We've also embarked just to add a couple of other notes on an innovation journey in the property estimating space for Gen AI. And a couple of examples there is an adjuster Copilot transcription summary that helps drive efficiency for adjusters, whether they're independent or working for companies as well as a last note summary as well within a claims file.
Lee Shavel: Peter, just to kind of broaden that out, in fact, your timing is great. Last week, we had, within Verisk, a Gen AI day where we pulled together all of our Gen AI practitioners and our data analytics executives to talk about how they are developing in their specific areas, generative AI for their for their tools, so that we can learn from each other, understand what's working and what's not. Some of the some of the products that we talked about was within our fast business, utilizing a feature called Ask Max, which is a an intelligent virtual assistant that helps clients understand how to utilize the fast installations for configuring and for end user processes, which facilitates their effectiveness and deploying that solution. We've talked previously about our underwriting copilot that we are working with a number of clients to develop to pull together data sets and automate functions in the underwriting, particularly in commercial property where we have a lot of data sets. We also have an application for our premium auditing as a service element. There's a lot of complex premium actuarial information. And this AI application helps cut the research time and empowers our customers to make informed decisions by accelerating their ability to retrieve and summarize premium audit documents. We also have an AI knowledge tool for our ISO electronic rating content that provides organized and detailed information about ISO circulars. And then we're also applying this to our Mozart Forms Composer. And you heard SK talk earlier about our Future of Forms. We are also applying an AI solution that will call out and summarize any changes made to ISO forms across versions. So this is just a sample of probably half dozen to a dozen specific applications as we're integrating this technology across our products to again improve the efficiency and productivity of our clients underwriting and claims professionals.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: Transactional revenue, tough comps begin to lap in 4Q. Can you discuss what transactional revenue trends in 4Q are incorporated into your guidance? And how much benefit from hurricanes Helene and Milton is actually embedded into the reiterated outlook versus your upside?
Elizabeth Mann: I think we forecast in each year for sort of an average year of storms. I think you heard me talk about some of the puts and takes on Helene and Milton in the fourth quarter. The transactional revenue comps do lap, but of course, if you just look at the growth rate in the prior year, that itself was lapping the Hurricane Ian in the fourth quarter of 2022. The final thing I'll point out on the transactional variability is the contract conversion that we called out this quarter will continue to play out in the fourth quarter and first quarter next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Haas with Wells Fargo.
Jason Haas: I'm curious if you could walk through again the moving pieces on guidance. It sounds like there's now at least some level of hurricane benefit baked into 4Q. I think I also caught that there was a 60 basis point benefit to margins from FX in 3Q. I'm not sure if you now expect to see something similar in 4Q. And then it sounds like there was an offset from higher interest expenses. I'm sorry if I missed it, but if you could say what interest expense you're expecting for 4Q and then if there's just any other puts and takes that I missed, it would be appreciated if you could walk through this again.
Elizabeth Mann: Our guidance ranges are really for the full year, and so the puts and takes that we're talking about in the quarter are all kind of small relative to that, but happy to walk you through those in order. On the margin, we called out for this quarter the 60 basis point FX benefit, which was not contemplated in the guidance range, nor do we forecast that for the fourth quarter. We feed that to the currency traders, I guess. The interest expense I called out was $32 million this quarter, up from $29 million the year previous. You could think of that as a reasonable run rate. Possibly over time, I suppose the net interest expense would go up as interest rates earned on cash balances could come down. I think those were the various puts and takes that I called out for the full year guidance and that hit the third quarter.
Jason Haas: It sounds like, otherwise to the underlying business, there's no change relative to your prior guidance?
Elizabeth Mann: That's right.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn Atlantic.
Russell Quelch: I wanted to ask about the international business. I think you called out, if I heard it right, in the pre-scripted remarks, you've seen an increased contribution to growth from the international business in the quarter. Maybe you could be a bit more specific about that, exactly what parts of the international business that's coming from, and if this is an area where you might look for further inorganic opportunities to grow in 2025, now you're at the bottom end of your leverage range and obviously funding rates are coming down.
Lee Shavel: We've seen strength actually in a number of our international businesses. I think we called out the life health and travel business, which continues to expand into new regions and being pulled there by their customers. So that's seen strong growth. Our Okta business in Canada contributed as well to that growth. I think Lee talked about some of the integration of some of the Verisk data sets there. So that's a good example of synergies and strength from the Verisk overall business contributing to one of our international acquisitions. So all of those are factors for good growth and our claims businesses in Germany have been doing well as well. So, yes, that is an area where we will continue to look for potential acquisitions.
Lee Shavel: I would just add also, as we've talked about with our specialty business solutions business, that we continue to see strength and a strong contribution to our overall growth rate from the services that they're providing.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Therefore, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2024 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. As we mark the halfway point in 2024, I can confidently say that we are on track to deliver against the strategic, operational and financial goals that we articulated at Investor Day and in our 2024 full year guidance. Elizabeth will provide the detailed financials, but at a high level, Verisk delivered solid organic constant currency revenue growth led most importantly by strong subscription growth of 8.3% that was broad-based across most of our businesses. This was partly offset in the quarter by modest declines in our transactional business, related to historically high volumes in auto shopping and elevated weather-related activity in the prior year quarter, which made for tough comparisons to normalized activity this quarter. We also experienced a drag on our transactional growth from the conversion of transaction-based contracts to subscriptions, which enhances the consistency of our growth going forward. To put this quarter in perspective and minimize the transaction to subscription conversion impact on a two-year compound annual growth rate basis, our total organic constant currency revenue growth has been 8%, at the high-end of our Investor Day revenue growth targets. We are driving subscription growth through strong renewals and improved price realization as our customers recognize the innovation and value-added upgrades we have incorporated into existing solutions. This is something that we've heard repeatedly in our renewal discussions with our largest clients. Our focus on cost discipline and operating efficiency resulted in healthy organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and strong margin expansion, translating into 15% adjusted EPS growth. We delivered these results while continuing to invest in innovation and technologies that can help our clients improve speed, efficiency and accuracy through deeper insights, improved data and increased automation. Our strategy is unchanged as we focus on building long-term value for the insurance ecosystem while delivering consistent and predictable growth with high returns on capital for shareholders. The industry backdrop in which we are currently operating is one marked by continued strong premium growth as rate increases continue to earn in. In fact, in the first quarter of 2024, industry-wide direct premium growth increased 10%, and Swiss Re's forecast is for 8% growth for the full year. Profitability across the sector has improved, and industry-wide combined ratios have come down, though there is variability by line and geography. Carriers continue to be cautious in an uncertain environment and focused on driving profitability. Specific to the homeowners line of insurance, 2023 was the worst year on record for catastrophic losses with $15.2 billion in losses, and direct combined ratios in 17 states were above the breakeven threshold of 100. This has driven carriers to restrict underwriting in certain markets and in some cases, exit challenging states and lines of business. We are working with our clients and innovating new solutions that target these problem areas, including introducing new roof analytics that leverage aerial imagery and engaging with the respective departments of insurance in Western states to share the updates we have made to our wildfire solutions. In the near term, these market conditions may present some headwinds for our predominantly subscription property business, but in the longer term, we continue to believe it highlights the need for the most accurate information to best price the risk. Technological and regulatory change also continue to challenge the industry structurally. And we continue to partner with clients to help them address the rapid pace of technological change as well as increased regulatory scrutiny on data privacy, fairness, generative AI and climate risk. As another example of our work to support understanding of broad industry challenges, we recently co-authored a paper along with research organization RAND Corporation analyzing the impact of social inflation in insurance casualty claims payments with a focus on better understanding the trends, impact and potential structural factors in growing jury verdicts and trial awards. At the center of our growth strategy is our effort to engage with our clients on a more strategic level. As an example of what I've been hearing recently from clients, I've had conversations with both client CEOs and CIOs about the importance to them of integrating data sets across their enterprise for efficiency and consistency. We are the natural trusted technology partner to help with this data asset convergence as we are best positioned, given our deep data and domain expertise, our position in the industry and our proven track record of aggregating and integrating industry data at scale. These C-suite level and strategic conversations are opening up broader and enterprise-wide opportunities and applications of our data and analytics with the industry and new avenues for growth for Verisk. For example, in casualty, an area of focus for carriers due to the rising claim severity, our Liability Navigator is an analytic solution that objectively assesses bodily injury claims to help carriers improve settlement consistency across claim teams. By integrating our proprietary medical provider fraud data and our Discovery Navigator medical record review technology, we transformed previously unstructured and disparate medical data into actionable insights at the point of decision, thus improving efficiency and accuracy in bodily injury claims outcomes. Also key to our growth strategy is building upon our 50-plus year history in insurance and our competitive advantages and positioning to serve as a network for the insurance industry. To that end, in our specialty business solutions, we are delivering solid double-digit growth as we build out an interconnected ecosystem built upon the white space platform for participants in the London market, including brokers, underwriters and managing general agents. We are continuing to win new clients, adding 15 new clients in the quarter, and placement volumes are growing rapidly as the scale of the platform builds. This network effect is also active across our claims platforms as we continue to add new partners to our claims solutions ecosystem. The ClaimSearch partnership enables insurance technology providers to integrate with the ClaimSearch platform, allowing insurers to select the technology that best fits their individual business needs. Earlier this year, we announced two new collaborations with FRISS and Globlue Technologies, who are integrating with our ClaimSearch platform. This integration will facilitate advanced fraud analysis and detection, including more complex scoring and triaging to improve decision-making. Additionally, it should minimize the manual fraud detection process, saving valuable time and reducing operational costs for our clients. Finally, we continue to focus on innovation as a key pillar of our growth strategy. To that end, earlier this month, we officially launched ISO Experience Index, a new benchmarking tool which is part of our Core Lines Reimagine initiative. The ISO Experience Index is designed to modernize how actuaries in the insurance industry analyze risk patterns by addressing the increasing volatility and scale of loss patterns in the industry and offering a responsive and up-to-date indicator of observed underwriting experience. Experience Index empowers our clients to be more responsive to changing conditions across various geographic markets by offering quarterly releases with more frequent updates compared to traditional loss cost reviews. This enables our customers to make more informed decisions in real time. Experience Index is available for the homeowners line and will be expanded over time to other lines of insurance. Our customers are realizing the value we are delivering through Core Lines Reimagine, and we are benefiting from this investment through better price realization and improved client dialogues. In a recent conversation with the CEO of a national carrier, he expressed appreciation for our quarterly Emerging Issues updates. These reports are just one example of listening to our customers' requests to not only provide data but also deliver more valuable and actionable insights. And with that, let me turn it over to Elizabeth for the detailed financial review.
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, second quarter revenue was $717 million, up 6.2% versus the prior year, reflecting consistent levels of growth across both underwriting and claims. Income from continuing operations was $308 million, up 51% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.15, up 53% versus the prior year. The GAAP figures include a cumulative $102 million net gain associated with retained interest in previously disposed businesses as well as a gain associated with the bond tender transaction we entered in June. The underlying EPS growth reflects strong revenue and profit growth combined with a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Moving to our organic constant currency results for the second quarter. Adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated consistent growth across both underwriting and claims. OCC revenues grew 6% with growth of 6% in underwriting and 5.8% in claims. This was a slowdown in growth as expected from the first quarter as we overlap the tough comparison to our largest ever transactional revenue dollar quarter in the second quarter of 2023. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 81% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 8.3% on an OCC basis during the second quarter. We experienced broad-based growth across most of our subscription-based solutions with strong renewals and expanded relationships with existing customers and solid sales of new solutions. Our subscription growth also reflects the benefit of conversion to subscription from previously transactional contracts. In some cases, temporary assignments or pilots are converting into longer-term contracts. In other cases, customers are looking to move away from pricing mechanisms tied to volume and instead opting for fixed pricing to give more visibility in their own cost structures. We are experiencing this trend across underwriting data solutions, anti-fraud solutions, specialty and property estimating solutions. And we expect the impact of these conversions to continue for the remainder of the year. The largest contributor to subscription growth continues to be forms rules and loss costs, where we are benefiting from improved price realization in our renewals as we continue to modernize our platform and deliver more value and insights to our clients through features like Experience Index that Lee spoke about earlier. In anti-fraud, we experienced underlying strong price realization in the business with growth augmented by strong sales of new solutions, including Claims Coverage Identifier and Claims Scoring, our new real-time monitoring tool that uses both rules-based and predictive models to identify and triage suspected fraudulent claims. And within Extreme Event Solutions, we delivered another quarter of high single-digit subscription growth driven by strong multiyear renewals with existing clients as well as the addition of new logos to Verisk. Our transactional revenues, representing 19% of total revenue in the second quarter, declined 3% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year, a drag on growth from conversion to subscription and the impact of more year-over-year weather-related claims activity. This was offset in part by strong growth contribution from our life insurance business and securitization within our Extreme Events business. Specific to the tough comparisons, last year, transactional revenues increased 12.4% and included benefits from elevated levels of auto shopping activity as well as the large non-rate action deal we had called out. Our revenue associated with auto shopping did continue to grow in this year's second quarter, but not at the level of the trailing 12 months. We expect those tough comparisons in auto to continue for the balance of the year. And with regard to the weather-related claims activity, while frequency of events was up in the second quarter, the severity events and associated claims volume from those events was down year-over-year from record levels in 2023. It is this volume metric that impacts our transactional revenues within property estimating solutions. All that said, we continue to experience a longer-term secular trend of growing weather-related claims across the property sector. And in fact, while 2024 claims volumes are down in the second quarter year-over-year, they are still continuing an upward trend as they are running approximately 20% above the trailing 5-year average. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 8.5% in the quarter. While total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 55.4%, up 130 basis points from the reported results in the in the prior year. As we've said the past, margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending. So we think it's useful to look at our margin on a trailing 12-month basis, which, as of June 30, 2024, was 54.3%, up 120 basis points over last year's level. This level of margin expansion reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, cost discipline and our global talent optimization efforts. Our margins also reflect a lower level of headcount growth in the quarter we expect to accelerate hiring in the back half of year to support our growth investments. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect our margins to be in the 54% to 55% range. We remain confident in our ability to meet our margin expansion targets while strategically investing in future growth opportunities. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $29 million for second quarter compared to $32 million in the prior year, reflecting higher interest income on cash balances. During the second quarter, we issued $600 million of senior notes due 2034 and successfully tendered for $400 million of our notes due in 2025. The net effect of these two financing transactions is that the ongoing run rate for net interest expense will be higher in the second half of the year than it was in the first half. That said, we are comfortable with our current leverage, which at 2x is at the low end of our targeted range of 2x to 3x EBITDA. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 21.7% compared to 23.8% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to the timing of certain discrete items that we do not expect to repeat. We believe that our tax rate for the full year 2024 will be at the low end of the 23% to 25% range. There could some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise equity. Adjusted net income increased 13% to $249 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 15% to $1.74 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 10% to $212 million while free cash flow increased 14% to $154 million. This is the first quarter that our cash flow metrics demonstrate the results of our insurance-only business and are reflective of the operating cash flow of the new Verisk. From an M&A perspective, we did not acquire or dispose of any businesses in the quarter. But we did receive $112 million in cash proceeds related to the prior sales of our health care business in 2016 and our specialized markets business in 2022. In both of those cases, we maintained a small structured equity position, which was monetized in this quarter. As of June 30, we had $632 million in cash on our balance sheet, which gives us the financial flexibility to continue self-fund the investment back into the business. We are also committed to returning capital shareholders. During the second quarter, we initiated a $150 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in July. As of June 30, we had $1.3 billion in capacity remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We are pleased with our results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Our outlook for 2024 remains unchanged. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. Below the line, we expect fixed asset depreciation to be at the high end of the range as we continue to put new projects into service and the tax rate to be at the low end of the range, given certain onetime discrete items for the first half of the year. Combined with the slightly higher net interest expense due to our refinancing, the net result is that we still expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.30 to $6.60. A complete listing all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our execution priorities are unchanged as we remain focused on delivering consistent and predictable growth while allocating capital to our highest return on investment opportunities. Our focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients, both large and small, has strengthened relationships and has fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for our clients, employees and shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Lee, I just wanted to follow up. You talked about the 8% growth on a two-year stack that's above kind of what it used to be. I was just wondering the components of that outperformance. I know you talked about pricing before. I was wondering this transition from transaction to subscription if there was a way to quantify how much that might have helped and just the sustainability of this for the next several years.
Lee Shavel: Good morning. Thank you, Manav, for the question. Yes. I appreciate the focus on the 8% two-year stack growth rate because I think it does give broader context beyond what we experienced in this quarter. And to answer your question, the drivers of that have been, generally speaking, more demand for our products from the industry as they are facing a variety of challenges in - on the underwriting side, on the claims side, the value of what we have been providing to them. But also, and I think this is the element that is the sustainable aspect of it is the success that we've had in increasing our value capture from the investments that we have made across the business. And this is something I referenced in the earlier comments. We are hearing it repeatedly from clients that they recognize the innovations, the investments that we have made, and that's enabling us in this environment to capture more of that value. And we believe that, that is a longer-term trend that will enable us to continue to meet that growth, supplemented by new products and new innovations that we are adding. We continued to see strong growth in our specialty business solutions area, where we've been innovating with our white space platform, which has those very strong network effects. We have continued to see growth in our international businesses, which is a penetration opportunity for us and growth in our life insurance business. So as we said at Investor Day, we have core strength where we are adding value and capturing that value in pricing. And that's supplemented by new penetration opportunities that we believe will sustain that growth over time. And then I'd finally add that the elevated strategic dialogue that we have accomplished with our clients is opening up new opportunities to provide our products on a broader enterprise and global basis to our clients. Recent - last week, I had two CEO-level calls, visits, where we spoke about how we can help improve the consistency of the data and the analytics that they are using across their organizations for some portions that aren't utilizing our data or our analytics. And I think that is a structural and relationship benefit that we've been able to achieve, and we'll see continued support on the growth - in our growth from those aspects. On the trends sub transition, it's happening in a variety of ways. Some of it is structural. Some of it is episodic. I think that it will be a diminishing impact over time. We had some stronger elements that that contributed to dynamic in this quarter and made for some of the more pronounced differentiation between subscription growth and transaction growth.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. Lee, is there any way to characterize the level of transaction activity related to things like weather? I think you guys mentioned auto remains elevated, but just get a better sense of how should we think about that on a go-forward basis or maybe a historical context?
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Surinder. So I think the thing that I would emphasize is that when you look at the second quarter of 2023 and you see the 12.4% growth, this is in the investor presentation on - in - that we had provided on the website. What we're experiencing was a very high level of shopping activity in auto as a function of rising rates within that business. You can look at the commentary of that. It was kind of truly exceptional - an exceptional level of shopping activity that was driving that transaction element. In addition, as you will see in the description around claims business, we were experiencing still a high level of weather-related claims activity that was also driving that business. And so that's really what is contributing to what we're - we are experiencing a relatively tough comparison enhanced by some of the transaction to subscription migrations that are more pronounced in this quarter. As we think about that element on an ongoing basis, I think we generally expect that our transactional growth rates are ones that are generally at our broader growth rates to slightly higher because in many cases, they represent some of our higher-growth businesses that tend to have more of a transactional aspect at the early stage. So with that, I'll ask Elizabeth to add some perspective.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Lee, for characterizing the factors that impact our transaction growth, and you can see the historical trends of it in that earnings presentation that he referenced. I think for mechanical reasons - well, first of all, it is variable over time. It's inherently harder to predict. We don't try predict the weather. But that inherent variability for some of the mechanical factors, for example, the conversion of transactional to subscription, that can have a one year - that effect can persist for a full year after a subscription locks in. So I just want to - we do expect tough comparisons for the balance of the year on that transactional revenue side.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. And I sort of wanted to continue on this conversion topic. So I guess over the years, there have been some times that I can remember moving some revenue streams to subscription from transaction. And over time, I think that, that makes a lot of sense. In the near term, it creates a little bit of noise. And so I know you said you expect this to continue. But are there other products that you can think of within the portfolio that you will also pursue this conversion for as well? Like should we expect this to every so often come up as a theme that maybe the growth is a little bit lower in quarter, but for the long term, we're thinking of moving stuff to subscription? Are there other products that could fall into that as well? Thanks.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Toni. You're right that we have previously talked about this in the context of our Claims Essential bundle, where there was a targeted effort for a certain customer segment. I would say as you hear us talk now more broadly across the business, we are seeing it in a number of different businesses where customers are on a pilot and choose to lock that in for a longer-term subscription or they have a subscription with overage tiers. And as their business grows, they lock into a higher subscription so that they have more visibility into their own price point. So those are trends that we will continue to see across the business. Over time, you've still seen that subscription-transactional mix of our revenues be fairly steady at 80-20-ish. And probably as some of our transactional customers convert into subscription, at the same time, we will have new and introductory products or new markets that we're entering where it's more common to enter it in a transactional basis. So we will continue to top up, I think, that transactional revenue base as well.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Last quarter, there was also a reference to a double-digit growth within life insurance solutions and benefited the transactional revenue growth. I was wondering if you could highlight what is going on with the life insurance solution, both on the subscription but also transactional side? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you for the question, Ashish. We do not break out for individual businesses that the transactional versus subscription. There are transactional elements for the development opportunities that we have within life. As I indicated earlier in response to Manav's question, that's a business that continues to contribute and add to our growth rate, generally falling into that higher - the double-digit rate that we have for many of our higher-growth businesses.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Sure. Hi. It's Andrew. Could you quantify if you're willing to how Verisk's auto insurance revenue growth did in the second quarter? And specifically, when thinking about data providers into that end market, does Verisk believe that's gaining, losing or maintaining share currently for auto insurance?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Andrew. Our auto insurance related - the shopping-related revenue did continue to grow in this quarter. But the year-over-year comp, it means that it's growing off a much higher level. So there's deceleration there. From a market share standpoint, we believe we're generally steady in the market.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Gregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. I'm going to pivot back to your comments, Lee, about strengthening relationships among your customer set. I have no doubt that your focus has really helped with your larger accounts. Maybe you could spend a minute and provide us an update on how you're progressing with your smaller accounts and also speak to potential disintermediation risk that might exist inside the smaller customer set?
Lee Shavel: Great. Thank you very much for the question. And I appreciate we have a broad range of clients. Naturally, our largest clients receive a lot of focus because their sophistication, their specific needs. But to your point, we want to make certain that we are delivering value for the entire insurance ecosystem. One thing that I would say kind of specific to the small and the midsized clients is that proportionately, they receive a greater value from the scale that we are able to deliver to them, both from an operational standpoint and from the value of data that we provide to them because often they have a lower share of access to overall loss costs or general information. I think they benefit more from the scale competitiveness that we provide them in a variety of claim solutions. And we have not seen any evidence of higher levels of attrition or disintermediation of that range of clients within our business. And that is something that we've watched and we've asked the question around. I think one - or two points that I would make supplementally is that a lot of our clients, while they are interested in new ideas, the risk of taking on a new, small, private technology vendor is something that they think about very carefully because they have to know that some - a firm that they can rely on over the long term. This is clearly an advantage for us because of our stability, our reliability. And to that end, we have also been working, as we've talked about, kind of most significantly in the claims area of finding ways to deliver some of those new technology providers by integrating them into our systems and platforms so that our clients can receive the benefit of that, but also in - with greater confidence that we have vetted and are supporting and integrating those products into our overall systems. So I really appreciate the perspective. It's not something that we have observed in terms of the behavior of our clients. Obviously, I think a much bigger impact is occasionally, our clients decide to leave a line of business or leave a state. That will have more influence, and we haven't seen any pattern of clients in the smaller, the midsized that have been leaving to another technology provider.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS Financial. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hello, everyone. Apologies in advance to harp on the whole subs versus transaction one more time, but clearly, it matters to people and also for the quarter in particular. So maybe you can just help us talk about the impact of the transition in this specific quarter. I know, Lee, you gave the two-year stack. And if you're not willing to be so specific for this year, I look at what you said 8% over two years, I think the average of the reported numbers were 8.7. So is it fair that maybe that added 70 bps this quarter and maybe the core growth was more in mid-7s? Any help would be helpful since people are clearly asking.
Lee Shavel: Yes. And Alex, I am - we're trying to relate the 8.7 that you have and the 8% was looking at our total revenue, not a subscription versus transaction. So just kind of taking into account the - or trying to eliminate the impact of that that migration between subs and trans, I wanted to point out our overall revenue growth over that two-year period at 8% was still at the high end of that range. The thing that I would say further is that there was a specific significant contract that has a function of the renewal of that contract. And some of the regulatory aspects of how that needed to be approved had to be characterized as transactional in the prior year and was a subscription is now on the subscription side. So that is an element. We're not going to quantify that within it. But I would characterize that as a kind of a specific situation that added to the weakness in the subscription growth. And beyond that, we have other - I'm sorry, the weakness in the transactional growth there. So this was last year revenue from a contractual standpoint was transactional. And now that, that contract has been confirmed and executed is now subscription. So that is an element. In addition to what I think, you can look at those historical transactional growth rates in the second quarter of 2023 and see a normalization more to that longer-term growth rate. So those are the elements. We don't think it makes sense to break all of those pieces apart. But hopefully, it's clear enough that that you had some seasonal highs or cyclical highs in prior year quarter plus some structural elements that were contributing to an exceptional tough comparison on the transactional revenue growth.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.
Jeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. My question is on underwriting, or I guess, Slide 8. I'm having trouble connecting the descriptors under business highlights with the line chart showing deceleration. I guess it sounds like core growth is good. Life and SBS remain accretive. And two of the three bullets that you're talking about for transactional headwinds fall into claims. And I think marketing has been weak for a while. So what are the primary factors driving the OCC deceleration in underwriting just beyond the slowdown in auto rate shopping? Thank you.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Jeff thanks for the question. To map it in underwriting solutions, that first descriptor, you've got the underwriting data analytics solutions. That is where the auto insurance shopping activity sits. So that's an element.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
Kelsey Zhu: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So there's been a lot of discussion around where we are in the cycle for the insurance industry and whether we'll see pricing kind of peaking in 2025. Since 20% to 25% of Verisk revenue comes from contracts that have premium growth as a direct input in price increases but also with a two-year lag, does this basically insulates there into 2027 if 2025 was kind of the pricing peak for insurance companies. Or how should we think about the cyclical dynamics here?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Kelsey, thanks for the question, and welcome to the call. On the question of the insurance cycle, look, we've talked over time about being in a hard market broadly in the property and casualty industry. That's hitting different segments, certainly at different times. But we know it's not going to last forever. So it's a when, not an if that hard market begins to peak and becomes more competitive. I think one of the strengths of Verisk, you have seen us continue to grow historically through both hard markets and softer markets in the insurance cycle. I would not go so far as to say we are insulated. I think the pressure remains on us to continue to deliver value to our clients through all the innovations and product strength that we've talked about on the call. So I think if we continue do that, we will continue to deliver value to our customers and continue to grow revenue throughout the cycle.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jeff Silber: Thanks so much. My question is about your outlook. I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but you had some pretty good quarters in the first half of this year from a bottom line perspective. By maintaining your guidance, it implies a pretty slow down in adjusted EPS growth in the back half of the year. I know you called out accelerated hiring. Is there anything going on maybe from a timing perspective, but if you can provide a little bit more insight that would be appreciated. Thanks.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. A couple of things. We have historically talked about some of the seasonality in our margin. Any quarter's margin can vary based on revenue mix as well as just the timing of spending. And we've signaled - we’ve commented that we intend to invest in the business. So that our margin guidance gives you and our EBITDA guidance gives you a good feeling of where we expect to end up on an EBITDA basis. If you look at the EPS rate, in addition, there's the tax rate where we've had certain benefits in the first half of the year that we don't expect to continue in the second half of the year.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to piggyback on Kelsey's question earlier on pricing and just ask, your net written premiums as we go into next year, I guess, the 2023 net written premiums were quite strong. It sounds like you're seeing very good value realization in terms of pricing from what you're doing in Core Lines. As we think about your 3% to 4% pricing target that you said at your Investor Day, do you think you're positioned to be at the higher end of that or even above based on what you're seeing? And how should we think about pricing in the near term? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Heather. I appreciate the question. One, I'm not going to go beyond the guidance the guidance questions or the guidance statement that we've made, just remaining confident in that we've provided. I do want to try address the pricing aspect a little further. And as I mentioned in my earlier comments, the fundamental dynamic almost regardless of the premium growth, which does, I think, influence it, in some cases, directly to a modest impact but also from a psychological standpoint, it's helpful. But even with those two, if we aren't providing value to our clients and they don't perceive that value then that's where we are going to run into challenges in improving pricing and driving the revenue. That's why the value of the investments that we have made in our Core Lines business and with our reimagine initiative, while one example of how we are driving value is what's critical - is the most critical factor in what sustains our revenue growth. And that's where we continue to get very strong feedback for how we are helping our clients improve the value of what they're doing. And I'd like to ask Saurabh Khemka, who leads that business and initiative to share a little bit about what we are hearing from clients and how they perceive the value of the investments that we have made. And hopefully, that will provide more context for how we've been able to overachieve on those - on that renewal pricing.
Saurabh Khemka: Absolutely. Thanks, Lee. Yes, if you look on the Core Lines Reimagine side, our engagement with our customers has really demonstrated the value of our content, and the upcoming innovations that we have is delivering additional value for them. So for example, the feedback has been very encouraging across the spectrum of our customers, large and small. They are seeing additional value in the new insights like the Experience Index, the executive insights as well as the new technology innovations that we have on delivery of our content, which is creating efficiencies for them. And so what we are hearing from our customers is these new insights is helping them be better in terms of reacting to market conditions, and these new efficiency tools are helping them to be more efficient in their operations. So it's been very good. I would also say that we've been flexible in terms of how we deliver our content. So some of our smaller customers like the packaged insights and the turnkey solutions. And our larger customers prefer some of the access to underlying components to our analytics so that they can create more differentiation. And so by being flexible, we're benefiting all our customers.
Lee Shavel: And Heather, to give you two specific examples, one product innovation has been the update to our Mozart product, which allows our clients to manage their policy forms much more efficiently because they have thousands of forms based upon product line and state and different product areas. It is a very time-consuming, laborious process to keep those updated, particularly if the reference are ISO policy forms. And so the investment that we've made is effectively in a document management platform that allows them to do that much more easily and more quickly. That's one dimension where they clearly see significant value increase. Another as we've talked about is on the Experience Index. This is where they have asked us to move further beyond those traditional loss costs that we provide to them in the underwriting process and give them a more current read on what's happening, what we see evolving. And so we are able to provide them more actionable information on a more timely basis. That provides value to them on the underwriting side, just to kind of tie that down to some specific products that we've been investing in.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.
Russell Quelch: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You made a point in the pre-remarks about putting out the fact that you're at the bottom end of the target leverage range. I'm keen to hear your thoughts on future capital deployment and potential use of that debt capacity. I'm wondering if you might look to inorganic growth again soon. We've, obviously, had a period where you haven't been that active, particularly if rates come down. And if you do, maybe could you talk to what areas you might target for inorganic growth, particularly wondering if there's more you could do, for example, in the life space, that would be great? Thanks.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Russell. So yes, as we look at our target leverage range and where we are relative to the two to three times, we go back to our capital allocation philosophy. We are willing to deploy to support the business. We do remain active in M&A markets and looking at what is available. We tend to focus on businesses that are unique in their markets that serve our insurance end market, but for which Verisk has a unique reason to be the right owner of that business. And so those can be data opportunities that we can add to our existing services. They can be customer opportunities or geographic or market expansion.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Going back to transactional revenue performance, the 3% decline you saw in quarter, were there any unusual headwinds you would call out that may not persist? Just trying to understand the overall trend since if you look at the quarterly cadence, the swing from plus three in 1Q to down three in 2Q was quite significant and want to understand if that trajectory should be carried forward into future quarters or if the 2Q decline is a reasonable rate to persist into 3Q, which also represents a tough comp if you look at the year-ago period.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, George. So yes, we always highlight that our transactional revenue does have some variability to it. One important thing that I will point to, of course, from a growth perspective, we always look year-over-year, but it is interesting also to look on a sequential basis this quarter relative to the first quarter. Our total revenues grew relative to the first quarter. And in fact, our transactional revenues also grew relative to the first quarter. So it's just the year-over-year that has that pattern. Now there's some seasonality and things that hit the second quarter typically and that we're particularly strong in the second quarter of last year. And the ones that we called out were the weather impact, which was historically strong in the second quarter of last year, the auto shopping activity for which we've anniversaried that tough comp, and then the transition of transactional revenues to subscription.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS Financial. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Hi, thank you for the follow-up. Just quickly, and you mentioned, Lee, the Experience Index here just a couple of questions ago. But as an outsider to the industry, I can certainly see the applicability here pretty strongly. So I know it's early days, and it's good to see this finally being launched. But can you just maybe talk about the reception you've seen with that? Because again, it seems like a lot of customers should kind of move to a more real-time index. And if so, is this definitely a new revenue opportunity? Or do you think it's going to get kind of included in upgrades? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Alex, thanks for the follow-up. I'm going to actually ask Saurabh talk about that - addressing your question.
Saurabh Khemka: Yes, absolutely, Alex. So the feedback has been very positive. First of all, as you noted, getting more frequent data and more current data is always helpful to our customers. And this is a tool that helps them very easily benchmark their experience versus the industry. And it becomes an additional input into their own internal decision-making and priorities. So what we're hearing from customers is this is a very good innovation. We've launched it for the homeowners' line of business. And the most frequent comment I hear is, when are you going to launch the other lines of business? So, we're excited about it, and we're going to continue launching other lines of business. And as we get feedback from customers, adding more elements to the Experience Index.
Lee Shavel: And I think regardless of whether it's priced separately or it's part of the broader element, this is an example of where we expect to capture value from that greater - the greater currency, I mean, kind of recency of that data. I want to take that, Alex, just given the question and kind of broaden it. We recently did a Voice of the Customer exercise and isolated 3 primary asks that we have had from our clients. The first of which the Experience Index addresses is that they wanted more - they wanted to see greater investment in data, both broadening the data set that we have and the currency of the data sets that we have. So this is an opportunity to improve the currency and the actionability of that data set. Now the other thing that's important is that the client is also asking for more data, which means that there's an implicit desire on their part to give us more data so that we can expand and develop it. So that in and of itself creates more value for us. And we've seen a variety of initiatives and appetite from the clients in the excess and surplus area, which for insurance industry analysts will recognize has been a growing area of the - of industry underwriting. The second theme that we heard was more insights. And we talked about the emerging issues, providing greater insights from the data on what trends are that are taking place. And so that has been a key enhancement. And then the final theme that we heard from clients is connecting the ecosystem. They want us to be that that central provider building network aspect so as to improve the efficiency that the overall system and their ease of operating within that. So all of these elements I share because their reflection is not entirely of us saying, this is what the industry needs, but what we are hearing from clients that they expect from us given our role, given our centrality and the data sets that we have.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session and today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-05-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk First Quarter 2024 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] 
 For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead. 
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2024 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. 
 The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. 
 As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.  
 A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP result because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant.  
 And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel. 
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. 
 2024 is off to a solid start at Verisk as we are building upon the strong performance we delivered in 2023. Elizabeth will provide the detailed financials, but I am pleased to share that we delivered 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth with strong underlying subscription growth of 7.8% that was broad-based across most of our businesses. 
 Our focus on cost discipline and operating efficiency produced strong double-digit organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and healthy margin expansion, translating into 26% adjusted EPS growth. 
 This quarter's performance was in line with our 2024 guidance. We are driving predictable and consistent growth by harnessing the power of our more integrated insurance-focused company and executing against our strategy to partner with the insurance ecosystem to help all participants address their most pressing challenges.  
 Our execution priorities are unchanged from those that we communicated to you a year ago at Investor Day. We are building on the progress that we made in 2023 as we continue to focus on three key things: one, delivering consistent and predictable revenue growth; two, driving operating efficiency and profitability; and three, allocating our strong free cash flow with discipline and a focus on return on investment.  
 I've spoken on this call many times about our efforts to engage with our clients on a more strategic level. To that end, in April, we hosted the Verisk Insurance Conference, or VIC as it is affectionately known in the industry, which attracted a record number of attendees from across the global insurance ecosystem, including representatives from the carriers, reinsurers, regulators and our channel partners. 
 VIC is our flagship event where we strategically engage with all our ecosystem clients and partners through joint discussions and presentations as an integrated One Verisk.
 This year's event featured over 70 different educational sessions and panel discussions on some of the industry's top-of-mind issues, including fairness, generative AI, fraud, climate risk, rate adequacy and social inflation. 
 One of the best attended sessions was a panel discussion about Florida property insurance and featured representatives from key market players, including the carriers, regulators, legislators and Verisk. The discussion focused on lessons learned from the insurance crisis in this important and high-risk market and what other states can learn from this experience.  
 The event also featured a solutions gallery that showcased many of our offerings, covering risk, natural perils, commercial property, home and auto as well as several of our key technology ecosystem partners. The event has generated strong collaboration ideas with our clients and partners as well as leads for our sales teams. 
 It also builds upon the goal that we set last year to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients and continue our path to serve as a data and technology partner to the global insurance ecosystem.  
 During the Verisk Insurance Conference, our Extreme Events division unveiled its latest innovation, Next Generation Models or NGM, for insurers, brokers and reinsurers. Verisk is the first firm to release its full suite of over 100 models across all perils and geographies to a next-generation financial modeling framework. And these models are all now accessible via our Touchstone platform.  
 As the rising cost of catastrophes and an increase in losses from frequency-driven perils such as severe convective storms has challenged the industry, Next Generation Models provide a better quantification of uncertainty and enhanced capabilities to assess insured losses across the insurance industry more accurately.  
 With next-generation models, our clients can make better financial assessments of loss potential and more accurately represent the risk to their policyholders, their businesses and their partners. NGM also offers new advantages to support complex insurance policy structures and deal with new terms and conditions that previously went unmodeled. Clients can effectively manage risk, both at the portfolio and individual levels using the NGM suite of models.  
 NGM represents the next step in our journey towards a fully SaaS native platform, underscoring our commitment to continuous investment in advanced data and technologies and capabilities on behalf of the industry.  
 Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our Core Lines Reimagine program. As previously mentioned, we are on a journey to digitize and enhance our essential suite of industry standard solutions to make our forms, rules and loss cost content easier to access, use and customize and provide much needed updates and insights. We have made good progress in modernizing our internal systems and processes for digital-first content creation, enabling us to deliver new client-facing modules.  
 We recently introduced Filing Intelligence, which is accessible on our new platform. This tool simplifies our filings delivery process by consolidating all necessary documents, forms, rules and loss costs into one accessible interface, eliminating the need for manual review and piecing together multiple documents. Filing Intelligence digitally connects all documents related to each filing, streamlining the process for users and ensuring seamless access to essential information.  
 On the actuarial front, we recently added Actuarial Hub to the new platform. Within the hub, clients can access new insights such as the ISO Experience Index, the loss cost activity dashboard and a new series of actuarial prospective articles. These resources offer deeper insights into our filings and data, empowering our clients to make quicker, well-informed decisions.  
 Looking ahead, we plan to launch additional customer-facing modules that will provide even more value to our clients by introducing new proprietary analytics, workflow tools and insights to further streamline processes and enhance underwriting accuracy for our clients.  
 Overall, we're excited about the progress of the Reimagine program. This initiative is already driving returns for Verisk as we are receiving positive client feedback and experiencing better price realization in contract renewals.  
 Lastly, today is an important day as May 1 is officially Verisk Generative AI day. Our technology teams from across our global offices and business units are gathered at our Jersey City headquarters to collaborate and share best practices and learnings on their work with GenAI for both customer-facing initiatives and internal efficiencies. 
 More specifically, all of our divisions have active GenAI pilots running with many other areas in active development. And within our claims business, we have three solutions in production and available today for clients.  
 Generative AI continues to be top of mind for our clients and is a topic of much discussion in my conversations with industry executives. One very promising application that I'm seeing is the use of generative AI to gather and predigest massive amounts of information to organize and distill it for the insurance professional, improving and focusing their expertise, not replacing it. 
 This is a natural fit and opportunity for the work we do in curating and managing the needs of the global insurance industry to facilitate more effective and efficient workflows. As we have done with other forms of advanced technology, GenAI is an area where we can invest for the benefit of the industry at a lower cost of investment in ownership than any single client can do on their own.  
 With that, I will turn it over to Elizabeth to cover the detailed financial review. 
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. 
 I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid first quarter of 2024. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, first quarter revenue was $704 million, up 8% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth in underwriting and more modest growth in claims. 
 Income from continuing operations was $219 million, up 12.9% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.52, up 19.7% versus the prior year. This level of EPS growth reflects strong revenue and profit growth, combined with a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count due to the large accelerated share repurchase program in 2023. 
 Moving to our organic constant currency results for the first quarter. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated solid growth for most of our businesses. OCC revenues grew 6.9% with growth of 7.8% in underwriting and 4.7% in claims. This was an acceleration from the fourth quarter in both subsegments and was in line with our expectations and 2024 financial guidance.
 Our subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.8% on an OCC basis during the first quarter. We experienced broad-based growth across most of our subscription-based solutions, with strong renewals and expanded relationships with existing customers and solid sales of new solutions. 
 The largest contributor to subscription growth was forms, rules and loss costs. We are benefiting from a stronger renewal cycle and improved price realization as we continue to modernize our platform and deliver more value and insights to our clients through our Core Lines Reimagine program that Lee spoke about earlier.  
 In anti-fraud, we experienced underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers that we mentioned throughout 2023. Most of our clients have successfully completed this transition. Therefore, the benefit will continue to taper throughout 2024.  
 And within underwriting data solutions, we are seeing a positive client response to our enhanced commercial lines property solutions, which have benefited from our expanded coverage as our database of commercial property records has grown by over 200% since 2020 and now has over 15.9 million records.  
 Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the first quarter, increased 3.1% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year which benefited from the strong auto shopping activity and nonreaction activity. During the quarter, we saw continued growth across our auto suite of solutions, though growth rates have moderated as we expected.  
 Regarding auto, due to recent changes in our data source, we have decided to discontinue our existing telematics offering. The impact of this is immaterial in 2024 with less than $1 million of revenue impact. We do not expect this to have any impact on the remainder of our auto solutions.  
 Our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth within life insurance solutions as we saw strong customer demand for incremental services.  
 And within our extreme events business, we saw better-than-expected transactional growth driven by securitization. This was offset in part by lower weather-related transaction volumes in property estimating solutions and the impact of the conversion to subscription within our anti-fraud business.  
 Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 10.6% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBIT margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 54%, up 180 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. 
 As we've said in the past, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending, so we think it's useful to look at our margin on a trailing 12-month basis which, as of March 31, 2024, was 53.9%, up 120 basis points over last year's level. This level of margin expansion reflects the positive impact of sales leverage and cost discipline.  
 We also experienced a modest margin benefit from nonoperating items, including foreign currency changes, but this was largely offset by margin impact from recent acquisitions. Our current margin rate also reflects continued organic investment for future growth, including our Reimagine program, the replatforming of key solutions in extreme events and property estimating solutions, our new financial and human capital systems as well as exploration of advanced technologies like GenAI. We remain confident in our ability to meet our margin expansion targets, while strategically investing in future growth opportunities.  
 Continuing down the income statement. Net interest expense was $29 million for the first quarter compared to $26 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects interest income on lower cash balances than 1 year previously. 
 Our reported effective tax rate was 20.3% compared to 27.1% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate is primarily due to tax charges incurred in structuring the sale of our energy business last year as well as certain discrete items that we do not expect to repeat in the remaining quarters of the year.  
 We continue to believe that our tax rate for the full year 2024 will be in the 23% to 25% range, so there could be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity.  
 Adjusted net income increased 19% to $234 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 26% to $1.63 for the quarter. The increase is primarily driven by solid revenue growth, strong margin expansion, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. 
 Our lower average share count reflects the impact of the large accelerated share repurchase program we completed in 2023 using the proceeds from the divestitures. This was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization and higher net interest expense.  
 From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities increased 1.9% to $372 million, while free cash flow increased 4.2% to $317 million. Both cash flow metrics reflect the impact of our indemnification obligation related to our former financial services business, which we accrued for in 2023. 
 It is also important to note that the prior year cash flow figures still include the results of our previously divested energy business. So these growth figures understate the cash flow growth of our insurance-only business.  
 We are committed to returning capital to shareholders. During the first quarter, we initiated a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program, which was completed in April. Our $0.39 per share dividend was up 15% from the prior year. We continue to have $1.4 billion in capacity remaining under our repurchase authorization.  
 We are pleased with our results for the first quarter and reiterate our outlook for 2024. More specifically, we continue to expect consolidated revenue for 2024 to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. 
 We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25% and adjusted earnings in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. 
 A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.  
 And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments. 
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. 
 In summary, our execution priorities remain consistent with those communicated at Investor Day, continued focus on revenue growth, operating efficiency and disciplined cash flow allocation. Following a strong 2023, we are pleased to see 2024 off to a strong start with implied growth of 7% in consolidated revenue and 9.5% in adjusted EBITDA, at the midpoint of our 2024 financial guidance.  
 Our focus on heightened strategic engagement with clients has strengthened relationships and fostered new product and business opportunities for the industry where we can invest at scale to drive value for our clients, employees and shareholders. 
 We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. 
 With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. 
Andrew Steinerman: How would you assess the health of your clients, meaning the P&C insurance industry now versus 3 or really kind of 6 months ago and how might that impact Verisk this year? 
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Andrew. I've assessed the strength of our client as being very solid. And I would say in contrast to, I think, where we were 2 or 3 years ago, you are clearly seeing -- across the industry, and if you follow the quarterly releases of the property and casualty insurers, you are seeing very strong premium growth, which is a reflection of that hard market and the improving profitability as reflected in stronger combined ratios for the business.  
 And so I think the combination of that growth, the improved profitability, some reserve strengthening now beginning to offset some of the heightened cat losses that they've experienced has generally put them in a position where they are feeling positive about the outlook, the -- their ability to achieve better pricing and price adequacy from their standpoint on rate.  
 There clearly are risks that they continue to face in terms of heightened catastrophic losses or cyber exposure or exposure to increasing casualty losses. But generally, their financial position is stronger and that has, one, both a benefit for us because we do participate to some extent in their overall premium growth, but also, I think, importantly, is that, that financial strength is making them more constructive and engaged in where they can be making investments to improve their business, whether it's on the underwriting side or it's on the efficiency and processing front. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. 
Jeffrey Meuler: Yes. So Lee, that all sounds like the industry is going to start to lean in more on marketing, and it seems like we've seen some signs that marketing spend is positively inflecting following a challenging period. 
 But you continue to call out headwinds in your marketing solution revenue. So maybe talk through that and if it's just a lag effect and a pipe is building. 
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Jeff. I think that's an accurate observation. I think we are beginning to see some early signs that marketing is picking up. Within the industry, there is a lag impact. And so we will continue to look forward to hopefully seeing some of that translate into our business. That is a small business, so it may not be discernible overall within our business. But we do think that's a positive trend.  
 I would also note that within that business, it is not entirely insurance for us that we're providing insights to some other legacy industries. And so that may cause a differentiated output. But I think your general observation is true. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. 
Ashish Sabadra: I wanted to focus on the solid sales of new solution. The question there was, Lee, thanks for providing some good details on the GenAI, but I was wondering if you could provide an example of new solutions that are gaining traction.  
 And then at the Investor Day, the new initiative was expected to generate 150 to 200 basis points of incremental revenue growth going into 2025. And I was just wondering if you could comment on how that's tracking. 
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Ashish. Let me take the first question since you're kind of referencing Investor Day, and I'll let Elizabeth add to this if she feels necessary. But what we outlined at Investor Day was incorporated into our guidance in terms of where we felt we could achieve incremental revenue growth. 
 Naturally, we saw the performance in 2023, which was a representative of the -- of achieving those higher growth rates. We're really pleased in the first quarter to be able to similarly deliver strong growth on top of that. And so we have kind of a compounding effect. And I think that reflects in large part, the achievement of some of that revenue growth upside. So I would look to the fact that we are meeting and exceeding the guidance that we set at Investor Day. 
Elizabeth Mann: Yes, I agree with Lee there. And I think in terms of examples of new products gaining traction, you've heard us talk about them on some of the recent calls, the Discovery Navigator product in claims, which is one that does -- now uses GenAI as well. We've talked about image forensics in the antifraud space and -- as well as a variety of innovations that we talked about in this call on our core products, including Core Lines Reimagine and the Next Generation Models in extreme events. 
Lee Shavel: Yes. And if I -- thanks, Elizabeth, for kicking off the first part of the question. We talked with Jeff's question on some of the headwinds we're facing on marketing, but I would also say, in terms of new product adoption in our life insurance offering, we are seeing very strong uptake in that category with the applicability of the low no-code solutions to the life business within our specialty business solutions area where we have seen very strong adoption on some -- from some major industry players onto the white space platform, which is a new product that we are growing.  
 And so in -- as well as internationally, as we have been bringing our products into that market, we're seeing the uptake and very strong double-digit growth across those businesses internationally. 
 And then finally, I would say, I think in terms of new product growth, we should never overlook the benefit or the uptake and receptivity that we are seeing to our existing product investments as with Core Lines Reimagine and other areas that we have been investing in similar to LightSpeed where we have improved those products, we have increased the value to the customer, we're integrating generative AI into a number of those products.  
 And in a way, that is new product adoption in terms of being able to realize incremental value in our revenues for those products. And I think that is reflected in our overall revenue growth as well here. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. 
Thomas Roesch: This is Tom Roesch on for Andrew. I wanted to ask about the pricing environment. It sounds like insurers are starting off the year on good footing. So I was wondering just kind of how the pricing environment, how you think about it this year relative to last year? And then also as it relates to those contracts that are tied to prior year net premium, just kind of how you think about those, too, this year. 
Lee Shavel: Sure. 
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Tom, for the question. Yes, it's good context. You heard Lee talk about the industry and the relative strength in the industry as well as the hard market that we are in. So as he highlighted for our contracts that have a tie to net written premium growth, we're seeing generally positive tailwinds in line -- I would say, in line overall with last year. 
 I think what's most important for us from a pricing standpoint is the increased engagement that we are having with our clients, and you're seeing the benefit of the investments that we're putting in our products and those are driving for us strong renewals, strong outcomes on the pricing conversations. 
Lee Shavel: Yes. And Tom, I'd say that on that, we are -- we see a receptive environment because I think the industry is doing well. We're seeing recognition of the value of the products. But I would also mention that I think with some of our efforts to improve our go-to-market strategy, we're seeing a more effective sales organization that is contributing to good outcomes on the pricing side as well. 
 So I think we feel very positive about some of the changes that we put in place in 2024 as a function of a close examination of what we could be doing better there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. 
Toni Kaplan: During the prepared remarks, you mentioned you're discontinuing the auto telematic offering. I was wondering, clearly, it's not generating much revenue for you, but was -- what was -- what prompted deciding to discontinue it? Was the data not valuable? Was it costly to maintain? Just any color there. 
Lee Shavel: Certainly. Thank you, Toni. And the short answer is, and first, it was a small financial impact for us. The simple answer is that the entities that were providing that data to us decided to discontinue collecting that data. And so there was really not sufficient analytical value in that without the data that was being provided. And I think it's fair to assume that it's a function of some of the media attention to collect connected car data. So that really was the simple reason. 
 It had been an area where we felt it was worth investing. We do believe in looking at broad data sets that are useful in evaluating driver risk. But I would emphasize that while we have discontinued that operation, and it was immaterial from a financial standpoint, we do continue to serve auto insurers in a significant way with a wide variety of products, including our LightSpeed auto, our coverage verifier, damage assessment from a claims perspective. 
 So this is a very substantial business for us, and the discontinuation of the Verisk Data Exchange will not have any impact in our legacy auto businesses. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. 
Faiza Alwy: I wanted to talk about subscription growth. You mentioned the stronger renewal cycle and the price realization, but I'm curious if you held this level of subscription growth is normal for this year. And help us better understand some of the factors that can impact us. 
 I asked because there has been some quarterly variation here last year, so if there's anything that you would highlight as we look ahead. 
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Faiza, thanks for the question. In terms of quarterly variations, there can always be minor puts and takes as things move from quarter-to-quarter, but nothing that we see at this point that would indicate significant quarterly changes.
 The drivers of strength for us this quarter have been really broad-based across the business. Forms, rules and loss cost has been the largest driver as the largest business, and we talked about some of the trends benefiting it there. 
 We've had strong strength in the antifraud business. I would call that both absolute strength as well as benefiting from the conversion from transaction to subscription. And the extreme events business actually had strong subscription growth as well given the demonstrated value there. 
Lee Shavel: Yes. And Faiza, maybe to add a little additional color, and we use this as an opportunity to say we talked about the environment. We've talked about the benefit of engaging as partners with our leading clients, which I think has helped us on that front, probably most primarily at a senior level to help our clients understand the value that we are providing to them across the enterprise. 
 But something -- to your question of kind of sustainability and growth, we clearly want to grow the subscription revenues at a higher rate where possible. And coming out of a lot of intense engagement at a senior level in 2023, we have had three clients in different areas, one is an international insurer, one is a large U.S. insurer, one is outside of the insurer, but in a variety of areas, that have come to us with ideas of products that we might jointly develop or distribute with them. And I think it's a reflection of how we can potentially develop new incremental revenue sources. 
 This was certainly part of our plan originally, but we've been delighted to see that, that engagement has enabled real commercial opportunities that we are in the process of exploring and structuring at this stage. That is certainly a primary path for us to find ways to continue to sustain and grow that subscription growth. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. 
Jeffrey Silber: I know you talked in the past about three, I guess, buckets of investment. You talked about the Core Lines Reimagine, investing in your sales force and investing in AI. Can we just get a refresh in terms of how much you're thinking of spending in those areas and where we are in that process? 
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. We don't break out sort of specific areas of investment by element. I think on the last quarter call, I mentioned those as some of the top areas for investment this year. And I think our investment in those areas is pretty much in line with our expectation for the year and embedded in the margin that you're seeing and the guidance for the full year. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. 
Charles Peters: So I'm going to focus on the transactional revenue piece because if I look at the quarterly numbers last year, you had some pretty strong results for second and third quarter. 
 Given the conversion of the antifraud business, is it your expectation that the transactional piece of OCC will be having some headwinds for the next couple of quarters? Or any sort of visibility there would be helpful. 
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Happy to cover that, Greg. Thanks. You are right that we do see headwinds on the transactional revenue side largely because the comps from last year have been so strong. You saw double-digit transactional growth for about a 1-year period last year. 
 I think some of the main areas of tough comps have been and will be on the auto transactional shopping activity, which was a real area of strength last year, in addition to the nonrate action activity. And we -- that really picked up in the first quarter of last year. 
 So we're starting to anniversary it now. The shopping activity did actually continue strong in the first quarter. But starting next quarter, we really anniversary strong growth there. 
 The other area where it could be tough comps has been on the weather activity. We called out through 2023 the elevated weather patterns that we were seeing. And so that could be a headwind this year. 
 Securitization activity was very strong last year in extreme events. So that's one that we are also waiting to see. So between those different areas, that's something we're looking at. 
 I think this quarter is a demonstration of the power of the business model and the bulk of our revenue coming in that subscription revenue, which continues to show very healthy signs of strength -- shows the strength that we can deliver, even compounding those tough comps. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. 
Manav Patnaik: I guess, I'll just ask on capital allocation. It sounds like you guys are starting on the ASR, so that seems to be the priority. But maybe what is the small- to medium-sized kind of M&A pipeline looks like, some of the stuff that you've been doing over the last couple of years? 
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Manav. I think I heard that. I think the focus is on capital allocation and how does the outlook for small- and medium-sized M&A opportunities. I would describe them as they are out there, that I think that valuations remain really high for those entities. 
 Our focus is always on how can we add value with our distribution, our data, our relationships. That has been a good equation for us. And valuations kind of continue to make that challenging for us to generate attractive returns. 
 But we are very engaged in that market and always looking for products that have achieved traction with the industry where we think we can accelerate the adoption and deliver value, both to our clients and to our shareholders. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. 
Surinder Thind: Just a question around the internal investments. So when we think about the Core Lines Reimagine or replatforming or AI, how should we think about the absolute level of investment from the perspective of how much of this is part of a normal spend cycle? And then maybe how much is maybe a little bit elevated and perhaps how we might expect CapEx to evolve, so far, whether it's this year or the next couple of years? 
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks -- yes. Thanks, Surinder. I can't break it out numerically. I would say that there are -- we've talked about the various projects that we are investing in now. Those are finite projects, which we will finish, and we've talked about the time lines for each. 
 There are some elements of those projects that is fixing or reinvesting in technology that has maybe been overdue. And so I would talk about our internal ERP systems as an area of that. Some of the places where we are doing tech replatforming would be those areas. And so those -- that level of investment may be elevated, and we may not need to continue going forward. 
 I would say there will -- we will always be investing in our products to maintain sort of their cutting-edge status. So after we finish Core Lines Reimagine, we will continue to invest and evolve in new projects that we may not know exactly what they are today. 
Lee Shavel: And I think what I would add to that, Surinder, is, I think, the short answer is that the ability for us to integrate generative AI technology as an expansion of a new form of artificial intelligence within the existing products is something that our businesses are effectively absorbing into their current financial models and thinking about where they're deploying capital within their own businesses. 
 There have been, and there may be in the future, areas where we have decided that -- or we have determined that there is a really interesting application in a new product upside that we want to invest heavily in or we want to accelerate, and that will be an opportunity for us to provide a focused amount of capital or investment. 
 At this stage, I think there were a couple of opportunities that we evaluated, and we determined kind of just maintaining our natural organic level of investment is the right path at this point. That may change in the future. 
 But I think Elizabeth's comments, I would just reinforce by saying, right now, we're finding a way to integrate this investment into the businesses and also recognizing that we are making a heightened investment on an ERP upgrade that we think will drive operating efficiencies and informational advantages for us over time. 
 And that will be one that, as we're going to finish that level of investment, may free up space, if there are good opportunities for us to invest. Otherwise, we'll return that capital as we always do with our discipline. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn. 
Russell Quelch: You mentioned in the opening remarks, Lee, that you'd rolled out the next-generation nat peril model. I wondered if you could articulate what the additional upside opportunity for Verisk is there given you're already seeing strong subscription revenue growth in the extreme events business.
 And I just wanted to check as well. You mentioned on pricing that you had been able to realize more pricing on renewals due to the product upgrades. Is that already -- is that as expected and therefore already factored into your guidance for '24? Or does it present a potential upside opportunity on the guidance? 
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Russell. So first on the Next Generation Models, I think that this is a major upgrade in terms of the sophistication of the models, allowing our clients to better estimate and quantify the uncertainty of their losses across the industry. 
 And given -- you think about the Next Generation Models,  it is taking a variety of the environmental, physical weather risk related and then translating into what are the real costs associated with damage, restructuring and the rest. And so we can take this and apply it to all of our perils and all of our geographies. 
 So it is a major enhancement to our portfolio of products, and it's also increased the sophistication of the ability to support complex insurance policy structures and deal with the new terms and conditions that weren't previously effectively captured the model. 
 It also is an important step for us to the SaaS model. Getting the next-generation financial model in place was critical, and what we heard from our clients is what they wanted to be addressed first. And now we can improve the functionality and the efficiency of that. 
 So we do think that this is a substantial opportunity for us to deliver more value to our risk modeling clients. And certainly, our expectations are reflected within our guidance in that regard. But it does, I think, open us up to continue to expand what we do for clients on that front. 
 With regard to your question on is the pricing upside, that is reflected within our guidance. We're pleased with the progress that we're making in the reaction to -- from our clients to the investments that we've made in a variety of our products. And that's reflected in the guidance that we have put forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. 
Alex Kramm: Just maybe quickly on the international side. I think 23% growth year-over-year. I know that's not organic, but still pretty impressive. Can you just maybe give us an update where you're seeing the most growth in those businesses? 
 And then maybe related to that, as historically viewed, those businesses are a disparate collection of different businesses in different regions. So curious if there's any efforts to maybe bring those businesses closer together or if you're already seeing any synergies between those businesses or if it is still just a lot of different disparate things. 
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Alex. It's a great question. So I think the first question relates to the overall growth. And I think when we look at the businesses on an organic basis, I think we are generally viewed, as we've spoken before, and we continue to believe that they have and will continue to drive double-digit growth within the -- within our business. And so I think that's kind of the baseline. We continue to see opportunity on that front.
 Your question on the coordination, I think, is an important one. And I would say that each of those businesses are serving distinct insurance industry constituencies. And the opportunity, I think, has been less to tie all of those products together from a single client perspective, but to partner more effectively with the U.S. team to mix and the international team to make certain that we are integrating our expertise, our data, some of the investments that we've made in the U.S. to enhance and strengthen those client -- or those product sets. 
 And so I think we're seeing a heightened level of partnership in that regard, but not so much tying together, for instance, the claims and the underwriting businesses as well.  
 Another dimension, which I referenced earlier is that I think that we are seeing an opportunity to partner with institutions within Europe that see that value and through their existing distribution networks have an ability for us to deliver some of that value in partnership with other players within that market. 
 And so that, I think, becomes an enhancement opportunity for those products as well as some of even our U.S.-based products and technology that can be applied there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. 
Heather Balsky: I was really curious about the catastrophe bond piece of your business. There's been some really strong data out there, and it seems like there's some outlook for continuation of that. What's driving that? And can you also remind us just how you benefit from strength in that market? 
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Heather. Yes, it is a strong market. I think it's -- what's driving it is both the need -- the increased catastrophe risk and the need for diversifying the set of investors in that space of risk. And for new investors, it's their own desire to diversify and find uncorrelated areas of investment. So that's been driving strength in that cat bond market. 
 How we benefit from it is our extreme event business is one of the primary providers of models and assessment of that risk, so that the investors and the issuers of those cat bonds can agree to transact on the pricing by assessing the risk. 
Lee Shavel: And Heather, the -- what we are seeing that is driving that is both demand from investors for noncorrelated returns and interest, particularly in this hard market from an insurance standpoint, what are perceived to be more attractive returns. We're also seeing that in terms of more capital being attracted into excess and surplus lines and reinsurance generally. 
 And it speaks to, I think, the ongoing development and the increasing sophistication of the portfolio -- active portfolio management of the insurance industry that is an opportunity for us given our modeling capabilities, given the loss costs and the rate modeling activities that we have. And that has been something that we have been engaged in thinking about at an enterprise level in terms of how we can support the development of that market. 
 One example would be there is a category of insurers that are ILS managers, insurance-linked securities managers. And those have been modeling clients of ours and also represent opportunities for us to build broader relationships and how our suite of products can serve their needs as they manage external sources of capital. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. 
Keen Fai Tong: In the early part of last year, subscription revenue growth was in the 9% range. And over the past 2 quarters, growth was in the 7% to 8% range. 
 What's a reasonable and sustainable rate of growth for subscription revenue? And what are the top 1 or 2 factors that you believe will drive either acceleration or deceleration from current levels? 
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, George. We don't forecast subscription growth for you. We do -- we obviously give our medium-term target range for total revenue growth. That's 6% to 8% organic constant currency, and subscription has historically been 80% of that. So that's kind of what we can say numerally. 
 In terms of drivers for acceleration and deceleration, I think all of the things that we've been talking about are investment in our products, our customer engagement and our industry expertise drive strength in the subscription revenue, both from a renewal, from a new customer base and from a pricing perspective. 
 Headwinds can come with -- we've talked about this before, with potential attrition or industry consolidation or [indiscernible]. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. 
Charles Peters: Great. So Lee, in your comments, you talked about the hard market in non-life insurance. And one of the things that's becoming apparent is that the pricing trends are going to begin to moderate. 
 So building on Elizabeth's last answer, how does a market that's more normal affect subscription and transactional revenue growth as we look ahead? 
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Greg, and thanks for coming back for seconds. We appreciate it. So I think that we are seeing -- I would first challenge that we are seeing kind of continued pressures on the industry, both in terms of ongoing inflation as well as increased risk that they are experiencing, that seemingly is continuing to support premium growth as well as kind of natural expansion in coverage for the industry. 
 So at this point, based upon the financial reports and our engagement with clients, we have not seen early signs of that market. In fact, a lot of the reading that I have seen has been to a sustained hard market. But we do have to anticipate at some point that there may be some pressure from a margin standpoint. 
 And in that context, our products and services remain critical in achieving a higher level of operational efficiency within the business in order to maintain or improve that combined ratio as well as the efficiency of making good underwriting decisions. 
 And I would use this as an opportunity to say I think one of the most promising dimensions of generative AI is in gathering and predigesting a lot of the information flow that the insurance industry relies upon to evaluate policy submissions, evaluating adequacy, going into the risk, not replacing the human, but enabling them to focus their expertise on the underwriting decision, the risk and the return decision. 
 We think that, that is a secular trend. As technology improves, as datasets expand, that will continue to provide ample opportunity for us to deliver value to the industry. It's nice to have some premium growth because I think it puts people in a constructive frame of mind. But these issues and challenges that the industry face are going to exist, regardless of whether it's a hard market or a soft market. And I think that's our fundamental opportunity. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. Thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-21 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question so that we can allow everyone to ask a question. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introduction, I would now like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd also like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonably effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating in this morning's call. I am pleased to be here today to recap what was an exceptional year for Verisk, marked by strategic, organizational and cultural change matched with outstanding financial performance and value creation for clients and shareholders alike. Elizabeth will provide the financial detail but in summary, we delivered 8.7% organic constant currency revenue growth in 2023, the strongest performance on record since our initial public offering back in 2009. And we exceeded the expectations we set at Investor Day in March. We combine this with double-digit organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and 150 basis points of margin expansion on an Insurance-only basis, achieving the low end of the initial margin improvement goal of 300 basis points one year earlier than our original target of 2024. And we have plans in place to build on that in 2024 and beyond. Despite the separation of our non-Insurance business, we still grew free cash flow 6% to over $800 million and above our 2022 level on an unadjusted basis. Over the past two years, we demonstrated capital discipline by returning over $4 billion in proceeds from recent dispositions, to shareholders through share repurchases reducing our share base by about 10%. This also served to substantially improve our capital efficiency, and boost our returns on invested capital.  And while our strong 2023 revenue growth was exceptional, the long-term opportunity of addressing our clients' most pressing needs, gives me confidence in our strategy to drive consistent and predictable growth in 2024 and beyond. The insurance industry backdrop in which we are operating, is relatively comparable to 2023. Insurance carriers continue to deal, with cyclical challenges on profitability resulting from higher losses and the lagging effects of inflation, by restricting new business in profit-challenged markets. The most recent AM Best data shows losses for the first nine months of 2023 were $32.2 billion, a further deterioration from the $24.5 billion in net losses recorded through the first six months of the year and tracking way ahead of the pace of losses in 2022. This caused AM Best to downgrade their outlook for the homeowners line from stable to negative, while also maintaining their negative outlook on personal auto. To some extent, profitability challenges in the industry were the result of higher catastrophe-related losses. Our own PCS data, points out that 2023 was the highest year on record for frequency of catastrophe activity, with 74 events. While 2023, did not have a major tropical hurricane make US landfall, wind and severe convective storms were dominant and the major source of events in the year. That said, the fourth quarter of 2023 was a relatively quiet period with only seven events, and was lower than the fourth quarter of 2022, which experienced 13 events. On the more positive end, carriers are having success raising rates and driving premium growth and are taking the very early steps in certain lines to unwind restrictions on writing new business, as they achieve rate adequacy. In fact, net written premium growth increased 10.8% for the first nine months of 2023. More structurally, the insurance industry continues to be challenged by the rapid pace of technological change including, digitalization and cloud migration. This is being compounded by the fact, that the industry also faces technological debt and aging legacy systems. In addition, the industry continues to experience growing regulatory focus on issues of data privacy, fairness and climate risk. Our business model and strategy are designed to address our customers' most pressing needs, both from a cyclical and structural perspective. We invest on behalf of the industry, applying our industry knowledge and technical expertise at scale, to deliver value to our clients at a lower cost of investment and ownership than any one participant can achieve individually. As we work with our clients on a more integrated basis, the opportunities to develop new solutions expands. We are focused on the three key priorities, we articulated back at Investor Day namely, delivering consistent and predictable top line growth, driving operating efficiency and profitability and ensuring disciplined capital allocation. Let me spend a few minutes on how we plan to go after each in 2024 and beyond. Our first priority is delivering consistent and predictable growth, through strategic dialogue with clients in innovation. Throughout 2023, we made substantial progress on our initiative to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients, and to become their strategic data analytic and technology partner. During the year, I met with over three dozen client CEOs and senior leaders representing over half of the US property and casualty insurance industry direct written premium to discuss how we could better support their objectives. Three primary themes came up repeatedly. How can you accelerate and expand the delivery of data and analytics to our organization? How can Verisk augment the capabilities of our colleagues to improve their ability to manage the amount of information they receive? And finally, how can Verisk help better connect the ecosystems we operate in to improve our efficiency. On the acceleration point, we are intensively addressing this opportunity across our businesses, but perhaps most significantly in our Core Lines Reimagine project to reengineer how we deliver our core data sets and analytics to meet the rapidly evolving ingestion demands of our clients. Prospectively, we see the application of low no-code and micro services technology that we have successfully deployed in the life insurance industry, having material significance to the property and casualty segment and have been working with clients on testing applications. On augmentation, we have already been applying generative AI technology through our Discovery Navigator solution to dramatically accelerate the summarization of large and complex medical files in our casualty business. Prospectively, we have been developing and working with clients to refine several augmented underwriting applications. On connectivity, we have been investing in our Xactware platform to support the integration of more ecosystem and partners. Last week, I attended our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City, which had record attendance from our insurance contractor, adjuster clients, and over 30 ecosystem partners. Both clients and partners expressed enthusiasm for our delivery of improved connectivity and efficiency, demonstrating the network potential of this business. Finally, on connectivity, we were thrilled at last week's announcement of Marsh's expansion of its digital trading initiative on the Verisk Whitespace platform. This builds on a successful pilot in 2023, which traded over $400 million in premium and is a gratifying endorsement by a world-leading insurance broker that should draw more participation onto a data-first platform that will drive greater efficiency for the market. With expansion across its UK specialty and international placement business, Marsh anticipates that over 90% of all client premium in that segment will flow through the platform by the end of 2024. Our strategic conversations are also helping to drive more informed innovation. In our conversations with clients, we repeatedly hear about the increasing regulatory focus and reporting requirements on fairness and unfair discrimination. To address this need during the fourth quarter, we launched FairCheck, a solution designed to address issues of fairness and discrimination in the underwriting process. FairCheck helps insurers test their personal lines' models and variables to respond to regulatory change and to evaluate and mitigate the potential for unfairly discriminatory outcomes. This solution is an extension of the work we did internally to assess Verisk's own personal auto rating model, to determine whether there were unfair pricing outcomes regarding race. We recently signed a national property and casualty carrier to be our first customer. Internally during 2023, we worked with an outside consultant to sharpen our go-to-market strategy and are implementing the first steps of this changed approach in 2024. This includes an investment behind sales effectiveness, incorporating a change to the composition of incentives to be more in line with industry best practices. In addition, we have identified pricing and packaging opportunities within property estimating solutions and extreme event solutions. And we will be bringing them to market throughout this year. Our second priority from Investor Day is driving operating efficiency and profitability. We remain committed to driving operating efficiency and margin expansion over time. We are leaning into our global talent optimization initiative, tapping into the talent-rich and low-cost markets like Krakow Poland and Hyderabad India. We have recently expanded our real estate footprint in both markets to support our growth. Additionally, we should continue to achieve savings as we modernize and optimize our technology infrastructure across all our legacy systems, including our internal financial and human capital ERP upgrade, which is underway and which should start delivering early efficiency benefits in 2025 with the full impact to be achieved in two to three years. As we look out, we see opportunity in improving our operational efficiency by careful reviews of our workflow and processes. We will continue to deploy our Lean Six Sigma program to drive additional savings and continue to focus on our organizational structure and efficiency. And finally, our third priority is disciplined capital allocation. Disciplined capital allocation underscores all our decision-making at Verisk. We invest our strong free cash flow into value-creating opportunities that support growth with attractive returns. Excess capital is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2023, our return on invested capital was approximately 26% with incremental returns on capital at approximately 19%, as continue to invest our capital at high internal rates of return. We are excited about the many opportunities we have to invest across our business in emerging technologies, including generative AI, low no-code applications and international expansion. We also are investing behind upgrades and re-platforming of our core solutions, some of which have been underinvested and need modernization to support future innovation. The most notable example is our Core Lines Reimagine project. As we highlighted before, we are about one-third of the way through this project from an investment perspective and we are engaging our clients as we plan for customer-facing modules launching in 2024. While there is still much work to be done, we are already driving returns through strong contract renewals with our largest customers, as they recognize the value of the program. We are also investing in modernizing our property estimating solutions platform to advance our strategic goal of creating a more open ecosystem that is resilient, redundant and available for all stakeholders. We are simplifying partner integration and developing new services to enable deeper workflow integration, richer solutions and better client services. This initiative should increase our agility and create a more dynamic work environment for both our clients and our development teams. We are also excited about the opportunities to continue to create incremental value in our insurance related acquisitions. For example, in claims, we are driving growth and synergies in our three recent acquisitions in Germany, where we have a leading market position in the bodily injury space and are adding services and technology offerings in the auto and property spaces through the acquisitions of ACTINEO, Krug and Rocket respectively. These acquisitions enable us to deliver solutions and add value to our German customers across the entire claims life cycle. Before we close, I want to address the recent leadership announcements naming three new business leaders to the Verisk Senior Operating Committee. Rob Newbold was named President, Extreme Events taking over the reins from Bill Churney who retired at the end of the year. And Doug Caccese and Saurabh Khemka, who are recently named Co-Presidents of Underwriting Solutions replacing Neil Spector who has moved into a strategic advisory role. All three leaders are evidence of our deeply talented management bench and focused leadership development and succession planning process. I want to thank both Bill and Neil for their many contributions to Verisk and to me personally as I stepped into the role of CEO. And while we will miss them, they have left their business in the very capable hands of talented, experienced and energized leaders. 2023 was a demonstration of Verisk's evolving culture. We delivered strong financial success, while absorbing organizational and leadership change. And I am excited about having the fresh perspective and energy of these three leaders as we move into 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.
Elizabeth Mann : Thanks Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid fourth quarter capping off an outstanding 2023. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, fourth quarter revenue was $677 million, up 7.4% versus the prior year, reflecting solid growth in underwriting and more modest growth in claims. Income from continuing operations was $182 million, down 15.5% versus the prior year, while diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.25, down 8.8% versus the prior year. The year-over-year decline in both measures were primarily due to a $19 million litigation reserve expense related to our former Financial Services segment that was previously sold, alongside a one-time tax benefit of $30 million, or $0.19 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, elevated depreciation and amortization expenses in the fourth quarter of 2023, resulting from the completion and implementation of certain large internally developed software projects during the year, also contributed to the decrease. These factors were partially offset by strong revenue growth, lower net interest expense and the benefit from our accelerated share repurchase program. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated solid growth for most of our businesses. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 6% with growth of 7.3% in underwriting, and 2.8% in claims. Normalizing for the $5.6 million in storm-related revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022, total OCC revenue growth would have been 6.9% and claims OCC revenue growth would have been 6.0%. As expected and as we highlighted in prior quarters, some of the environmental trends recorded elevated growth earlier in the year began to normalize in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we did begin to overlap tougher comparisons in many of our businesses. That said, 2023 was a record year for Verisk, with total OCC revenue growth of 8.7%, driven by strong growth of 8.5% in underwriting and 9.3% in claims. Growth for the full year was broad-based with almost all businesses delivering better-than-expected results. Throughout 2023, our increased focus on the Insurance business and our energized organization, capitalized on three key industry and environmental trends to amplify our growth. These trends included, the pricing environment, resulting from the hard insurance market, the high transaction activity, driven by elevated shopping activity for auto insurance and the active US weather patterns that Lee highlighted. Our subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.3% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter, with growth in almost all our subscription-based solutions. The drivers of growth we experienced in the quarter were consistent with trends we saw throughout 2023. More specifically during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing. In anti-fraud, we saw underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essential bundle. That said, we have started to anniversary the benefit we experienced from these conversions and are expecting the benefit from this transition to continue to moderate in 2024. These strengths were offset in part by continued weakness within Verisk Marketing Solutions and a more normalized level of attrition across the business, including some reduction in the level of contractor activity, due to the weather and some pressure within our Insurtech customer segment. Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, increased a modest 0.8% on an OCC basis, reflecting a tough comparison versus the prior year, which included revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional revenue growth would have been 4.1%. During the quarter, we continued to see strong results from our auto solutions, driven by healthy consumer shopping activity and the final quarter of benefit from the large nonrate action deal we signed for 2023. We have begun to overlap the positive inflection in shopping behavior from last year and are expecting growth to moderate in 2024. Our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth within life insurance solutions, as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our extreme events business, we saw better-than-expected transactional growth driven by securitizations. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.5% in the fourth quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA, margin which includes both organic and inorganic results was 53.4%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. The fourth quarter margin rate reflects the positive impact of sales leverage, cost discipline and foreign currency changes. This was offset in part by margin pressure from higher incentive compensation, acquisitions and organic investments for future growth. 2023 was a year of tremendous growth and efficiency for Verisk as evidenced by total OCC adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.5%, while total adjusted EBITDA margin was 53.5%, up 150 basis points from the prior year. This margin rate reflects core operating leverage from the strong revenue growth and cost discipline across the organization. As Lee discussed earlier, delivering operational efficiency and profitability remains a key priority for us as we move forward into 2024 and beyond. We have confidence we can continue to make further progress, while also balancing investments to support future growth. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $28 million for the fourth quarter compared to $41 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects lower year-over-year debt balances as well as higher interest on cash balances. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets was $68 million for the quarter, an increase of 57%. The increase was primarily driven by an additional $23 million of expense related to the timing of certain large internally developed software projects that were completed and placed into service during the year. On taxes our reported effective tax rate was 24.9% compared to 9.9% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate is related to the one-time tax benefit of $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and a $19 million litigation reserve taken in the fourth quarter 2023 that we mentioned earlier. Adjusted net income decreased 9.3% to $204 million and diluted adjusted EPS decreased 2.1% to $1.40 for the fourth quarter. These changes reflect the negative impact from the one-time tax benefit in the prior year quarter and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by solid revenue and EBITDA growth lower net interest expense and a lower average share count. The share count reflects the impact of the additional $250 million of share repurchases executed in the fourth quarter as well as the final settlement of our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan that we entered into in March. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis net cash from operating activities increased 1.4% to $252 million, while free cash flow increased 15.8% to $196 million. It is important to note that the prior year cash flow figures still include the results of our previously divested Energy business. So, these growth figures understate the full cash flow growth potential of our Insurance-only business. On dividends and repurchases, during 2023, we returned $3 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. We are pleased to share that the Board has approved a $0.05 or 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.39 per share. In addition our Board has also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, bringing our total authorization to $1.6 billion. On guidance, we are pleased to deliver our expectations for 2024 with growth and margins in line with our Investor Day target and they build upon the exceptional performance we delivered in 2023. More specifically, we expect consolidated revenue for 2024, to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.9 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin in the 54% to 55% range. This margin reflects strong cost discipline, while also funding incremental investment opportunities that we expect to drive future growth. These opportunities include investing in our sales force to drive greater sales effectiveness, expanding internationally through acquisitions and building our capabilities with new advanced technologies including Generative AI. Walking further down the P&L, we expect depreciation and amortization of fixed assets in the range of $210 million to $240 million and amortization of intangibles of approximately $75 million. Both items are subject to the timing of completion of projects and foreign currency changes. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This all culminates in adjusted earnings, in the range of $6.30 to $6.60 per share. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $240 million and $260 million as we continue to invest organically to drive future growth. A complete list of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee, for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we're excited about the opportunity that lies ahead. Our motivating purpose is to partner with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator, to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So I wanted to talk about the revenue guide. Liz, you mentioned a few puts and takes and we've been talking all of last year about some of the one-time impacts that you noted are normalizing. So maybe you give us a bit more perspective specifically how you're thinking about transaction growth and what some of the puts and takes there are? Thank you.
Elizabeth Mann: [Technical Difficulty] takes. But zooming back on the full year, we really think there were three drivers of strength in 2023. The first was the pricing environment in the hard insurance market. The second was the transactional rebound and particularly the activity in the auto shopping space. And the third was the elevated weather activity which as you heard 2023 was a record-breaking year for cat events even though there was a single large hurricane driving it. When we think about making assumptions for a future year, we think in general that first -- that hard insurance market does persist into 2024. But for the other factors for transactional activity, we would expect that to normalize somewhat. And for the weather, we can never forecast mother nature. So we assume a more normalized level of weather activity.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: It's Wahid Amin [ph] on for Heather. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to comment a little bit more on the pricing environment for 2023. You said it was quite elevated. Can you comment on how that is going into 2024?
Lee Shavel: Yes. So, thanks. This is Lee. So first let me distinguish I think from a pricing standpoint first, as we indicated in our comments and as Elizabeth just described, the overall premium growth market has continued to be strong as insurers have been able to secure some rate approvals. We think there's more progress in that regard. So I want to differentiate that pricing environment, which has been constructive. And from our perspective that is a partial benefit. It represents approximately 20% to 25% of our revenue base is tied to prior two-year premium growth. And so that provides some level of support. But I think the more meaningful element of our pricing is our ability to deliver value to our clients. We're doing that probably most significantly in the investment that we're making in our Core Lines Reimagine project, where early renewals from clients that have seen what we are doing, what we are creating, how we are improving, their experience, their efficiency has demonstrated that value. And we have been able to realize stronger pricing momentum than we had originally anticipated which we feel good about as we continue to deliver more functionality through that platform. And I would say, further I think we through the go-to-market review that we have done, we have identified some areas to identify how we can capture more value that we are delivering to our clients from pricing structures that align to identifying and identifying that value that we're creating for our clients.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. First, I just want to say how much I appreciate Slide 7, the revenue mix, very helpful. My question is about Verisk auto underwriting revenues, which I think is all non-subs. Just please verify that. How did this ad market do in the fourth quarter? And what's the assumption for 2024 within a guide?
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Andrew and thanks for the feedback on the slide. We're always listening to you guys. On the auto underwriting revenues, it is largely transactional but not 100%. There is some subscription revenues in there. And the shopping activity was – in Q4, it tapered down from Q3 but it is still elevated relative to historical levels. I think for third-party data that J.D. Power data encapsulates that. I think we are assuming that it will continue tapering down to more historic levels. Even at where it is we're now lapping the benefit of the strong environment. But maybe for more on that environment I'll turn it over to Doug Caccese
Doug Caccese: Sure. Thanks, Elizabeth and thanks, Andrew for the question. Just I'll echo what you had said Elizabeth. As we look at our internal data and also external shopping data we see a slight slowdown in Q4 from the shopping activity. And when you look at it month-over-month you see a slight slowdown from October, November, December. So we are seeing that slowdown happen. We expect that slowdown to continue. But in 2024, we expect still elevated levels of shopping activity. The pivot on this is also that we'll focus on our non-rate action campaigns which actually allow us to go and help carriers bring in premium immediately that's leaking out of the book while they're waiting for rate to earn in so it helps in that way.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead. 
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the subscription growth. There were three headwinds that were called out. I was just wondering how should we think about the Marketing Solutions some of the attrition and contracted activity and insurance deck as we go through 2024? Thanks.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. On the marketing side as we've called out in the year -- carriers and being challenged and still trying to achieve profitable growth has not yet turned on their marketing spend. We are starting to see that tide turn and some of them are returning to profitability. The marketing engines haven't been turned on quite yet, but you're starting to see green shoots in that environment. I would say we're assuming that it will start to return to more normalized levels in the second half of this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, This is Brendan on for Manav. I just want to ask [Technical Difficulty] the new product pipeline. Any benefits from that this year? What's kind of -- what's planned for this year? And then also you talked about some incremental investments as well with AI Gen AI. So anything related to that?
Lee Shavel: Sure. Thank you, Brendan. And I'm going to repeat the question because you came through a little choppy there. So I think the question was how do we feel about a new product pipeline areas of investment? And so I would say, we're really excited about a number of the new products and developments that we are -- that we have been working on. In particular, I think, certainly a lot of the focus has been around generative AI and its application. And we've been exploring its application across a variety of our businesses. I'm going to isolate for a second on our claims business where we have deployed some generative AI, applications and are also looking at developing other applications. I'm going to ask my colleague Maroun Mourad to talk a little bit about what we're doing in that area as an example of what we have been looking to do more broadly.
Maroun Mourad: Thank you, Lee and thank you Manav for the question. So building on our 2023 momentum let me just highlight our strong levels of client engagement and ecosystem partner-driven innovations and co-creation that led to the productization of a couple of solutions. In the casualty bodily injury space we have deployed a traditional AI methods as well as generative AI technologies in the data extraction and medical file summary space in conjunction with the deep domain expertise of our legal as well as medical staff in order to continue delivering value to our customers in that space and also in the property estimation space. We have also deployed the Gen AI and other AI methods in order to continue delivering automation in the estimation product process. We've talked in the past about XactXpert as a solution to continue driving productivity, speed as well as accuracy which is very important for our customers to connect adjusters, contractors as well as insurers.
Lee Shavel: And I'd add to that, Brendan. I want to give you a taste of what we're doing on that front. But as many of you know, we've been really thrilled about the success that we've had with our fast businesses application of low and no-code technology to the Life Insurance business. We believe and have begun to engage with clients on how that can be potentially applied to the P&C area. So I think that's a broad opportunity. And then we also as a more insurance-focused entity have been able to try to integrate more of our data sets in our extreme events business and our specialty business solutions area, tying together some of the functions in the excess and specialty market and the reinsurance markets as well as tying together some of our claims data and our underwriting data. And so as we have now fully migrated to the cloud, our ability to facilitate those types of integrations are particularly attractive. So a lot of the great stuff that we have underway that should support future growth for the company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Please go ahead.
Jeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. I know a lot of factors contribute to the consistent growth. But I just would love your perspective on the procyclicality of bookings or innovation sell-through, especially when it's discrete upsell. And I guess, what I'm wondering is as the -- as you start to see the move towards premium adequacy, would you expect to see bookings pick up with that? And maybe can call out a few areas, I'd imagine marketing is one, but any other areas where there may be pent-up demand as the environment gets healthier from a profitability perspective? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Sure, Jeff. It's a complex question, and so I think we're trying to get our handle on it. I'm going to kind of isolate on as we see premium adequacy improve and the procyclicality dimension of the business. I should probably start by saying, or by saying, as I think many of our investors and analysts understand we don't have a high degree of economic sensitivity. And so, there is muted sensitivity to cyclical effects. We tend to be more influenced as you've observed by weather events or activities in the ILS market and so those tend to have a more pronounced element to it. I do think that, there is some procyclicality elements that as the business -- as the insurance industry is doing well and we've seen premium growth that, that does encourage more investment in technology and renovation that accelerates our ability to deploy some of the technologies that we have invested in. And that is a positive tailwind in that scenario. However, I want to isolate that to insurance cyclicality. So that as their profitability grows and that may be separate and unconnected to just broader economic cyclicality, which is relatively muted. So hopefully that, I think, addresses kind of the core of your question, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Greg Parrish: This is Greg Parrish on for Toni. Thanks for taking our question. Why don't you just talk about margin? You talked about what sounded like expansion of some of the ongoing efficiency initiatives that you have. Is the benefit from those within the ongoing 25 to 75 basis points in your framework and balanced by investment? Or do you skew a little bit higher over the next two to three years as you work through those initiatives? How do we think about that? Thanks.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question. We are continually focused on efficiency here at Verisk and looking at the next levers that we can pull. We do think in the long-term that being efficient in our core business will enable us to fund some of the investments we've been talking about, all while delivering operating leverage in the business. So, beyond 2024 is a long way out, and we'll come back and give impact on that in future years as we get closer. But that's the general concept of delivering efficiency in order to fund some investments and still have an expansion.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jeff Silber: Thanks so much. I want to continue on the margin discussion, and I'm sorry, if I'm misspeaking here. But I'm looking at your Investor Day slide last March, where you were guiding for 54% to 50% -- 56%, excuse me, adjusted EBITDA margins in 2024, and then another 25 to 75 basis points increase in 2025. Today you're talking about 54% to 55% in 2024. I'm just wondering what's changed since then? And should we still expect the margin expansion in 2025 that you had guided to last year? Thanks.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Jeff. Yes, you're right. Our range now as a one-year guidance and a 1-point range is a tightening from what we have said at Investor Day, which at that time it was two years out and a 2-point range. And I'll remind you that, that Investor Day range the 54% to 56% itself was a tightening of what had been our three-year margin target, which was a 3-point range of 53% to 56%. So, our trajectory over the past three years has been to increase margins by 150 basis points in 2022, another 150 basis points in 2023. And then, currently the midpoint of this guide would represent another 100 basis points on top of that. So we are balancing that margin expansion and the trajectory of margin expansion with investments in growth. The differential between the current midpoint of our guide and the midpoint at Investor Day is entirely encompassed by the three incremental investments that I highlighted that were not yet in the cards at the time of Investor Day. Those are the investments in our sales force that Lee discussed, the international expansion with our M&A that has taken place since Investor Day, and then the investments in generative AI to drive new products. So, we think we're delivering on all of our client-facing investments those -- the three ones being the ones that are particularly new since Investor Day. We're doing that while still delivering 100 basis points of margin expansion. And so, we think that balance is an attractive package. If you compound this and this margin expansion on top of what we already delivered in 2023, you come out ahead of those targets that we had in March.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. I'll echo Andrew's comments on slide 7, super helpful. And my question goes specifically to that graphic. Lee and Elizabeth, when you look at the different solutions here, maybe you could call out a couple about what you're the most excited and perhaps where you think you have the ability to drive faster growth whether that's on the claims side, or the underwriting side, it sounds like you have some pricing initiatives. Obviously life and rest of world is pretty exciting if somewhat small. But are there a couple of areas where you think -- if we look at this chart say three to five years from now where the contribution of certain solutions have significantly changed?
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. I'm going to answer your question in a way that I think gives you some insight in terms of where we see value creation opportunity. I think first off, all of our businesses are clearly generating strong organic growth delivering value to the industry. They're at different scale levels. And so I'll reiterate that, for instance, in our forms rules and loss cost area where we focused our core lines reimagine area that's a broad area where we are creating value. And I'm going to ask Saurabh Khemka who leads that effort in that business to talk a bit about how we're creating value there. It's probably our most scaled opportunity where we can find incremental value and capture that value. Underneath the businesses as a whole and this will hearken back to Investor Day, we see opportunities to build network value. We've talked about it within the themes ecosystem where we're adding partners, which creates value for all of our market participants but particularly our insurance clients. And I'll also note that with our specialty business solutions, while 3% of our total 2023 revenue contribution represents connectivity and a network impact particularly with the Marsh announcement that allows us to build value in that network expansion. And I think that holds true in a variety of areas, property estimating solutions in forms rules and loss costs. But let me give Saurabh an opportunity to talk a little bit about where we are adding value to our clients in a variety of ways with the core lines reimagine project.
Saurabh Khemka: Sure. Thanks Lee, and good morning. So, overall, we feel really good about where we are with the reimagine program and the progress the team has made. And as the program naturally moves towards client deliverables in 2024, our customers will see additional value from benefits of our modernization of our internal systems, which will allow them to have faster access to our analytics, new analytics and insights like our executive industry insights that will be brought into the buy lines of business will provide benchmark analytics to our customers, new innovation around our forms management platform, which will make it easier for our customers to manage and track changes to our core programs, and finally continued migration of our contents to the new platform. We are really encouraged by the client feedback around these innovations and our customers are excited to see these come to fruition.
Lee Shavel: And I'll cap it off by saying another dimension of incremental growth is the ability to move some of our traditional products into more of a SaaS type of environment. And there in our extreme events business, the migration to more of a SaaS model, we believe opens up opportunity to deliver more value to that segment of our clients as well. But thanks for the question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. In terms of just the go-to-market strategy the investment in the sales force at this point, can you provide a little bit more color in terms of are there like changes in compensation structure or headcount thing that you're looking for? How should we think about that part of the equation?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Surinder. So there are a number of elements and I really have to complement the organization for its receptivity, to outside perspectives, on what we could be doing better. We looked at it across all of our businesses. And certainly, compensation structure was an area of focus. And there, I think we -- there were two things. One, we looked at where market levels were both from a level and from a composition standpoint, so that our sales team felt as though they were being fairly treated, create a good opportunity and aligning our interest with the customer. And we believe that that will improve our retention and make certain that they are focused on the opportunities that generate the most value for us. We also spent time looking at pricing, relative to value and where we feel as though we're delivering demonstrable value to our clients, and how we can be more responsive to structuring our pricing in a way that aligns, with our clients' perception of value and what their needs are. So, I would just identify those as two of the primary functions. I would add, somewhat outside of this, we have also been working to make certain that our sales effort is well tied into our senior-level strategic dialogue, so that as we have driven a stronger level of dialogue, we are communicating effectively internally to capitalize on opportunities for sales on existing products that our clients may not be aware of, or we find higher support because of the value proposition at a senior level within the organization. And so, that's an area where we expect that we'll be able to do a better job as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Please go ahead. 
Q – Andrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the higher-growth businesses, a different way. I think back in the Investor Day, you talked about those potentially representing 20% of your business in 2025. Is there a way to kind of comment on that trajectory, and how those faster-growth businesses performed in 2023, specifically?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. This is Elizabeth. Yes, I can comment on that. They continue to be on the path and on the trajectory to achieve that goal. They've achieved strong results in 2023. And the largest change in our growth mix in 2023 versus kind of the algorithm laid out at Investor Day, has been the overperformance of the core businesses.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. 
Q – Russell Quelch: Yes. Appreciate, you having me on. I also appreciate the strategy you've been making in improving and growing the business. But I want to look at the free cash flow yield. It's still at the low end of the peer group. And Elizabeth did mention in her remarks, I think a focus on growing free cash flow. So maybe you could expand on this a little bit, and how much we should expect free cash flow to grow in 2024 and beyond.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Russell. We'll have to look with you at that stat on free cash flow yield because we think the Insurance business has very strong free cash flow. Again, looking at it maybe as a percent of revenue may understate the strength of it. So, we think it's been growing. I mean, a demonstration of the growth in the Q4 number, which has grown over the prior year, even though the prior year numbers still include the energy business. So we are excited about the free cash flow generation of the business. We don't give guidance on it, but conceptually it should continue to grow roughly in line with our bottom line. And I think the purest demonstration, we can give of that confidence has been the commitment on the dividend increase.
Lee Shavel: Yes. And Russell the one thing I would add is I think that if you start with free cash flow given accounting differences over time should even out. And so it should approximate our overall EBITDA growth rate assuming that the CapEx is growing commensurate with that. I do think in 2024, we're seeing slightly higher CapEx growth, because of what we see as a number of opportunities within the business. Part of that relates to the generative AI opportunity. And so we may have periods of higher level of CapEx investment that may bring the overall free cash flow growth down. But over the long-term we see that very -- should be very commensurate with our overall adjusted EBITDA growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Seth Weber : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Lee, I've heard a couple of times you talked about pricing opportunities. I think you called out extreme events and property estimating. I'm just trying to maybe get some more details on that. Do you think that will impact 2024? Or is that a longer-term kind of play here? And is this just sort of the first couple of areas where you're finding these new opportunities and we should expect more of that kind of going forward? Or any way you can help frame this pricing opportunity? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Seth, thanks for the question. It's difficult to kind of isolate it, because it occurs across our business. I would say that certainly that those pricing improvements that I've referred to in terms of new contract renewals are factored into our 2024 guidance from an overall revenue growth perspective. So, in that regard, we're beginning to see some of that influence that our near-term expectations. But I do believe that it is a source of growth for us longer-term. And it's not a really very different than what we described as our general operating model, which is that we believe that we can create much broader value for the industry, by investing in this data and technology and capturing that particularly as we add value to our existing clients is largely value-driven pricing. And so that supports the -- that longer-term 6% to 8% growth target that we are working to achieve on a predictable and consistent basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. This is Sid on for Greg. I wanted to focus on Slide 18 of your investor deck and when you talk about your capital management philosophy. And just moving forward curious, how we should view repurchases following in your capital management framework versus acquisitions, or internal investments, et cetera?
Elizabeth Mann : Yes. Thanks for the question, Sid. As we highlight there, our capital management philosophy really focuses on our returns on invested capital. We will look to invest in the business. Our CapEx range that we've given you for the year shows the organic investment in the business. On the M&A side, we are active in the market. And we will continue to evaluate opportunities and what we see out there for strong businesses which bring something additive to the Verisk business. And those two things should be generating returns well above our cost of capital. And we assess that and continue to track it. As we highlighted in the script, our incremental returns on invested capital this year were approximately 19%. To the extent, we don't find opportunities there, we will continue to return capital to shareholders, as you've seen us do pretty consistently in the past.
Lee Shavel: And Greg, one thing that I would add and I want to thank all of our investors who participated in the year-end investor survey that was conducted. We thought it was important to get feedback after the first three quarters and following Investor Day. And specific to your point and Elizabeth's comments Greg, one very clear priority from the investors that we surveyed was a preference for internal investment kind of recognizing our ability to leverage that and generate very high returns. And so, we appreciate that input. We share the view that that's very additive to our business and will clearly be a priority for us.
Operator: Your final question today comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into some of the transaction revenue trends you're seeing. Adjusting for storm comps, transaction revenue growth was 4% on an organic constant currency basis in 4Q. Directionally in 2024, how do you expect transaction revenue growth to trend from that 4% normalized for storm comps considering trends like auto rate shopping behavior and the conversion of transaction revenue to subscription revenue? What are some of the puts and takes that gets you higher or lower than 4% transaction revenue growth this year?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, George. You're right. The transaction revenue is -- well, first of all it's coming off a full year of very strong transactional growth, double digit I think for the prior four quarters. So we are sort of lapping that period. The biggest driver in that elevated strength a big piece of it was the auto shopping activity that we've talked about before and the weather trends actually being another element of that transactional growth. That was actually offset by some headwinds in our anti-fraud business, as they converted transactional customers to subscription customers. So looking forward, I think we expect those trends to normalize. Again, we're not assuming elevated weather activity. The auto shopping trends will begin to normalize.
Operator: We thank you for participating on the call today. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-11-01 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Currently, all participants are in listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participants to one question so that we can allow everyone to ask a question. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Sheryl, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd also like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonably high effort and unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gains and loss from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel: Good morning, and thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings call. I am pleased to be here today to update you on the progress our team at Verisk is making on driving strategy and translating it into strong growth and value creation for our clients and shareholders alike. Elizabeth will provide the financial detail. But in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of results marked by solid organic revenue growth across most of our businesses, healthy margin expansion, and double-digit profit growth. We have confidence in our ability to deliver on both our 2023 guidance and the longer-term objectives we communicated back in March at Investor Day. The industry environment within which we are operating is marked by some deep challenges. Insurance carriers are dealing with the cross currents of inflation and higher losses, which are both negatively impacting industry profitability. In fact, A.M. Best data for the first six months of 2023 points to a $24.5 billion net underwriting loss for the U.S. Property and Casualty Insurance industry, running well ahead of the pace of the full-year 2022, which experienced net underwriting losses of $26.9 billion. A.M. Best notes that personal lines specifically homeowners is the primary driver of these declines. In reaction to this backdrop, carriers are exiting markets in key catastrophe prone states, dropping certain lines of unprofitable business and laying off portions of their workforce. Carriers are also raising rates to attempt to cover rising inflation and losses, driving net written premium growth up 9.7% for the first six months of 2023. In response to this environment, Verisk is partnering closely with our clients to address their most pressing concerns, including high value solutions that can deliver high return on investment for our clients. And we are including our clients earlier in the innovation process to ensure we are delivering the right solutions with simple implementations, improving the success rate and pace of uptake of new solutions. One of the key tenets of our strategy is to elevate the strategic dialogue with our clients and to become their trusted data and analytic and technology partner. During the third quarter, we engaged with clients on several occasions and at a variety of venues including the Verisk Insurance Conference in London. This year, we've combined several Verisk events to make it easier for clients to explore the many ways we can add value and increase the efficiency of their operations. In London, for example, we combined events focused on underwriting, claims, specialty insurance and extreme event modeling into a singular client-centric experience featuring Verisk solutions. I delivered one of two keynote presentations and the entire Verisk Senior Operating Committee was in attendance demonstrating our commitment to our customers at all levels. A solutions gallery featured Verisk solutions as well as the solutions of our ecosystem partners, and we held 35 concurrent educational sessions. We wrapped up with a CEO dinner with attendees that represented carriers, brokers, and managing general agents had a group discussion around common challenges faced by the entire insurance value chain. Enterprise-wide risk management is top of mind for many in London, as our clients are managing extremely large and complex portfolios of risk spanning multiple classes of business and insurance markets all over the world. To address this pressing need, we recently introduced Enterprise Exposure Manager. This solution is a joint development effort between specialty business solutions and extreme events to bring to the market a cloud-native and scalable solution that enables insurers and reinsurers to make more informed business decisions by offering a comprehensive view of risks that exist across large property portfolios. As we engage with our customers at these events and in the many one-on-one meetings we have hosted throughout the year, there were a few consistent themes that we hear in these conversations. First is Digital Transformation, which represents a massive opportunity for the global insurance market. Our clients aspire to modernize their platforms, improve systems integrations, lower expenses, and improve operational efficiency, and we are partnering with them on this journey. Verisk is introducing solutions that drive operational efficiency for some of their most people and paper intensive processes. For example, within our casualty business, we recently launched Discovery Navigator and are seeing solid early success. Discovery Navigator combines artificial intelligence and machine learning, Verisk's contributory data and years of clinical and legal expertise to immediately identify and extract key medical data points from unstructured records, which are part of bodily injury claims. Depending on the complexity of the case, the number of medical pages involved in a bodily injury claim can range from hundreds to thousands. Verisk has automated the organization, review, and summary, of these complex unstructured documents, allowing insurers to adjust, negotiate, and settle more claims in less time. Discovery Navigator easily integrates into our customers workflows through API or online options and delivers up to a 90% time savings and 95% accuracy for an average 10x ROI for clients. Additionally, Discovery Navigator is a widely versatile tool that is driving innovation and can be used in combination with other Verisk solutions like Liability Navigator, delivering workflow automation, decision support and overall efficiency for clients. The need for deeper data insights is also something we hear regularly from customers. Inflation trends during the past year have underscored the need for accurate, up-to-date and granular data insights to inform underwriting, risk management, reinsurance and claims decisions. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Verisk with our comprehensive and proprietary data assets. For example, our Verisk property estimating solutions are designed to meet these challenges head on with a comprehensive set of tools based on timely proprietary data, enabling our customers to write the most accurate estimates possible on their first attempt. This reduces the risk of over and underpayments while improving cycle times. Key to this process is XactXpert, our recently introduced rules engine that assists estimators in avoiding unwarranted costs in their estimates. We also enable our customer's quality assurance teams that evaluate the data from the entire process, ensuring that the claim payment will be correct the first time. Finally, generative AI remains a frequent topic with clients both its transformative potential and the risk that it brings. We believe gen AI can deliver efficiency within Verisk and in client-facing solutions starting first in our underwriting and life businesses where we are actively exploring new product development as well as enhancements to existing solutions. We are increasing our investment and leaning into generative AI as our clients recognize that by partnering with Verisk, they can invest in this -- we can invest in this advanced technology on behalf of the industry more efficiently than any one customer can do on their own. We also intend to do so while maintaining our focus on fairness and value-centric governance. On the theme of investment, I want to provide a progress report and update on our core lines reimagine project. We are about one-third of the way complete in what is likely a five-year journey to modernize our forms, rules, and loss costs and related solutions. We've made progress modernizing our internal processes like our ratemaking operation to enable and efficiently scale innovations in current and new solutions. We are expanding our industry-leading contributory database by adding new data contributors and by increasing the quality of our collected data. And we are working on enhancing the recency of our data in our analytics. On the customer-facing side, we are in-market with new proprietary analytics and workflow tools. For example, we have launched executive and client insight reports designed for the senior leadership of our clients across two of the largest lines of insurance, namely homeowners and business owners with plans to expand into other large lines over time. Just this month, we also launched our Legislative Monitoring application in the new platform for select clients. This new cloud-native application transforms what was previously a document based paper trail for tracking thousands of insurance related, legal, regulatory and legislative developments into a data driven, modern, digital monitoring and efficiency tool with an improved customer interface. Legislative Monitoring is the first of a series of new features that will be launched over the next several years on the platform. Overall, customer feedback on the reimagine project has been quite positive, including on the custom analytics and Legislative Monitoring application I mentioned before, and there is excitement for future advances within core lines. This excitement is driving more constructive, value driven conversations with our clients as we partner with them along their digital transformation journey. We are making these investments to deliver increased value for our clients through enhanced underwriting accuracy and efficiency. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered strong third quarter financial results. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $678 million, up 11% versus the prior year, and income from continuing operations was $187 million, up 13% versus the prior year, reflecting strong growth across both underwriting and claims. Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.29, up 23% versus the prior year. This quarter's reported results included a $19 million litigation reserve expense associated with an indemnification for an ongoing inquiry related to our former Financial Services segment, which was sold in April 2022. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated strong and broad-based growth from most of our businesses, aided by some in-period transactional benefits. In the third quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.4%, with growth of 8.3% in underwriting and 12.2% in claims. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.3% on an OCC basis, with growth in almost all our subscription-based solutions. More specifically on the drivers of growth in subscription revenues during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing as well as a lower level of attrition and consolidation across the industry. Within property estimating solutions, our efforts to expand the ecosystem and drive new innovations like XactXpert are paying dividends through higher levels of customer retention for our contractor customers. In anti-fraud, we saw underlying strength in the business with growth augmented by the continued benefit from the conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essentials bundle. And finally, within extreme events solutions, we are benefiting from strong renewals and new customer wins. Our transactional revenues representing 20% of total revenue in the third quarter grew 10.2% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth was again from our auto solutions, driven by better than expected shopping activity by consumers and the continued benefit from the large non-rate action deal with a national insurer that we previously communicated. Our trends track consistently with the recent J.D. Power data, which pointed to a 12% increase in shopping activity for auto insurance in the third quarter as customers continue to respond to rate increases. That said we will begin to anniversary the elevated shopping activity in the fourth quarter, so we are expecting that growth to moderate. In addition to gains in auto, our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our property estimating solutions business, we saw strong transactional growth generated by our expanded set of distribution partners within our ecosystem and from elevated weather events, although not to the level of a large scale catastrophe. In fact, according to Verisk's PCS data, the third quarter of 2023 had 73 days out of 92 that included a PCS event in the U.S. And 2023 is on track to become a new high for catastrophe frequency likely to bypass 2021, which was the highest year on record to-date. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 11.8% in the third quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results was 54%, up 70 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. This margin rate reflects core operating leverage from the strong revenue growth and cost discipline across the organization. As we've said in the past, the margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by revenue mix and timing of spending. So we think it's best to look at our margins on a trailing 12-month basis, which in the third quarter were 53.3%, up 150 basis points over last year's level. Continuing down the income statement, net interest expense was $29 million for the third quarter, compared to $34 million in the prior year. The current level of net interest expense reflects lower year-over-year debt balances as we paid down our revolving credit facility as well as higher interest on cash balances. Our reported effective tax rate was 25% compared to 24.2% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year change in the tax rate is related to the $19 million litigation reserve expense that we mentioned earlier, partially offset by higher stock compensation benefits in this quarter versus the prior year's period. Going forward, we expect the tax rate for the full-year 2023 to be near the high end of the originally guided range of 23% to 25%. Adjusted net income increased 17% to $221 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 27% to $1.52 for the third quarter 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, and a lower average share count. The share count reflects the impact of our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan that we entered into in March, as well as an additional $50 million worth of share repurchase that we completed in the third quarter. Regarding the share count, you can see that while our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined 7.7% year-over-year, it was essentially flat sequentially. From a cash flow perspective, on a reported basis, net cash from operating activities decreased 11% to $250 million, while free cash declined 9% to $196 million. The decline in both cash flow metrics is a function of the fact that prior year cash flow metrics include the results from previously divested businesses as well as a favorable cash tax impact in the prior year from the sale of our environmental, health and safety business. Adjusted for these items, both cash flow metrics increased year-over-year during the third quarter. We are very pleased with robust year-to-date performance. Our guidance for 2023 remains unchanged. We now expect revenue to be towards the high end of our range of $2.63 billion to $2.66 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is still expected to be between $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the 53% to 54% range and adjusted EPS in the range of $5.50 to $5.70. A complete listing of all guidance measures can be found in the earnings slide deck, which has been posted to the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. We do want to remind you that the fourth quarter of 2022 included $6 million in revenue associated with Hurricane Ian as well as a tax benefit associated with the divestiture of Wood Mackenzie. And now, I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited about our business momentum and the opportunity ahead. Our motivating purpose is to partner with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities, and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships, and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision making and operational efficiency is a formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing with insurance marketing budgets, especially in the current rate and inflation environment and if you're seeing any sort of a pullback from insurance carriers?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, George. I appreciate the question. So the short answer is yes. I think the dynamic that we're observing is that because of the loss environment and the frustrations that the insurers or the carriers generally have had in getting rate increases to compensate them for the increased risk and the increased replacement costs driven by replacement. Right now they are focused on achieving profitability off of their existing books and that has resulted in a lower level of advertising by the carriers as they are kind of working with their existing book. We have seen, as Elizabeth described, a lot of shopping activity, but that is consumer driven and is a response to the higher rates that almost everyone is experiencing right now. The consequences of that for us is that in our Verisk marketing solutions business, we have seen declines within that business because of lower overall advertising spend by the carriers as a function of this environment.
Stacey Brodbar: Next question, please.
Operator: Line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. I guess I'll just ask the question around the guidance that was maintained. I mean, this quarter came in, I think above at least our expectations and probably yours. Correct me if I'm wrong there, but if the subscription growth stays steady like it usually does, are you implying that the transaction piece could see some material declines? Just would love any help with just trying to bridge that.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks very much, Manav. On the guidance, we're very proud of our results year-to-date. We've given full-year guidance in order to bring additional transparency and for folks to see how the business is going. We did update that mid-year after seeing significant shifts in the environment. But our full-year guidance does imply revenue growth of approximately 8% to 9% on a reported basis that's above our long-term targets. As we look at the fourth quarter, no specific comments on the fourth quarter other than what I highlighted, which is to remind that the growth comparisons do get tougher in the fourth quarter due to the storm revenue and the tax benefit there.
Operator: Line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just Lee, you keep on talking about the strategic dialogue you have with customers at a high level. It sounds like some of this stuff is resonating. I guess I'm curious, are you actually measuring success in any way yet or is this too early? I mean, should we be looking for larger, I don't know, outsourcing deals or maybe again specifically like any revenues that you're tracking that you can already talk about?
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Alex. I'm happy to address that. I think we have seen a clear benefit in a variety of areas. So one and first is that engaging at that strategic dialogue and I probably have had over a dozen client CEO meetings and one thing that we focus on in that is understanding their broader enterprise challenges within this environment. And there's also a focus on what is Verisk doing for us and where are their areas that we are helping others that we can help them. And specifically, in a number of those conversations, we've identified products -- existing products that we have that can be particularly helpful in this environment. And I would say are what we have done to help carriers analyze their existing rate adequacy and where there may be opportunities to improve their rates in their auto book or in other parts of their business. And that's opened up some channels that before where our bottoms up approach may have run into an obstacle within the organization. But when given the opportunity to describe the strategic benefit, the financial benefit, we're getting more top down support. And I've seen that take place in a number of clients. So I think that's one. The second is in understanding areas, emerging areas where they are facing either challenges or interest in new technologies, an opportunity to guide what we are doing in some of our projects like core lines, reimagine, what we're doing in generative AI, to tailor them to what we know has strategic resonance for those clients has been helpful. And so I think as we have been investing in a number of generative AI applications that has been specifically helped by getting insight and buy in from those levels. I had one dinner with the CEO said, look, Lee, we could spend tens of millions of dollars on generative AI, and I'm not sure what we'll be able to generate out of it. But if you can develop a pilot and we can benefit from that. We would be happy to test that pilot as soon as you have it ready. And I think that's a great example of where we're able to substantiate that strategic dialogue and translate it into targeted product development at a faster rate than we would have before. I think those are certainly benefits that we'll hope to begin to deliver additional growth for us in 2024 supporting our core business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is now open, Greg.
Greg Peters: Great. Good morning, everyone. I will focus my question on Slide 6 of your investor deck where you breakout subscription and non-subscription growth. And I guess I'm going to come at the non-subscription piece where you callout auto underwriting, property estimating, and life insurance. And clearly, you're doing really well this year. But we're also dealing with some really unusual profitability challenges inside auto and property. Would you expect that the non-subscription organic growth rate would inversely correlate with sort of the underwriting cycle for your carrier partners, or am I missing something?
Elizabeth Mann: Well, let me thanks -- thanks for the question, Greg. Let me take a crack at that. I think it's a little bit hard to draw that conclusion. The transactional revenue is a combination of a couple of different areas. We've highlighted the main ones that contributed to the growth. The auto underwriting, the shopping activity has driven that, the property estimating solutions has a transactional component related to weather activity and then life on the incremental services. So I'm not sure I would point it directly to an inverse correlation to the underwriting environment.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is now open, Andrew.
Andrew Jeffrey: Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. Elizabeth, could you give us an update on the state of two markets? One, Florida, just an update on liquidations, and how that's impacting your outlook for the fourth quarter. And also California, I know there's been I think Lee referred to in your prepared remarks, some disruption in, especially homeowners, underwriting in California and some challenges that carriers are facing raising rates. Just wondering if there are any updates in either of those areas as it pertains to the guidance and maybe the longer-term outlook too.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Hey, Andrew, this is Lee. I know you directed that to Elizabeth, but we have Neil Spector who runs our underwriting business for us, and I think he's been closest to that. So let me give him an opportunity to give you a read from what we're seeing in those markets.
Neil Spector: Sure. Thanks. Well, first, I'm sure you've seen the news that several large national carriers have kind of withdrawn writing new business in both those markets due to the challenges. However, in Florida specifically, we haven't seen any additional liquidations and there's been no reduction in the ratings of the carriers that are there. So there's still availability in that market of carriers. And you may have seen recently a press release we put out in the last quarter showing how citizens, which is the state run insurer is leveraging some of our aerial imagery data to help with evaluation of properties in Florida. So that's really stable as far as between the last time we reported. And now California, there's certainly challenges both in the amount of time it takes to get rates approved and also in what tools you're allowed to use in Florida as far as pricing goes and those continue although the regulators in California are seriously looking at the potential to use more tools in the future to help with challenges like wildfire.
Lee Shavel: And I would add to that, Andrew, and I think that gives a great kind of current sense of where things are. Neil and I were in Washington, D.C. last week meeting with a number of the trade associations just to understand how we can be helpful to the industry from a data perspective. And one thing that was very clear is that the Florida and California are both very engaged with the industry to understand what steps could be taken to improve the health of those markets. I think they understand the risk and the challenges. They obviously face some political pressure, but we've been encouraged by their openness to discussing how they can improve the market dynamic for the carriers within each of those markets. And that's an intense level of dialogue that could ameliorate some of kind of the early pressures that we saw.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. You may now go ahead.
Jeff Meuler: Yes. Thanks. I'd imagine we're at the time of year where you're starting to send invoices on 2024 pricing. So can you just talk through how you're thinking about it relative to the historical context, just given the cross currents of still elevated inflation, but maybe it's coming down the P&C insurance, industry profitability challenges and then just not sure how things like core lines play into that pricing realization versus discrete upsell. Thank you.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Jeff, for the question. Obviously, we're looking at it. It's still early in the cycle, and I'm not in a position to quote any numbers or any thoughts on 2024. The data on 2022, while it's still being finalized, it does show net written premium growth still in an elevated level around the eight -- slightly north of 8% that has tapered from the 2021 growth, but still relatively high on a historical basis. I think Lee pointed to both that environment, but also the fact that it is a function of the challenges and the desire to move towards profitability that our carriers, our customers are seeing. And so we are balancing those two things as we go into the rate -- the pricing cycle for next year.
Lee Shavel: I think those are the two core elements. One, the impact of premium growth, which as we indicated, remains strong, as well as the value that we are creating, particularly in core lines where we've increased the number of data sets, we've increased the ability of our clients to utilize that data. And so we certainly look to capture the value that we're creating for our clients there and all of those factor into our pricing considerations.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn. Your line is now open.
Lee Shavel: Russell, are you there?
Operator: Russell, your line is now open.
Lee Shavel: Moving to the next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. Lee, I was hoping you could talk about the M&A pipeline. Any areas of particular interest, maybe technology, just given you highlighted the digital transformation theme earlier. Just wanted to ask about sort of how -- what would be interesting and how you're seeing levels of assets right now. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Toni. So the first thing that I would say is, hopefully is as evident by kind of what we have been doing has been a primary focus on our internal operations and what we can accomplish with the core business. And we're particularly focused on the growth objectives that we've set, the margin objectives that we've set. And we feel it's important coming after -- coming off of Investor Day that we are focused on demonstrating what the core franchise is able to deliver. So in that regard, we are not looking at any substantial large acquisitions that would be transformative. We obviously are entirely focused on insurance right now. And so that's the orientation. We do maintain active engagement on smaller mid-size opportunities; generally sub $100 million, where we feel there may be a high quality product that has gotten initial traction with the industry and where we can add substantial value by accelerating its adoption. In many cases, our clients feel more comfortable adopting a product when they know that they have the strength and the stability and our capabilities behind it, or we can enhance that product by improving the data set, improving the efficiency or the technology that's driving it. And we've had success with that in a number of areas, probably most notably our acquisition of FAST on the life side, which has been a textbook case of where we can add value in those areas. We continue to be excited about the marketing opportunity, even though as we mentioned in our earlier comments, the advertising environment has been a headwind for that. But we see broader appetite for those and we'll look to across all of our businesses to see where there might be a technology or a product or a data set that is relevant. So I wouldn't say that there is anything in particular, we really are aware of it across all of our businesses, and we want to make certain that we don't miss an opportunity to enhance one of our businesses if there is something that is truly additive.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, Elizabeth, you pointed to the high end of the 2023 guidance range now being expected. Was that just for revenues or for other figures as well? And then, when I look at the high end for the 2023 revenue guide, I get an implied revenue growth for the fourth quarter of plus 4%, of course, that would be as reported. Could you help us with the counterpart the OCC revenue growth implied in the fourth quarter?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. That comment about the high end was specific and confined to revenues and did not apply to the other line items. And I'm not here to comment on the fourth quarter in specific, other than the points I made about the year-over-year comps.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Jeff Silber: Thanks so much. I'm going to ask a question about 2024, but not a numbers question. I'm just curious, compared to a year ago, what areas of your business are you feeling more confident about it as we head into the next year? And conversely, what areas might be a bit more concerning for you than they were a year ago? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Jeff. It's an interesting question, and I would start off by saying that first, at a high level, I feel as though the strategic engagement that we've had has created broader opportunities for us to advance in a number of businesses by more effectively communicating the value to their enterprises. So I think that's certainly something that we feel strongly about. We -- in addition, feel confident about the core lines reimagine investment that we have made and our ability to deliver greater value to our clients over the next several years and to participate in that. I think that we are also seeing in the property market and the focus around profitability and opportunity to serve our clients more broadly. I think the other thing that we would look at this year that we have benefited from is some higher level of transactional activity, particularly in the auto side with high levels of shopping that have contributed to our growth rate that may not be sustained into 2024. Similarly, on the property side, some higher levels of activity there that have contributed to strong growth. I think overall, we're really pleased with the growth that we generated in 2023. We had some tailwinds. We aren't providing guidance on 2024 at this point. We have to step back and assess where we are, and we'll do that in the first quarter. But I think strategically and from a -- from an investment standpoint, we're excited about where we're investing core lines, generative AI, investments that we're making in broadening our ecosystem and integrating other partners that add value to our customers. And we'll continue to work to offset and mitigate any of the transactional benefits that we've had in 2023.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is now open.
Andrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask a modeling one, not specific to fourth quarter 2023 necessarily. Just wanted to ask the last half decade has been a little bit of a crazy one. I think that's speaking to it lightly, a lot of moving parts where the business sits today. Is there any -- how would you kind of describe the seasonality of transaction revenue? Is there a --if we're talking about 2025/2026, is there like a typical cadence that we should expect on the non-subscription line given the makeup of the underlying businesses that comprise that? Thank you.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. The biggest component of the transaction revenue that has some seasonality to it, there's two that come to mind. One is the weather, the weather-related seasonality in property estimating solutions that on a long-term historical basis tends to occasionally get a boost in the third quarter as a function of Atlantic hurricanes last year in 2022 that happened to hit in October and fell in the fourth quarter. The other element that you saw last quarter, the securitization market can sometimes that hits in the second quarter primarily. That's a relatively small part in our business. The other elements of transactional revenue don't necessarily have a seasonal pattern to them, the life insurance services, the auto, underwriting product is more a function of their own markets.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Heather Balsky: Hey, thank you for taking my question. I was hoping you could update us on your expense program where you are today. Are there any other areas that you're identifying in terms of opportunity as we move forward? Thanks.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes, Heather, thanks for the question. Our expense program, as we highlighted in the past, I think we said sort of over 90% of the benefit is experienced in 2023. So I think of those original set of actions, we think they've largely been action that are expressing themselves in the margin expansion that you're seeing today. There is continued focus on cost efficiency at Verisk. And so we're looking in the future for opportunities based on our global talent outsourcing program and based well on investments in internal efficiency that will play out over time like the ERP program that we've talked about.
Lee Shavel: Yes. And Heather, I would say, look, we're very focused on the margin objectives that we set at Investor Day and I think we had a very good start and what we have delivered and have been realizing the benefits of that. But it's a continuous process for us and we're always going to look for where we can achieve greater efficiencies throughout the business. Elizabeth mentioned several, but as we have been able to make the business a more integrated business focused on insurance, I think we've identified some areas where we can improve both effectiveness and efficiency in the organization and we'll expect to be pursuing those in 2024 to continue that momentum.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. Seth, your line is open.
Seth Weber: Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I was interested in your comment in the prepared remarks about incremental business on the life side. I'm wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit and talk about customer appetite for more cross-selling and taking more solutions here in this environment. Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yes. So, Seth, thank you for the question. And I'm going to ask Neil to talk about where we see incremental opportunities within the life space. I think it's not only clients, but also thinking about kind of the nature of their technology, that low-code, no-code approach and its applicability more broadly here in the industry.
Neil Spector: Yes. Thanks, Lee. So our solution in life is a low-code, no-code software platform that helps a life insurer from the policy administration distribution claims from a full lifecycle. And what we've seen is even in the current environment, there is a huge need in the life industry to modernize technology. They're behind P&C as far as modernization of systems. And as Lee pointed out, because our system is a low-code, no-code, we have the opportunity to potentially lower the operating costs of deployed lines of business on our platform pretty substantially versus legacy solutions. So there's a strong incentive for life insurers to move on to these more flexible and lower cost operating environments. We've also seen a huge need from our customers in support of their transformation and that has driven some of our service or transactional revenue for our existing customers because of their desire to have us support their implementation efforts.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Surinder Thind: Thank you. Lee, could you please discuss maybe the performance in the international business, maybe what's driving growth there and how that kind of differs from the U.S. and maybe even some product plans or how you expect to kind of further offering out there.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Surinder. I'm going to appreciate that. We've been pleased with the international growth rates across the organization. I would put them into three categories. We first have our specialty business solutions, which is predominantly London-based addressing the Lloyd's or the excess and surplus market there. They continued to have success in delivering workflow and automation efficiencies through the software platform that they are -- have built and are integrating other components to. We think that's delivers a lot of value to the participants in that market, so that's been additive to our overall growth rate. On the underwriting side, we have a life, health, and travel business that has performed well, particularly coming off of the resurgence of global travel post the pandemic. Since then, it's kind of normalized, but we continue to see opportunities for that to grow. And I'm going to actually turn to Maroun Mourad, who has had several businesses internationally on the claim side to give you a sense of our experience there as well.
Maroun Mourad: Thank you, Lee. Thank you, Surinder for the question. As I may have mentioned in previous calls, we had made a decision within the international claims business to reorganize the units splitting the UK and Europe about a year ago to drive more focus and growth. And that approach and the execution of the strategy has paid dividend. I'll talk about the UK first, which is growing with speed and focus under the leadership of Chris Sawford and his team innovating on existing property, bodily injury and auto, or motor as we call it across upon solutions. And more recently, there's been a focus on the anti-fraud space within the UK. On the European side, under the leadership of Samer Abou-Jaoudé and his team, we had entered the bodily injury market through Germany a couple of years ago through the acquisition of ACTINEO as a matter of fact, I was just in Cologne where we hosted a market event attended by over 70 customers who showed greater support for the bodily injury solutions and product offering, as well as an appetite to engage more frequently with Verisk to on the motor side, where we have a few months back made the Krug acquisition on the motor side and that integration is proceeding well and delivering on plan. And last but not least, we have our Mavera acquisition in Scandinavia based out of Sweden that delivers technology solutions for the bodily injury space. And finally, from an operating model perspective, we are leveraging our position in multiple territories with single finance, human resources, marketing, legal, as well as technology platforms.
Lee Shavel: And Surinder, just to kind of put it in context, the international revenues represent about 17% of our total, as you probably would see in the investor presentation. And I think the characteristic is that this is an opportunity for us to penetrate new markets. It is diverse, as you can hear from a lot of the businesses. So we have a number of growth factors and I would end by saying a focus also on elevating our dialogue to articulate the strategic value to international institutions is part of our strategy as well. So we're happy with the progress that we're making. We continue to see that as a substantial growth opportunity for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Your line is now open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Lee you mentioned gen AI a couple of times, so -- and you highlighted improving existing product as well as launching new products using gen AI. My question there was how should we think about the monetization of gen AI? Wondering if you could give some anecdotal example of some products that are coming to the market. How should we think about monetization? Will that be offered as free or will you be charging more for gen AI? And the third last would be the timeline. How should we think about timeline for some of these product launches? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Well, thank you, Ashish. So let me give you a couple of responses to that. So first, I have to say, generative AI is something that is certainly relatively new and so there is a developing aspect to this technology and its application. And so there will be dimensions of this that we're still in the process of piloting and testing. But let me refer you back to the comments that I made around Discovery Navigator and what we are doing in the casualty space where we are already utilizing AI, including some generative AI elements in that solution. And so generative AI is a component kind of similar to traditional AI or machine learning that is a tool to help our clients gather data, consolidate and interpret and then utilize data. So as it relates to Discovery Navigator, there are some generative AI elements that are included in that, that we are in the process of monitoring by demonstrating the substantial ROIs by improving the speed with which they can gather that data from a workers' comp claim through all of those medical records. So that's in flight we have other dimensions of that in certain businesses. The second example I would give is in utilizing generative AI from a coding perspective to improve efficiency is something that we have been exploring and testing and we think there are internal efficiencies for us in adapting some of that technology. And then, finally, what is on the horizon that I referenced in speaking to our client engagement and their enthusiasm for us to developing a product is something that would be a co-pilot in an underwriting context that utilizes our data sets, our experience in supporting from an actuarial standpoint from a rating standpoint, the underwriting process that is specifically targeted to a line of business. And that is something that is on more of the front end that we are testing and developing. In the first instance, that's something that we are monetizing with Discovery Navigator in the second instance, that's something that we hope to begin to deploy so that we can achieve efficiency in our overall coding. And in the third instance that's going to be something that hopefully we develop a product. There's been a strong appetite and interest from our clients. And so if we can deliver something that would be something we would hope to begin to monetize in the 2024/2025 timeframe based upon what our product development is. So a range of that, but it's a component of and an additional tool to a lot of the data and analytics work that we do.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your final question comes from the line of Russell Quelch with Redburn. Russell, your line is open.
Russell Quelch: Yes. Thanks for circling back around and sorry for the technology issues. I was wondering if you would provide us with the growth rate for the extreme events solutions revenues in Q3 and year-to-date. And you made some brief comments in your prepared remarks, Elizabeth, but can you expand on what trends you saw there in Q3 and maybe what you're seeing so far in Q4, and wondering what you've assumed for your -- in your full-year guidance for Q4 in this business area?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Hey Russell, glad you're able to join us. Sorry, we don't provide specific disclosure on the extreme events business and certainly not quarterly. So sorry I can't comment on that.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-08-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Verisk Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded, and currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today’s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session where we will limit participants to one question so that we can allow everyone time to ask a question. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk’s Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Abby, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk’s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today’s earnings release, I will remind everyone today’s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk’s future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I’d like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today’s earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other non-recurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning and thank you for participating in today’s call. I am excited to be with you today to provide an update on how our strategy, focus and results-oriented culture is translating into strong financial performance for Verisk. I will leave the details of the financial results to Elizabeth. But in summary, Verisk delivered continued business momentum in the second quarter, underscored by strong organic revenue growth and solid margin expansion, translating into double-digit profit growth. We are driving these results by focusing on our client’s most pressing needs as they deal with an environment marked by elevated underwriting losses, including those from catastrophes and high levels of inflation, leading to pressure on profitability. We have elevated the conversation and directed our sales focus to the solutions in our portfolio best suited to solve those challenges. Our byproduct of the tough operating environment is a hardening of the insurance market as carriers are taking rate actions to help drive improved profitability, leading to stronger net written premium growth. Rate takes time to work through, so we expect this environment to persist into 2024. The cross currents of elevated underwriting losses and increasing pricing in the insurance industry has become a hot topic across the press with headlines about trouble spots like Florida and California. Specific to Florida, since our last update, there has been little change as we have not seen any additional liquidations, though uncertainty remains. We continue to watch the market carefully, particularly as we head into the Atlantic hurricane season. We are also keeping a keen eye out for new financial stability ratings for the Florida market, which we expect in the next few weeks and could identify further deterioration in the market. Recent legislative reforms in the property market are expected to have a positive impact, but it may take some time for that to materialize. In California, current regulation restricts insurers from using catastrophe models and ratemaking, but the Department of Insurance is exploring a change to that policy. To that end, Verisk recently testified in front of the California State Assembly, joint hearing, insurance and emergency management as the expert on catastrophe models and how their use can help insurers assess risk from low frequency, high severity events like wildfires, ultimately benefiting the residents and businesses in the state. This is a great example of our enhanced industry engagement as we leverage our expertise to benefit all the players in the insurance ecosystem, including carriers and regulators and build resilience for consumers and businesses. As I discussed at Investor Day and on prior calls, a key pillar in our strategy is elevating and strengthening the strategic dialogue with our clients. To that end, I had the opportunity in the second quarter to visit with many of our clients in the U.S. to understand their focus and explore how we can better support their objectives. These conversations generated several initiatives for expanded dialogue with C-suite support to accelerate opportunities on technology and data initiatives, particularly regarding inflationary impacts. During a visit to Europe, I encountered similar opportunities with our clients there, as well as exceptional energy and focus at Verisk offices in London, Malaga, Cracow and Cologne. The message that we hear is very similar across industry participants, large and small, U.S. and international. We welcome Verisk’s expertise in partnership to drive more automation, lower our investment cost and improve efficiency. Given our mission-critical data, deep customer relationships and engagement and scale, no one is better positioned to meet this need than Verisk. A key extension of our conversations with our clients is our innovation agenda. We are listening to our customers and designing solutions to meet their most pressing needs. For example, we recently launched a new solution for carriers, contractors and adjusters within our property estimating solutions called XactXpert. XactXpert is a no-code, low-code cloud-based rules engine designed to streamline the insurance restoration and claims estimation process. XactXpert targets the key challenges our clients face, including inaccurate and incomplete information and claims estimates, high compliance needs, pressure to reduce cycle times, revisions, loss adjustment expenses and a need for more digital and simplified processes for a changing workforce demographic. Further, it empowers carriers, contractors and adjusters to customize organizational estimating behaviors, delivering quick, accurate claims estimation by reducing manual input errors and driving consistency, accuracy and efficiency throughout the claims estimating process. We are seeing strong interest from our customers for this newly launched solution. In our anti-fraud solutions, we recently launched Image Forensics, an AI tool designed to detect fraud in digital images submitted as part of the claims settlement process. Image used in claims processing has grown exponentially with more and more images being submitted directly by the claimant. In fact, just since mid-2020, photo estimates for auto claim settlement have doubled and while virtual claims processing is driving industry efficiency and customer satisfaction, it has also exposed insurers to an increasing source of fraud from activities like reusing prior loss images using Internet images or digital or document manipulation. We are leveraging the depth and breadth of our customer’s relationships in building a contributory image database, combining it with images sourced from Verisk’s property estimating solutions databases to provide images in match reports and indications if an image was used in a prior loss. Image Forensics is also a great example of how our innovation engine is now actively associating data sets that were previously siloed into powerful new tools for our customers as this tool combines data from anti-fraud with data from property estimating solutions. I know that generative AI has been top of mind for many. At Verisk, we have been using artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing in many of our solutions for some time. For example, our Mozart Forms Composer uses machine learning and natural language processing to help insurers organize, track, edit and analyze insurance policy forms with greater consistency, efficiency and speed. This tool employs advanced technology to digitize a historically document-driven process and addresses a major pain point for our clients, managing the complex and growing problem of analyzing policy language across multiple lines and states, while enhancing their ability to customize policy language more quickly. With regard to generative AI, we are currently testing private versions of generative AI and are making an index of possible use cases focused on both customer-facing solutions and internal efficiency opportunities. We are working in partnership with our customers and state regulators to ensure that we are approaching this innovative technology with a focus on ethical use in fairness. Finally, I would like to formally welcome Samantha Vaughan to Verisk as our Chief Privacy Officer. Data governance and stewardship have always been a key focus for Verisk and Vaughan will lead the oversight and enhancement of our policies to protect the data entrusted to Verisk and will help ensure the integrity of Verisk’s data practices, regulation and compliance. In addition to the focus and dedicated privacy leadership, our new privacy officer expands on the thought leadership Verisk is providing across the insurance industry. As technology and data capabilities expand, the privacy risks expand as well. Concerns about AI, data risk management and security, all have a key nexus in privacy and we are glad to be joining the best-in-class companies that articulate a values-based approach to the privacy office.  With that, I will hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Lee, and good morning to everyone on the call. I am pleased to share that Verisk delivered strong second quarter financial results. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $675 million, up 10% versus the prior year and income from continuing operations was $204 million, up 18% versus the prior year, reflecting strong growth across both underwriting and claims. Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.35, up 9% versus the prior year. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, our operating results demonstrated strong and broad-based growth from most of our businesses, aided by some in-period transactional benefits. In the second quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.8% and with growth of 9.3% in underwriting and 11.2% in claims. This quarter’s result was boosted by certain transactional revenues that we do not expect to repeat in the back half of the year. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 79% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 9.1% on an OCC basis. We saw contributions across nearly all of our subscription offerings. More specifically on the drivers of growth in subscription revenues, during the quarter, we experienced the continued benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net prem -- net written premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflected in some of our contract pricing. In anti-fraud, we are driving accelerated growth from the successful conversion to subscription from previously transactional customers through our claims essential bundle. And in property estimating solutions, we continue to benefit from strong contractor subscription growth as contractors are realizing the value of being part of the Verisk network, particularly with the active weather patterns we are undergoing. In fact, according to Verisk’s Property Claim Services, PCS, in 70-plus years of history, this was the most active first half of the year on record from a weather event perspective, dominated by hail, wind and thunderstorms. Finally, liquidations and consolidation across the industry was lower than historic average during the quarter, but we continue to anticipate some normalization in the second half of the year. Our transactional revenues representing 21% of total revenue in the second quarter, grew 12.4% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth for the second consecutive quarter was from our auto solutions, driven by increased rate shopping by consumers and the continuation of a large non-rate action deal with a national insurer that we told you about last quarter. Our trends are reflective of those noted by recent J.D. Power data, which pointed to a 13% increase in shopping activity for auto insurance in the second quarter as consumers react to rate increases. However, J.D. Power also noted that carrier switching increased a much more modest 4%, which may suggest a potential slowing of the market going forward.  In addition to gains in auto, our transactional revenue growth also benefited from double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. And within our extreme events business, we saw a very strong transactional growth related to securitization, as the second quarter marked a record for new issuance in the catastrophe bond market. I will remind you that the catastrophe bond market is seasonal and we do not expect this level of activity to continue in the second half of 2023. These transactional results also included some one-time benefits, including overage charges on specific large underwriting contracts that renewed in the quarter.  Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.6% in the second quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on the strong revenue growth and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objectives. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results was 54.1%, up 160 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. On a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the second quarter margin expanded 140 basis points from margins of 52.7% in Q2 2022. The margin rate in any given quarter can be influenced by the revenue mix, leading to a seasonal pattern in our margins. As such, we think it’s helpful to look at our margins on a trailing 12-month basis [Technical Difficulty] within the second quarter were 53.1% on a trailing 12-month basis, up 140 basis points over the prior period.  The year-over-year change in the second quarter margin reflects the impact of certain one-time expenses in the prior year quarter, as well as strong cost and operational discipline and the impact of our cost reduction program. This was offset in part by higher levels of performance-based compensation, including commissions related to our stronger year-to-date performance, as well as a decrease in our pension credit, negative margin impact from recent acquisitions and higher T&E expenses. Reflecting on our ongoing cost reduction plans, we continue to run the margin targets that we articulated in our 2023 guidance and at Investor Day in mid-March. Continuing down the income statement. Net interest expense was $31.6 million for the second quarter, compared to $31.9 million in the prior year. With the divestitures now behind us, the proceeds from the sales directed to our $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan and the long-term capital structure now in place, we now expect this current level of net interest expense to be at a similar quarterly run rate for the remainder of the year. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 23.8%, compared to 19.2% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year change in the tax rate is related to lower stock compensation benefits in this quarter versus the prior year’s period. Going forward, we still expect the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the originally guided range of 23% to 25%. Adjusted net income increased 8.5% to $219.8 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 18.9% to $1.51 for the second quarter 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by a higher tax rate. With regard to the share count, we received the vast majority of the shares from the $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan when we entered into the plan back in March, and while we did not make any repurchases in the second quarter, we do have the ability to repurchase some additional shares outside of the ASR, and we may do so in the future. From a cash flow perspective, net cash from operating activities increased 48% to $193 million due to strong operations and a decrease in cash taxes paid. The decrease in taxes paid is primarily related to the non-recurring gain on the three disposition in the prior year quarter. Though there was also a one-time cash tax payment of $17 million paid in the second quarter of 2023 related to the energy divestiture. I will remind you that the prior year cash flow metrics include the results from previously divested businesses. Turning to guidance. Given our strong half -- strong first half performance, as well as the contribution from recent acquisitions, we are increasing our financial outlook for 2023. We have posted a summary of all guidance measures in the earnings deck on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Specifically, for 2023, we now expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.63 billion to $2.66 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margins to be in the range of 53% to 54%. Walking further down the P&L, we still expect fixed asset D&A to be between $175 million and $195 million, and intangible amortization to be approximately $70 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to currency variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity.  Regarding capital expenditures, we now expect CapEx to be between $220 million and $240 million, reflecting increases associated with recent acquisitions, as well as our continued focus on investing organically behind our highest return on investment opportunities. These include a modernization of our forms, rules and loss costs, a migration of our extreme events platform to a cloud-native architecture and further investments across our growth businesses. We are also investing in an upgrade of our financial and human capital system that will enable future efficiencies once implemented. As previously communicated, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, bringing adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5.50 to $5.70. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited about the opportunity ahead and our ability to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry. Verisk is best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity because of our scale and expertise. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, deep customer relationships and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is a formula that we are confident will also deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I will ask the Operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the outlook for the back half on sales. I know that both this quarter and last quarter, you ring fenced some items that, you articulated were potentially one-time. But it seems like guidance implies at the high end 7.5% revenue growth versus you did 10% organic sales in the first half. Is it those items tapering off, do you have a different outlook for the environment? Could it really helpful to reconcile how you did in the first half and your expectation for the back half?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Heather, thanks for the question. We have been very happy in the first half that we have been kind of firing on all cylinders. We have a diversified business within the insurance space and we have called out a number of different environmental or industry factors where the revenue growth in the first half may not be sustained into the second half. And so for those -- just to reiterate them, I think, there’s no fewer than six different factors that have contributed to the strength in the first half. To go through those, there has been low attrition and consolidation in the industry, which has the potential to renormalize in the second half of the year and in the future. Second, the level of auto shopping activity driving transactional volume in our auto insurance business, they moderate. Third, the level of weather activity has been elevated in the first half, although no specific catastrophe events and also related to weather is the fact that there was obviously a large hurricane in the fourth quarter of last year. So that will create a difficult comp in the fourth quarter. Fourth on the list of reasons for strength. In our anti-fraud business, we have been driving strong growth by converting transactional customers to subscription in our claims essential bundle. We will start to lap that benefit, which started roughly this time last year. Fifth, we talked about the securitizations and the strength of the ILS market, which was elevated in the second quarter and we don’t expect that to continue. And then, lastly, we had called out various technical items like billing catch-ups or overages and the extra business day in the quarter. All of those have been contributing to the 9.8% and revenue growth, which has been above our long-term sustainable 6% to 8% target and may not continue in the second half.
Lee Shavel: And Heather, if I can put a wrapper around the detail that Elizabeth provided, you asked the question initially in terms of a sales dynamic in the second half. And as Elizabeth was describing, these really aren’t sales-related elements, they are more environmental factors that contributed to a strong first half that we think are likely to moderate in the second half where we can’t have confidence that they will continue to reoccur. So there’s nothing that we see that this is predominantly sales driven. It is more environmental.
Heather Balsky: Appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the prior question. As you think about the normalization of trends in the external environment, acknowledging that the internal execution has been relatively stable and strong. When would you expect that normalization? How would you expect the subscription and transaction revenue performance to normalize in the coming quarters? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yeah. So, George, thanks for the question. I mean, I will start off by saying that I think implicit if you go through all of those details that Elizabeth has gone through, it’s difficult to predict what that is going to happen. I think the sense is, there is probably some reversion to mean in the ILS market. We had a strong second quarter. It’s not -- typically, you see that from quarter-to-quarter, but it’s difficult to predict. The shopping activity is one where we are seeing some early trends, but that’s going to depend upon macroeconomic factors. So I don’t think that, given the nature of that and its particular strength on the transactional side, we are in a position to estimate or predict when that’s likely to moderate or simply taking a more conservative point of view around the impact in the second half.
George Tong: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. I was hoping to revisit kind of an older question about net written premiums. I know it has less of effect on Verisk pricing, but it’s still part of the Verisk pricing. And looking back to 2021 and 2022, those were strong growth years for net written premiums for the U.S. P&C Insurance industry and I just wanted to get a sense with the two-year lag that I think is typical for a contract. How much is that helping this year’s organic revenue growth?
Elizabeth Mann: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. It is helping this year’s revenue growth and we are looking back to 2021 on our 2023 contract. I think we have previously called out that was a 9.6% net written premium growth across the industry. And as I called out, the factors of strength in our subscription growth that and the strength in our forms, rules and loss cost business has probably been the largest contributor to our subscription growth.
Lee Shavel: And Andrew, to add a little bit of context around that. As Elizabeth described, it has been a benefit, but there are also, I think, the impact of inflation is clearly driving some of that net written premium. We are also seeing the benefit of a hardening market within the insurance as a whole. But the other element is, because of inflation, our costs are going up, that gives us a little bit more scope on the pricing side and we are also continuing to add value to those products, which particularly in this environment with insurance industry focused on improving their efficiency. We have been able in a number of areas to deliver substantial value on that front given those pressures and that -- those elements are probably a larger factor than the pure net written premium. I think we estimate that the portion of our revenues that has some exposure to that is in the 15% to 20% type of range.
Andrew Steinerman: Perfect. Thanks, Lee. Thanks, Elizabeth.
Operator: We will take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I am going to ask a question that’s sort of a compilation of the prior three. When you think about the sort of abnormal items or one-time items that have been benefiting. I think most of those seem to impact the non-subscription business. A couple of them seem to apply to subscription. But I guess when you think about the non -- the traditional like subscription business, is it the pricing or is it the low attrition, like, what’s happening the biggest impact and maybe if you think about the net written premium growth in 2022 versus 2021, how should we be thinking about that with regard to pricing in 2024? Thanks.
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Toni. Yeah. So on the subscription growth side, I would call out kind of the top three drivers to the strong subscription growth. The first is across the forms, rules and loss cost business, and that includes both the pricing dynamic that we talked about, as well as the low historical industry liquidations or consolidation. The second biggest factor -- the second biggest contributor to growth in subscriptions has been the anti-fraud business, particularly with the transition from the previously transactional customers to the claims essential bundle that has been adding to subscription growth. And then third, on the property, estimating solutions, subscription growth has been strong this quarter, driven by continued contractor usage and as well as insurance carrier usage, given the weather events. So those have been the main drivers of subscription growth. It is broad-based. It is not just a pricing dynamic. I think that’s fair to say. Moving to your question about net written premium and 2022, the Verisk review of the 2022 net written premiums is not yet published, but the A.M. Best data came out recently. It showed 8.4% of net written premium growth across the U.S. P&C industry. That’s in line with the preliminary Verisk data that we have quoted previously. So that is a positive tailwind. On the other hand, as Lee highlighted, some of the challenges on inflation and profitability, the A.M. Best data also shows a 15% increase in losses with overall combined ratios above 100%. So that points to the challenges facing the carriers, and the difficulty and profitability for which many of our solutions and products are designed to help them address.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Operator: We will take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. I just had a question on the margins. I know you reiterated the number. I was just hoping you could give us an update on how much of the long-term kind of cost actions have been taken, as you did last quarter. And I was just curious, the talk on gen AI and then I think you had CapEx going up as well. Is that -- I mean, if you have to spend more on that, does that change your perhaps range of margin outcomes thinking a couple of years out?
Elizabeth Mann: Yeah. Thanks, Manav, for the question. A couple of comments on the margins. I think as we have highlighted before, I think, we said that about 90% of the cost actions would be seen within the run rate in 2023, so we are largely working through that. I think that as we look -- we have called out previously some of the investments kind of on the business side, maybe just to give some color for the quarter, the M&A has been probably a 40-basis-point headwind for the quarter from recent acquisitions. The investments that we are doing in the business on the cloud side, as well as the ERP investments and the renormalization of T&E, all add up to about 90-basis-point headwind for the quarter. And then finally, as a non-operating item, the pension has been a 50-basis-point headwind for the quarter. Going forward in terms of investment in technology, look, we continue -- our margin targets continue to support as they have been already our investments in technology. To the extent, as Lee highlighted, we are in early days on reviewing some of the opportunities with our clients and some new opportunities opened up with gen AI. So to the extent we learn more, we will come back to you on that in the future.
Lee Shavel: Yeah. And I would just add, I think, on a lot of those investment opportunities, they are more CapEx driven than OpEx driven at this point. And we have given you our targets that we are very focused on achieving, while at the same time, continuing to maintain the necessary investment, both in OpEx and CapEx to make certain that we are delivering on our top priority, which is organic growth in the business.
Operator: We will take our next question from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Greg Peters: Good morning, Lee, Elizabeth and Stacey. I am going to focus my question on the transactional revenue component. And I am curious if there is a reporting lag and some of your transactional revenue. For example, you called out the benefit from auto in the second quarter yet. We are seeing some of the large auto insurance companies really cut back in their marketing expenses in their second quarter results. And would it be appropriate for us to match property transactional revenue with either PCS events and/or hurricane activity, because you called that out in one of your answers? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: So, Greg, thanks for the question. I will take kind of the first half. And I would say, first, we have a lot of complex factors in the overall financial reported results. The marketing dimension is being reflected in weaker performance in our Verisk Marketing Solutions and so I think we are experiencing that. The shopping activity, however, does generate some offsetting revenue as people are exploring potential rate opportunities that are out there. On the homeowners, I think there are so many different products that react in different ways to the dynamics. It’s hard to tie them to a single metric. And I would also just make a comment that, the activity in auto is really being driven right now by consumer activity rather than carrier activity at this point. So, hopefully, it’s not a -- probably a satisfying answer, but it’s very difficult to tie the performance -- the financial performance in a broad sense to kind of specific leading indicators on the auto side, it’s just too many factors going on.
Greg Peters: Understand. It’s intrigued [ph] question. Thanks for the time.
Lee Shavel: Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Appreciate you taking the question. Lee, I continue to be intrigued by some of the conversations around moving up into the C-suite and perhaps sort of expanding the scope of your relationships with some of the carriers given relatively low sort of share of net written premium. Can you just talk about a little bit how you think that will affect the long-term trajectory of your revenue growth and if that’s still a benefit sort of yet to come over the next several years?
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you very much for the question, Andrew. And it has been something that I have emphasized across the enterprise. And we have really been pleasantly surprised at the receptivity that we have had at that level where I don’t think we had really prosecuted that dialogue as effectively or in a coordinated fashion as we probably should have. And this -- in the past two weeks, I have had conversations at the CEO level with three executives of our -- of large clients or partners of ours, actually four over the past three weeks. And in one instance, it was very clear, the CEO was focused on the impact of climate change on their business model over the long-term and they asked us to come in and give a broader perspective on what we see in terms of the impact of the longer term model and how we see that potentially impacting their underwriting decisions within geographies. So tying together some of our underwriting benchmark and analysis with our longer term weather trends. That’s an opportunity for us to tie together some of our data sets and analytics. In another conversation, there was a focus around some of the regulatory challenges on rate approval. So it was an opportunity for us to deliver some of our expertise around non-rate actions to enable the carriers to realize some lift on the rate side. And in the third instance, there was a recognition that the client was facing some technology and process challenges as they were trying to move their organization forward where we could lend some technical support in building and helping them build technology that meets their client needs more effectively. And in each of those, I think, it opened up opportunities for us to tie our data sets together to deliver an integrated product. And the other dynamic is that, I think, when you have that support at the C-suite rather than us pushing product up within the organization, you have a mandate that motivates and energizes that client if we can demonstrate real value. And I think we are really just at the early stages of that as we find opportunities to address these broader needs that then can be expanded to new industry solutions across the -- across all of our client sets. So at this stage, I think, what you are seeing in our performance is some beneficial environment, the focus within certain of our businesses, energy released by some of our organizational changes, but I think we are still at a very early stage in expanding and opening a more strategic relationship and partnership with our clients.
Andrew Jeffrey: Very thorough. Thanks.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeff Silber: Thank you so much. Elizabeth, I think, you called out about a half a dozen items that you think may not recur in the second half of the year. I know it may be difficult to quantify the impact on that. But is it possible to quantify the impact those items had either in the first half of the year or maybe just the past quarter?
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks for the question, Jeff. Yeah. We haven’t quantified kind of the components of each of these. I would say two things. As I have listed out factors on contributing to subscription and transactional growth. Those have been in order of magnitude to help you size them up. And the other point, we have a rough rule of thumb of calling out kind of one-time events that are -- that contribute more than 1% to revenue growth, none of these single factors hit that threshold.
Lee Shavel: And I would say…
Jeff Silber: Okay.
Lee Shavel: …you can certainly see some of the outperformance relative to our long-term targets and so some significant portion of that delta reflects those one-time elements, otherwise, they would be part of our normal operating cost. So I think it gives you some kind of sense of the scale of the impact of some of these.
Jeff Silber: Okay. Great. That’s helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.
Andrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to circle back on marketing solutions. I think you called out in the prepared remarks or in the slide deck that you continue to see some pressure there and new customer acquisition spend is low amongst the carriers. Any signs of moderation there, it does seem like, in general, they continue to pull back. I think the expectation previously was that was going to improve in the second half. Just wondering what kind of the latest temperature check is there and what’s kind of baked into guidance in terms of a recovery?
Lee Shavel: Yeah. And -- thank you, Andrew. I think you are reading the situation correctly. The carriers are pulling back on marketing expense, largely driven by uncertainty around whether they can underwrite profitably within certain markets or product lines and that is having an effect -- it had an effect for us in the first half and based upon what we are seeing, we do expect that effect to continue in the second half for that business. It’s a small part of our business. But I want to come back and emphasize that there’s clearly shopping appetite. As consumers naturally are seeing higher rates, there is a desire to find a more competitive alternative to what they have currently and so that latent energy is there. I think we expect over time that as the regulators approve some of the rate increases and we are seeing some positive signs on that as we alluded to in some of our earlier comments that, that will give us a greater opportunity to support our carriers and our clients with that marketing analysis. But one thing I want to emphasize that longer term, the demand from our clients were sophisticated analytics around how are they -- who is looking to shop for insurance in an online context, what are they looking for, how can we deliver the right product at the right time is something that they are strategically committed to and we see a broad and growing opportunity to continue to serve that, notwithstanding some of the marketing headwinds that we are experiencing in the industry.
Andrew Nicholas: Understood. Thanks, Lee.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey. Good morning, everyone. I maybe scrutinizing the guidance change a little bit too much, but just a quick question about the margin. When I look at the change in guidance on before in revenue and on EBITDA, it seems like the incremental margins you are implying here are at the midpoint in the low 40s and even at the high end only 50%. So, again, this may be just like some of the, like, a number thing, but I am just wondering why the incremental margins on the outperformance would be lower than your overall margins? Is it performance-based payments, is it incremental investing or is it just the mix of business?
Elizabeth Mann: Yeah. Thanks, Alex. Good question. One is they are each ranges, so there is some range there. But I would say, in general, there’s a couple of different things. One is the M&A, the incremental M&A that’s been added since we gave guidance. Obviously, as we have talked about the pattern where our recent acquisitions typically have lower margins than our existing business. Some of it -- yeah, there’s a little bit of business mix across the full year. There is -- there are incentive-based payments based on the strong performance in the year-to-date. And in general, there’s some seasonality in our margins. But finally, also there is -- as we talked about before, there’s investment over the course of the year as we look to balance efficient operation with also our goals for long-term sustainable growth.
Alex Kramm: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Russell Quelch with Redburn. Your line is open.
Russell Quelch: Hi. [Technical Difficulty]
Lee Shavel: I am sorry. Operator, we can -- it’s not legible or we are not able to hear what the analysts are saying.
Operator: Sir, yes, we have a very garbled connection. If you could try reconnecting and rejoining the queue, please?
Russell Quelch: Sure. Is that better now?
Operator: It is. Thank you.
Russell Quelch: Thank you. Apologies for that and thank you for having me on. So the question was, could you give us the H1 revenue numbers for the marketing business, the ES [ph] business and the life insurance and the international businesses so we can assess you versus the numbers that you gave at the Investor Day earlier in this year. And also, I wondered if you might consider increasing disclosure going forward so we can better assess the growth in the business, now it’s solely an insurance business? Thank you.
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks for the question, Russell. Yeah. We don’t give that level of disclosure at the moment on our businesses. The Investor Day was to give a long-term -- a sense of our long-term overall portfolio and was more disclosure than we have ever given in the past. So we will take your feedback on that and consider it.
Russell Quelch: Okay. It was worth a try. And then just a quick follow-up on the revenue to CapEx. I appreciate that’s higher than most of your peers and I heard you talk earlier about incremental investment from a CapEx perspective for AI. I wondered if you would be willing to take that revenue to CapEx ratio over 10% if you were to see a great opportunity to invest in AI opportunities in the next couple of years?
Elizabeth Mann: So thanks for the question. In terms of CapEx as a percent of revenue, again, we have talked about it, that’s not a metric that we target. What we target is strong returns on invested capital for our capital deployment. But if you are benchmarking against our peers, there’s two things that you have to keep in mind in terms of CapEx as a percent of revenue. One is our very high margins, which would make the CapEx as a percent of revenue skewed and maybe we should look at CapEx as a percent of EBITDA or free cash flow. The second point is that our R&D is very low, just given the way that we classify items. And so you should look at CapEx plus R&D, and on that basis, you would get to a more normalized level. As to kind of where we would take it, I think at Investor Day, I pointed to a similar range of sort of high single digits area and we continue to assess what the opportunity is and what’s the best way to create value for shareholders.
Russell Quelch: Okay. Good stuff. Thanks for that and apologies for the connection issues.
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Russell.
Operator: And we will take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to drill down further on the new product innovation. Lee, you mentioned several new products that were launched in the quarter that are gaining traction with customers. I was wondering how do you track those KPIs internally and is there anything that you can share externally on how we can track the success that you are having with this new Verisk initiative and the new product innovation over the near-term, but also over the next three years to five years? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Ashish. I think given the scale of these and that they are deeply embedded, this is something where I think we will continue to describe anecdotally our success and what we -- our traction with clients around these. But it’s at a level of detail, and certainly, at this stage, isn’t a significant financial impact and so we won’t be providing specific items around that. But I think they reflect a few of a larger portfolio of investments that we make across the business that over time we expect can be contributors to perhaps tie it to other innovations that we have made are LightSpeed suite of products is an example of where we identified a need, we developed an application and now that has been a significant contributor to growth as we have been able to help our clients grow their or improve their ability to deliver a bindable quote on an accelerated basis. So there are throughout the organization, a large portfolio of these opportunities. It’s not limited to the two or three that I have described and so it’s probably an overwhelming level of detail to kind of share all of that with you. But it’s a fundamental part of our process of finding ways to add value for all of our clients.
Ashish Sabadra: Okay. That’s great color. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we will take our next question from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Stephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your strategy within Europe for your international business, maybe you could touch on how organic growth is trending, also your thoughts on any kind of acquisitions or that could help you kind of further gain critical mass going forward? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Stephanie. And the international opportunity for us is one that we pursue in -- with a couple of approaches. And I will start with kind of the natural inclination to see if we can build off of the product sets that we have in the U.S. So there are a variety of underwriting products, for instance, in our participation product, our core lines forms, rules and loss cost businesses, where international buyers see interest in that data and that information and so we have been able to penetrate that market in delivering that product set. We also have claims products that we have developed specific to those international markets. So that is the first stage of our international approach. In addition, as you can imagine, we have made a number of acquisitions in international markets that represent the -- our ability to deliver similar services that we can add value to either by providing additional capital, leveraging our network of relationships, adding technology expertise or improving the efficiency that accelerates the penetration of that marketplace. And then the third element is to be able to tie those together in order to create more composite value or to create a stronger ecosystem. And there, I would point to our specialty business solutions that is a combination and an integration of our original Sequel acquisition with acquisitions like Whitespace, Ignite, Rulebook and most recently Morning Data that is serving the non-standard market or the London market with a broadening and increasingly integrated sets of products that allows us to serve the insurance industry more effectively. So though each of those are elements that we are pursuing in that international dimension. In a broad sense, we have generally been experiencing double-digit growth rates for our international business as a whole, reflecting contributions from all of those. In some cases, we have a life and health travel that has been growing at a high rate as the global travel industry has recovered post-COVID, that’s beginning to normalize and we have other businesses that are automating or augmenting traditional functions in the claims side. Those are some of the businesses that we recently acquired in Germany and in Sweden. And we continue to have success in the U.K. in serving both the general insurance market, as well as the London non-standard excess and surplus market. So there are a lot of elements, but we generally view the international markets as areas where we can bring our expertise and we can augment existing InsurTech players that are effectively serving the industry there.
Stephanie Moore: Great. I appreciate all the color.
Operator: We will take our next question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you and good morning. So I wanted to talk about the sales growth acceleration. You cited basically environmental factors that have accelerated your growth. But you have also talked about innovation, better dialogue and partnership with your customers. So it seems like the financial impact of that represents more upside over time, but curious how you think about the return on the innovation and some of the cultural things that you are doing. Is that something that you think accelerates that growth by allowing for pricing, improving retention, cross-selling, et cetera.? Has your thinking evolved just over the last few months since you gave your long-term outlook?
Lee Shavel: Yeah. So, Faiza, thanks. There’s a lot rolled up in that question. So I am going to take -- give it the best crack I can here. I think the essence of your question is, as we have come about a year from our exits from the non-insurance businesses and we have described our ambitions for what we can do more broadly with the industry as our culture has evolved, becoming more focused around insurance, do we remain confident that the growth opportunity that we described at Investor Day remains in place? And I think the short answer is yes. We have been really happy with the level of engagement from our clients. I have been very happy with the feeling I have had within the organization of our configuration as an insurance-focused entity. I think that we are putting more energy into looking at how we can tie our data sets and our products together to serve the industry more broadly. And I think that’s also improved the energy around innovating for the industry and we have been focused on how do we do that not only from a bottoms-up standpoint with ideas from our employee base, which are often at the closest to the products and how we add value to those for the benefit of our clients and our ability to realize the commercial benefit, as well as now integrating, I think, stronger input from the top down to make certain that in those conversations with our clients when we have identified an opportunity to address their needs by tying things together that we are productizing that and we are delivering something not just for that client, but something that we can roll out to the industry as a whole. At the core, our economic value proposition is driven by an ability to invest in and develop a solution or an analytic that can serve not just one client, but the industry as a whole, and so our ability to generate to rapidly monetize strong return on that investment and serving as an effective utility for the industry is quite powerful. And so I think everything that we have seen so far is a validation of what our thesis was. And I think we are also reassured that our investors are seeing the results. At an early stage, there’s a lot to build upon and so we are hopeful we will be able to continue to execute against that dynamic.
Faiza Alwy: Great. Thanks, Lee. Appreciate it.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s call. We thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-05-03 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk First Quarter 2023 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Verisk Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar : Thank you, Mandeep, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2023 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com.  However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain/loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel : Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, and thank you for participating in today's call. At our Investor Day in mid-March, we detailed the benefits of being an insurance-focused business and our comprehensive strategy to drive consistent, predictable growth at Verisk. Our first quarter results demonstrate the sharpened focus and results-oriented operating plan at Verisk. We are operating on a more integrated basis across the company and have been more engaged with our clients, as I'll describe in greater detail. I will leave it to Elizabeth to walk through the details of the financials. But in summary, we delivered very strong organic revenue growth combined with solid margin expansion yielding double-digit profit growth. The growth was broad-based with most businesses contributing to the result, and we have strong business momentum. We delivered this performance despite a macroeconomic environment marked by high inflation, interest rate volatility and market anxiety. Specific to the insurance industry, our customers are coming off a year marked by elevated underwriting losses and pressure on profitability. In fact, the U.S. property casualty insurers experienced a $27 billion net underwriting loss in 2022, the largest loss since 2011, according to industry data collected by Verisk and the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. Moreover, profitability was under pressure as reflected in deteriorating combined ratios at 103% in 2022 versus almost 100% in 2021. One consequence of this tough loss in profitability environment in 2022 has been a hardening insurance market where rate increases are driving faster net written premium growth in the first quarter reports of many major insurers. Verisk is partnering with the industry to help them reduce costs, better select and price risk, root out fraud and overall operate more efficiently, given the macro environment. One problem area has been the state of Florida. As we have discussed in prior calls, the insurance crisis in Florida is being driven by a litigious environment, further complicated by extreme event vulnerability. The combined impact is pushing insurers into insolvency. The state legislature has passed reforms to address the crisis, and there are currently efforts be negotiated to bring increased oversight to the state's insurance market. That said, the risk for more liquidations remains. And we continue to monitor both the primary and reinsurance markets closely while leaning in with our customers to help them adapt to new legislation, to better select and price risk in the state and to identify the systemic bad actors in the market. A second area of challenge has been auto underwriting as insurers pulled back on writing new policies as they awaited regulatory approval for rate increases. Rate actions have started to roll through. And in the first quarter, we saw a rebound in policyholder shopping activity in response to higher rates, driving strong transactional revenue growth for Verisk this quarter. That said, we have yet to see behavior change on the part of the underwriters as they are still cautious about spending on marketing and underwriting new policies. We continue to expect that improvement in the back half of the year. One key pillar in our strategy that we discussed at Investor Day is being a more client-centric organization and the importance of strengthening the strategic dialogue with our clients and intensifying our industry engagement. To that end, I've been leading the organization with direct client engagement through full relationship reviews at several of our largest clients where we've been able to identify how we can best serve them and integrate new solutions to meet their specific objectives. I've also hosted our first CEO roundtable, where we brought together the leaders of our clients to discuss the issues that are foremost in their minds and where we can leverage our centrality and expertise to help address these issues. This has been followed by a client Chief Information Officer roundtable, where we brought our technology leadership headed by our CIO, Nick Daffan; and Chief Data Officer, Eric Schneider, to discuss technology and analytics trends that are on the minds of insurance industry CIOs. In particular, generative AI was a hot topic. And we discussed how we can help the industry develop safe, ethical and effective use cases and guide policy. Our clients are recognizing the early benefits of change and focus at Verisk and have provided great feedback. A recent quote from an important client stated, I can't remember a meeting with this degree of transparent dialogue where I felt like Verisk was listening. Our recent NPS scores also reflect this change in perception. Verisk conducts customer relationship surveys twice a year. And our recent NPS scores in the first quarter of 2023 were 47, up 4 points versus this time last year. Further, so far this year, we have hosted 3 in-person client events. At all our events, clients can engage with our solutions and hear directly from those clients who use the products in the market and learn how effective they are in helping solve industry challenges. More specifically, in February, our claims business hosted 2 events, including Elevate, our signature event for claims and restoration professionals, which provided educational and networking sessions for over 600 industry professionals. We also hosted almost 300 industry participants at IFM, an industry-wide event targeting the latest issues and advances in fraud management. In the U.S. alone, insurance fraud is estimated to cost the industry $300 billion annually, impacting industry profitability, and Verisk is uniquely positioned to help the industry. We host this event in partnership with the National Insurance Crime Bureau. Both events included expert panel discussions featuring our clients and partners, leading academics and thought leaders in the industry covering top-of-mind issues. In April, we hosted the inaugural Verisk Insurance Conference and hosted almost 600 clients for a 4-day multitrack conference designed to deliver a combination of product and thought leadership-focused content to key extreme events, life and underwriting decision-makers in insurance and reinsurance. This comprehensive event, which combined 3 previously separate events, enabled us to educate our clients and prospects about Verisk's end-to-end capabilities while continuing to provide them with valuable content applicable to their specific role in organization. It raised the awareness of the breadth and depth of solutions we offer to solve the industry's biggest challenges and really highlighted the benefits of the integrated Verisk approach. We saw a great response to this event with almost half of the extreme events professionals attending underwriting sessions and 40% of the underwriting attendees joining an extreme event session. A recent notable competitive contract win in our Extreme Events business is a great example of the benefits of being more focused and more integrated across Verisk. We recently signed a large multiyear contract expansion with a global insurer for extreme events platform, Touchstone. This client, who is already a subscriber to our property underwriting data solutions, will partner with Verisk in a workflow that will directly integrate those data solutions into the Touchstone platform. This partnership not only allows the client to obtain an enhanced view of their catastrophe loss potential based on various data with minimal operational friction, but it also gives Verisk the opportunity to market the feasibility of the same solution to a broader range of market participants. What struck me at both our claims and underwriting events after dozens of client conversations was the genuine enthusiasm our clients have for our ability to help them address industry issues with our scale and centrality. A commonly expressed sentiment is Verisk has a unique perspective, and we know you can help us. This is a tremendous privilege for us, and we are more mindful of our responsibility to create value for our clients and stakeholders. We are particularly excited about the opportunity it represents to find new channels for growth. On the technological transformation front, we recently achieved a major milestone as we have successfully sunset our mainframe. The scope and complexity of this project was massive. And our technology teams worked tirelessly to shut down a 40 year old mainframe in just 5 years. I want to thank my colleagues for their hard work and dedication to modernizing our legacy technology footprint. This move allowed us to modernize our operations and provide a better experience for our customers. Equally importantly, it enables Verisk to allocate more of our technology resources towards innovation to drive future growth. Finally, I wanted to share that we recently published our 2022 corporate social responsibility report. This year's report offers a view of our ESG journey and our work to help build global resilience for individuals, communities and businesses. We continue to pursue sustainability and growth through the lens of a responsible ESG framework. On the environmental front, this year, we established a Climate Advisory Council to glean strategic guidance on climate change and receive climate-related feedback on our forthcoming solutions. Moreover, Verisk's sustainability team is currently working with an independent consultant to help the company complete a report, meeting the expectations set forth by the task force on climate-related financial disclosures. As part of the exercise, we are conducting analysis assessing the impact of climate change, both on Verisk's direct operations and across key elements of its value chain and developing a realistic pathway to support science-based targets and a commitment to net zero targets. The team is also engaging with internal stakeholders regarding Verisk's current risk assessment activities and framework for identifying climate-related opportunities. We expect to publish the report in late 2023. Regarding governance, over the last 12 months, Verisk took steps to enhance our governance at the Board level, including making changes to provide for the annual election of directors and separating the role of Chair and CEO. We also took steps to refresh our Board, welcoming 4 new independent directors, who bring fresh perspectives and valuable skill and experience sets. As of the 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, 4 directors, namely Annell Bay, Chris Foskett, Constantine Iordanou and David Wright will be retiring from the Board. I would like to express my gratitude to each of these directors for their leadership and guidance, which have been invaluable to Verisk's journey and transformation. These changes will bring our Board to a total of 10 members, 90% of whom are independent and 60% are gender or racially diverse. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results.
Elizabeth Mann : Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. Before I start with the first quarter results, I have a few reminders for everyone. First, all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This will be the final quarter of this year-over-year comparison. Second, as it was in the prior quarter, Wood Mackenzie is accounted for as discontinued operations on our income statement, and results are not included in continuing operations for either period. Third, all cash flow metrics include the results of all 3 disposed businesses in the prior year figures. Turning to the financial results. I am pleased to share that we delivered a strong first quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $652 million, up 1% versus the prior year, reflecting growth in Insurance, offset by the impact of the VFS and 3E disposition. Income from continuing operations was $194 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk was $1.27. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are pleased with our operating results, which demonstrated strong core underlying performance across most of our businesses, aided by some in-period onetime benefits. In the first quarter, OCC revenues grew 9.8% with growth of 9.1% in underwriting and rating and 11.4% in claims. This quarter's results was boosted by certain transactional revenues that we do not expect to repeat for the remainder of 2023. Our subscription revenues, which comprised 80% of total revenue in the quarter, grew 8.7% on an OCC basis. We saw broad-based growth across most of our businesses with strength in core underwriting, property estimating solutions, extreme events, antitrust, life insurance solutions and many of our international businesses. Specific to our core line services, we are experiencing a benefit on certain of our revenues from the stronger net premium growth in 2021, which is currently reflecting in our contract pricing. Working against this is a modest negative impact from the 7 liquidations in Florida that occurred over the last 12 months and which we discussed earlier. We do expect the impact from liquidations overall to become more pronounced as we move throughout the year. Our transactional revenues, representing 20% of total revenue in the first quarter, grew 14.4% on an OCC basis. The largest contributor to growth was from a strong rebound in our auto businesses driven by increased rate shopping and the signing of a large nonrate action deal with national insurer. Additionally, we experienced double-digit growth from life insurance solutions as we are seeing strong customer demand for incremental services. Our travel solutions are benefiting from a post-COVID rebound, particularly in markets like Australia and New Zealand. And our property estimating solutions experienced continued storm benefit in the quarter. These transactional results did include some onetime benefits, including overage charges on specific large underwriting contracts that renewed in the quarter and catch-up billing for certain claims customers. Finally, the casualty workers' compensation business delivered growth in the quarter but continues to remain below pre-COVID level and is recovering at a pace slower than we had originally expected. On the auto underwriting side, we did see solid growth in transaction volume this quarter versus declines last year as rate increases are now driving shopping behavior by policyholders. However, as Lee mentioned earlier, carriers continue to be cautious and have pulled back on marketing spend to attract new customers as they measure the impact of rate increases on profitability. To that end and given the transactional nature of this business, we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for auto as we move throughout the year. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 15.7% in the first quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on the strong revenue growth and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objective. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 52.2%, up 480 basis points from the reported results in the prior year. On a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the first quarter margin expanded 320 basis points from margins of 49% in Q1 of '22. This reflects the impact of certain onetime expenses in the prior year quarter as well as strong cost and operational discipline and the impact of our cost reduction program. This level of margin also does include several headwinds, which in total represent about 150 basis points and include a decrease in our pension credit, pressures from recent acquisitions and higher T&E expenses, offset by foreign currency realized gains in the quarter. Reflecting on our ongoing cost reduction plan, we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on the margin targets that we articulated in our 2023 guidance and at Investor Day in mid-March. During the quarter, we also took actions to put in place a permanent capital structure for the new Verisk as well as actively manage the balance sheet to take advantage of the $3.1 billion in proceeds we received from the closing of the Wood Mackenzie transaction. To that end, in February 23, we paid down $1.4 billion in debt that was outstanding on our revolver. On March 3, we issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes at a rate of 5.75%, bringing our total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter to $2.85 billion. We then entered a $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase plan and received an initial delivery of 10.7 million shares in the quarter. We expect to receive the final shares when the program is completed in the fourth quarter. The net result of these actions in the quarter was net interest expense of $26.4 million for the first quarter compared to $31.3 million in the prior year. Included in this number was $7.4 million in interest income that we earned on the proceeds of the Wood Mackenzie transaction, which we do not expect to continue as the proceeds are now fully deployed. Having now completed all these transactions, we now expect net interest expense for 2023 to be slightly below the full year 2022 level. On taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 27.1% compared to 17.4% in the prior year quarter. This higher tax rate included a onetime tax charge of $15.2 million associated with the structuring of the energy sale, which closed in the quarter, offset in part by higher stock compensation benefit versus the prior year period. Going forward, we expect the tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in the originally guided range of 23% to 25%. Adjusted net income increased 9.4% to $196.4 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 16.2% to $1.29 for the first quarter of 2023. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by higher tax rate. We are very pleased with the robust performance in the first quarter. But given that it is still early in the year, our transactional revenues are inherently less predictable. At this time, we are maintaining our outlook for 2023. While the first quarter showed strong operating momentum, based on what we see today, we have not changed our expectations for the balance of the year. To that end, our full year 2023 guidance is unchanged. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel : In summary, we're excited about the opportunity ahead and our ability to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry. Verisk is best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity because of our scale, centrality and expertise. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. The combination of our focused business model, unique market position and strategy to deliver value for clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency is the formula that will also deliver value to our shareholders through predictable growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy : I wanted to ask about -- I understand that the transactional revenues you cited, there may be certain onetime items. But on the subscription revenues, you cited increased growth in premium pricing. And it sounds like that should continue. So maybe talk about some of the offsets. I know you mentioned Florida, but if you can further dimensionalize that for us, that would be really helpful.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks. Happy to. I'll highlight a couple of the drivers of the subscription growth, which was broad-based and some of the potential later in the year. So on the -- the largest driver of the subscription growth was in our forms [indiscernible] business. This was the biggest contributor to the growth, just given the size of it within overall Verisk. And the growth was driven across the contract. Probably about 20% to 25% of our contracts in the business overall are tied to premium growth. We are seeing an environment with strong premium growth with over 9% -- nearly 10% net written premium growth in 2021, which is driving some of those contracts. In addition, we're delivering additional value to our customers and new products, as we highlighted at the Investor Day. So we are partnering with them in this environment. Finally, in that business, in this quarter in particular, there were lower levels of attrition, liquidation or consolidation in the industry than we might typically, something that we're monitoring in the balance of the year. In addition to that business, other contributors to subscription growth, our property estimating solutions business had a strong quarter, somewhat helped by easier comparisons in the last year and some continued storm benefits there. And our anti-fraud business in the claims business is also driving strong growth. That is fueled significantly by conversions to claims essentials, which is a subscription product for third-party administrators and self-insured. That transition from transactional to subscription product started in the back half of last year. So we're still in kind of that overlapping growth period. And finally, extreme events and life, our life solutions business also had strong subscription growth. So collectively, strong contributions across the portfolio.
Lee Shavel: And Faiza, if I would add, I think the other dimension that you were looking for is what might not be sustained given that strong growth in the first quarter. And so there are a couple of things that I would point to. One is that we -- in subscription growth, we have some property estimating solution subscriptions that come on associated with the storms in the fourth quarter. And sometimes those persist. It's hard to predict how long that those will persist. So that's a factor. In addition, as we indicated, the Florida situation and potential further insolvencies would impact that. And then as Elizabeth described, part of the conversion of the -- in the anti-fraud to our claims essentials package, it generates some growth in 2022 and in the early part of 2023. I think we will lap some of that exceptional growth, and that will probably serve as a bit of an offset in the later part of 2023.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan.
Andrew Steinerman: I would just like a little more detail about those certain transactional revenues that were elevated in the first quarter, like which product lines? And what are you assuming for the balance of the year for those same transactional pieces?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Happy to cover that. Maybe like the subscription, I'll go through sort of in order of magnitude of the impact to the transactional growth. So the biggest single driver in the underwriting and ratings portion of the business was the recovery in the auto space. There were really 2 elements to this. First was we referenced the nonrate actions deal with a major insurer. And that's a unique opportunity for auto insurers to look across their portfolio and see actions that they can take beyond rate increases. The second element, though, is the overall rebound in shopping behavior, which picked up quite suddenly in the quarter. We've seen industry data that supports it. The J.D. Power data shows a strong increase in auto insurance shopping this quarter. So those 2 factors contributed to our transactional growth. In addition, the -- our life business, which is both a subscription business but has a services implementation component which contributed on the transaction side. In the property estimating solutions, there was -- there continue to be carryover as well as some localized storm activities, the wind storms and tornadoes and some ice storms that you've seen that had a component of an impact. And then there were a couple onetime elements, including some overage charges on contracts in underwriting and rating, billing catch-up in the claims business. There also -- there happened to be an extra business day in the quarter, which will come out in the third quarter. So those were the main elements across the transaction growth.
Andrew Steinerman: Right. And Elizabeth, I also said, how are you assuming these transactional pieces are guided for, for the balance of the year?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. So that's encapsulated in our 2023 guidance, which is unchanged.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.
Greg Peters : Lee, in your comments, you spoke about the client outreach initiatives, and I think you highlighted a Net Promoter Score of 47, which as far as insurance industry standards is nothing to sneeze at. Can you maybe give us an idea of how you're thinking about improving that score? Is that part of your approach and strategy is you convene all of these panels and meetings with your clients and provide us some perspective on how you're thinking about that, please?
Lee Shavel: Thanks for the question, Greg. So certainly, we view the Net Promoter Score as one gauge of our client satisfaction and enthusiasm for what we do. I wouldn't say that we are targeting our client outreach primarily to drive an increase in NPS. We're hopeful that, that will be a consequence, but our primary purpose is to elevate our dialogue [indiscernible] with our clients, which, as I indicated, I think there's a very strong appetite for because they recognize that with the data sets that we have and our centrality, we have the ability to solve problems for the industry. And the only way that we can identify those as industry issues is by moving and strengthening that dialogue at the top. And I think it does put us in a position where we are beyond addressing their tactical needs in underwriting claims, extreme events modeling, we have the ability to solve bigger problems by tying some of those data sets together. We talked about the integration of our property data into the Touchstone platform, which is an example of how, as part of that higher-level dialogue, we were able to find solutions. So we are looking for ways to integrate more data sets and bring new data sets in to satisfy and delight our clients. And I certainly hope that we'll be able to see an increase in our NPS overtime. But where the rubber will meet the road is going to be in sustained revenue growth and the development of new products that we can then monetize across the industry.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC.
Ashish Sabadra : I just wanted to drill down further, Lee, on your comments around some of the macro challenges, insurance-specific challenges, but also better client interaction and some of the things that you mentioned in response to the prior question around new data sets. So my question here was how is that helping build the sales pipeline? Have you seen any elongation in the sales pipeline? Can you talk about the bookings and the traction you're seeing? And how should we think about the contribution from these upsell, cross-sell into the existing customer base accelerate as we go through the year?
Lee Shavel: Thank you. Thank you, Ashish. It's a great question. And I would start by saying through a lot of this client interaction, you have a very clear sense of what is on the minds of senior leaderships at underwriters and reinsurers. And I would start off by saying probably inflation and the impact of inflation on the insurance industry as they evaluate potential losses, insurance to value, placement costs, pricing is first and foremost. And to give you an example of how that manifested itself in our world at our Verisk Insurance Conference, which we were tying a lot of these topics together, our session on tracking inflation costs across a variety of aspects of insurance was a standing room-only event in a pretty large room of people spilling out into the hallways outside. So anything that we can do to provide more insight on the impact of inflation and how that's going to influence replacement costs and insurance to value is an important element of that. Similarly, social inflation and the impact of rising legal costs, time involved in resolving those is very much on the front of their minds associated with regulatory changes. We've seen some regulatory changes in Florida to try to limit some of that exposure. So our engagement on both helping understand that dynamic, how to manage that effectively in settlement discussions and also working towards some regulatory solutions and legislative solutions that address that is important. Topics of climate change and broader global risks that is factoring into our extreme events business is critical. We've had -- that has helped drive pipeline for some of our longer-term climate-oriented models as well as understanding how social, political and environmental risk through our Verisk Maplecroft subsidiary interacts with those risks is also an important topic as insurers are confronting a broader sense of the risk. So those are a few examples of what I would describe as the issues that are top of mind and that we have seen drive, I think, very solid activity on the sales front. I'd also mention that in light of that and in light of kind of the questions around the sales cycle that we have seen in other places, we have always dealt with relatively long sales cycle. And I think our -- the industry, the insurance industry has generally been less volatile. We have not seen any changes in our sales cycle and the impact. So we recognize that, that has been a greater challenge for some of our peers in this market environment. But to date, we've [indiscernible] our sales teams, we have not seen that be an impact as of yet.
Ashish Sabadra : That's great, and congrats on such a strong momentum in the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan : Lee, thanks for your comments on generative AI. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about it in terms of your broader strategy and how you view the opportunities and risks. And then, Elizabeth, thanks for sharing the pieces on the subscription and transactional nonrecurring items, but I'm not sure I caught the quantification of how much the quarter benefited from the onetime items.
Lee Shavel: So Toni, on generative AI, I'll say at the start, our first approach is understanding it, understanding it in the context of the potential use cases within insurance, listening to how our clients are perceiving it and understanding, on one hand, how this can be an effective tool to be utilized to potentially automate functions [indiscernible] insurance to potentially integrate other data sets into their decision-making. But there is -- there are -- because I think of the breadth of this technology, there are clearly a lot of applications. And we're working to identify those and the opportunity, on the other hand, and I think the driving factor is there are clearly profound risk associated with generative AI in terms of its ability to understand and contextualize the conclusions or the outputs that it's creating. And so our primary focus has been in identifying a policy for us internally and as we think about the industry as a whole to provide scope for protected use cases that allow us to test and evaluate and understand the risks and deal with this on a very disciplined basis where the industry is able to develop this in a safe and nondisruptive manner.
Elizabeth Mann: Toni, to your question on the onetime items, we haven't quantified them. They're not of a magnitude that we would call out in specific. We just wanted to mention as a tailwind.
Toni Kaplan : Congrats again.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America.
Heather Balsky : I was hoping you could touch on the Florida market and what you mentioned in terms of the potential risk as we move through the year. I think in last quarter, you had, had one additional bankruptcy. Is there anything in particular that you're seeing? Or is it just a cautiousness, given the uncertainty?
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Heather. It's a great opportunity for me to bring Neil Spector, President of our underwriting businesses, into the conversation and through his engagement with clients, particularly on the underwriting side, has probably the best insight on what's happening within Florida. Neil?
Neil Spector: Thank you. Great question. I would say it's going to take a while for the reforms that are -- that were passed there to have the positive impact on the market. There's still a lot of lawsuits that are pending from prior to that legislation that will flow through. There's also a concern with reinsurance. The renewals will be coming up for the next storm season, and the expectation is that reinsurance costs are going to go up. So just the overall market is still not favorable for insurers down there. And so we need to continue to watch and make sure that we don't have additional liquidations or additional challenges out there. As I've mentioned in the past, it also creates opportunities for new players to enter the market. And so we do see that as well. But it's just a dynamic market that we'll probably see the results of the situation for at least another 12 to 18 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik : Lee, maybe if I can follow up on the technology question and specific to, I guess, the sunsetting of the mainframes, which obviously is a great step, but I think it's one of the first steps, I guess. I just wanted to understand what's left in the tech modernization, what your plans are? And what benefits that might read over, I guess, the next multi-years?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Manav. So -- and I appreciate you asked the context in kind of a sequential way. So first, as I indicated, the accomplishment of moving off of that mainframe was a really substantial challenge, particularly for an organization that has been -- has developed over decades, and that technology had been in place for a long time. And so the immediate benefit, as we've talked about in the past, is that we are clearly realizing an economic benefit in terms of our ability to manage data and process data in the cloud. And we have -- there were costs necessary for us to achieve that outcome. But most of those costs have been -- had hit us. We're now experiencing the benefit of that from an economic perspective. But I'll remind everyone that, of course, that this also involves a geographic change in our balance sheet, meaning that what previously would have been depreciation of those hardware and software assets is now moving to an operating expense in terms of cloud expense. So may not be apparent from an EBITDA perspective, but there is real economic benefit from that. Now we will also continue to expect to see our cloud expenses grow as we integrate new data sets as we develop new solutions. So that will be part of our expense base that grows with the revenue opportunities that we see. But the strategic benefit for us that I believe we're really at the early stages of realizing is that through associating data sets that are now in a cloud format, our ability to tie those data sets together, to develop workflow software that is able to integrate that, to deliver that in a micro services context or an EPA context to our clients and integrate into those features expands the scope by which we can create value from those data sets. And to tie it to my earlier comments, as we better understand our clients' needs, it gives us an ability to potentially customize the way that we integrate and deliver those data sets to our clients to meet their specific value objectives. And that's, I think, what we're very excited about. We also -- from a technology standpoint, one other modernization step that we are taking on is an upgrade of our ERP system. That will deliver also efficiencies for us on the accounting, on the HR side. That also improves our ability to understand and accelerate the amount of internal information that we have. So having completed the cloud migration, we're now embarking under Elizabeth's leadership the -- our ERP transformation.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS.
Alex Kramm : Just wanted to come back to the guidance, which was obviously unchanged. Just trying to understand, since you're new to this first year of giving guidance, what your philosophy really is here going forward? So I know it's the first quarter in, but how should we be thinking about you updating the guidance throughout the year if you're running significantly ahead or below? And then as we think about this year, I know there was a lot said already on this call. But as you talk about the none changed guidance, was it really hey it's too early in the year? Was it anything as maybe a little bit more uncertain, some of the transactional side you mentioned? Or was the first quarter really just in line with what you were expecting all along?
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Alex. Yes. We are excited to be giving this new transparency to the market. Our overall philosophy is going to be to give you clarity on what we can expect. We do not intend to sort of update for minor changes or for every kind of mark-to-market on a frequent basis. It's the first quarter of the year, and so it's still early in the year. We will update for material changes as we see things unfold.
Alex Kramm : Okay. Fair enough.
Elizabeth Mann: And maybe actually, to your question on our views for the balance of the year, I'll repeat what I said in the comments, which is from where -- from what we see today, as we think about the balance of the year, we don't see significant changes in trends versus what we talked to you about when we gave the guidance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair.
Andrew Nicholas : Second quarter in a row where you've called out antifraud analytics as a growth contributor. And I appreciate some of the insight on your capabilities there at Investor Day. Elizabeth, I think you called out some changes in contract structure in that business. Would you mind unpacking that a bit further? Is that something that's impacting growth in the near term? And then broadly speaking, are there other dynamics to call out within anti-fraud that are contributing to the stronger growth rate?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks. So that -- in that product, we had -- it is for insurers, but it is also used by third-party administrators and by self-insured. Previously, those customers, the TPAs and the self-insured had been on a more of a transactional business model. They would use the data when something would occur. We have developed a subscription product that is specifically targeted to that customer base and have been moving them to that subscription product. We started that in the middle of last year. As they move from a transactional to a subscription model, you're seeing that shift in that business where transaction revenue may even be declining, but it is being replaced by subscription revenue, which is higher quality and more sustainable.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from Bank of Montreal.
Jeff Silber : You called out your life insurance business a couple of times. I know it's relatively small, but we've been reading about some of the pressure that the life insurance industry is in because of the returns on commercial real estate, maybe some mismatches of assets and liabilities. Are you seeing that with any of your clients either in the life insurance industry or more broadly overall?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Jeff, thank you for the question. I would say, first, recognize that pressure. But that pressure is, in fact, I think, creating the opportunity that we are pursuing in that we are providing through our life solution a completely renovated and fresh platform for our clients to deliver that product, to develop new products on a faster basis and to substantially reduce the costs that they have in originating and managing that product. So at least what we see and part of what is driving the very strong growth, and I heard this directly from clients at our various insurance conference, many of whom are large players in the insurance industry, given that pressure, they are using this as an opportunity to rethink. Some of them have exited the business, and they are reestablishing it on this new platform that we are providing to them.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Julian on for Andrew. Just wanted to touch on the recent acquisition in German market. Is that kind of -- is it fair to say it's an indicative of a little focus on auto? And maybe what other kind of vertical opportunities exist there in that market?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. And I think this is a good opportunity for me to bring in Maroun Mourad, the President of our Claims business. And given kind of the claims dimension of that, he can speak specifically to crew and also how it fits into our broader German strategy given our prior acquisition of ACTINEO.
Maroun Mourad: Thank you, Andrew. So the [indiscernible] is an auto on-site and remote adjusting that uses automation and digitization as well as invoice and bill review check to enhance the customer experience, provide more speed and drive down growth for our customers. As you know, about 1.5 years ago, we acquired a firm in the [indiscernible] called ACTINEO. That was an extension of our line of business specific solutions outside of the U.S., starting in the U.K. and now expanding into Germany, France and a couple of other markets. So there are synergies with the [indiscernible] acquisition to leverage our existing operational base as well as customer base to provide an additional product or 2 to the German customers. And this will also help us use the [indiscernible] and the German platform as a launching pad to explore growth into the markets in Europe. So it's both a product line expansion as well as the diversification of our suite of solutions offerings in the claims space.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.
Jeff Meuler : Apologies for the multiparter, but all on the same topic. So on the underwriting and marketing, I guess, just to what extent is there still like a lagged impact from some states that didn't get requested rate actions or just how much better is the performance in the states that did? And then what specifically needs to happen for the marketing to really turn on? I know you're saying in the second half, but is it a customer success channel capacity constraints as they respond to the consumers shopping after they see the higher premiums, and that needs to be alleviated or what needs to happen? And the last is just what exactly is the revenue model like as marketing demand improves, to what extent does it flow through the sub space? Or to what extent is there meaningful incremental transaction revenue?
Lee Shavel: So Jeff, I think you won the award for the most complex [indiscernible] question, which we do appreciate because it is a complicated topic. Let me start off, and then I'm going to ask Neil to jump in and provide more context. So the dynamic of what we're seeing is that right now, in general, is that we are seeing higher rates, and consumers are responding to that. So some of the strength that we're seeing in auto is they are beginning to shop more frequently because of the initial impact of rates. We expect that, that will continue. Some insurers through nonrate actions that they're entitled to have been able to increase prices. So we're getting to see the consumer respond to that, and that's driving volume. Now from the insurers' perspective, however, there still are these concerns about inflation and underwriting in certain geographies that is -- put them in a position where they are not willing to market as aggressively. And so that's why we have not seen the level of marketing activity on the insurer side. So those are the dynamics that we are seeing right now. It's -- we do expect to see more rate increases. That will probably encourage more competition and demand for new products, but the insurers will have to evaluate where they want to write business and what they want to do to attract more. So that's kind of a rough approximation, and I'll let Neil fine-tune that a bit.
Neil Spector: Yes. So I'll just add. So I think part of your question was the rate increases by various states. And the states approved those rate increases at various times and various levels. And I think what we've seen is that by now, most of the states, the increases are flowing through, but not all states happen at the same time. And then, of course, insurers are raising rates because their costs have significantly gone up. There's a number of drivers to that, which we mentioned some of them: severity, the cost to repair is up dramatically. There was a huge spike in used car prices, and there's a huge increase in medical costs, et cetera. So they're unprofitable. These rate increases will help. And so their desire to write more business is really muted. And so when you think about the marketing function, that is really the growth engine, which insurers go out to grow their business. And that has been paused in a large part due to the unprofitability of the line. So we expect over the next 12 months, that will -- the lines will become more and more profitable as these rate increases go through and that marketing spend will return, although it's questionable as to when. We don't know exactly when. And I think it will return for certain players sooner than others because each insurer handles the situation differently. We do have a subscription model with our overall marketing products. So they are subscription revenues. But the subscriptions are tied overall to usage. And so as the market grows and marketing spend comes back, we expect that to recover, but it is not purely a transactional model.
Lee Shavel: Yes. And specific to this embedded in our comments was part of the transactional strength were some nonrate action programs that were insurers looking to address some of their higher risks within that. As these rate increases begin to flow through, that should diminish, but then it potentially drives other growth within the business. So again, a complex situation, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit more insight.
Jeff Meuler : It does. I think you addressed all 19 parts.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [Harold] from Jefferies.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [Harold] on for Stephanie Moore. Just wanted to ask about the percentage of price increases that the company plans to implement with the health in insurance industry like you just talk about, particularly given an uncertain macro backdrop as inflation was at historic levels last year.
Lee Shavel: So Harold, I was -- we lost you there for a little bit. I think that you were just asking the general question around price increases in the context of the environment. Do I have that correct?
Unidentified Analyst: Correct.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes, happy to comment on it. I mean, first, I want to remind you, we don’t have a single pricing approach. It’s a targeted approach across all of our businesses, and we’ve been pricing items to value. I think I quoted before the net written premium growth in the industry was 9.6% in 2021. That’s the year that drives the growth for many of our customers. About 20% of our revenue is tied to that premium growth in the year prior. So that has been an element.
Lee Shavel: And I would say we are – in this environment where the business is growing, there are a lot of new issues that we’re working to respond on. With that growth and naturally some of the inflationary costs within the environment, the investments that we have made to improve the value of the product, we believe that it has been a supportive environment for us to capture the value that we are creating in the product through some of the pricing increases across our entire product set.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman.
George Tong : I wanted to return to the nonsubscription revenue trends. So nonsubscription revenue grew 14% in the quarter driven to a large extent by auto underwriting. How sustainable is the strength in auto underwriting nonsubscription revenues with the trends that you're seeing with rate shopping? What are some of the puts and takes that could cause underwriting in autos to accelerate or decelerate in the coming quarters?
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Good question, George. Thanks for that. Some of it ties back to the discussion we were just having on the industry and the impact of the rate increases that we're starting to see. So the strong auto insurance shopping behavior that we saw in this quarter was a function of some of the rate increases that have started to push through. To some extent, that is a recovery that we had expected to come later in the year. And so it may just be a pull forward of that recovery. We're waiting to see kind of the interplay of the dynamics that Lee and Neil were talking about in there. The second driver of the auto business, the nonrate actions and our -- enabling our customers to do that, that may taper off as they start to get rate increases, and that may turn into some of that shopping activity. So that's the interplay of those elements we see going forward.
Lee Shavel : Great. Well, thank you, George. I think that was the final question. So I want to thank everyone for participating, and we look forward to continuing the dialogue with all of you. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-03-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Fourth Quarter 2022 Earning Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  For opening remarks and introductions, I would now turn -- like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, you may go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar : Thank you, Devin, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk President and Chief Executive Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including those related to our financial guidance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation of reported and historic non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call is provided in our 8-K and today's earnings presentation posted on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. However, we are not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results because of the unreasonable effort and high unpredictability of estimating certain items that are excluded from projected non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, including, for example, tax consequences, acquisition-related costs, gain or loss from dispositions and other nonrecurring expenses, the effect of which may be significant. And now I would like to turn the call over to Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel : Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Stacey, and thanks to you all for participating today. We've really been looking forward to this call because it's our first opportunity to reintroduce Verisk in our new insurance-focused configuration, to discuss the momentum in the fourth quarter and given all the structural changes, give you a forward view of our expected performance in 2023. We accomplished an extraordinary amount in 2022, so let me provide a brief summary. First, there's been a lot of structural change. In March, we sold 3E, our environmental health and safety business, for net cash proceeds of $575 million. In April, we sold Verisk Financial Services for net cash proceeds of approximately $500 million. And most recently in February, we sold Wood Mackenzie for approximately $3.1 billion. We've begun the process of returning a substantial majority of the after-tax proceeds of those transactions to shareholders through share repurchases as promised. Despite a challenging economic, geopolitical and financing environment, we were able to complete these transactions at attractive valuations through the strong underlying businesses, capable management teams and a well-organized sale process. Let's turn to governance change. Structural change wasn't the only transition at Verisk. We also made a number of governance changes that shareholders suggested. We are transitioning to a declassified Board with annual elections. We added four new directors with fresh perspectives and experiences: Jeff Dailey, Wendy Lane, Olumide Soroye and Kim Stevenson. We separated the Chairman and CEO role with the election of Bruce Hansen as our new Chair. I have to personally thank Bruce for his advice and leadership through my transition. As a former CEO, he's been a great coach to me as have been all of our directors. Let's turn to organizational change. Finally, organizationally, we've had substantial change. In addition to Scott Stephenson's retirement last year, Mark Anquillare stepping down in January and the addition of Elizabeth Mann as our CFO, we have made over a dozen changes in senior management. These have enabled the next generation of management to rise, bringing new energy and fresh perspectives how we can make Verisk better. At the highest level, I have reconstituted our Senior Operating Committee with 10 colleagues, six of whom are new to the committee, who represent a better balance of business unit leaders and corporate leaders for improved integration and coordination. I'm also proud that the committee represents 50% gender diversity and 40% ethnic diversity, a strong signal for our entire organization. We all share the common mission of creating value for our clients, employees and shareholders.  With all this change, we were, of course, carefully watching for disruption with our employees and clients. While there is some understandable anxiety with any organizational change, the feedback from employees at three town halls, anonymous surveys and informal feedback has been very positive with enthusiasm for our refocused strategy in insurance and new leadership. In particular, our purpose of working together to build global resilience for individuals, communities and businesses has resonated strongly with our employees as has our new cultural values of learning, caring and results. As I believe all of you can appreciate, what we accomplished in terms of structure and organizational change in 2022 was no foregone conclusion, and the delivery of a clear view of our insurance-only operations in our 10-K was a massively complex exercise. It required the effort, expertise and commitment of hundreds of our employees to accomplish. So I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of our nearly 7,000 employees for their professionalism, commitment and understanding as we have undergone so much change in 2022. They are absolutely talented and critical to our future success. What we accomplished this year demonstrates what we're capable of ahead. On the client front, we have also received a positive response from many clients who appreciate our renewed insurance focus and desire to improve our relationships across their organizations. I experienced this first-hand at our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City and dozens of client meetings and calls. Their feedback reinforces that while we have been a great product organization, we can be a much better client organization. And that's an area where I'm dedicating substantial time and leading from the front. I spent most of my career as a client professional, and I'm excited to be returning to this particular role. Let's move to financial change. I won't steal Elizabeth's thunder on the financials. However, there are two elements that matter most to me in our 2022 performance and what we intend to achieve in 2023. First is our ability to continue to deliver strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth despite the changes and challenging environment in 2022 and the clear momentum in the fourth quarter results. We have clearly demonstrated what Verisk is capable of in the fourth quarter by delivering organic constant currency revenue growth of over 7% in the insurance-only business even after eliminating the impact of storms.  I'd also note that fiscal year 2022, the insurance OCC revenue growth of 6.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 8% is a solid result for a year of substantial change and macroeconomic challenges and is a strong reflection of the stability of our business and a good foundation to build on to in 2023 and beyond. Second is our delivery of clear margin improvement consistent with the clear goals we set for the insurance-focused business of 300 basis points to 500 basis points improvement from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021. At 52.7% for the fourth quarter, we are on the cusp of delivering at the low end of our targeted range of 53% to 56% for 2024. And our guidance for 2023 is for adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 53% and 54%. Finally, we are providing expanded financial guidance for 2023 as a reflection of the complex structural changes in 2022 as well as an expectation of more predictable growth with our refocused business. This decision also reflects the input from many of our shareholders who ask for improved financial guidance. Naturally, it will come with the necessary caveats that we can't predict all contingencies but represents our best assessment of 2023 financial performance. So where does that leave us after all of these changes? We are, as of this moment, a new Verisk, new structurally, organizationally and with a reenergized and refocused purpose values. There's a lot that you'll be familiar with, including our insurance focus, industry centrality, strong market position, stable growth and strong margins and some new elements that are expanding our growth opportunities in areas such as life assurance, marketing solutions and in our European businesses, including specialty business solutions, where we are improving workflows and efficiency in the Lloyd's nonstandard market. You will also see changes in our expense discipline to drive margin expansion and a new approach to providing financial guidance for the year ahead. Let's step back and take a moment to reframe our opportunity. The insurance industry is massive, complex and growing globally. Our clients face substantial technology, regulatory and macroeconomic challenges in a rapidly evolving environment. This is less an assertion than an often repeated sentiment that I hear from the leaders of our clients. One of my favorite client quotes was, "Lee, we need Verisk's help to address this, but more importantly, the industry needs Verisk's help." That crystallizes our opportunity and position. You'll hear at Investor Day from several clients that Verisk is considered a true business partner rather than a vendor and that we work together to collectively solve problems for the insurance industry. We create value for our clients through a simple economic mechanism. We invest in data, analytics and software at scale to address industry needs much more efficiently than individual companies can. We are addressing hundreds of billions of dollars of premiums and expense across the industry to improve revenue growth, risk outcomes, fund experience, productivity and margins. These investments deliver real value to the industry and in turn, drive our growth, operating leverage and high incremental returns on capital. Much of this opportunity is realized by facilitating connectivity across the insurance ecosystem. Hence, the theme of our annual report for 2022: Connecting What Matters. To connect, you must be central. You must be trusted, and you must understand the needs of the ecosystem. No company is better positioned than Verisk with our scale, relationships and expertise to create this value for the insurance industry. We're very proud of what we accomplished in 2022, but it was all to put us in this position where we can demonstrate our full potential, focused on serving the substantial and expanding needs of the insurance industry. With a reconfigured and energized organization bound together by a common purpose and values, we are very excited about the path ahead and can already feel the benefits of this better integrated and focused approach. This is the way. As our 2023 financial guidance implies and as you'll hear at our upcoming Investor Day, we believe this path will see continued growth, improving margins and strong returns on capital. I'll end with thanks to our shareholders who encouraged us to consider new approaches and offered their perspectives directly or indirectly through surveys and our analyst community. We and our Board have listened carefully. And our actions and path ahead clearly reflect your input. We are here to expand the opportunity, execute on the plan and deliver value on your behalf. I can't imagine us being in a better position to do so, and we're off to a solid start. With that, I'll hand it over to Elizabeth to review our financial results for the quarter, the year and our financial guidance for 2023.
Elizabeth Mann : Thanks, Lee, and good day to everyone on the call. Before I start with the fourth quarter results, I have a few reminders for everyone. First, all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This effect will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions. Second, as we described previously, due to its materiality, Wood Mackenzie is accounted for as discontinued operations beginning this quarter. And its results are not included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA results in either the current period or the prior period. Third, in the earnings presentation now posted on the Investors section of our website, we have included certain pro forma quarterly financial metrics, removing the operational results of all our divestitures as well as a reconciliation to our historical reported results, which we hope you will find helpful. Turning now to the financial results. I'm pleased to share that we had a strong finish to 2022. For the fourth quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $630 million, up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting growth in insurance, offset by the impact of the VFS and 3E dispositions. Income from continuing operations was $216 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk was $1.37. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, which demonstrated strong sequential improvement relative to the third quarter as a broad-based recovery across our business contributed to the strongest quarter of the year. In the fourth quarter, OCC revenues grew 8.1% with growth of 6.5% in underwriting and rating and 11.9% in claims. This quarter's results included $5.6 million in storm-related revenue associated with Hurricane Ian. Excluding the storm-related revenues, OCC revenue would have grown 7.1%. Our subscription revenues, which comprise 80% of our total revenue in the quarter, grew 7.2% on an OCC basis. We saw broad-based growth across most of our businesses with strength in core underwriting, property estimating solutions, extreme events, antifraud and life insurance solutions. We did experience a modest negative impact from the liquidations in Florida. As we noted in previous calls, Florida has been a trouble spot for the insurance industry, and the losses from Hurricane Ian add complication. In 2022, the market saw six liquidations. And so far in '23, we have seen one company placed into receivership after higher-than-expected losses from Hurricane Ian, which is the carrier into insolvency. We continue to work to offset this headwind through engagement with our customers by helping them adapt to Florida's new roof coverage rules and by better segmenting risk using both new and existing sources such as our roof age data and aerial imagery. Our analytics have been integrated into our LightSpeed platform and can help customers leverage data earlier in their quoting process, ensuring they underwrite risk appropriately as well as help drive non-rate action for in-force policies. Transactional OCC revenue growth of 12.1%, representing 20% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, also improved from the third quarter, reflecting the revenues associated with Hurricane Ian. Adjusting for the storm impact, transactional growth was a healthy 8.2% comprised of continued strong recovery in international travel, strong sales of life insurance solutions and a modest contribution from our workers' compensation business, which is improving though, continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. This was offset in part by continued weakness across auto underwriting and marketing solutions. On the auto underwriting side, we continue to see cyclical softness across our auto underwriting and marketing solutions as carriers are dealing with the impact of rising inflation and increasing loss ratios. To that end, carriers have pulled back on underwriting new auto policies as well as on marketing spending to drive new policy volume and customer acquisition. Carriers are working to reset pricing, which we think could take another six to 12 months to truly take effect. To help our customers bridge this uncertain time and drive growth for Verisk, we are working with them to help identify ways to improve profitability with targeted non-rate actions that minimize premium leakage. We are actively engaging with customers about our risk check renewal product, which allows insurance -- which allows insurers to analyze an entire book of business with minimal IT resources and pinpoint policies that require attention. Moving now to our adjusted EBITDA results. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting core operating leverage and the impact of certain cost reduction actions we have taken in connection with our margin expansion objectives. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 52.7%, up 210 basis points from the reported results in the prior year, reflecting the benefit from recent dispositions, strong cost and operational discipline, the impact of certain cost reduction actions and the high incremental margins associated with storm-related revenue. This level of margin also includes a number of margin headwinds, including approximately 110 basis points from recent acquisitions as well as 80 basis points from the headwinds from our ongoing technological transformation and higher T&E expenses. In addition, this quarter included certain onetime or non-operating expenses including severance, FX impact and a decrease in our pension credit, which collectively negatively impacted margins by 190 basis points.  Finally, if you compare the fourth quarter margins on a pro forma basis for all divestitures, the 4Q 2022 margins of 52.7% represent an 80 basis point margin expansion from 51.9% in the fourth quarter of 2021 pro forma. Reflecting on our objective to deliver 300 basis points to 500 basis points of margin improvement in 2024 from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021, we took great strides in 2022 with full year adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% on a pro forma basis, reflecting approximately 140 basis points of margin expansion associated with our operational excellence focus. To date, we have made decisions and taken actions to address more than 60% of the run rate cost savings we are targeting. The impact of those actions will be realized through 2024 with about 30% of the cumulated expected cost savings already achieved in the reported results in 2022. Our business continues to demonstrate the operating leverage embedded in our data analytics business model. And we have confidence in our ability to deliver on the objective in 2024. Interest expense. Interest expense totaled $41 million for the fourth quarter compared to $30.2 million in the prior year. For the full year, interest expense totaled $139 million versus $127 million in 2021. This increase in interest expense is related to higher balances on our revolving credit facility as well as higher interest rates. We have paid off all borrowings under our credit facility as of February 2023. And in the near term, we'll look to establish a go-forward balance sheet for the business, staying within our targeted leverage range of 2x to 3x adjusted EBITDA. Taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 9.9% compared to 16.8% in the prior year quarter. This lower tax rate included a onetime benefit of approximately $30 million, which was primarily the result of transaction benefits related to our Wood Mackenzie divestiture, offset in part by lower stock compensation benefits versus the prior year period. For the full year '22, our effective tax rate was 17.5% as compared to 22.8% in the prior year, including approximately $67.7 million in benefits related to all our dispositions throughout the year. The net effect of these transaction-related tax benefits was a reduction in our full year effective tax rate of 5.4%. Adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS. Adjusted net income increased 14% to $225 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 18% to $1.43 for the fourth quarter '22. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Capital returns. During the fourth quarter, we returned $514 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to consistently return capital to shareholders while also investing in our business. In particular, included in that amount is $366 million of share repurchases we have completed since the announcement of the Wood Mackenzie transaction back in November. In the coming days, we intend to enter into an additional $2.5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement for a total capital return of $2.87 billion associated with the transaction proceeds. This is consistent with our plan to return the majority of the proceeds from the Wood Mackenzie divestiture to shareholders via share repurchases. We continue to expect the dilution from the transaction to be within the 4% to 6% range. Looking ahead to 2023, as Lee mentioned, we have listened to shareholder feedback, and we'll now be providing annual financial guidance. We have posted a summary of all guidance measures in the earnings deck on the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Specifically, for 2023, we expect consolidated revenue to be in the range of $2.59 billion to $2.63 billion versus $2.437 billion in 2022 pro forma. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.42 billion versus $1.266 billion in 2022 pro forma and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 53% to 54%. Working further down the P&L, we expect fixed asset D&A to be between $175 million and $195 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $70 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity. We also expect capital expenditures to be between $200 million and $230 million as we continue to invest organically behind our highest return on investment opportunities. These include a modernization of our core line services to digitize our industry standard offering and enable expansion into new workflows that improve productivity for the industry. We are also investing in an upgrade of our financial and human capital systems that will enable future efficiencies once implemented. As previously communicated, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, bringing adjusted earnings per share to a range of $5.20 to $5.50. This range represents strong double-digit growth rates on EPS after normalizing for the impact of transaction tax benefits in 2022. Before I turn the call over to Lee, I just want to remind everyone that we're hosting an Investor Day on March 14 here in Jersey City, where we will provide more transparency and clarity on our strategic profile, growth drivers and long-term financial targets. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel : Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, we are excited to focus all our attention, talent and resources on the global insurance industry where we can deliver substantial value to our clients through improved decision-making and operational efficiency. We will be engaged more intensively as a strategic technology partner to our clients and the broader insurance industry to identify and develop ways for Verisk to support their objectives. With our scale, relationships and expertise, we are well positioned to help make those connections in this period of accelerated change for the industry and by extension, to the people and communities they serve. Our motivating purpose is to work together with our clients in building resilience for individuals, communities and businesses globally. Combined with our focused business model and unique market position, this is a formula that will deliver value to our shareholders through growth and returns. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question.  With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan : Congrats on the results today and particularly, I think your progress on the margin front. You talked about hitting 53% to 54% margin in '23. And as you mentioned, that will essentially be at the low end of the '24 target range. Does this change your strategy around investment, meaning does this allow you to go more aggressively after growth opportunities, just given that your margin is in a really solid place?
Lee Shavel : Thanks, Toni. I'm going to hand it over to Elizabeth to start.
Elizabeth Mann : Thanks, Toni. I don't think it changes our overall strategy. We are committed to the targets delivering in '24. We're happy to be in the low end of that range already ahead of schedule. But we'll maintain that level of focus on margin while still maintaining investment in the business as we have been balancing so far.
Lee Shavel : Yes. And Toni, I'll just add, I think we're very comfortable in our ability to meet those targets, to build on that while still continuing to support the growth objectives that we have for the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong : You've reaffirmed your commitment to deliver 300 bps to 500 bps of EBITDA margin improvement from a normalized base of 50% to 51% in 2021. Recently, you restated historical financials suggesting an insurance-only Verisk has normalized EBITDA margins of approximately 52%. Can you discuss upside potential to your 53% to 56% 2024 target for EBITDA margins?
Elizabeth Mann : Yes. Thanks. We remain committed to that range. Right now, I'm here talking about 2023, I think there's been some headwinds in '22 that we've talked about previously as well as some benefits to the business. So on balance, we're committed to the range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.
Heather Balsky : I'll continue the streak of margin questions on the Q&A. And just ask, if you could help us just bridge a little bit more what gets you to 53 to 54, what's coming from the savings? What's sort of the impact from the stranded costs and some of the other chunkier lines that kind of get you from '22 to '23?
Elizabeth Mann : Yes. Let me talk a little bit about that. If you start with the baseline '22 of 52% that pro forma, that already includes the headwinds from stranded costs, and it includes most of the headwinds from recent M&A. As we move forward on that, there is still a little bit more headwinds from those previously identified items in our baseline, call it, about 30 basis points collectively from ongoing impact of the T&E normalization, the cloud and technology investments, including some of the financial and capital systems that we talked about. So all those investments, 30 basis points.  There's probably still 30 basis points of headwind also from the pension credit, which we know today based on current assumptions will be -- will continue to be a drag in 2023. Offsetting that, you'll see -- so that's about 60 basis points. Collectively, that's offsetting about 150 basis points to 250 basis points of sort of core operating leverage. I haven't broken that down between operating leverage, gross impact and the cost savings target, but those are all included in that 150 basis points to 250 basis points, bringing us to the net of 100 basis points to 200 basis points margin expansion.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.
Ashish Sabadra : Changing gears and moving to the top line, really strong OCC growth in the quarter. I was wondering for your 2023 guidance, what is the organic constant currency assumption for that guidance range? And then as we think about a quarterly cadence, I was wondering if you could provide any color on that? And any color on the puts and takes as we think about auto underwriting coming back, worker comp improving as well as any color on pricing trends and comping some of the Florida insurance headwinds. So any incremental color.
Lee Shavel : It’s like a four-part question. So let's choose -- I would consider that multiple choice. So…
Elizabeth Mann : I'll try to hit the main points there. So on the OCC revenue growth, we haven't given that on a forecasted basis. We will report that out as the quarters develop. The one piece of slice for you, for 2023, the acquisitions that roll in from inorganic to organic are not -- don't create a major swing in the growth rates. And obviously, FX is -- we're not predicting. In terms of -- you asked about the quarterly cadence of how that plays out, there's nothing that we see here today that would imply a meaningful swing in the quarters from a financial perspective. If you look at the OCC comparability results to 2022, those could have some swings just based on the swings in '22.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.
Hans Hoffman : This is Hans Hoffman on for Stephanie. Congrats on a strong quarter. Just wanted to talk a bit about your strategy within insurance, specifically internationally and just how organic growth is trending there? And then just kind of maybe as part of that, are there any acquisitions in the international pipeline that could help you gain further critical mass therein going forward?
Lee Shavel : Yes. Thank you for the question. Let me try to address the components of that. So I think I outlined in my comments the general strategy where we are looking to make investments in data or technology that solve industry problems that we can monetize across that industry. And that strategy really holds across the business. Internationally where we've had a very solid success of finding businesses that have established products in international context, and I'll use our acquisition of Sequel as an example, we have taken that business. We have found ways to support that with addition of other components such as a rate-making component or a binding component in that business that add value to the total offering for our business, thereby integrating components for the market participants in that ecosystem. We will continue to look for opportunities to leverage those types of additions as well as data sets and functionality that we have within the U.S. business. We recently made an acquisition in Sweden, and you may be familiar with both our acquisitions of ACTINEO in Germany and Opta where we're deploying similar strategies. And generally, across our international businesses, we have been able to deliver growth faster than our overall rate and generally in the double-digit range because of the penetration opportunities we have within those marketplaces. So hopefully that ties together with our general strategy and how it applies internationally and the contributions to growth from each of those elements.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeff Meuler : I want to ask about the pickup in claims underlying growth normalized for the discrete storm revenue. I mean, it's a pretty big step-up. So I'm just trying to understand were there any other like onetime benefits in the quarter? Is this mostly about COVID recovery because the factors you cited were things like recovery in international travel, workers' comp or what I'm really looking for, was there like a pickup in like cross-selling and upselling trends in the business, and the stepped-up growth rate could be sustainable?
Lee Shavel : Thanks, Jeff. So I would say the general dimension has been that it has been the normalization of activity across the business in a couple of fronts, driving activity being one of that. I think that has had a positive improvement in some of our antifraud categories. Elizabeth made reference to some of the return to growth in our workers' comp businesses. And I think on the property estimating side, I think we've seen higher and more normalized levels of activity. Some of that -- well, excluding the actual storm revenue, I just -- I think we have seen more activity. I'd ask my colleague, Maroun Mourad, who leads our claims business if there's anything that he'd like to add to that, the general pickup that we've seen in the claims business.
Maroun Mourad : Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. We've been experiencing overall healthy growth across the different claims businesses that we've got. So in addition to the comments made by Elizabeth and Lee around property estimating solutions as well as the casualty workers' comp business, we continue to see the customer engagement that is resulting in very healthy growth activity across our antifraud suite of solutions. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Alexander Hess : This is Alex Hess on for Andrew Steinerman. I want to ask maybe a bit about retention rate and the pressures you saw from Florida? And then as a sort of second part to that question, any sort of operational or balance sheet efficiency statistics you can provide for the standalone insurance Verisk? So to that Florida question, maybe what are -- what was your retention rate in '23 and then -- in '22 and what was it sort of ex Florida?
Lee Shavel : So, Alex, thanks. I would say we are experiencing continued high client retention rates. And I think what we talked about, there's been one liquidation in Florida. And so that's something that we have called out. But I don't think -- and I look to my colleague, Neil Spector, here to see if there are other than that situation, whether we have seen any changes in our overall retention on the underwriting side of the business. So I think those remain very solid. We're watching it carefully because of the risks in Florida. But to date, I think we've only had one liquidation. Neil, anything you'd like to add?
Neil Spector : Thanks, Lee. No, I think you summarized it well. I would just say that while there are potential for liquidations down there, there's also new formations of companies that come into the market because there's need for coverage, which gives us opportunities. So just -- it isn't a one-way flow of businesses exiting, there's businesses entering as well, which helps offset some of that.
Lee Shavel : Thank you. And the question, I don't know on the operational and the balance sheet. Elizabeth, I think, can respond.
Elizabeth Mann : Yes. Thanks for that, Alex. We haven't -- I don't have any specific stats pulled out on that right now. But I think in general, the insurance business is the most cash flow generative and sort of the most capital efficient of our former businesses. It generates strong free cash flow, negative working capital characteristics and high kind of yields on EBITDA.
Lee Shavel : And when I think about balance sheet efficiency, Alex, I think the most striking thing is that with these dispositions, we have released a lot of capital that was not generating as high a return as in our core insurance businesses. And so I think you will see that in the return on invested capital, particularly as we utilize the proceeds to repurchase shares. That's probably the most significant balance sheet efficiency in my mind.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James.
Gregory Peters : Lee, in your comments, you acknowledged all the changes that the company has gone through over the last year. Now that you're laser-focused on the insurance piece, can you talk about how you're tracking customer satisfaction? Specifically, is there something like a comprehensive customer survey that you're using, where you can collect unfiltered feedback rather than just looking at retention numbers and feedback you get at conferences?
Lee Shavel : Yes. Great. Thank you very much. And you really touched on something that we -- I think we have a good system. We undertake a survey and an NPS scoring twice a year. In 2022, that is in the mid-40s, which is consistent with where we've been before the pandemic and through the pandemic. And I think we saw an increase in that during the pandemic as a function of kind of a general lift from working from home, from our clients, some of the features that we offered through client experience that were well received but still a very solid number. So we undertake that, but we also have customer experience unit that is always looking to gauge the feedback that we receive from our clients on product experience. So at that level, we're trying to provide a number of means for them to communicate anonymously their level of satisfaction. I would also say anecdotally, we have intensified our efforts to engage at a senior level, particularly at C-suite with how we are providing value and solving problems for them. The feedback of knowing of -- their feedback to our renewed focus on just the insurance industry has been very positive. The outreach from some clients, where we haven't had a strong relationship, has been very positive, and we've actually seen a higher level of engagement from them as a result. So we're looking at that across at different layers. And so far, I think the response has been positive, and we'll continue to build on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.
Andrew Jeffrey : I appreciate all the sort of succinct summation of the changes you made in your business. And the guidance, I agree, that's really helpful. We also appreciate all the callouts of the business drivers. Now that you're a pure-play, can you -- are there some areas where you think Verisk has particular ability to focus and accelerate growth? I'm thinking about life or extreme event modeling as we think more about climate change. I just wonder if there's more of a laser focus on areas we think Verisk has the ability to really leverage assets and potentially accelerate top line.
Lee Shavel : Yes. Andrew, thank you very much for the question. And I will -- I'll do my best to address it here. But I think we're really excited about drilling into that at Investor Day. So forgive me for another advertisement for Investor Day, but I really think that it will be a great opportunity for you to hear not only what I have to say strategically, but also hear it directly from the business and the investments that we're making. So I'm going to try to limit it to three. The first is, as you referenced, in new areas for us like life insurance and in marketing that are current needs for those businesses that we have the opportunity to penetrate the existing insurance industry or segments of the insurance industry that we have not served before are already delivering significant growth that enhances our overall growth rate. So we will continue to look for those opportunities. The second level is internationally, as we've described, also a penetration opportunity where our international businesses are growing faster. They represent an opportunity for us to deliver some of the data, the analytics and technology into those markets as well as developing new solutions. And so the success that we've had in UK we hope to follow up with success in Canada and in Continental Europe with some of our work there. And that's not just acquisition-driven. It's also integrating some of the features and products that we have in the U.S. And the third element that I would just point to is I think that we have a broader opportunity based upon the conversations that we've -- that I've had with other CEOs and other C-suite clients around the opportunity to improve the efficiency of the broader insurance industry. I think to my earlier point, I think we've been great on the products that are focused on specific underwriting or specific claims applications, but our ability to tie those solutions together, potentially find shared services or more automated solutions to address the hundreds of billions of dollars of expenditure by the industry is an area that has a very strong reception from the clients we've dealt with. One element that I'll tease that has gotten a lot of interest is our ability to digitize more of the forms elements and the standard policy language, which, as you can imagine, can sometimes expand exponentially with tweaks to that language. Being able to manage and track that on a digitized basis is part of the investment that we're making in our core lines reimagine. Those are the types of solutions where we can, given our centrality, given the data sets that we have really revolutionize the way that, that process is being handled, creating efficiencies across the industry as a whole. So that hopefully gives you a little bit of a start in terms of where we think we can find new areas to potentially expand that growth rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.
Jeff Silber : I wanted to focus on your auto underwriting and marketing that you talked about, actually a two-part question. Can you just remind us what your exposure is there? What it was as a percentage of revenues pre-pandemic, what it is now? And what gives you the confidence that these companies can really reset premiums within the next six to 12 months?
Lee Shavel : Yes. So one, I'm going to address the second part first. And then just also ask Elizabeth or Stacey to kind of refresh me on the overall exposure element. But I think we're confident because we are already seeing in a number of regulatory areas that those rate increases are being approved. There was a -- previously a bit of a delay, I think, because of elections that probably created some delay from a regulatory standpoint. We're now seeing those begin to emerge. I think a recognition that the inflationary costs that the auto insurers have borne is something that is legitimate needs to be factored into overall pricing. There are some areas that I think we're concerned about, particularly in California and approvals on that front. But I think we're getting a sense of momentum in those rate increases. And from an overall exposure standpoint...
Elizabeth Mann : Yes, we've said that the auto -- exposure to the auto industry is about 10% of our total insurance revenue.
Jeff Silber : And that's what it was or that's what it is now?
Elizabeth Mann : In general.
Lee Shavel : It has been at that level consistently. It hasn't changed materially.
Operator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik : And first, thank you so much for the guidance details and providing that. I just had a question around the pricing environment. If you could just talk about what pricing -- how pricing fared, I guess, this year and then looking out into '23, if you should expect any incremental improvement versus that?
Lee Shavel : Yes. Thanks, Manav. So as you can appreciate, we have hundreds of products. And so each has a different pricing dynamic reflecting what we view as the demand elements for that, the value that we provide. And first and foremost, our primary pricing philosophy is driven by the value of the product and what it's delivering. And so we are often trying to calibrate pricing to be a fraction of the value that the client received. And when we think about our growth from pricing, it is primarily a reflection of our ability to deliver value to clients.  Now we also recognize that there is an element in our pricing that is tied to net premium growth. We are -- that is a factor. It has been a decreasing factor over time as other products not tied to that have grown faster. But that is an element where we are expecting some lift, given generally stronger premium growth as we've seen in different part of the businesses. And then finally, I would say going into 2023, reflecting somewhat of the higher inflationary environment and the imposed costs on us from a compensation standpoint, we have included a somewhat in certain instances, a higher inflationary component to reflect that reality as we think most of our clients have done in similar situations. So all of those factor into the guidance from a revenue standpoint as it relates to pricing. I would say, however, that while pricing and particularly the value-added element is the most important component, we do also expect contributions from new customers, from upsell with existing products, from growth from our new initiatives and our higher growth to contribute a like amount to our overall growth rate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.
Andrew Nicholas : I wanted to ask just in terms of kind of the top and bottom end of revenue guidance. Is it fair to say that the recovery of some of the headwinds you've called out the past couple of quarters on auto underwriting, marketing solutions and the sort are the primary drivers to the top and bottom end? Or are there other kind of puts and takes to call out that underlie the '23 guidance range?
Elizabeth Mann : Yes. Good question. Yes, as you flagged kind of one of the swing factors between the top and bottom end would be the recovery of some of the more sensitive -- macro sensitive parts of our business like auto. In general, with the 80% subscription revenue, there's a lot of stability in the overall. One or two other environment-related factors that I would point out that could contribute to the difference in that, the top and bottom end of that range as you say, the amount of storm-related revenue is inherently unpredictable, obviously. We have included some assumptions for that in the budget but a sort of moderate assumption in there. And then there's one or two other sort of macro-related factors like the level of cat loss activity and other things that could contribute to that range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alexander Kramm : Quick clean-up question, and sorry if I missed it, I dropped earlier. But I don't think you guided on interest expense, and you gave us a couple of pieces here in terms of paying off some of the debt already in February. So can you just be a little bit more specific on what we should be expecting there? Because I think some people are struggling getting from your EBITDA guide to EPS.
Elizabeth Mann : Yes, it's a great question. We're not giving a specific number on interest guidance, but I can give you some dimensionality to it. I think if you look at our fourth quarter interest expense, that was obviously higher than it was kind of on a run rate basis for the full year. I think for 2023, we would assume that the interest expense is slightly less than it was in the fourth quarter annualized but higher than it was for kind of the full year of '22 or between those two factors.
Operator: Our final question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.
Faiza Alwy : And I just want to say congratulations on executing all the changes in 2022, and thank you from me also on providing guidance. Today, I wanted to just go back on margins and specifically about the 2024 goals. The range is still pretty wide. And wanted to get a sense of what are some of the factors that would take you to the low end of the range versus the high end of the range?
Elizabeth Mann : Yes. Thanks, Faiza, for the question. Really, we're here today to talk about the quarter and the 2023 view. So sort of longer-term discussions, we'll talk about at Investor Day.
Lee Shavel : Yes. And Faiza, I would just say, look, we clearly an objective of delivering on that, and we want to demonstrate our ability to improve that margin. Longer term, I think what we'll talk about are the trade-offs between investment and margin and the value that the investment can deliver in terms of growth and returns. I think that's not a new dynamic. That's something that we have always worked to try to find a balance to demonstrate margin strength, but also not at the cost of delivering where we think value is created most significantly, which is through growth and returns. But we are fully committed to delivering on the guidance that we set initially of that 53% to 56% range, and we're working to deliver a strong result as we possibly can.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time, which concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-11-02 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today’s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk’s Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Savannah, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk’s Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Elizabeth Mann, Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today’s earnings release, I will remind everyone, today’s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk’s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I’d like to also remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions are included in our consolidated and GAAP results, but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation is provided in our 8-K. And now I’d like to turn the call over to our CEO, Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. Before I jump into the earnings results, I want to officially welcome Elizabeth Mann to Verisk. Elizabeth brings operational and corporate finance experience from her three years at S&P Global capital markets and strategic sophistication from her 12 years of investment banking experience at Goldman Sachs, and finally, an impressive academic foundation and enthusiasm for mathematics that fits perfectly into our analytical culture. She is coming up the curve quickly and has already established herself as a valued part of the team. I’m pleased to share that we delivered on our stated intention to become a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. As we announced on Monday, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell Wood Mackenzie to Veritas Capital for $3.1 billion in cash consideration, payable at closing, plus future additional contingent consideration of up to $200 million. Our ability to achieve this result in the midst of a deteriorating deal environment speaks to the quality of the asset and the momentum of the business. Wood Mackenzie is the globally recognized leader in natural resources intelligence, with in-depth proprietary data sets and subject matter experts that cover the full energy and natural resource value chain. Since we acquired Wood Mackenzie in 2015, the business has increased revenue and EBITDA; integrated acquisitions; developed new areas of growth in the energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining; and most recently, upgraded their client platform, Lens. This has transformed Wood Mackenzie from an advisory services business focused on transactional research and consulting to a data analytics business bolstered by long-term subscription contracts, a leading brand and market position. We have been honored to work with and support our friends and colleagues at Wood Mackenzie and we wish them well and look forward to their continued growth and success under the proven leadership of Mark Brinin and Joe Levesque, and their respected future owners, Veritas Capital. The future for Wood Mackenzie is very bright, and we look forward to having an ongoing productive relationship with them. This transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023, will best position Wood Mackenzie to fully capitalize on secular industry tailwinds, including the energy transition and deliver on the growth opportunity that lies ahead. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Going forward, the Wood Mackenzie business will be reported as discontinued operations beginning with Verisk’s fourth quarter earnings report and 10-K filing. We plan to use the approximate $3.1 billion in proceeds, primarily for share repurchases and debt paydown. After accounting for share repurchase and debt paydown, we expect this transaction to be modestly dilutive to Verisk’s earnings in the range of 4% to 6%. That said, over the longer term, we believe the deal will bring Verisk the added benefit of increased focus on our core insurance business, more consistent growth in line with our long-term targets and improved return on capital, which should drive shareholder value. Now let me turn my attention to our third quarter earnings results. Verisk delivered solid third quarter results as we partner with our customers to help them navigate through environmental challenges in the marketplace, including inflation and elevated losses in certain lines of insurance. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, Verisk delivered mid-single-digit organic constant currency revenue growth and margin expansion, resulting in organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7%. This performance reflects our focus on cost discipline, operational efficiency and the early benefits of initial steps taken in previously announced margin improvement initiative. Elizabeth will provide more detail in her financial review. On our EBITDA margin expansion objective, we continue to be confident in our ability to achieve our stated target to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of margin expansion by 2024, an insurance-only baseline of 50% to 51% normalized adjusted EBITDA margins. We have taken actions to enhance operating efficiency, improve productivity and streamline processes. During the quarter, we eliminated certain roles across the organization, sunset legacy products and reduced office square footage. Additionally, we entered into an agreement to sublease our data center to a third-party as we move more of our computing infrastructure to the cloud, delivering long-term savings for Verisk. We have also advanced on our future of data collection project, where we are improving the efficiency and productivity of our field force, which not only saves money, but enhances our solutions. We expect that over the next two years, about half of our identified cost savings will come from headcount actions, about 25% from reductions in spending from IT infrastructure and about 25% from third-party spending, including real estate. To-date, we have made decisions and taken actions to address more than half of the cost savings we are targeting. Turning to our customers. Our Insurance customers continue to be generally healthy while they’re dealing with the cross-currents of inflation and increasing loss ratios, which are negatively impacting profitability across the industry. This is having a disproportionate impact in personal lines, insurtech companies and certain geographic markets. While insurers are increasing rates to help cover inflation in repair costs, it takes time to get rates approved by the regulators and then implement it across the entire book of business. To-date, premium growth has not yet caught up to loss costs. Specifically, in personal auto, we continue to see pressure on underwriting activity across the industry as insurance providers are holding back on writing new business. In fact, combined ratios across the industry continue to trend lower, and as a result, insurers are cutting back on marketing spend as a way to protect profitability. The net result is lower transactional revenues for Verisk across both our personal lines and auto underwriting solutions as well as certain of our marketing solutions. We believe this is a cyclical issue and will abate over time. As we noted last quarter, Florida is a trouble spot for the insurance industry, and the losses from Hurricane Ian add complication. We are experiencing an increasing level of insolvencies across the market, with four companies liquidating just this quarter, while other carriers are electing to exit the market entirely. This has had a negative impact on both our subscription and transactional revenues. To address these issues and drive future growth, our sales teams are engaged with the new entrants into the market as well as expanding our relationship with a state-backed insurer to help price and select risk. We are also working with our existing customers to help them understand the impact of inflation across their book of business and to help them price the risks accordingly as policies come up for renewal. Apart from the near-term challenges, we continue to believe that the opportunity for Verisk to address the long-term strategic and operating needs of the insurance industry remains substantial. In my many conversations with insurance CEOs, they have consistently encouraged us to develop a more strategic dialogue and how we can help the industry address technology, regulatory and operating issues, leveraging our unique and legacy position as an effective utility for the industry. To that objective, we have been coordinating a series of CEO and CIO roundtables to develop solutions that can improve industry operating efficiency and capital efficiency as well as productivity. While these initiatives will take time to develop and implement, they represent a substantial incremental opportunity for Verisk. We are very excited about the opportunity to engage with the industry at the strategic level and broaden our technology partnership with them. In recognition of our commitment to innovate on behalf of clients, Verisk was recognized by Celent as a Luminary for developing innovative solutions that help property, casualty and life insurers detect claims fraud. Our solutions were recognized by highly advanced functionality and ability to integrate with third-party data, driving faster outcomes and a more accurate claims experience. Similarly, we are committed to creating value for our employees, which includes providing an exceptional workplace. And we were awarded the Great Place to Work designation this year in the U.S., UK, India, Spain and New York. We were also recognized as a Great Place to Work for Women in the UK. In today’s rapidly evolving workplace, we are focused on talent attraction, development and retention by supporting our teammates’ passion and having a purpose-driven culture that allows unlimited success. Finally, as a demonstration of our commitment to ESG priorities, Verisk has been ranked third out of 100 Best ESG Companies in 2022 by Investor’s Business Daily. The list recognized companies with superior environmental, social and governance ratings, in addition to fundamental and technical stock performance. We are honored to receive this recognition for our commitment to sustainability and the ability of our strong and growing business to meet customer and investor expectations. As we move forward, I am more confident than ever that with our proprietary data sets, talented and dedicated people, deep industry knowledge and technical expertise, Verisk is best positioned to create value for our customers by helping them evolve in a new digital environment, integrate rapidly growing data sets and achieve new levels of efficiency. This, in turn, will create value for our employees and shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Mark for some more color on the Insurance business performance.
Mark Anquillare: Thanks, Lee. I’m pleased to share that the Insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. In Insurance, we are experiencing strong growth in subscription revenues across both underwriting and claims, resulting in OCC subscription growth of 6.1% for the segment overall. Within Underwriting, we had strong results from core underwriting, extreme event solutions and our international businesses. We also had healthy contribution with double-digit growth achieved in certain of our newer acquired businesses, including life insurance and specialty business software solutions. Extreme event solutions had a strong quarter, driven by the addition of new customers to our core Touchstone Platform as well as the expansion of multi-year deals with existing customers. New environment of rising inflation, insurers and reinsurers are challenged to keep up with the growth in their exposures. To help our customers understand the risk of the inflation and assess their exposures, we recently released our 2022 Global Modeled Catastrophe Losses Report, detailing key global financial loss metrics based on our latest suite of catastrophe models. Additionally, we are supporting insurers with a broad array of property data solutions so that they can ensure they’re keeping up with the impacts of inflation and have a more informed view of risk and ongoing exposures. Our sustainability and country risk business also had a very strong quarter as demand for our risk indices in both the corporate and investor segments continue to drive strong double-digit growth. We’re also beginning to get traction with the expansion of our sustainability offerings into the Insurance segment. Within Life Insurance, we’re delivering strong double-digit growth through the addition of new customers as well as the expansion of our relationships with existing customers. Our low-code, no-code technology is leading the industry’s modernization by helping carriers gain efficiencies and improve profitability at scale with a simpler technology ecosystem and a faster time for implementation. We continue to be excited about the growth potential for our Life business. And our success here serves as a great blueprint for our ability to drive growth and value creation through the extension into large, addressable and adjacent insurance markets. Insurance transactional revenues grew a more modest 1.8%. This quarter’s transactional revenues were negatively impacted by a lower level of storm activity versus the prior year when Hurricane Ida made landfall in Louisiana, as well as the environmental impact of software results in our personal auto underwriting and marketing businesses. We do expect to see some benefit in the fourth quarter from Hurricane Ian claims, but we caution that some of this can be offset by more liquidations or insolvencies within the core insurance market. Additionally, we expect the environmental headwinds in personal auto and marketing to persist. In our effort to advance the dialogue and our work on ethical AI and algorithm preparedness, we recently coordinated and sponsored the Insurance Fairness Forum, where we presented on social fairness, pricing and underwriting for insurance, with a preliminary study focused on personal auto rate-making. During the conference, we engaged with consumer advocates, insurance regulators, as we want to ensure that we’re at the forefront of the conversation on this very important topic. The insurance industry is inherently trying to differentiate, selecting and pricing risks, but our goal is to ensure that there is no unfair discrimination. In our customer conversations, we hear that they need help to become more automated, more digitally engaged and more connected. The insurance industry is directing their spending towards these projects and, in turn, to Verisk, as a key ecosystem partner to drive these initiatives forward, which has been a key driver of growth for us. The industry continues to look to us to innovate and respond to recent industry events with leading-edge solutions. For example, our Verisk teams responded to Hurricane Ian by helping clients track damage, dispatch adjusters and staff, estimate the cost to repair the damage and speed the claims process to get properties repaired and safely return families to their homes. Our catastrophe loss estimate of $42 billion to $57 billion was an early and accurate estimate of insured losses related to Hurricane Ian, allowing insurers and reinsurers to understand the impact on their portfolios. In California, insurers face new regulatory measures to address rating, property coverage, wildfire from areas. Verisk is helping our customers comply with these new regulations. We continue to help our customers select and price risk and root out fraud with our advanced data and analytics, and believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow as we advance our mission to become the trusted technology partner for the industry. Now let me turn the call over to our new CFO, Elizabeth Mann, for financial review.
Elizabeth Mann: Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you here on the call. I’m so happy to be here at Verisk and speaking to you today. I have admired the company and its phenomenal insurance business for over a decade as I worked in the information services sector. And now is a particularly exciting time to join as we have an opportunity to redefine our strategy as a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. We can now focus our capital and all of our industry knowledge to support the needs of our customers, as Lee and Mark have already highlighted. As I’ve joined Verisk over the last six weeks, and I’ve been getting to know the people and digging into the business, I’ve been focused on a few priorities. The first is a focus on cost discipline and execution against the margin targets we’ve committed. Second, Lee has established a framework for capital allocation and ROIC metrics, which I intend to continue. The resulting transparency and accountability on our deployment of capital will support our ability to invest with confidence to drive top line growth and strong returns. Third, I will prioritize investor engagement, gathering feedback and providing transparency into the business. So I look forward to getting out on the road and meeting all of you. Let me now turn to our third quarter results. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that all consolidated and GAAP numbers are negatively impacted by the recent dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. This effect will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will anniversary those transactions. As noted, due to its materiality, Wood Mackenzie will be accounted for as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the third quarter of 2022, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue was $745 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of recent dispositions and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds, which are most pronounced in our Energy segment, offset in part by acquisitions. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 6% to $189 million while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk decreased 3% to $1.20. The decline was primarily due to the dispositions within the former Energy and Specialized Markets and Verisk Financial Services segments, including the loss incurred as part of the true-up of the closing adjustments. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are pleased with our operating results, led by continued growth in our subscription revenues. In the third quarter, OCC revenues grew 4.8%, driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment and continued sequential improvement in our Energy segment. Our subscription revenues increased 5.6% while our transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.2%. Adjusting for $3.3 million in prior year revenue associated with our Energy business in Russia, OCC revenue would have grown 5.3% and subscription revenues would have grown 6.2%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6% in the third quarter. Normalizing for the prior year revenue associated with our Energy in Russia and the incremental expenses associated with exiting that business, OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results, was 51.5%, up 160 basis points from the year prior, reflecting strong cost and operational discipline as well as the benefit from recent dispositions. This level of margin includes approximately 60 basis points of headwind from recent acquisitions; 50 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including cloud expenses, which we absorbed into our cost structure; and 40 basis points from higher year-over-year T&E expenses. Despite the environment and cyclical headwinds to margin, this quarter’s margin expansion is further demonstration of our commitment to efficiency. On that note, let’s turn to our segment results on an OCC basis. For Insurance. In the third quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 5.3%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics, extreme events, life insurance and specialty business solutions. Subscription revenues increased 6.1%, reflecting tougher comparisons versus last year’s 7.9% growth as well as the impact of some of the environmental factors Lee and Mark spoke about earlier. Transactional revenues increased 1.8% in the quarter, reflecting a lower level of storm activity in the quarter as well as continued softness from personal auto, underwriting and marketing. This was offset in part by strong recovery growth in international travel insurance solutions. Within workers’ compensation, we have seen a return to modest growth, though the business is not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.9% in the third quarter while margins declined 70 basis points to 55.2%. These margins reflect a heavier burden from the corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed as well as the impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the partial normalization of travel expenses back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investment in our high-growth areas like life insurance and specialty business solutions and the impact of recently acquired businesses. Energy and Specialized Markets. Revenue increased 2.5% in the third quarter. Normalizing for the impact of our exit from Russia, Energy revenue growth was 5.2%. Our subscription revenues increased 3.5% or 6.8%, normalizing for the Russian exit, led by double-digit growth in energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining research, coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. Additionally, we continue to experience strong adoption and contract expansion from our Lens renewals. Transactional revenues decreased 1.8% as growth was constrained by consulting resources. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.2% in the third quarter, and margins contracted 210 basis points to 34.4%. These adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin figures include $0.2 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for that impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 7.8%. On taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.7% compared to 20.9% in the prior year quarter. This higher year-over-year tax rate was the result of lower level of stock option activity versus the prior year. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we expect the tax rate in the fourth quarter to be approximately 24% to 26%, reflecting the impact of discontinued operations as well as a lower than originally expected level of stock option activity. On adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS. Adjusted net income decreased 1.9% to $230 million, and diluted adjusted EPS increased 1.4% to $1.46 for the third quarter of 2022. These changes reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count, offset in part by the impact of divestitures and the higher interest expense and tax rate. For free cash flow, net cash provided by operating activities was $280 million for the quarter, down 1.8% from the prior year period due to the loss of operating cash flows related to the dispositions. Normalizing for the impact of the 3E and Verisk Financial Services dispositions, free cash flow would have been up 7.5%. Capital expenditures were $66 million for the quarter, up 7% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We now expect capital expenditures for the full year to be within the range of $270 million to $280 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment into core underwriting, where we believe there is a significant opportunity for platform enhancement. In addition, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $195 million to $205 million, and intangible amortization should be approximately $145 million for the full year 2022. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to foreign currency variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects and future M&A activity. On capital returns. During the third quarter, we returned $349 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to consistently return capital to shareholders while also investing in the business. Additionally, in October of 2022, we entered into a new $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement to be completed in the fourth quarter, as is our normal practice. Looking ahead, we plan to optimize the use of proceeds from the sale of Wood Mackenzie while also maintaining our leverage range. We will achieve this through a combination of debt paydown and share repurchases and may act opportunistically from a timing standpoint. Before I turn the call back over to Lee, I just want to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Day in March, where we will provide more transparency and clarity on our strategic and financial profile and growth drivers as a global insurance-focused data analytics and technology company. And now I will turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Elizabeth. In summary, our business is strong, as evidenced by our organic constant currency, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA growth of 7% and strong margin performance in the quarter. We are confident that we have the team in place to execute on our operational efficiency plans over the next two years and deliver on our margin expansion targets. Longer-term, we continue to believe as well that the opportunity to create value for our customers and employees will drive value for our shareholders. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I’ll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And with that we will take our first question from Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: Congrats, Elizabeth, and look forward to working with you. Lee thanks for providing the details on the impact of the divestiture. I was just wondering if you could provide some underlying assumptions. Any color on that? If there is any tax leakage, how does the tax increase for the remaining companies, stranded cost? Any color on those fronts will be helpful. Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Ashish. First, let me say on the question on tax leakage. The $3.1 billion in proceeds, I think, if your question is directed towards that, we are not expecting any significant tax leakage. There may be some upside for us on that modestly. But we think that we will be able to deploy the full amount of that in share repurchases and debt paydowns. As it relates to the future tax rate, we have provided some guidance for the fourth quarter. But we – it’s obviously a complex issue that we are working through in terms of the longer-term impact. It depends upon the composition of the business overall, and we would intend to provide more clarity for that as we look ahead. I think it’s fair to assume, of course, kind of as implicated in the fourth quarter, that our effective tax rate will be higher. But we’ll try to provide more specific guidance as we sort that out and in the time frame that we typically do with our fourth quarter earnings results.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question will come from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Go ahead.
Jeff Meuler: Thank you. Lee or Mark, maybe if you could just give us a more holistic perspective on what the adjacent market opportunity is for you as you focus your efforts in capital on insurance. You talked about life being a blueprint for extension into adjacent markets, and you talked about developing solutions. That’s an incremental opportunity for you coming out of the CEO and CIO roundtables. But maybe if you could just give us more holistically address just how you see addressable market or adjacent opportunities.
Lee Shavel: Sure. Thank you, Jeff. I’m going to take a first crack at it and then hand it over to Mark for his perspective. But the one way that we’re looking at this is we’re looking at the totality of the insurance industry spend in aggregate. And that’s a very substantial number in kind of the [indiscernible] and Jeff, I think you may be rattling a paper there. But we’re looking at that aggregate amount. And I think as we’ve talked to investors previously, when we look at the amount of revenue that Verisk generates from the insurance industry relative to their operating costs, it is a 40 to 45 basis point amount. And we think that there’s a broader opportunity for us to address their marketing spend in finding efficiencies, in finding solutions to drive productivity gains, to find efficiencies on technology spend, which are substantially larger opportunities for us relative to the scale of what we’re doing. So that will give you a sense of why we think that’s a substantial opportunity. And we’ve been engaged in addressing a lot of those with current initiatives that we look to expand on. And I know Mark can certainly speak to some of the things that we’ve been doing on that front.
Mark Anquillare: Super. So maybe I’ll try to give you three examples. We talked about life. But even within life, we have the ability to continue to extend into group life. We are focused today from a life insurance perspective primarily in the United States. We can go international. To the extent you think about other lines of insurance, other lines of business related to life, you have disability. That’s an opportunity for us. We see opportunities to extend into pet insurance, travel insurance. Those are some examples of like customer sets that we don’t operate in. I’ll make the obvious example, but I just do want to remind everybody that from a marketing perspective, that is a huge customer set, the marketing departments inside of insurers that we just never really dealt with before, and now we have access to through some recent acquisitions. And it really is forming the foundation of how we kind of go to market with some of our customers, really helping them understand the best target markets and where and how to price. Last but not least, you have heard it throughout the themes here. We think we can do more from a software and technology platform perspective with our customers. We don’t deal with the CIO as being the chief information officers inside of our major customers. And we see ourselves as a technology player and has been a strong partner to them. So hopefully, that helps.
Lee Shavel: Yes. And Jeff, I think you see there are three dimensions there that we’re talking about. One is a functional orientation. And so that’s Mark speaking to the marketing opportunity. We see similar opportunities on the technology side. And then operationally, there is the business line opportunity or dimension that we’re looking at with travel and other areas. And then, of course, there is the international, where we feel as though the opportunity to bring some of that expertise. All of those are – create, I think, a broad envelope for us to look to expand on what we’re doing.
Jeff Meuler: Thank you, both.
Operator: Our next question will come from Alex Kramm with UBS Financial. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a quick follow-up to Ashish’s question. But since you didn’t report this quarter as discontinued operation but will next, maybe you can give us the apples-to-apples EBITDA margin, how it would have been if it would have been a discontinued operation already? And if you can’t add into that specifically, maybe outline what the stranded or servicing costs related to Wood Mac will be and how they will fade away over time. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Alex, thanks for the question. We’re not at the point where we have broken through both the combination of the adjustments that we’re making in the overhead costs or the overhead allocation. So I think that is something that we’ll look to provide more input on as we move ahead, probably with the fourth quarter earnings, where we’ll have that discontinued operations. Our focus has been on getting the transaction done. As you can imagine, that has been, I think, a pretty solid accomplishment in a difficult market. It will take time for us to sort through the accounting consequences now that we understand that, and there are a lot of transitional elements that we need to take into account. So it’s not a simple metrics to us.
Alex Kramm: Understood. Thanks.
Operator: And our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. Thanks very much. Wanted to ask about your pricing, how that’s looking for 2023. I know you mentioned the insurers currently trying to put through sizable rate increases to cover inflation. I guess, will you be able to benefit from that by being able to increase your subscription prices? How should we think about the magnitude of price increases next year versus 2022 or versus a normal year, however you want to break that out? Thanks.
Mark Anquillare: Yes. Thank you, Toni. I appreciate. This is Mark. Let me first remind everybody, we do have some connectivity of pricing to premium volumes. The utility of our products are seen and demonstrated through the premiums they write. So to the extent that it’s a harder market or meaning price is going up and there’s more premium, we will see that on a little bit of a lag effect. To your more direct and short-term, I think what we’re trying to do is really balance the opportunity to hopefully maybe take a little bit more price, only because, like everybody, we’re incurring some more costs around labor and other inflationary type of spend. But at the same time, we’re in it for the long-term. And what we’re trying to do is make sure that we are able to sell new products, new solutions to customers and not cause any short-term angst degree with regard to pricing today.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. You just called out kind of broader insurance inflation pressures, I guess, and then more specifically, the Florida issues as well. Is there any way to quantify how much each of that impacted the growth? And how long should this headwind continue?
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Manav. So these are – there are a variety of factors, some of which are difficult to kind of fully separate. I’m going to ask Mark to kind of give his perspective on both impact and sustainability of these effects that you’re asking about.
Mark Anquillare: So quantifying is difficult. So I’m going to maybe qualify – kind of quantify, I apologize. So inside the auto market, what we’re seeing is just a general theme of people trying to write less business or quote less new business. They are waiting for their rate filings to be implemented and in turn, wait for higher prices or higher premium before they write. So that seems like a depression that will occur and be soft, I would guess, probably for another six months or so into 2023. That’s our take. But at the same time, it is something that cyclically will come and will go, so we expect it to rebound. Two, Florida is clearly a challenge. There has been an insurer last resort. Basically, rates there have been subsidized when people try to get into the market. They’ve been hurt by large cat and inside of those new customers and those existing customers that are going out of business. That does affect us and will be – let me say it this way, that will be a little bit longer term. Ultimately, new emerging insurers will rise. We will hopefully serve them. We are working with them now, but that will take time. So that rebound would probably be over the course of a year or more, I would say, in that regard. I think the last comment that you were referring to or at least we’re referring to is the workers’ comp space. We did see some growth this quarter. At the same time, the market is still depressed. Some of that is regulation, I think I’ve highlighted in the past. Some of it, I do believe it’s just the fact that the work-from-home environment leads to fewer claims in the future. So I think we’ve started to anniversary the challenge. I think it will start to rebound a bit. I don’t want to be optimistic, but I would assume that should occur in 2023 at some point. I hope those are the three trends or themes that you were talking about. The other thing that affected us a little timing was storms. Obviously, Ida last year, Ian this year, both pretty big storms affecting different quarters.
Lee Shavel: Yes. And I would add one other dimension, Manav, which is I think that what we’ve seen is kind of fairly solid subscription growth. I think that what you saw in 2022 was some weakness on the transactional revenue growth. And I think it will probably manifest itself, some of these trends in – some sustaining of that weaker growth into 2023 if these dynamics have the impact that we described. But again, also subject to variability on storm levels, but hopefully, that’s helpful.
Manav Patnaik: Yes, thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, it’s Andrew. I’m going to ask you about Verisk’s ongoing organic revenue growth goal of 7%. And my question is, how long will it take Verisk Insurance to get there? And what needs to happen? And where your comments about Florida workers’ comp going to hold us back from getting there?
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Andrew. So we certainly understand that. What I will first say and reiterate that our confidence in that long-term target remains in place given what we see as the opportunities in front of us. I think when you look at what we’ve even achieved in 2021 at a more challenging environment, where we had two quarters of organic revenue growth above 7% clearly demonstrates the ability of the insurance – of our insurance business to achieve that. We’ve had some weakness related to pandemic effects, such as lower driving activity, impact on workers’ comp. And I think, to Mark’s comments, we are seeing some weakness as a result of the economic environment, but we’re also seeing recovery in some of the pandemic-related effects. And I think that biases us towards stronger performance ahead from a growth perspective as we come out of some of these stronger elements. Some of the macroeconomics may persist, but I think we’re seeing kind of more momentum towards that target ahead. That would be the way, I think, about it, both from a longer-term perspective, which we are still confident that we can deliver on that. We have to work our way through, I think, the conflicting impacts of some recovery from pandemic impacts and then some of the more sustained macroeconomic, which, I think, are of a lower magnitude than what we experienced through the pandemic.
Andrew Steinerman: Got it, thanks Lee.
Operator: The next question will come from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Greg Peters: Yes, good morning, everyone. I guess, I’ll step back and ask a bigger picture question. I heard in your comments, Lee, about talking with all your customers and trying to partner with them to help innovate, et cetera, and that’s going to require investment in your business. And so I guess, what I’m getting at here is, just to go back and sort of reset or recast a die in how you’re going to balance the desire to improve margins. And you’re sending out some margin targets versus the need really, to invest in your business in order to help your customers get the innovation they’re looking for.
Lee Shavel: Greg, thanks for the question. And particularly – I would particularly value your perspective and knowledge around the insurance industry. And so you probably better understand better than most the challenges that the insurance industry is facing. And so let me kind of break that apart. I think the opportunity to invest in these new opportunities have generated both growth and very strong returns for the internal investments that we have made in a variety of areas. And I would probably cite our LightSpeed product, where we’ve been able to accelerate delivery of quote to – a bindable quote to the point of sale, has generated a very strong economic growth for us and a very good return on capital. So we’re looking for similar elements to that. We’ve been talking about our investment in the core lines, reimagined initiative to migrate a lot of our data and services into that new technology platform, which delivers substantially greater value for our clients on that front, opening up, I think new opportunities for growth and certainly a high return that we can generate on that. So those – and the third point that I would make is that on the margin efficiency target, that has been focused on looking at – not at cutting investment within the business, but looking for areas of opportunity from an operational efficiency perspective within the business that, I think, it’s been a very healthy exercise for us that we’ve demonstrated progress against, but it hasn’t come at the cost of us pursuing these overall opportunities. So I think if you – the fundamental concern is, look, we’re hearing that there are a lot of opportunities to invest. How does that – does that conflict with the margin objective? I don’t believe so. I think that we can continue to make these investments. We can deliver on the operational efficiencies within the business to drive that margin improvement and continue to generate very solid growth and strong returns on capital.
Greg Peters: I appreciate the additional color.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Greg.
Operator: The next question will come from George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. With respect to the Wood Mackenzie sale proceeds, how are you thinking about splitting the $3.1 billion between debt paydown and share repurchases? Do you have a target leverage multiple in mind for the stand-alone insurance company?
Lee Shavel: Thank you, George. I’m going to hand that over to Elizabeth to address.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes, hey George, thanks for asking. Like we said, we’re going to balance it between debt paydown and share repurchases. We don’t – we haven’t established a precise number for debt paydown, other than to state there’s no change to our target leverage range of 2x to 3x in order to maintain our investment-grade rating. Within that, we’ll look to optimize, over time, kind of the best balance of interest savings versus share repurchases. And either way, the majority of it, the significant majority will be on share repurchase. But either way, sort of farther to where we end up within that fairly small range, we’ll still be within the accretion dilution range that we quoted.
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. I appreciate taking the question. Mark, I’m intrigued when I hear you talk about some of these new markets, which really would be true extensions for Verisk, pet being one, I think, that you mentioned. I’m wondering if you have – do you think you have the data and the kind of digital customer-facing solutions that you might need to expand into those markets? Or if you think you’re going to need to add capabilities to be able to penetrate those new markets and drive new revenue streams.
Mark Anquillare: So Andrew, great question. I appreciate that. I think when we attack new markets, we typically go at it with a theory that we could build some great models. And then as data information starts to flow, we can improve those models. So pet as an example. What we do with travel is not that travel, you would think like, boy, I missed my flight. It’s going to being short. This is the type of travel that focuses on somebody who has a pre-existing medical condition. And to the extent that they’re traveling, how do they get the right medical. So that is a modeled outcome and that has kind of the data we have around it. We can apply those type of models to pets, dogs, cats, more traditional pets, in a way that we can understand how health of the pet and existing conditions cause and will affect payouts. So I hope that’s just an example of ways we can kind of adjust our models. I think the digital engagement and the way we’ve gone at those things are very best-in-class and very digitally engaged. So I think we’re well-positioned there. We do not hold the same data advantage that we do in some of the United States’ admitted lines. But that doesn’t cause us to shy away from and actually provides us with an opportunity to find a way to gather some information. I hope that’s responsive.
Andrew Jeffrey: Yes. I look forward to seeing your progress there.
Operator: And our next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jeff Silber: Thanks so much. That’s close enough. I want to go back to Manav’s question where you parsed out some of the environmental impacts affecting the business. I understand the impacts on the non-subscription revenue. But I was just curious on the subscription side in terms of the slowdown. I know if you’ve got customers that go bankrupt, obviously, that’s an impact. But why are we seeing the slowdown in subscription revenue? And is that something we should expect to continue? Thanks.
Mark Anquillare: Yes. So one of the things I think we tried to do is to share that, even though you would think of subscriptions as being this wonderfully flat ride from quarter-to-quarter, even inside of our subscription businesses, when we bring on new customers, where we have some anniversary of dates, there is a little bit of an up and down inside that. So to the extent that you look at this year’s subscription to last year’s, I think that’s a good rule of thumb. If you look at it quarter-by-quarter, there’s some up and downs. I would not read anything into subscription level growth in the quarter. Everything is very solid, and everything is running as we would expect. So I will kind of reinforce Lee’s earlier comments about the subscription growth being strong and more optimistic.
Jeff Silber: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Faiza Alwy: Hey guys. Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to focus a little bit more on the insurance-specific margins. And I think those came in a lot better than what we had talked about. Because I think, previously, you had talked about those margins declining in line with year-to-date that you had seen in the second quarter. So I’m curious what drove the upside? I think it sounds like you’ve made some progress around your cost savings initiatives that you had talked about. So maybe just address how much that contributed to margins and how we should think about it in the fourth quarter. And maybe, Lee, if you can talk about if your confidence in those targets has improved as you’ve done some work around them.
Elizabeth Mann: Yes. Thanks, Faiza. Thanks for the question. Let me comment a bit on the Insurance-only margin for Q3. While it was a slight year-over-year decline, I think we reminded you that, that was offsetting some of the headwinds in the baseline that included the reallocation of corporate expenses from the divestitures. It included the impact of recent acquisitions, which are themselves lower-margin businesses, and it offsets our investment in cloud and the return of T&E expenses. Offsetting those, there is the natural kind of operating leverage in the business and business growth. So those things kind of offset each other. The one other thing I might call out in the quarter there is it’s also offsetting a slight decrease in the pension credit, which happened at the corporate level. And so the Insurance business had its allocation of that component. And that is expected to continue in the fourth quarter. More generally, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter for Insurance, these headwinds will continue. The impact may not be exactly linear quarter-to-quarter, so that could move around.
Lee Shavel: Yes. And what Elizabeth is describing, Faiza, is that underneath the overall margin performance, when you kind of strip away the reallocations, there is still a very strong operating leverage that is expressing itself in terms of looking at it before we look at kind of the non-operational elements. And so that’s the core of the business, and that’s how we will drive EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth. On the second part of your question, the confidence that we have on achieving our targets is driven by a very methodical process that we’ve gone through to identify all areas of potential savings that – as we indicated on the call, that we have identified and taken actions that address over half of that target at this point. And we have line of sight on additional opportunities that we’ll be pursuing over time. Part of these will be influenced by the transitional demands of the separation of our businesses. And so we have transition service obligations for those until those businesses are separated. That’s a factor. And we wanted to see how those sorted out before we worked towards the further or the additional decisions that we need to make to achieve that. But we feel very confident in our ability to meet those expectations.
Faiza Alwy: Great. Very helpful. Thank you, both.
Operator: Our next question will come from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Stephanie Moore: Hey, good morning. I was hoping to get a bit more color on just the international business, maybe some update on how it performed during the quarter and kind of your expectations going forward. Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Sure. Thank you, Stephanie. So I would start off by saying that our international businesses and, obviously, I’m going to presume that the question is directed to our Insurance international businesses. Wood Mackenzie, of course, is an international business, but we kind of covered that in the call. But on the Insurance side, we have a variety of businesses, on the Claims and on the Underwriting side, probably, most significantly, our Specialty business services or what was formerly known as Sequel, that addresses the Lloyds non-standard market with a workflow platform and management system for that market. That continues to have great success in delivering a very compelling solution, both on the front end of business origination, pricing and rating and then, ultimately, kind of the policy management side. That has continued to drive double-digit growth. And we’ve seen similar performance from a lot of the other international businesses that we’ve had. I’ll turn it over to Mark for some additional color perhaps on the businesses other than Specialty business.
Mark Anquillare: Well, I think you had it right. I think we are seeing growth there, which is in excess of our U.S. business. What I also like to highlight, although not organic at this point, the acquisition of Opta, which is a business intelligence solution up in Canada, is a wonderful business, very much aligned with what we do. And the synergies that we anticipated are greater than we anticipated. So I think we’re making great progress there, and it’s a really nice addition to the Verisk family.
Stephanie Moore: Great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.
Andrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on kind of the end-market health and the insurers profitability pressures. I understand that there are some environmental factors here that seem a bit more temporary: auto market, Florida, workers’ comp and the like. But are you seeing that lead into kind of the more kind of core traditional conversations? Has there been any impact on the sales cycle in your P&C business or the pipeline? Just trying to understand if some of these issues are truly concentrated in the items that you called out, or if there is the risk of this being a bit more pervasive. Thank you.
Mark Anquillare: Yes, good question. I mean, I think you’ve read it. You’ve seen it. I mean the insurance industry is, like many, under a little bit of pressure. Inflationary costs and inflation in general is causing pain to their bottom line. The cat, along with some other cats, I mean, another big year, probably $100 billion of losses. So that creates stress and pressure on them to look at costs, look at ways. They can be more focused on underwriting and underwriting discipline. So I would tell you that we have this wonderful business that continues to have a wonderful spot inside of their key decisions. And we have not seen anybody trying to move away, but there is definitely pressure there. There is definitely people scrutinizing every purchase and scrutinizing when and how they buy. So we are seeing some of that. And we’ve highlighted some of the areas where it’s been most – fall more on the transactional side.
Lee Shavel: And Andrew, I want to extend on Mark’s comment because that near-term pressure that you’re asking too specifically is part of what we’re experiencing, but it also creates that broader opportunity because that focus on how do we address the impact of those inflationary costs, not just on our loss and loss adjustment expenses, but also on our operational efficiency and the inflation that we’re experiencing that, is driving a more robust dialogue around automation, how we can utilize data to better select risk, how we can improve the processes by creating more connections through the ecosystem to handle a lot of the steps that are probably not as efficient as we could be. So I think that while it is creating that – some of that near-term pressure, it is also bringing a greater urgency and focus, as I described, in the strategic orientation of our client CEOs around how do we solve industry problems that can create a lot of value and savings for them.
Andrew Nicholas: Makes sense. Thanks for the color.
Operator: And our final question will come from Heather Balsky with Bank of America.
Heather Balsky: Thanks for taking my question. I’d love to get an update from you guys on your cloud transformation and how it’s progressing. And then just any color you can give on the implementation costs and then when you kind of expect to see some savings, and what type of savings? And then just with regards to your margin expansion goals, does that incorporate the cost of implementation rolling off and those savings flowing through? Or is that incremental to that target?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thanks, Heather. And I would – so with regard to cloud transformation, in prior calls, we identified the fact that we’re in kind of the final year of that implementation. And we have achieved – this is a very important distinction. We have achieved operating cash savings when you look at our incremental cloud expenses netted against what would have previously been CapEx expenditure in the business. And so that’s – we believe that it has delivered real cash savings to us. However, it’s important to understand that, that, from an accounting standpoint, from an EBITDA perspective, means that we have added EBITDA expense to our P&L. And so that has come on. We’ve been able to adjust that, but we’re effectively converting depreciation and amortization to EBITDA expense. That’s why you’ll hear us talk about the headwinds from the cloud and the cloud implementation. We do think that, that incremental cost is one that we are substantially through. And in addition, we have been able to take out the OpEx expense through some of the outsourcing to that third party that we described earlier in the call. All of that is included in the – in our overall margin improvement targets. So as we have realized those savings, that is factored into the margin element, particularly the outsourcing of our legacy data centers. I think that addresses the two parts of your question.
Heather Balsky: Thank you very much.
Operator: And that will conclude today’s earnings conference call. Thank you very much for participating, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-08-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Chris, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2022 financial results. On the call today are Lee Shavel, Verisk's Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Grover, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, on our website and by dial-in. As set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Finally, I'd also like to remind everyone that the financial results for recent dispositions included in our consolidated and GAAP results, but are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation is provided in our 8-K. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Verisk's CEO, Lee Shavel.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered solid second quarter results. As you review the financial results, please be aware that due to the dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services, certain year-over-year comparisons will be distorted by the impacts of these transactions. For example, the decrease in our free cash flow year-over-year was primarily the result of a significant tax on the realized gain from the sale of 3E. Dave will provide more details in his financial review. Second quarter organic constant currency revenue grew approximately 5% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 4%. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, organic constant currency revenue grew approximately 6% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 6%. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 140 basis points to 51% through cost discipline, operational efficiencies, the benefit of decisions affecting recent portfolio actions and some very early steps taken in our previously announced margin improvement initiative. This level of margin also includes headwinds from cloud transition and a partial normalization of travel and entertainment expenses as we continue to hold more in-person conferences and visits as we engage with our customers. While overall organic constant currency revenue growth, excluding Russian revenues was below our long-term targets, we saw solid performance in our subscription revenues offset by weakness in our transactional revenues due to the continued impact of the work from home environment on certain businesses as we'll describe. We did see sequential improvements in the second quarter, reflecting some normalization in certain businesses including international travel. Subscription revenue organic constant currency growth excluding Russian revenues of approximately 7%, representing 81% of total revenue was solid and improved sequentially in both insurance and energy. Insurance OCC subscription revenues were above our 7% long-term target, demonstrating the mission critical nature of our solutions. Energy subscription growth improved sequentially as positive pricing momentum from our Lens investment and strong annual contract value growth begins to convert into revenue growth. We also had strong growth in our energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining research. Transactional organic constant currency revenue growth of approximately 2%, representing 19% of total revenue, improved slightly in the quarter with sequential improvement in insurance due to the solid underwriting growth offset by weaker performance and claims due to ongoing declines in workers' compensation claims volumes across the industry of at least 25%. And new regulations that went into effect in early 2022 that are slowing claims settlement. In addition, we are also experiencing some softness in personal lines auto related to the market dislocation as Mark will describe in his section. We have seen normalization progress across our businesses and expect this to continue. However, several of these impacts are having longer cycle recovery times than we originally expected. Energy transactional revenue declined modestly on an organic constant currency basis, due primarily to resource constraints in our consulting business as a result of strong demand from our professionals, particularly in [technical difficulty] region as well as tough compares versus last year's rebound level growth rates. You can find more details about our subscription and transactional growth rates by segment in our quarterly earnings deck, which can be found in the Investors section of our website. Since taking over the CEO role at the end of May, I've been meeting with the leadership teams of many of our key customers and stakeholders. In these valuable conversations where I'm learning how we can improve, I hear repeatedly that Verisk is a critical partner with a unique seat to analyze performance and technology across the industries we serve and most importantly, implement technology change for the benefit of all of our clients. As one of our clients put it not only do we need to Verisk help on this issue, the industry needs your help. Our value proposition is clear. Verisk strategically invests in data and technology at scale to deliver economic value to our customers through operational efficiencies and better decision making. In both the insurance and energy industries, we benefit from the growing demand for data analytics from our customers, along with their increased ability to ingest and use our rapidly growing datasets. We deliver greater value per dollar invested than our clients would be able to individually and we are in an advantaged position as few companies enjoy closer ties to and a greater understanding of their clients businesses than Verisk. This is a responsibility that we do not take lightly, as it is this unique proposition that will power our growth and drive long-term value creation for shareholders, customers and employees. As we focus and define the strategic orientation over 2022, we expect to lay out our plans in greater detail at an Investor Day in the first quarter of 2023, following the reporting of our fourth quarter 2022 results. During the second quarter, we made a series of new leadership announcements as we build out the team that will lead Verisk forward. Of importance to many of you on this call, we recently announced that Elizabeth Mann will be joining Verisk as our Chief Financial Officer. Elizabeth joins us from S&P Global, where she was the Chief Financial Officer of Ratings and Mobility divisions. And before that she was Senior Vice President of Capital Management, which included oversight of the Treasury department Elizabeth will bring very relevant experience and a fresh perspective that I know will improve our organization financially and operationally. She will be joining us on September 15, and we look forward to introducing her to you and she will welcome your perspectives as she comes up the curve on Verisk. In addition, we recently announced that Maroun Mourad has been named President of Claims Solutions. Maroun has been a key leader in our Underwriting and Rating business since 2015, serving as President of ISO, Commercial Lines, President, Global Underwriting and most recently President, Life & Growth markets. Maroun brings deep industry expertise from as many leadership roles at Gen Re, AIG, Arch and Zurich across underwriting, operations and general management. He also brings a great entrepreneurial spirit and a true customer-centric approach to the business and is the right leader to help drive our vision of revolutionizing claims for the industry to automation, technology and advanced analytics. Maroun takes the reigns from Rich Della Rocca who has retired after 27 years with Verisk. We thank Rich for all of his many contributions to Verisk and wish him very well in his retirement. We also announced that Tim Rayner has been named President of Verisk Specialty Business Solutions. Our U.K.-based business centered around our Sequel suite of insurance software. The Specialty Business Solutions team is a linchpin in our strategy to create an automated in interconnected ecosystem for the insurance industry in the U.K., EU and beyond. And Tim is the right leader to drive that strategy. Tim joined Verisk in 2018, after a long and successful career in the insurance industry holding various leadership roles at Miller Insurance Services. Now, let me provide an update on both our progress towards being an insurance focus data analytic solutions provider and our commitment to furthering margin expansion. We're making steady progress on our evaluation of the separation of the energy business. The preparation of the internal separation analysis and standalone financials are ongoing and we have hired a team of outside advisors who are engaged in the next phase of our process of developing alternatives available to us. Our timing expectations remain unchanged and as we have stated previously, our decisions will continue to be guided by shareholder feedback, value considerations and market conditions. As many of you know, we have also undertaken a broad shareholder survey for the benefit of your perspectives, not only on the energy separation, but how we can improve in meeting investor expectations generally. On our EBITDA margin expansion objective, we continue to be very confident in our ability to achieve our stated target to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of margin expansion by 2024 often insurance only baseline of 50% to 51% normalized adjusted EBITDA margins. We have taken some early steps, including the restructuring of our marketing function, office space consolidation and a greater emphasis on our global talent optimization hiring. Additionally, we have embarked on a span of control analysis to guide further operational efficiencies. We continue to experience the impact of the stranded corporate allocations from the businesses we have sold in our reported segment margins. It is important to remember that 2022 is likely to remain quite noisy due to the impact of portfolio changes and implementation costs. As such, we continue to expect to the margin expansion to be increasingly visible over 2023 as we move past the timing impacts of the portfolio changes in implementations and work toward previously stated 2024 target. Now I will turn the call over to Mark for some more color on the insurance business performance.
Mark Anquillare: Thanks, Lee. I'm pleased to share that the Insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. Across insurance, we're experiencing strong growth in subscription revenues across both underwriting and claims, resulting in OCC subscription growth of 7.3% segment overall and demonstrate stability and consistency of our business model and the must have nature of our solutions. Within underwriting, we had strong results from core underwriting, extreme event solutions and our international software business. We also had healthy contribution certain of our newer acquired businesses including life insurance and marketing solutions. Within life insurance, we had delivered strong sales growth from the addition of new customers and expansion of existing relationships. Life insurers are embarking on the modernization and digital transformation of the core systems and FAST software offers flexibility and speed of implementation helps insurers achieve their goals in a timely and cost efficient manner. Extreme event solutions had a strong quarter, driven by the addition of new customers added to our core touchdown platform as well as expansion of multi-year deals with existing customers. In addition to catastrophe bond market continues to be strong and Verisk is growing its share in that market. Our sustainability and country risk business also had a strong quarter as demand for our risk indices in both corporate and investor segments continue to drive strong double-digit growth. Within claims, we're experiencing strong growth in our fraud fighting analytics, driven by the addition of new customers and expanded use cases. More specifically, our new claims essentials bundle designed for self-insured and third party administrators provides an end-to-end claim solutions. It is deriving conversion to subscriptions from customers approval to use our solutions on a more limited and transactional basis. We also recently announced exclusive partnership with LIMRA and LOMA, an industry research organization, life and annuity insurance industry fight the account takeover flood situation. Insurance transaction revenues grew a more modest 2.7%. We have seen a strong rebound in our international travel business that has been offset by headwinds for both our workers' compensation claims solutions and softer results from our personal auto underwriting. In addition, in the first half of the year has seen a lower level of storm activity versus the prior year and historic averages. More specifically, our workers compensation solutions are dealing with two headwinds, including volume levels are down at least 25% across the industry, as well as new regulations, that are slowing the pace settlement. That said, we are not sitting still. We have recently implemented process improvements to help drive greater throughput, a new customer outreach to drive volumes to Verisk. U.S. insurance industry is generally healthy shorter term insurers are dealing with the impact of interest rate volatility inflation and rising loss ratios. This is having disproportionate impact on personal lines in InsurTech players in certain geographic markets. While insurers are increasing rates to help cover inflation and repair costs, it takes time to fully take effect across the entire book of business. Specifically in personal auto, we're seeing lower levels of underwriting activity, which is resulting in lower transaction volumes and revenue. The industry is dealing with higher inflation and supply chain shortages, which are pushing up physical damage claims costs. As a result, the industry's raising rates a temporary pulling back on new business to improve profitability. Notably, we're also watching carefully the developments in Florida homeowners insurance market. This is a market that is dominated by small local companies as widespread exposure to climate related risks and is dealing with elevated levels of litigation in fraud. This combination is leading to pull back underwriting and increase in insurer liquidations and exits from the market. As a result, these risks are moving to the state-run insurer of last resort. The state of Florida recently created a reinsurance facility to bring more stability to the homeowners market to address these issues and help our customers on the underwriting side, we are facilitating new market participants and have expanded our relationship with the statewide insurer to help price and select risk. On the claims slide, we're helping customers including State government agencies with this claim score and analytics to improve their ability to investigate and identify fraud. This is a developing situation almost staying close to our customers and regulators. Through our customer engagement, we know that the insurance industry is focused on becoming more automated, more digitally engaged and more connected and they're directing, spending toward these projects. They turn to Verisk as a key partner to drive these initiatives forge, which has been a key driver of our growth. We can use to help our customers select and price risk and route out fraud with our advanced data analytics and believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow as we advance our mission to become a trusted partner from the technology and analyst perspective for the industry. I turn the call over to Interim CFO. David Grover for financial review.
David Grover: Thanks, Mark. Before I begin, I want to remind everyone that all consolidating GAAP results are negatively impacted by the recent dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services. That will continue through the first quarter of 2023 when we will earn anniversary those transactions. For the second quarter of 2022, on a consolidated basis, revenues were $746 million, a modest decline from the prior year, reflecting the impact of recent dispositions and headwinds from FX rate changes, which were most pronounced in our Energy segment offset and part by acquisitions. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 28% to $198 million while diluted GAAP EPS attributable to Verisk increased 32% to $1.24. The increase was primarily due to a lower tax provision this year versus the prior-year period, which included a non-cash revaluation charge related to an increase in U.K. tax rates that became [effective] last year. Moving to our OCC results, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are pleased with our operating results led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the second quarter, OCC revenues grew 5.3% driven by continued strength in our insurance segment. Our subscription revenues increased 6.2% while our transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.7%. Adjusting for $3.5 million in prior year revenues associated with our energy business in Russia, OCC revenues would have grown 5.9% and subscription revenues would have grown 6.9%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.4% in the second quarter, normalizing for the prior year revenue associated with our energy business in Russia and the incremental expenses associated with exiting that business. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.7%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic results was 51.0%, up 140 basis points from the prior year, reflecting strong cost and operational discipline as well as the benefits from recent dispositions. This level of margin includes approximately 80 basis points of headwind from recent acquisitions, 60 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including cloud expenses, which we absorbed into our cost structure and 60 basis points from higher year-over-year G&A expenses. Finally, this margin also reflects about 60 basis points of headwind from the timing shifts related to executive compensation, which we told you about last quarter, and will have no impact on full-year results. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an OCC basis. In the second quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6.4%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics, extreme events, life insurance and international specialty business solutions, subscription revenues increased 7.3% while transactional revenues were up 2.7%. We continue to experience strong recovery growth in certain of our transactional businesses, including international travel insurance solution, but continues to be pressured by weakness in workers compensation, as well as softness in personal auto underwriting as the dealing with some dislocation as Mark described earlier. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.1% in the second quarter, while margins declined 180 basis points to 54.7%. These margins reflect heavier burden from the corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed the impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the partial normalization of travel back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investment in our high growth areas like life insurance and marketing solutions. Energy and specialized market revenues increased 0.8% in the second quarter, normalizing for the impact of suspended operations in Russia, energy revenue growth was 3.6%. The end market continues to be volatile and impacted by geopolitical developments, but we are seeing sequential improvements in our subscription revenue growth rates as our customers are trying to witness some of the data and analytics. Our subscription revenues increased 1.7% and was affected by our decision to suspend all commercial operations in Russia. Normalizing for Russia, subscription revenue growth was 5.2% led by double-digit growth in energy transitions, chemicals and metals and mining research coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. Additionally, we continue to experience strong adoption [technical difficulty] expansion from our Lens renewals. Transactional revenues decreased 2.8% as growth was constrained by consulting resources as we are seeing an elevated level of employee attrition due to a competitive market for expertise in energy and technology. We are working to offset this trend and have demonstrated success in attracting talent to our energy business as well. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.4% in the second quarter and margins contracted 90 basis points to 34.6%. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin includes $1.1 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for the Russian impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 3.6%. In addition to the incremental Russian expense, this margin also reflects the partial normalization of travel expense back into the business and higher cloud expenses. It also reflects continued investment in Lens as we further build our capability to garner maximum value from the platform including Lens power, energy transitions, chemicals and metals and mining. Looking to the remainder of 2022, loss of Russian revenues and adjusted EBITDA will negatively impact each quarter by approximately $4 million per quarter. Verisk Financial Services results are included in our reported numbers, but not in the OCC figures. We sold Verisk Financial Services to TransUnion on April 8. Our reported effective tax rate was 18.3% compared to 35.6% in the prior year quarter. The prior year's tax rate was elevated due to a non-cash revaluation charge with a U.K. tax law change, we also benefited in the quarter from higher level stock option exercise activity as compared to last year. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we expect the tax rate to be between 20% and 23% in the third and fourth quarters of 2022, though, there could likely be some quarterly variability related to employee stock option exercise activity. Adjusted net income increased 28% to $244 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 31% to $1.53 for the second quarter of 2022. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $130 million for the quarter, down 44% from the prior year period due to a tax payment of $122 million primarily related to the gain on sale of 3E as well as the loss of operating cash flows related to the dispositions. Adjusting for these unique items, operating cash flow would have increased by a double-digit rate year-over-year. Capital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter, up 11% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to expect our capital expenditures to be within the range of $280 million to $310 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting that we believe there is similar opportunity for platform enhancement. Related to CapEx, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $210 million to $230 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $170 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, and completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the second quarter, we returned $374 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return initiatives while also consistently returning capital to shareholders. Additionally, in June, we entered into a new $300 million accelerated share repurchase agreement to be completed in the third quarter. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Dave. In summary, our businesses are strong and we are making important progress, executing on our strategic and operational initiatives, including the evaluation of the separation of the energy business and our margin expansion targets. As we evaluate options for the energy business, we will continue to focus on pursuing the most value creating path for our shareholders and we'll also consider market conditions and timing. We are confident that with the recent transformation of our portfolio and active cost management over we can deliver growth in line with our long-term objectives with organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth, reflecting our strong operating leverage. Finally, I wanted to remind you that we are planning an Investor Day for the first quarter of 2023 to be held at our offices in Jersey City. We will provide more details as it gets closer and we certainly hope you will join us. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Heather Balsky: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I'd love to get an update on your cost savings program. And just kind of hear how big, I mean, you talked about it earlier in the call, but just -- how things are tracking. You talked about really seeing impact in 2023 kind of what the phasing might be next year. And also I think there is some concerns about the macro. Your business has proven to be pretty stable in a downturn. But how -- I guess, how to think about the margin improvement and how sales may play into that or not. Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Heather. I'll start off and then ask offer Mark an opportunity to provide additional color as the Chief Operating Officer. He has been leading that initiative and really driving it's today. At a high level, as I indicated in the call, we are very confident that we will be in a position to deliver on the expected range of margin improvement of 300 to 500 basis points of that 50% to 51% baseline for an insurance only business described the elements that we are considering. We've taken a look at all alternatives that have been identified to us internally and externally. And are working against those directly, some of those have already been underway. I'll let Mark kind of describe, but some of the things that we have been doing. In terms of phasing, we are [technical difficulty] at this point to give specific direction potentially as we kind of look towards the Investor Day, and we have a clear picture of 2023 and specifically the macroeconomic environment that we're looking at. We might be in a position to provide some greater clarity around that. But this at this point, there are too many moving pieces for us to estimate. But as I indicated, we'll expect to see clear progress across 2023. And with that, just offer Mark an opportunity to add any color.
Mark Anquillare: So first of all, I think I can tell you we are on plan. I think all of our businesses and support centers have kind of stepped up to the challenge of trying to be more effective and more efficient. As a result of just our overall cost structure, a lot of the focus has been on people and trying to make sure that we are thoughtful about where we need to replace and where we need positions, and we've tried to maintain a rigor around that both when we're hiring new and where that position could be. So a part of the thought is not only to be more effective and more efficient inside of our operations. It's also about where are those people could and should be hired. So we have some operations in Hyderabad, we have some operations that are in Malaga, we have some operation that are in [indiscernible] and we have some operations in Costa Rica, which in the place and we try to become a little bit more internationally where we place those positions and try to make sure that we have the right talent and maybe at lower costs. Facilities is key to that, I think we're making some progress there. We've limited smaller offices. We made some progress with a couple of our major ones. The real estate market, commercial real estate market particular is a little bit slow. So we are probably a little behind on one of those -- probably a little ahead one of those major offices. And then I think I just kind of talk more broadly about where we want to invest and I think the teams have doing a great job of really focusing on where can we get the best ROIC. So there is instances where we're going to reallocate dollars into higher opportunities and we're sunsetting some opportunities where we say due to that maybe that return is not so great. And we probably have kind of come up with the notion of a little bit about more fast sale on some of the smaller products. And I think you're around on track and I think you'll see as we said good benefits from that program as we transition into 2023.
Lee Shavel: And Heather, the only thing I would add is that of course, as I think all companies are these days are aware of the impact of inflation across the business, and particularly the competitive environment from a compensation standpoint. And so we have factored that in at this point, we believe that we can absorb those costs make some steps and improving our retention and still deliver on that. So to your macroeconomic comment, we do recognize that there have been some pressures that may influence the results in 2023 and 2024, but reiterate our confidence in the original target that we set out.
Heather Balsky: Great. Thank you so much for the answer.
Operator: The next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is John filling in for Ashish. Congratulations on the strong results. Could you just help us understand the return of transactional revenue specifically around workers' compensation, as well as personal auto underwriting, as well as some of the property estimating solutions as well. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, John. Mark, do you want to take that.
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So let me provide a little color as to what I say, I don't remember exactly, your auto, let me start with workers' comp and I'll segue through it. So on the claims side, what we've seen is two things, really. Overall, the industry today relative to pre-pandemic, there's just fewer workers compensation claims. I think in large part, that's a function of you working at home. There's not a lot of slip and falls when you're sitting in your living room and as a result, there's just an overall downturn in the number of claims and that business is transactional. Two, there has been regulation. This is kind of inside of the world of how the government interacts insurers as to who pays us set aside and what that change has done. This has caused some of the insurers to kind of change their processes, probably moving towards a more rigorous process by which they submit those claims as opposed to some of the maybe short cuts that we're starting to happen. So that has also slowed down the buying. That is just a timing thing. The first one is more systemic at least time being, which relate to work from home. Two, on the claims side, I think you were talking a little bit about volumes in -- our repair cost estimating and how weather -- personal auto was the third one, okay. So I'll go to personal next. From a personal auto perspective, I think the other item that we're seeing is because of the challenges in the industry, meaning the world of inflation and cost repairing cars, profitability is starting to be hurt by that loss ratios are up. So when you bring on new business, right, usually there is a short-term loss, so the cost of bringing on that new business. And it takes time to get insurance rate increases. So you have to file those. So there is a general pullback and some of the underwriting of new business, there is less shopping online and because there's less shopping, there is less transactions and people pulling our data around those auto transactions things like loss histories, who is the prior coverage with things around motor vehicle reports. That's the type of information we typically provide. So hopefully that color is there. If I heard correctly, I think the last thing was just generally from a recurrent cost estimate perspective, it's been a very quiet storm season, most of our business is subscription based there is some transactional element to when storms happen, there is typically some adjusters that why software transactions kind of fluctuate up and down with storms.
Lee Shavel: And so, John, at a high level, as Mark describing, there are a lot of individual effects on the transactional businesses, some of which are shorter term timing related, there may be some systemic or secular elements on the workers comp. But generally, I think across those transactional businesses, we did see sequential improvement from the first quarter, the second quarter and I think the kind of the stronger trend will be kind of a continued normalization. So certainly, there are a lot of factors and individual elements, but we feel as though we should see kind of continued normalization on those growth rates.
Unidentified Analyst: Very helpful. Thanks for the color.
Operator: The next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Hi, to spend my question on the energy trend transition here rather potential changes in that business for you. But maybe you can just remind us, you mentioned that your evaluation is ongoing at the timelines are what you've outlined before. So maybe remind us, if I remember correctly, I think you committed to making a decision in the third quarter and maybe the transaction of last resort would be a spin out in the first quarter of next year. So just wondering if anything has changed of those timelines are still the same. And as you think about that spin out is that still something that you're evaluating or could there still be a future given market conditions, where you actually think you -- it makes sense to keep the business. So maybe just a quick update here. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you for the question, Alex. So in terms of overall timing that remains the same. We are on track to have a decision on energy by the end of the third quarter in conjunction with our third quarter earnings release with execution of that alternative to actually follow given the various kind of timing of executing on that. And with that, timing, I would describe this as being exactly where we anticipated completing the kind of separation of the accounting work and analysis. As I indicated, we have advisors that are engaged in this project, they along with our team are actively evaluating all of the alternatives. And so everything from a private sale to a separately capitalized spin out as well as retention are still alternatives that we are weighing. We're being guided by what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders from a value perspective and factoring risk in timing. I've seen the markets are different almost by definition from where we were when we originally announced this. And so the financing market as a function of changes in interest rates is more challenging than it was previously. And naturally, obviously equity markets are also down. Those are all factors that we will consider as we think about the value of the business and the value to our shareholders.
Alex Kramm: Great. Thanks for the reminder.
Lee Shavel: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Wanted to ask also about energy, ex-Russia grew about 3.6% organically in the quarter, very slight deceleration sequentially. I maybe would have thought that just given how strong energy prices have been year-to-date and I would think it's a really conducive environment for selling more information just given all the uncertainty, you also of the Lens platform that you launched in the last couple of years. So just what's holding back growth in this segment. Why isn't this growing 5% or more just what's holding it back. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Thank you for the question, Toni. And I think the simple answer is the differentiated performance between our subscription-oriented business, where we are capturing the strength of the value of that Lens platform as well as the strong demand for our energy transition, our chemicals, metals and mining business. And so there, excluding the Russian impact the overall growth in that business is solidly in that mid-single digits level at 5.2%. And the weak part of it has been in the consulting side. And there - I think there are two factors. We had a very strong 2021 with the rebound in that and it has been challenged by resource constraints frankly, the level of demand for the businesses there. But given the demand for our professionals with energy and energy transition expertise, it has been more challenging for us to have the resources against those consulting projects. And so, I think the combination of those two factors and the decline in revenues in that business while a very strong environment as you indicated has obscured what we think is the fundamentals we're seeing re-achieving again and positive momentum in the subscription revenues. We continue to see very solid growth in our ACV from Lens and research as a function of everything that you described. But that's the short answer, right. I think that addresses your question, Toni.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you so much.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping you could perhaps talk about in a life insurance business there, maybe just a sense of how big it is today. And just what the - how we should think about the strategic vision for building up life insurance?
Lee Shavel: Thank you for the question, Manav. I'll turn it over for Mark for his perspective.
Mark Anquillare: Yes, I look forward to and thank you for the question. I think we talked about life and marketing. Life has been a wonderful story. What we've seen is, inside of those insurers that are really looking to upgrade probably decades, old technology. Our fast solution has been winning the day and that is a combination of trying true traditional life insurers and there's been a lot of the secondary market or a lot of M&A, where private equities getting involved and buying books of business. Because we're able to implement quickly and then a very low cost in this no-code low-code environment we have been the kind of gender and strategic partner of choice. The beauty of these contracts at the beginning is a little bit implementation, but everyone is going to be moving on to the platform and what you see is not only do they put their business on, they start adding lines and they start extending across legal entities. So we have a combination of new logos, but also more business coming onto the platform. And as you think about the way we - for that obviously, the subscription revenue associated with those like - are going to continue to grow nicely. What we are doing is kind of uniquely positioning solution with not only a combination of great modular software, but analytics, so you can better understand - underwrite business which parallels a lot of the things we did in P&C. So we've kind of taken a little bit about P&C playbook, we've augmented with some great technology and I think we're starting to really make a difference in the life insurance space so, very happy with the progress there. I don't know, we've given the size of that business, but it is certainly growing quite quickly with the high double-digits
Lee Shavel: Yes and Manav, I would add. I was recently out on the West Coast and had an opportunity to meet a number of our clients in the InsurTech space that are out there. And several of them are specifically focused on life applications. And I will tell you the thing that is really - the two things that are really compelling. One is, how they are availing themselves of broader datasets that formally really weren't as relevant in the life space. So there is an appetite for data and a utilization of data and there is a real focus on the availability of instantaneous data so that they can make underwriting decisions. So I mentioned that, because I think they represent the leading edge of where we see life insurance going and that speaks to the broader opportunity that we face or the broader opportunity that we have in front of us to be gathering those datasets of scale. Developing those applications and then deploying it against our relationships on the insurance side, we have done incredibly successfully with the FAST acquisition. So while still, I'm not material contributor to our overall business, it is one that clearly we believe has tremendous penetration potential and growth potential.
Mark Anquillare: And just to tie it altogether, we referenced [indiscernible] that's an example of us kind of bring it in industry dataset and industry organization to fight fraud things that we do well in the P&C side. So kind of a good example of these comments.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeff Silber: I'm getting a lot of e-mails from some of your investors regarding exactly how you calculated the EBITDA in terms of maybe transferring some of the costs from the disposed businesses and I'm sorry to waste my question on this. We just get a high level overview, because a number of investors just asking that? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: So Jeff, I'll start and then I'll ask is Stacey to describe it. Essentially, we have the allocated corporate costs that exist, but we still are - we still bear or simply be allocated on a variety of basis, but generally kind of proportionate to the scale of the business. And so that impact, we have to allocate those cost somewhere and they are being allocated to the insurance in the energy business. Stacey, you feel [ph] you're embellishing.
Stacey Brodbar: Jeff, so just to be clear, the two dispositions that we did, do not hit the materiality threshold for discontinued operations. So that's why the accounting is a little bit confusing. And on organic constant currency basis, we have adjusted and taken out Verisk Financial and 3E. So all organic constant currency growth figure are adjusted for the impact of those transaction. However, our total adjusted EBITDA dollars and margin include the impact of all of those businesses. There is reconciliation at the end of the press release, which will show you all the moving pieces and parts. But it does take and as Lee said, we did take allocations that were previously associated with 3E and associated with Verisk Financial put them into just the energy segment and the insurance segment overall. The allocations to insurance basically hurt insurance margin by 80 basis points year-over-year. So that will give you a sense of what the impact is. Hopefully, that's clear. And we can talk later offline.
Jeff Silber: Yes, I'll say, I'll definitely follow-up. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question is from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Faiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Thank you. And so, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the international business, and you mentioned some management changes in the U.K. Just wanted to get clear in terms of - how you see that business trending. How it trended in the quarter and how you see a trending going forward?
Lee Shavel: So Faiza, thanks for the question. So when - we talk about our international business naturally, our energy business is substantially an international business. And so I - in that regard, we've kind of commented on two - in answer to Toni's questions, the strength that we've seen in subscription - growth on basis for us and function of our successful wins as well as on the consulting side. On the international business from an insurance perspective, there are a, variety of businesses, the most significant of which is our specialty business solutions business. And our business that is providing a software-oriented ecosystem to the non-standard Lloyd's market. It is a business that has generated very strong revenue growth rates. It's a double - it has been a double-digit grower within the business, we have successfully integrated other bolt-on acquisitions such as a ratings engine within that business. And we're very happy with the performance of that business and our ability to expand off of that. That is one piece of a larger portfolio of insurance businesses that we have developed, which have generally been additive to our overall growth rate. I'll ask Mark, maybe to describe a couple of the other components of the businesses and generally the performance and their contributions to our international businesses. But I just want to make that distinction between energy and insurance.
Mark Anquillare: Yes, that's great. And I think we highlighted that what you would probably recognize Sequel suite of insurance software has been the bigger element and the big grower over U.K. and beyond. We also have an underwriting business that kind of [technical difficulty] as it relates to understanding risks, understanding exposures. But we go beyond there and talk about insurance as it relates to travel and even pet insurance. Those have both come back and it started to grow nicely. That has been nice grower, once again, we're thinking of our international businesses contributing to and actually helping us accelerate our overall organic growth. Other two things that I'll quickly highlight is we kind of continue to extend selectively often it does a lot of the things that we do here in United States, as it relates to property underwriting, they do it in Canada. So, that is a new acquisition that has been a good contributor and kind of new to the Verisk family as well as ACTINEO, which takes us into Germany again inside the claims space, primarily around auto. So our approach broadly, it's been more around software and a little bit on the claims side around services augmented with solutions and things that we do in the U.S., trying to export them with a local footprint and all of that has been successful with - our international growth.
Lee Shavel: And so I think as we expect it to continue to be additive, we also view it as the broader opportunity and recognizing that in the U.S., we have the advantage of having been a utility or the P&C insurance industry and that doesn't exist to the same extent internationally, but software provides an ability for us to connect and create ecosystems, where we achieve a similar dynamic. And that's going to specifically what we have observed with our specialty business solutions element. And so, we're particularly interested in businesses, where we are connecting the industry and we are facilitating industry efficiencies and improved performance. And the international market, in many respects, is not as developed as what we have here in the U.S., and that's what we're excited about continuing to pursue.
Faiza Alwy: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Appreciate taking the question and all the color on the business. Mark, I wanted to ask you about another relatively new area for you, which is marketing. And I wonder if you could sort of give us a sense of what the long-term roadmap to that business looks like. And also I'm wondering if there are any cyclical considerations, discretionary spend considerations you mentioned some pressures that underwriters are facing today. Is that a business you think grows through the cycle, how do we think about that?
Mark Anquillare: Great, so Andrew thanks again. So our theme that is across all insurers is this digital engagement trying to make sure they really satisfy the customer. So what we've attempted to do from a P&C perspective, especially, on the personal line side is due to this ultimate prefill. I mean, that's kind of the way, sometimes you hear described. If you call and you give us your name a number, we can fill in all the information, everything about you and give you a quote, that is you being an insurer, and we support to facilitate that. But we wanted to go one step further, we wanted to go even further to the front-end and as you're providing that quote, what if we found the right group of people to share that quotes. So what our team at [indiscernible] and some of the marketing solution SaaS is, we are the industry standard as that we know sitting a website who's shopping. So we know who's actually shopping for insurance. So this is a wide and very real opportunity to kind of drive this pipeline to drive this funnel a real opportunity and provide that. So the marketing solutions have been a nice extension to both our P&C, as well as our life insurance opportunities. It's that front end that gives us the opportunity. There probably is some cyclicality of that, if it's a difficult time and people are trying to cut costs. There's probably more or less marketing spend that happens. But because of the unique situation that our marketing solution to [indiscernible] we sit on these websites. No one else really had the ability to do what we do, it's not like we're competing directly against Google, it's - we have these relationships that we understand who the - real candidates are. And what we also have the ability to do selectively is to take that capability and extend it beyond P&C. So it allows us to do life and P&C insurance, but to the extent that someone's buy house, they're a prime candidate for P&C insurance, but it's also a prime candidate for someone who needs a mortgage. So there is an extension and big opportunity even inside of other vertical markets where we're selectively looking. So I hope that gives you the color you're looking for.
Andrew Jeffrey: Yes, it does. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff Meuler: Yes, thanks. And part of related question, but related to the personal auto underwriting, I guess, it seems like the insurers are - rate actions now. So if you can run this forward because I would think there is also some countercyclical demand in terms of consumer rate shopping to save money for going into a recession. So just -- are there any historical parallels in terms of like what's the lag between those rate actions? And when you see the increased churn that has the positive impact on your business and then just to be clear on the last answer since you said there is probably some cyclicality. Are you seeing delayed uptake because of the cyclical headwinds of LightSpeed in the marketing capabilities, because it sounds like the markets talking a lot about a need for more sophisticated segmentation? Thank you.
Mark Anquillare: Yes so, great question. Now I'm going to piece it back together and respond may be a little out of order. So first of all, from the end to beginning, we are continuing to see uptake in LightSpeed, people love the concept and people continue to buy the solution. What we're seeing though is the volumes coming through the solution are depressed a little bit. And the short answer is, there's less shopping. I'll give you the example that I think you're looking for. Some of the InsurTechs that had been our early adopters who had a lot of volume coming through all of a sudden now start to focus on profitability. As they start to focus on profitability, that causes them to pull back on writing new business, right. There is a direct correlation, there at least nearly life of a policy. So that's a step of it. Two, kind of your other question-- related question is to about rate and taking rate. Everybody is working rates. I've seen some rate increases as high as 40% by some filings as it relates to certain states. They are coming, but people will start to write again when they get the rate increases they want. How long does that take, it really depends, sometimes on the inner workings of some insurers especially in personal auto, they use this as [technical difficulty] they don't use our direct filings. So that could take six months to nine months to get in place for before things start to ramp up again, because they have price that they expect make them profitable hope that was responsive to most of your questions.
Lee Shavel: And Jeff, I would just add kind of a broader overlay which is as Mark is describing, we are seeing some of that near-term pressure on in the business, but longer term, we believe the fundamental driver is the demand for that marketing technology, that demand for kind of delivering that data in that underwriting decision increasingly at the point of sale is what we continue to drive the growth in that business as the industry moves to deliver on that digital experience that Mark described.
Jeff Meuler: Clear and comprehensive, thank you, both.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.
Andrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to circle back on your answer to an earlier question about transaction revenue. It sounds like, the vast majority of transaction revenue you would expect to kind of normalize to a higher rate over time. But there are some secular structural challenges and workers' comp and maybe some of the other pieces of that business? So my question is, is the expectation for transaction revenue within insurance to ultimately arrive at the 7% plus kind of growth target that you have for the full business over time? Or should we kind of think of achievement of that objective as being driven more by the subscription revenue piece and transaction at some level below that. Thank you.
David Grover: Yes. Andrew, thank you for the question and the opportunity to address that. I want to be very clear. We believe that the transaction revenue over time, it's something that is -- at least at the 7% and actually historically has contributed a higher level of growth and reflects in a lot of ways the applications of new data and new technology that is expressed at the initial stage in transaction related activity that generates revenue for us. So I think what we are experiencing right now are the impacts a bit of the overhang of the pandemic, more people working from home, as Mark described workers comp impact on auto in the macroeconomic environment. But we maintain complete confidence that the transactional driven businesses over time and on a normalized basis will be additive to our overall growth rate and can certainly exceed our 7% long-term target
Lee Shavel: And maybe summarizing that, we are taking share across all this. So when volumes return, we have taken share and that will be reflected in transactions.
Andrew Nicholas: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, I just wanted to ask if directionally you expect your energy and specialized markets business to accelerate in the second half of the year. Lee, you did point out like you see on Slide 6 that non-subs business and energy and specialized was down because of consulting constraints. Do you expect those constraints to resolve themselves? Or is that going to be with us near-term and then you mentioned solid growth in ACV. I would think the solid growth in ACV would translate into stronger growth in -- for energy and specialized.
Lee Shavel: Andrew, thank you for the very clear question. And so I'll deal with it in the two parts. I think the conclusion that you drew or the logic that you described is consistent that we see with the ACV growth. And the layering on additional contracts where we've been able to up price the research product as a function of the value of our clients see in Lens. That should continue to have a positive impact on the overall growth rate. And so we do anticipate momentum on that front over the balance of the year. The more difficult element estimate is the consulting side. And so I think that is one where in this competitive market, we face a challenge in getting the level of resources that we think fully address the demand. So I would say, I think we believe that's the case for the research business. On the consulting side, it's a little bit more difficult. And I'd say conservatively that we probably wouldn't anticipate at this point a material change on the consulting front.
Andrew Steinerman: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line open
Hans Hoffman: Hi, this is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamzah. Thanks for taking my question. Could you just walk us through how you're thinking about further M&A and where the focus is there and then sort of what the pipeline looks like.
Lee Shavel: Certainly. So thanks for the questions. So as you can imagine, our primary focus at this stage is on the near-term objective of the energy separation analysis and project, and two the margin expansion opportunity. And so that is where most of our corporate resources are focused M&A from an M&A standpoint. And then secondly, as we are -- opportunity to evaluate where the business is where we want to take it. What are other opportunities that we have in front of it and how we want to think about internal versus external investment that is occupying that of the next largest part of our time and as we defined that certainly M&A will be a part of how we think about deploying capital and creating value. We have demonstrated in areas particularly on the insurance side, where we have a new dataset for a new technology as with FAST and with Sequel and with Jornaya, we have the ability to materially accelerate revenue growth within those businesses and integrating those with our dataset. So I want to say that we are -- we will continue to look for opportunities where we can materially improve the business and create value through strong returns on the invested capital. That will be our primary focus. It will be in the scale level, but I think you've seen, but for the near-term, we don't expect this high level of activity. One thing that I want to emphasize is that we are not looking at any new verticals outside of insurance and I think until we come to a resolution on the energy business looking at anything in the energy space. So that would be the direction that I provide you.
Hans Hoffman: Thanks.
Hans Hoffman: Our final question today is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. You committed to expand margins 300 to 500 bps off 50% to 51% baseline for an insurance only business. I wanted to confirm that you can achieve those margin targets regardless of the outcome of your energy strategic review. And since you've taken a close look at costs and the insurance business as part of the strategic process, how likely are you able to also take out medium term organic revenue growth for insurance beyond the historical 7% range.
Lee Shavel: Thank you for the question, George. I may ask you to repeat the rather extended second part of the question. Let me remind you George, as we said explicitly when we provided the guidance that the margin improvement of 300 to 500 basis points was specifically associated with focused entity. I'm sorry just ask you to review that I think there is the answer to your question. The determination of what we do with energy, we'll have to evaluate. So if that business is retain then there will be a different margin profile. We will still seek to achieve those cost savings related to the insurance business overall and look for margin expansion, but those savings were clearly defined as specific to an insurance focus entity. And I ask you to reiterate the second part of your question, George.
George Tong: Sure. The second part is since you've already taken a look at the insurance business from a cost perspective. Have you also taking it aligns to the business from a growth perspective and insurance, how likely are you able to take up the medium-term organic revenue growth for insurance beyond 7%.
Lee Shavel: George, we continue to maintain our long-term targets for the overall business we've said repeatedly in the past that 7% organic growth is our target. We demonstrated ability to achieve that. We are -- I'm not at the stage where we're changing our long-term guidance for the business, obviously we have an ongoing objective to exceed that growth rate and our compensation systems are tied to over achieving against that goal.
George Tong: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. And this will conclude today's conference call. Thank you everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk First Quarter 2022 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today’s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Justin, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2022 financial results. On the call are Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lee Shavel, incoming CEO; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and incoming President; and David Grover, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as our traditional and quarterly earnings presentation and the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about our future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. I would also like to note that the financial results for recent dispositions of 3E and Verisk Financial Services are included in our consolidated and GAAP results are excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. A reconciliation is provided in our 8-K. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Good day, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. The past 21 years at Verisk had been an incredible and rewarding journey. It's been my absolute privilege to serve as Chairman and CEO during such a transformative time for our company. I'm incredibly proud of the growth that we delivered and the value that we created for customers, employees and shareholders. And we always deliver this value by acting with the highest level of integrity. Our company's success has always been a team effort. To that end I'm delighted we have such a deep bench of talent, including our incoming CEO. Lee Shavel and incoming President, Mark Anquillare, who I know will drive continued growth for our company and Verisk towards becoming a global insurance focused data analytics solution provider. I look forward to seeing the work that all Verisk teammates will do to drive innovation and growth or long-term success. As this is my final earnings call, I also wanted to take a moment to thank all the shareholders and analysts that have covered Verisk for your effort and your support over the years. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Scott, and Good day everyone. On behalf of the entire Verisk team, Scott, let me thank you for your dedication and service to Verisk. We wish you all the very best in your well-deserved retirement. It has been a privilege to work with you and learn from you over the past five years and I'm fortunate to have your ongoing support and counsel. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered solid first quarter results. First quarter organic constant currency revenue grew 5.3% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 4.1%. Adjusted for the impact of the suspension of our commercial operations in Russia and higher discrete professional fees, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.7% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA grew 6.9% We delivered solid growth across the insurance segment with the fastest growth reported in Marketing Solutions, International Specialty Business Solutions, Life Insurance, Extreme Events Solutions and Claims Analytics. We also had solid contributions from our industry standard solutions in underwriting. Within energy we continued to see improving results across both subscriptions and consulting with the strongest growth in the energy transition, chemicals and metals and mining. We have experienced softness in certain of our transactional businesses, including workers compensation, which is experiencing continued weakness as carriers are adjusting to new regulation within the industry. In addition, our property estimating solutions had weaker transactional growth related to a slower storm season versus last year's ice storms in Texas. Finally, the auto underwriting business continues to deal with a lower level of shopping activity. Our results also included headwinds from the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, increased cloud costs, higher discrete professional fees in the quarter, and the partial normalization of travel and entertainment in the post-pandemic environment. We will provide more details on the financial review section of the call. In preparation for officially stepping into the role as CEO over the last 75 days, we have visited our offices in London, Boston, Lehi, Utah, and of course Jersey City to meet with the employees and leadership teams of all our business units. Many of these individuals are longtime colleagues, and I'm excited to build on these relationships going forward. In addition, I've had the opportunity to meet with more than a dozen of our most significant customers, some of whom I've interacted with throughout my tenure here. I've long known the valued role we play as a technology partner to our customers, and I'm more energized than ever about the extraordinary opportunity we have to expand the breadth and the depth of those relationships. Our value proposition is very clear. Verisk strategically invest in data and technology at scale in order to deliver economic value to our customers through operational efficiencies and better decision-making across the industries we serve. In insurance our customers look to us to help them better select risk and facilitate the automation of legacy processes to improve efficiencies and underwriting and claims. They also turn to Verisk for support with the digitization of their customer experience. And to enable the use of new datasets and platforms for expanded product lines. The development of our Touchstone platform and Extreme Events Solutions, the Lightspeed product suite and underwriting and the development of our life business are tangible examples of what we have delivered to clients. And in energy understanding the complex impacts of the energy transition and the geopolitical events continuing to unfold in Ukraine on the global energy economy remain a primary customer focus. There is strong demand for improved data delivery and analytics and we continue to deliver on that demand for our customers through our Lens platform. In fact, the first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of mid-to-high single-digit ACB growth helped by new multiyear contracts with material upsell for customers that are adopting Lens as they recognize the value of this new platform delivers. In both insurance and energy, we benefit from the growing demand for data analytics from our customers, along with their increased ability to ingest and utilize our rapidly growing datasets and technologies to make better decisions and drive operational efficiency. We create lift from these growth engines through the industry scale at which we can deliver greater value per dollar invested than our clients will be able to individually. Growth and returns on invested capital have been and will continue to be the primary driver of value creation for our shareholders over the long-term, and my highest priority as CEO will be to continue to deliver on both. We are well positioned in industries with massive opportunities that will require investment in focus in areas where we can maximize value for our customers. It also requires delivering value for our employees and when we rely for their talent, commitment and effort. We operate in a highly competitive market for talent and must be sure that Verisk remains a very attractive destination for the best and brightest. Moving from our long-term value creation strategy to our near-term focus on the activities we described to drive enhance shareholder value. I wanted to provide an update on both our progress towards being an insurance focused data analytics solutions provider and our commitment to achieving margin expansion. We are making steady progress on the separation of the energy business. We are actively engaged in a detailed planning and modeling exercise of the financial, legal, tax and operational costs associated with separating the business. This analysis will inform valuation and the transaction structure that we intend to pursue subject to market conditions and shareholder value considerations. Our timing expectations remain unchanged. On our EBITDA improvement objectives as Mark will describe in greater detail those still early we have identified several areas of organic cost efficiencies at the operating and corporate level to drive margin expansion. These opportunities include the consolidation of certain real estate locations, as leases come due, or to the extent sudden lease opportunities are available. The increased usage of our global talent optimization locations for new hires and more efficient technology investment, including the closure of our on-premise data centers. We will also reduce corporate overhead after we complete the transition services agreements associated with the sale of 3d and Verisk Financial Services. As we previously announced in mid-March, the company continues moving towards the goal of being a global insurance focused data analytics solutions provider. We expect to deliver 300 to 500 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and the consolidated remaining insurance focused business by 2024 against a baseline of 50% to 51%, normalized adjusted EBITDA margins, now the 55% adjusted EBITDA margin that our insurance segment delivered in 2021. Indeed, 55% does not represent a normalized run rate for the insurance business as it does not account for a number of offsets, including first corporate overhead costs allocated to other businesses of approximately 200 basis points. Second, the impact of three strategic insurance related acquisitions made over the last two quarters, approximately 80 basis points. And finally, the normalization for incremental cloud transition, and post-pandemic travel and entertainment expenses, for a combined approximately 170 basis points. In addition, investments in new financial and human capital systems will provide greater efficiency opportunities when fully implemented but will pressure margins in the near-term as well inflationary and competitive compensation pressures, but these effects are all embedded in the 300 to 500 basis point target. We should note, the 2022 is likely to be quite noisy due to the impact of portfolio changes and implementation costs, as well as the impact of other environmental issues. As such, we expect the margin expansion to be most visible beginning in 2023 as we move past the timing impacts of the portfolio changes in implementation. Based on our work to-date, we are very confident in our ability to achieve our stated target for EBITDA expansion by 2024 as we originally disclosed. Before turning it over to Mark, let me provide a quick update on the CFO search. We continue to make progress and are prioritizing public companies CFOs with operational efficiency experience. In the meantime, David Grover, Verisk’s Controller and Chief Accounting Officer has been acting as Interim Chief Financial Officer and is well suited for this job. I'll now turn it over to Mark for some more color on the insurance business.
Mark Anquillare: Thanks, Lee. Before I begin, I also want to take a moment to thank Scott for all that he has contributed to Verisk. The legacy that you're leaving is rooted in the way our teams innovate, and always deliver for our customers. I wish you the very best in your retirement. It has been a pleasure to partner with you for all these years. And I'm excited to build on the strong foundation of success as we move to the next chapter of Verisk story. I'm pleased to share that the insurance segment delivered another solid quarter. Across insurance we're seeing strong results from both commercial and personal lines and seeing contributions to growth from our newly acquired businesses like Marketing and Life Insurance Solutions. Within our core, underwriting and Claims Solutions, growth is being driven by strong renewal cycles with existing customers, as well as from the addition of new customers and expanded use cases for Claim Solutions. Within marketing, we're seeing strong growth driven by continued adoption from T&C carriers using our solutions to optimize lead acquisition programs, build more intelligent marketing, segmentation and monitor portfolios for right timed outreach, and for improved customer retention. We're excited about the opportunity head as we combine Jornaya with our newly acquired in future business to further enhance these capabilities by synergizing products and offerings. Our Life Insurance Solutions continue to help our life and annuity customers along with their digital transformation. All the while delivering very strong growth for Verisk with the addition of new customers as well as expansion of relationships with existing customers. Life insurance recognize the benefits of a module and flexible software solutions and are standardizing on fast platform. Within stream events, we are seeing strong growth in our core Touchdown platform with the signing of new customers as well as extension of multiyear deals with existing customers. In addition, the catastrophe bond market continued to be strong, with Verisk participating in more than half of the deals placed in the quarter. Our sustainability business also had a very strong quarter as demand for ESG and resilience global risk indices in both the corporate and financial sector whose strong double digits. In the quarter we launched sovereign ESG ratings targeting the right financial sector, and early interest is encouraging as our focus on the risk is an unmet need in the marketplace. During the quarter, we experienced recovery in many of our transactional businesses that were negatively impacted by the pandemic, including travel, international auto and claims. This was offset in part by continued weakness in our workers compensation business, as carriers are adjusting to new regulation within the industry as well as tougher compares on the storm-related revenue versus last year's ice storms in Texas. In our many discussions with our customers, we continually hear the same message, the insurance industry is healthy and focused on to become more digital, more efficient and more automated. While insurers are experiencing increasing costs related to inflation, rates are hardening reflecting these inflationary factors. This should lead to faster premium growth. In addition, rising interest rates are helping the investment portfolios of our customers driving better profitability. All that said, cost efficiency continues to be a big focus of our customers has they work to be quicker, more automated and drive savings. The growth of our data sets has been a strategic focus as we work to further advance our mission to help our customers better slug risk. To that end, we've been expanding the data encouraging of our commercial property database, and now have over 15.4 million properties up from 12.2 just a year ago, goes to become a combination of onsite surveys, virtual technologies, third-party data sources, and our ability to accurately model key characteristics using the data we have to expand and update our databases more frequently. Separately, we've added 10 new data contributors into our core statistical databases for ratemaking in the first quarter. On [indiscernible] this quarter has been wonderful. We successfully hosted hybrid customer events, with many in person sessions. In February, we held our signature Elevate Conference, and in March, we held our Insurance Fraud Management Conference, both of which successful. Across the two events we had almost 600 attendees in person and another 900 plus through virtual sessions. It was great to be in person with customers again. During the quarter we acquired Opta, Canada's leading provider of property intelligence and innovative technology solutions, the acquisition further expands their footprint in the Canadian market, it supports optic and reshaping risk management with valuable business intelligence. As the only organization in Canada that regular gathers and validates data through ongoing research often is widely considered the industry standard for valuations, property risk intelligence and loss control services. This transaction offers Verisk immediate expansion into Canada with the leading provider of underwriting data and analytics to carriers and provides opportunity for product harmonization across the Opta and Verisk portfolio. We're excited to welcome the Opta team to the Verisk family. Finally, I want to take a minute to add to the comments that we made around operational efficiency. Within the insurance segment, we have engaged in a detailed study across all our costs throughout our business units. We have identified areas of expenses to be eliminated without impacting future growth opportunities. Such opportunities exist in real estate, technology infrastructure, increased use of our low-cost talent locations for open positions, improved sourcing and procurement, product optimization, and we work diligently to realize these cost savings in a timely and efficient manner. Now, let me turn the call over to interim CFO, David Grover, for the financial review.
David Grover: Thanks Mark. For the first quarter of 2022, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenues grew 6.8% to $776 million. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 200% to $506 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk increased 204% to $3.13. Our GAAP results include the impact of a $380 million after tax gain on the sale of our environmental health and safety business. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are pleased with our operating results led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the first quarter, organic constant currency revenues grew 5.3% driven by continued strength in our insurance segment and sequential improvement within our energy segment. Our subscription revenues increased 6.2%, while transactional revenues increased a more modest 1.3%. Adjusting for $3 million in prior year revenues associated with our energy business in Russia, organic constant currency revenues would have grown 5.7%. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA was 4.1% in the first quarter, adjusting for expenses related to the suspension of commercial operations in Russia, as well as district higher professional fees. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.9%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA was 46.3%. This level of margin includes the impact of the suspension of Russian operations, approximately 70 basis points of headwind from strategic recent acquisitions, a higher level of professional fees and the return of certain COVID-related costs back into the business. It also includes approximately 90 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs, which we absorbed into our cost structure. Finally, this margin also reflected a beneficial timing difference related to executive compensation, which will reverse over the remainder of 2022. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the first quarter, insurance segment revenues increased 6.1% We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, Claims Analytics Solutions, Extreme Event Solutions, Life Insurance Solutions and International Specialty Business Solutions. Subscription revenues increased 7.2%, while transactional revenues were up 1.3%. Certain of our transactional businesses experienced recovery in the quarter including international travel insurance solutions and international auto claim solutions. But this was offset by a slower storm season versus last year's Texas ice storms and continued softness in workers compensation. Adjusted EBITDA grew 5.5% in the first quarter, while margins declined 240 basis points to 51.5%. These margins reflect a heavier burden from our corporate costs that were previously allocated to businesses that have been disposed. The impact of recently acquired businesses, higher cloud expenses and the return of travel expense back into the business. This level of margin also includes continued investments in our high growth areas like Life Insurance and Marketing Solutions. Energy and specialized markets revenues grew 1.9% in the first quarter normalizing for the impact of suspended operations in Russia, energy revenue growth was 4.3%, a solid acceleration from the fourth quarter. The end-market continues to be volatile but has benefited from higher commodity prices. Our customers are in a much stronger financial position than they were just two years ago. Our subscription revenues increased 4.8% when adjusted for the Russian impact as we are capitalizing on the increased appetite for advanced analytics. During the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in energy transition and chemicals research coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platforms through upsell of existing customers and the adoption of new logo says customers are seeing the value over integrated cloud-based data analytic environment. This is evidenced by material increases in contract size for multi-year contracts that include Lens. We also had another successful renewal cycle in the first quarter of 2022, resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter of mid-to-high single digit ACV growth. Transactional revenues increased 1.5% but growth was constrained by resources as we actively are managing to take on only the highest value consulting work. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4.9% in the first quarter and margins contracted to 130 basis points to 33.1%. This margin includes $1.4 million in incremental expense related to the suspension of operations in Russia. Normalizing for the Russian impact, adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 5.3%. In addition to the Russia expense, this margin level reflects higher cloud expenses and the return of travel expenses back into the business. It also reflected continued investment in Lens as we further build out capabilities to garner maximum value for the platform including Lens power, energy transition, chemicals, and metals and mining. Looking to the remainder of 2022, the loss of Russian revenues and the adjusted EBITDA will impact each quarter by approximately $4 million per quarter. Financial services were included in our reported numbers but not within our organic constant currency figures. We close the sale of VFS to TransUnion on April 8. Our reported effective tax rate was 17.2% compared to 22.5% in the prior year quarter, the quarterly tax rate benefited by over 500 basis points from certain non-recurring adjustments relating to the sale of 3E. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2022, we still expect the tax rates to be between 20% and 22% in each of the next three quarters, there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the face of employee stock option exercises. Adjusted net income increased 7% to $217 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9% to $1.34 for the first quarter of 2022. These increases reflected organic growth in the business contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $400 million in the quarter, down 11% from the prior year period, reflecting timing differences for certain of our collections, and the impact of the 3E disposition which closed in the middle of March. Capital expenditures were $60 million for the quarter up 1.4% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $280 million to $310 million. This supports our plans to increase our software investments through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting where we believe there's a similar opportunity for platform enhancement. Related to CapEx we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization should be within the range of $210 million to $230 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $170 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to ethics variability, the timing of purchases, the completion of projects, and future M&A activity. During the first quarter, we returned $621 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return initiatives while also returning capital to shareholders consistently. We continue to expect to deploy after tax proceeds from the sale of our 3E and various financial businesses for share repurchases in addition to our normal pace of quarterly repurchases, which are generally executed through an ASR program. And now I'll turn the call back over to Lee for some closing comments.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Dave. In summary, our businesses are strong, and we are making important progress executing on our strategic and operational initiatives, including the separation of the energy business and our improvement in margins. As we evaluate options for the energy business, we will continue to focus on pursuing the most value creating path for our shareholders and all the various stakeholders. We are confident that the transformation of our portfolio and active cost management, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives, and deliver OCC adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. We continue to appreciate the support and interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. So thanks for some of the clarification on the base for the margin upside. I think there's been some confusion. Maybe just and I think you raised to that a little bit. So maybe I didn't catch us fully. But can you just talk -- remind us of the cadence to get to that 300 to 500 basis point improvement? I think you made a comment about 2023 that you may see some benefits. And then maybe related to that, on 2024. We talked about 300 to 500. Is that really something you see realized in 2024 for the full year or is it something that you would achieve by the end of the year and it's really a 2025 event? So maybe a little bit more of a cadence will be helpful. Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Alex. So yes, I think you have -- took the comments accurately, in terms of the base rate. And as we indicated, 2022 is going to be noisy. There are a lot of effects in what we are working towards and I think remain confident in is that going into 2023, we will have achieved run rate expenses that demonstrate progress in 2023 on a full year basis. And as we then look to 2024, our expectation is that 2024 on a full year basis will represent a achievement of that 300 to 500 basis point improvements. And so I think your question Alex went to is that something that you're anticipating exiting 2024 with? No, I think that we believe that achieving that our objective for 2024 as a whole is, is what we are targeting and we remain confident with.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, Please ask your question.
Greg Parrish: Hey, it’s Greg Parrish on for Tony, thanks for taking our question. And all the best to Scott. Want to stick with the margin that 300 to 500 basis points of expansion, you talked today about doing a deep dive with a review of the cost structure to come up with that number. Does this incorporate all the opportunities you found, I think some of them, like closing down a data centers probably would have happened anyway. And I mean, the backdrop of why I'm asking is a shareholder thinks, there's potentially a lot more out there. So I don't know if there's a way you can frame the delta here. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Sure, Greg. Thank you. And let me start off, I will ask Mark to supplement my comments. But we have looked comprehensively at all of the suggestions that we have received from shareholders. We have examined those. We have drilled into them. And we've had conversations with the business. And there is naturally supporting this a substantial amount of opportunity that we are going to be pursuing over the next several years. And I think it's important to understand that that 300 to 500 basis points reflects not just the quantum of the cost savings, but also the opportunities for other investment within the business that we think drives stronger growth rates, good returns on those types of investments from an internal and from an external perspective. And so I think to answer your question, we do see opportunities from a cost savings standpoint that go beyond that. But we are also making certain that we are utilizing, as I've described before, the opportunity for investments and near-term in projects that may have a lower margin, but represent good growth, good return and operating leverage over time. So hopefully that gives you a sense of both the scope, the quantum that we are looking at and how it relates to our overall management of the business for growth and return objectives. Mark is there anything that you would want to add to that?
Mark Anquillare: No, Lee. I think it was well said I just will highlight that. We have gone across every account every division. And we've gotten very deep into this. And I think the theme here is a combination of how can we be more effective? How can we be more efficient and that's across a lot of different categories, as well as what products may need to be rethought. But I will emphasize, we want to make sure that we continue to invest in the future because we're looking to grow and continue to grow as we have an organic growth is key to all this. So it's a delicate balancing act. But I think we've been making very good progress here and we're confident.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the insurance OCC growth of 6%. So the industry background is pretty robust. We talked about strength in several businesses. Obviously, there are some one-time headwinds as well. But I was just wondering like the organic growth of six continues to stay behind or underperform the longer-term expectation despite a pretty strong demand environment. So how should we think about this growth going forward, as some of these one off items come off? Can we get back to 7% plus growth in '22.? And then just maybe mid to long-term as you streamline the business and as you highlight it focusing on more efficient growth. Can you see an improvement to that group profile over the midterm? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: So Ashish thank you for the question. I'm going to start off by making a high-level comment with regard to our subscription revenue versus non-subscription revenue and insurance and then turn it over to Mark to give some compositional color around that. But to your question, in Dave's comments, we highlighted that for insurance in the first quarter, we achieved 7.2%, organic constant currency revenue growth in our subscription revenue. And the weaker part of the business is, was in our non-subscription revenue. And that was a function of within our Medicare set aside some caution with regard to regulatory changes, hangover from the pandemic, pressured some of that transactional revenue. In addition, we continue to see lower auto purchasing activity. And then, finally, we had a tougher compare due to the Texas ice storms in the prior year period. So I think not stepping away from the fact that the 6% was below that overall target, in the most important component of the largest component, the subscription revenue growth, we think was very solid, and we have some near term transactional revenue. That was really the primary driver of that lower growth rate. But Mark, press within the businesses, you can give some context around the strength on the subscription side and any of the other transactional elements.
Mark Anquillare: Yes, Lee. I go back to -- we're just under 7% in ’21 from an insurance perspective, as we look forward, I think the 7.2 is a good indication of the strength of the business. I can provide a little color on the ups and downs as some of the non-subs type of revenue. One, storms last year, Texas storms provided a little bit of a headwind in '21, obviously working against that comp in ‘22. Two, there still seems to be a quietness, at least in volumes as a result of the pandemic. And we see that in two places. One, just people aren't shopping for auto insurance, car insurance quite as frequent as they once did. I think they're probably content with at least the rates they have now. As inflation hits, and rates start to rise, people will again begin to shop. And the world of workers comp claims is just generally down. In your home, it's just not as many workers comp claims, we've seen probably drop of maybe around 20%. And there's been some regulatory changes that have paused some of the activity with insurers to how they're going to approach those claims. So those are the specifics with regard to non-subs or non-subscriptions. But what I like to emphasize is the subscription side of things, whether it's from our underwriting core line services, the claims analytics business, which is the fraud finding business exception on, and again, with extreme events, very strong. So I was pleased with first quarter. And as is the norm, we typically have growth and we have strength as the year progresses with insurance. So thank you.
Lee Shavel: And Ashish, thanks for that mark. And Ashish, I want to also come back and address your question on the longer term growth trajectory. And certainly, within our existing businesses, we see a constructive environment and good demand. But one area that I'll be focused on and this comes out, I think some of my past experience, as well as conversations with customers, is that the insurance industry as a whole continues to look for opportunities to improve their efficiency to take substantial costs out of their operations, to improve the digital experience with their customers. And I think our ability from where we sit to act as their technology partner in more of a utility role, where we can find solutions for the industry is a tremendous opportunity for us to think more broadly about what we can do, because if we are creating value for the industry, we're creating value for our clients. And I think that will naturally drive value for our shareholders.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. I just wanted to talk about that margin expansion. So you saying the base now is 50 to 51? Going up 300 to 500 basis points that's 53 to 56 by '24. Does that include energy or does that kind of 53% to 56% margin assume energy is not part of the business. And then if you can make a comment on if the tax rate for the various business meaning x energy will be much different than the businesses today.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So let me first confirm that that 300 to 500 basis points half of the 50% to 51% assumes that we have separated energy. And so what we are trying to do is provide and reference, as we did in the original statement, what the consolidated insurance focused business looks like from a margin standpoint. So it explicitly assumes that we have separated energy within that context. And with regard to tax rate, I think we are still sorting through that as we look at the complexity of the legal entities that we utilize on a global basis. And we have tried to utilize some of the legal efficiencies within those tax jurisdictions. I don't think at this point, we're anticipating a dramatic change in the tax, but I just want to maintain the fact that we are as part of our exercise, trying to get a more precise read on what the tax implications are.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your lines open, please ask your questions.
Greg Peters: Good morning. So I'm going to focus on Slide 16, of your investor presentation, which is the capital expenditures slide. And I noted the comments regarding guidance around CapEx. So just trying to understand the pieces here in what you're showing us on Slide 16. And specifically, how much of the CapEx expense, over this history relates to non-insurance related businesses. And when you set this target of getting to mid-single digit level over time, I'm trying to flip that with the guidance that you have and CapEx for this year, because it certainly doesn't seem to match. So any additional perspective on CapEx would be helpful. Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Greg. I appreciate the question. I know this has been a focus for investors. And so the way I would describe it, and on page 16, it's important to understand for 2021, that does include VFS, 3E and Wood MacKenzie. And I would note that if we were looking at this on a segment basis, the various financial services and Wood MacKenzie particularly as a function of the Lens investment that we have made, as well as product enhancements that we were making at Verisk Financial Services, we're operating at a higher CapEx as a percentage of revenue relative to our average. And so if we are looking at an insurance on focused entity, while there will continue to be investment opportunities, probably most notably with what we're describing as our four lines reimagine that we believe will deliver similar types of benefits to the Lens platform that we did with Wood MacKenzie, that those areas of investment will continue to be important. But overall across the insurance, that would have been and we expect would be below the average rate that we have been operating at over the past three to five years.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Jeff Meuler: I guess just want to revisit the structural revenue growth answer. And let me present it this way. You've invested a lot in several new areas, non-U.S. marketing wise there's been more CapEx you're talking about the underwriting software platform and tech opportunities in general, not sure to what extent as you do the deep dive on the business. There's incremental pricing or go-to-market opportunities. That sounds like a lot of growth drivers to me. I guess, are those back selling for maturing growth drivers? Are they incremental, I don't know if you're just not wanting to commit to a new target or if you want to show us the growth first? But if you just help me understand if there's offsets to what sounds like a lot of growth drivers? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Look, I appreciate the perspective and I think that we would agree there are a lot of growth opportunities within the business as we are sorting out the separation of the two businesses. Part of that exercise is looking at the overall insurance business and evaluating where there are growth, where there are opportunities to invest, where there are opportunities to deinvest. At this point, given that, I think it's early stage in making that assessment. And we're not prepared to change the guidance that we have. I think we've demonstrated on the subscription revenue that we have been able to achieve within insurance that 7% growth, there are transactional revenues that we still are expecting to show recovery. But as we proceed through the separation, my objective would be to give a more thoughtful and fulsome description of how we think about growth going forward as we are thinking about this as an insurance focus entity. I take the point, there are a lot of growth opportunities, we're going to be making investments. But at this stage, we haven't reached the point where we're ready to make a change in that long-term guidance. We believe 7% organic constant currency or higher growth for the insurance business is a very solid respectable target with operating leverage that should drive EBITDA ahead of that. We've made our point in terms of our EBITDA expect expectations. And hopefully, we'll continue to refine that as we think about where we want to focus where we want to invest, and what we think the growth opportunities are.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Heather Balsky: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just two things. On the margin outlook, I'd love additional color. The first is in terms of the 300 to 500 basis points, I guess what gets you to the low end versus the high end of the range? I'd love to better understand that. And second part is, are there any, I guess, one-time costs? Or how should we think about one-time cost as you execute on this plan? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Heather. So I appreciate the question on the low end versus the high-end. I think there are two primary dimensions that will influence that. One is simply the quantum of opportunity that we identify and we want to identify as much opportunity as we can that doesn't impact the overall growth level of the business. And so that's, we are certainly pushing to achieve as much of that margin improvement as we have laid out as possible. The other side of that is, what is the level of investment that we think is necessary to support, expand the overall growth and achieve good returns on that. That is the tension point, as I've described before, to many of you to many of the investors, margin is a dynamic element that you have to understand in terms of what is -- what margin expansion is being generated on a pre-investment basis. And then what do you consume in order to support and expand growth and returns on beyond that. And so particularly, as we are going through an environment with higher inflationary costs, with high competition for our talent. We are evaluating those impacts which I would describe as environmental that we have to take into account that may influence where we end up in terms of that range. But the primary business tension will be the quantum of cost savings, that are not growth impacting as well as our deliberate decision on what we're going to -- where we are going to invest, and what the OpEx impact of that will be on our overall margins. But the primary objective is, as I mentioned in my comments, that growth and returns are the fundamental foundation for value creation for shareholders.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to focus on all the recent tuck-in acquisitions that you've made. It looks like you spent over 600 million or so on acquiring a bunch of these assets. I was just hoping you would help us identify some of the key areas and perhaps what the total M&A contribution for the year should be. You gave us some help on kind of the margin impact, but just from a revenue perspective, what does that add.
Lee Shavel: Manav, thank you for the question. And since as you observed those have been predominantly not exclusively in the insurance sector. I'm going to ask Mark to talk about the nature of those tuck-in acquisitions, what we expect to achieve from a business standpoint. And then, Stacey will either now or in our follow up calls provide context around the acquisition impact. Mark, can I turn it over to you to talk through some of the recent insurance acquisitions?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So let me -- two themes that I think you'll spot is, one, we continue to focus on trying to globally grow. So we'd have this wonderful franchise in the United States. And we've tried to take and extend that into other areas. So a) optic provides us with an underwriting base and foundation in Canada, doing many of the same things that [Ferris] [ph] does in United States around the ability to understand the value of a property, how much it should be insured, the property characteristics, so very nice synergies, very much aligned with what we do. And it takes us into Canada. We have a strong claims presence from a repair cost estimating perspective, but limited underwriting. So I hope that's kind of very strategic in that regard. The other international element to this is, we bought a business called ACTINEO, which represents a claims business around auto in Germany. So as we try to extend and expand, we've had some wonderful growth and some great synergies in the U.K. market. And this takes us into Germany, but also provides us an opportunity in solution set that along with an earlier acquisition called Validus that helps us also potentially get into Spain, and back into the U.K. in this product area. So again, international expansion, the focus. Other theme is really around marketing. And we've experienced a lot of customers very interested in trying to understand it and penetrate the customers, they are trying to segment, the customers they are trying to identify and bring on board. We have some wonderful tools to help them quote that business and identify and select that risk. So think about some shopping for homeowners insurance or auto insurance. [Indiscernible] is give us visibility as to who's literally out there shopping for insurance. It is an ID -- a lead ID that kind of shares this industry standard that yes, I'm out there. I've been on these websites. And to the extent that now I have information about that person. We are taking a lot of our underwriting where we've been focused on the asset, meaning the house or the car and trying to extend it into the people and the person in the individual gaining insurance. And we feel that personal side of underwriting and marketing is a very large market opportunity and we're naturally there already. So hopefully that provides a little bit of strategic context like.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Mark. And one thing I want to add, before Stacey will address the contribution elements, Manav is adding one thing that we have been pleased with is the shift that we have made from more of a portfolio orientation from an acquisition standpoint, to a focus on business unit driven acquisitions is that we have been able to identify where we can have an impact on the business, we have focused on an improved and more intensive integration process. And so with acquisitions like FAST, Jornaya and Sequel for instance, we have been able to demonstrate improved performance against our expectations and really help accelerate a lot of good technologies that the insurance industry values, but we can really help accelerate their adoption by the industry.
Stacey Brodbar: And Manav just for your aware, we break out the contributions from acquisition-related revenue versus disposition in the footnote tables there is a non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release. During the quarter, it was about 20 million on an annualized basis. I think the best way to think about the recent tuck-in acquisitions you're referring to are roughly $100 million in incremental annualized revenue, but you'll just have to phase in the timing for when we close those acquisition. Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Jeff Silber: Thanks so much. I'm apologizing for going back to a margin question and I just want to focus on the insurance segment. I know you said this year is going to be noisy, I completely understand it. But if we look at the first quarter, your insurance segment, margins went down by about 240 basis points. I know there were a number of items in there. Is that the kind of run rate we should use for the rest of the year in terms of the year-over-year decline which should be expected in this segment?
Lee Shavel: Yes. So Jeff, thanks for that. Couple of things. One, I think that what's important to understand on that decline, is that the primary contributor to that is the reallocation of expenses to the insurance and the energy sector. And so and if we achieve that separation with energy, that will be a further allocation. That's what gets you to that 50% to 51% level. Now, there are going to be effects within that quarter that influence if, for instance, we have the discrete professional costs. And we mentioned in that quarter, there was a benefit from some compensation elements that will reverse. But I think that primary impact of the reallocation of the expenses is a good starting point for understanding kind of what our normal run rate expenses will be over the course of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Going back to your margin expansion target. Can you elaborate on your strategies for balancing cost takeout with growth investments was not the star of the business of growth capital? And related to that, what are your targets for the amount of growth investments spend over this time horizon through 2024 in which areas will future growth investments focus on?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, George. I appreciate the question. And I'll start by saying, first, from a process standpoint, obviously, we are in -- the business is operating on a real-time basis, we are making investments. And so on those, we are maintaining what we believe was the right investment approach going into 2022. And so within our budget, and so those are the types of investments that you want to maintain. We will look as we go into 2023, where the trade-offs are from a growth standpoint, relative to the expense savings. And this is actually kind of the typical year-end discussion that Scott and Mark and I would have to evaluate what is the level of investment that we believe is advisable in the business to sustain to expand the growth opportunity? What is the margin impact? What are the returns on for all of those, and we look at those options across all of the businesses and then determine what we think is the best and the most supportive. And so as -- we are near-term focused on achieving the cost savings, identifying, implementing those over the course of 2022. And then as we proceed and think about where we want to focus our investment on an ongoing basis within that business. We will look at those trade-offs. There is not a monolithic across the business perspective on this is what we are going to invest in growth because almost by necessity, it needs to be a project-by-project and business-by-business determination and that we evaluate through our budget and our long range planning. So that's probably the best answer that I can give you. But we are always trying to, one, prioritize growth in returns while achieving the margin expansion objectives that we've outlined.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffery from Truist. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. Appreciate being here. I wanted to ask a question about the cloud investment and the cloud transition. Lee, it seems like there will be some longer-term expenses associated with that that you contemplate in your sort of steady state insurance margins. I assume there are some go-to-market product development NPI benefits, though. Two, can you just talk about the specific ROI that you expect from your cloud transition efforts?
Lee Shavel: Sure. Thank you, Andrew. So the first point that I want to make is that as we detailed in our last call, from an economic standpoint, we are achieving a benefit from our transition to cloud, meaning that our investments in that cloud migration have generated OpEx savings and CapEx savings across the portfolio that we have made. And it's important to understand that you have to look at both dimensions of that to see the economic value. But it does entail naturally an effective transition of what were formerly CapEx expenses into OpEx expenses in terms of our cloud-based expenses. And so, firstly, that investment is generating an economic value, and is generating a high double-digit plus return on the capital that we invested within that. And I say that on the basis of having looked at the projects of where we've made those investments and then what we've achieved from an OpEx and CapEx savings standpoint. So we do believe that it is contributing both economic value and returns. Your broader question, as I understand it is to understand the benefits from a business standpoint. And we do believe that the migration of those data sets into the cloud of the applications into the cloud, facilitate more coordination and integration of the analytics that are able to draw from that consolidated data set. And in a way, the Lens experience that we've had is a demonstration of that. First, and probably most immediately, in terms of the ease with which our customers can access data, utilize data, integrate into their processes, improve their efficiency, because we are sourcing from multiple systems or from legacy systems. And much of what we want to accomplish in our core lines reimagined moves in that direction as well, process efficiency first, but we're also improving the environment where we can associate data sets more and more effectively. But that is, I think a more of a second stage achievement, we're focused first on the economic value that we can achieve the process improvements for our clients, and then ultimately, the improved analytical opportunity. There's certainly may be overlap. But generally, that's the process. And to-date, I would say on that data benefit, that is still largely an unrealized in certain areas, I think we've achieved it. But in terms of the broader opportunity, I think there's still much more for us to do. And it ties into I think, this broader infrastructure or utility opportunity that we see for the industry as a whole as that data becomes consolidated in a more consistent architecture. It facilitates broader industry process improvements.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your lines open. Please ask your question.
Faiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you and good morning. Lee, I wanted to ask a few follow up. Maybe follow up to George's question. Are you able to [indiscernible] and talk about, the specific cost savings. So maybe how much of your cost savings are related to real estate? How much is related to cost? How much is related to sort of employees and other locations. And maybe if you could talk about the operating leverage that you expect in the business? And lastly, you've made a few acquisitions that have impacted margins and interiors as you think about your longer term growth rate. Do you need to make more acquisitions and whether the potential margin impact of those future acquisitions is included in your long-term margin target? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yes. So Faiza thanks that's a lot of questions to throw at me. But we'll try to knock them down one by one. So at this point, the dollar detail as we are developing this as we are anticipating what we can achieve over the course of 2022, we aren't at the stage where we are ready to provide $1 breakdown on the expense. With regard to your question on operating leverage, operating leverage is really the key element that I focus on, and I am -- we do embrace the fact that this opportunity to rethink our cost base fundamentally improves our operating leverage. We've always been focused on businesses that have solid operating leverage. And as we drive strong organic growth into the business that magnifies the EBITDA growth, and that naturally produces margin expansion offset by our level of investment. The last question or element of the question related to the impact of M&A. And there our focus is on generating growth and returns. I think embedded in your question is, do we rely on acquisitions to maintain our growth rate? I think the short answer is no, we do look for businesses that we can create value from that are higher growth and represent opportunities for us to accelerate and to generate returns. But we believe that our internal opportunities to grow and as we've demonstrated in a variety of areas, including with our Lightspeed products and within our claims business, with a number of the products that we've added there, within our Extreme Events Solutions, businesses, those have all been strongly performing growth businesses for us. Looking ahead, we obviously can't anticipate the acquisitions that may become available to us. Our acquisitions are typically for smaller, higher growth businesses that do have lower margins. And if we do see acquisitions that we think are value creating, we will pursue those, and they may have a negative margin impact. In fact, they're probably likely to have a negative margin impact that would be outside of our overall objectives here, but they're fundamentally focused on value creation through our ability to accelerate and drive both growth in returns. So our analysis is based on the business as it is right now that we can achieve that against that insurance focus, consolidated business, but we aren't making any assumptions in terms of what our future acquisitions are. Those have to be opportunistic and based upon our discipline.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Hans Hoffman: Hi, this is Hans Hoffman filling in for Hamza. Can you just walk us through your pricing model? And, how much is price running today? And maybe any changes relative to history on how you price? I know you guys have talked about value-based pricing in the past?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Hans, let me ask Mark to provide a high-level view, we obviously have hundreds of products with different pricing dimensions. So again, it's not a monolithic business. But Mark perhaps you can offer some perspectives on how we think about value-based pricing model?
Mark Anquillare: Yes, super. So first of all, naturally, the way we kind of align our value add to our customers needs is typically tied to some element, how big they are, which is usually in the form of premium. So it doesn't necessarily tie year-after-year the premium, but we try to think it up to how they're using basically our core products, or our claims analytics products to the extent you think about some of the solutions on the repair cost estimating side, it's just the number of claims. So I think what we've typically tried to do is set up a process by which we kind of size the overall relationship based upon premium or claims are. And then inside of that, we are trying to create a holistic solution. So we are trying to bumble solutions together. So we provide a holistic solution set to them. And I think the opportunity there is that one, they have the ability to bundle the products, they get kind of a value price. And we try to include some increase or inflation in years two and three, usually there is a three year contracts, and they kind of come renew and year four, sometimes they are five year contracts. But I hope that gives you a little bit of color. 85% of the revenue is subscription based typically it's in these three-year contracts. And I think the relationship strong. So we're always able to add new solutions or maybe they want to add a different subsidiary to the mix and that gives us continued upselling opportunities inside what is a very big existing customer base.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please ask your question.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. I want me to go back to the CapEx slide on 16. Lee is there anyway to segregate kind of how much it sits within energy versus insurance. And to the extent something happens with the energy business, should we expect that to go down? And then, you further transition in the cloud journey? Does it internally develop software start to scale down as well? Or is that going to be a structural part to that, I know, the CapEx over time, kind of declined, but how should we think about kind of cloud versus internally developed software?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Kevin. So the first comment is, as we are kind of looking at this separation, I would just kind of leave it at right now. The investment on the energy side relative to revenue would be above that average, driven by that level of Lens investment in 2021 and 2022. And so we would expect that there would be an improvement on that. But we want to look at that separation, before we evaluate changing that guidance, which we still adhere to. The second part of your question is, one, yes, we are seeing that CapEx savings as you can see on that slide, but that internally developed software will continue to be an important component of the way that we invest to deliver value to our clients. It is creating platforms for the data, it is creating software automation solutions for clients. And that will continue to be an important component for the way that we either improve efficiency or make better decisions within our business as a whole. Our business is becoming more software intensive. And we think that's a good thing because of the value that we can create for them. One from a process standpoint, but also recognize that in a lot of the software businesses that we have and have acquired are essentially networks of participants in the insurance ecosystem. Our Sequel business or Specialty Business Solutions, is probably the best example of that. And that creates opportunities for us to utilize that data to create analytics and to provide new functionality that supports the ecosystem. And so that's why it's so important in a way with that software, we are able to recreate in other markets of the network effect that we have enjoyed historically within our domestic business. And I would also note, when you look at our acquisitions, Fast, sequel, Jornaya, they are more software intensive and are associated with that higher growth rate. So that will be an ongoing an important component for us.
Lee Shavel: So with that, I think that is our final question. Thank you for your time today. Thanks again to Scott for all of his contributions and we look forward to the ongoing dialogue with all of you as we proceed. Have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-23 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today’s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Ram, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer and Group President; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and Group President. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days and on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about our future performance, including but not limited to, the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Before we discuss the company's performance, I want to first reflect on the recently announced leadership succession plan. After 21 years at Verisk, I will be retiring as CEO following our Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and I'm pleased that Lee Shavel will succeed me as CEO; and Mark Anquillare as President. It has been an honor and privilege to lead Verisk through critical and transformative periods for our company and the industries we serve. With a dynamic executive team, deep bench of talent, strong balance sheet, collaborative culture, a modernized technical environment and leading-edge analytic and software platforms in place, this is the right time to begin the transition to Verisk's next CEO. I have every confidence that under Lee and Mark's steady leadership, the team will continue to empower a better, more resilient and sustainable tomorrow for customers and the world. I'd like to personally thank all 9,000-plus Verisk teammates for their passion and dedication to always being innovative, for their underlying commitment to our customers and for conducting business each and every day with the utmost integrity. I know the Verisk I will be leaving is more data rich, more modern and more integrated with our customers and the future is very bright. Most of you know Lee quite well. Since joining Verisk in 2017, he has served as our Chief Financial Officer and has been a trusted partner who has sharpened our focus on the effective allocation of capital. In 2021, Lee became Group President of our Energy and Financial Services segments and successfully integrated the business for improved strategic and operating coordination and accelerated investment in the company's Energy data analytics platform. In addition, he's been actively engaged in the company's ongoing business and portfolio review, which I'll speak to in just a bit. Partnering with Lee will be Mark Anquillare, who has been elemental to Verisk's growth, operational excellence and customer-centric culture for 30 years. Mark has been instrumental in growing the company's insurance vertical and aligning the company's enterprise risk assessment and management with its core operations. With Lee as CEO and Mark as President, I have great confidence that we have the right team in place as we execute on our plans to enhance shareholder value. And I look forward to working together towards a smooth transition of leadership. I also want to comment briefly on the recent governance actions that were announced last week. These actions were the culmination of a broad shareholder engagement and outreach program that the management team and independent members of our Board of Directors have undertaken since last year's annual meeting. As part of our proactive approach, we focused on environmental, social and governance matters as well as long-term strategic positioning and operational excellence. We appreciated the broad set of perspectives we heard over the course of conversations with investors who represented a wide variety of geographies and investment styles and we greatly value the input we received. Reflecting this feedback from shareholders, we've taken a series of actions, including: first, a proposal in the company's 2022 proxy statement to declassify the Board of Director election terms; second, the separation of the Chairman and CEO roles effective at the 2022 Annual Meeting; third, the implementation of return on invested capital-based incentives for named executive officers and other leaders; fourth, direct oversight from the Board on the risks and opportunities that sustainability issues create; and fifth, continued ongoing Board refreshment. We believe these actions will bring improved transparency, increased accountability and further align our corporate governance with best-in-class practices. Turning now to the financial results, I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a strong fourth quarter, demonstrating the consistency and stability of our subscription-based business model, the relevancy and mission-critical nature of our solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. The net result for the fourth quarter was organic constant currency revenue growth of 5.2% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.6%, reflecting solid growth in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement in Energy and Financial Services. For the full year, Verisk reported consolidated revenue growth of 7.7% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.8%, reflecting the positive impact of the acquisitions, including Jornaya, Data Driven Safety, Roskill and Whitespace. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk grew revenue 5% and adjusted EBITDA 4.7%. The last year was also one of major technological transformation, international expansion and continued investment in innovation, all of which occurred alongside our comprehensive portfolio review. Starting with our Insurance business. 2021 was a strong year as we reported 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth and 6.5% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. We experienced exceptional new sales growth across the broad range of Insurance solutions, including underwriting, claims, extreme events and international software solutions and strong uptake for new insurtech solutions like our LightSpeed platform. We continue to see strong demand for our ESG-related solutions for corporate customers, including our country, climate and human rights data and analytics solutions. Overall, our Insurance franchise remains competitively positioned and we are advancing our lead by continually building our data advantage and maximizing the strategic synergies across our insurance data assets and solutions. This year, we added 47 new data contributors to our statistical agent database to support ratemaking across our core insurance loans and provide our insurance customers with valuable analytics that can help them innovate and expand in the rapidly changing marketplace. This includes contributions from global, national, super-regional and regional companies and built upon the 37 contributors we added in 2020. Additionally, we expanded our contributory image library with real-time images of damaged property in autos for claims settlement, with the contribution of images from a top five insurer. We also expanded our data use rights for automated underwriting, analytics and subrogation. We continue to experience exponential growth in our small business database, which should fuel future opportunities across the small business lines of Insurance. This continued growth in our contributory data is a testament to our partnership with our customers, who entrust us with their data assets, a responsibility that we do not take for granted. These ever-growing data sets not only enable and empower us to innovate further to solve our customers' problems but they also fortify our competitive position and strengthen our growth potential into the future. Importantly, our strategic decision to expand our gating analytics to additional areas within the broader Insurance segment is delivering results for our customers and for Verisk. For example, Verisk's life insurance solutions combine our data analytics and software platforms within the life and annuity segment, helping carriers, distributors and acquirers transform their product rollout, customer buying experience, underwriting, policy management and claims. In addition, we are saving our customers significant CapEx and OpEx and expediting their speed to market for new products. During 2021, Verisk Life Insurance Solutions delivered strong double-digit growth, with faster growth in our licensed revenues. Moreover, our late 2020 acquisition of Jornaya and the subsequent acquisition of Contact State in the UK is enabling us to extend our data analytic capabilities into the marketing suite of our insurance customers and is driving strong growth for Verisk. Our marketing and analytics solutions help insurance carriers and financial services companies improve the timing, relevancy and compliance of consumer engagements using end-market behaviors and consent-based data solutions. Marketers are increasingly focused on first-party data enrichment as their foundational strategy, all while managing risk and protecting consumer privacy in an increasingly complex and evolving privacy landscape. Jornaya partners with the biggest insurers and powers data-driven personalized marketing programs for their customers' acquisition and retention. We are also excited about the added capabilities we will be bringing to our marketing solutions through the addition of Infutor, a strategic acquisition that we closed earlier this month. The investment rationale for this transaction is clear. Infutor offers real-time identity resolution and consumer intelligence to marketers to help understand the consumer behind each marketing interaction. Combining this with Jornaya's unique insight into in-market behaviors positions Verisk marketing solutions as a key data partner to our insurance customers. It also further strengthens our insurance offering as we continue our portfolio-reshaping efforts and increase our focus on the Insurance segment. Turning to our Energy and Specialized Markets segment. For the full year 2021, we delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 2.4% and organic constant currency EBITDA growth of 6.4%, reflecting sequential improvement as we move through the year. This was driven in large part by an enthusiastic reception to our Lens platform which helped our Energy businesses deliver solid annualized contract value growth, resulting from three consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit ACV growth. As we continue to integrate the business for improved strategic and operating coordination and accelerate technology investments, we have an active pipeline of new features and functionalities scheduled to be released during 2022 within our Lens platform, including ongoing development of discovery and valuation capabilities in our power, upstream and subsurface packages. In addition, we will continue to bolster our existing data to include emerging technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. These combined efforts should continue to drive increased adoption and uptake by our customers. With just over 10% of our ACV related to Lens, we feel confident in our penetration runway and expect us to support continued sequential growth in 2022. Now let's turn and discuss our portfolio review process. As we've mentioned on previous earnings calls, we've been engaged in an ongoing and comprehensive bottoms-up review of our noninsurance businesses and overall portfolio composition. With the assistance of outside advisers, our Board and management team have extensively studied each of our non-Insurance business units, analyzing them across a broad spectrum of financial and operating metrics, including long-term sustainable growth, operating leverage and capital return potential. We also carefully explored competitive positioning, business scale, cross-vertical data and technology synergies and the shape and long-term development of the end markets. Here, our decision making is driving synergies across our businesses and improving sustainable returns on invested capital. It is with this in mind that we determined to sell two of our business units that, after careful review, did not meet certain operating metrics or did not prove to generate the needed synergies. First, we've recently announced the sale of our Environmental Health and Safety business, 3E, to New Mountain Capital for a total potential aggregate consideration of up to $950 million. Verisk intends to return the immediate after-tax proceeds of roughly $460 million to shareholders through share repurchases once the transaction closes late in the first quarter of 2022. Second, as we announced yesterday, we have signed a definitive agreement to sell Verisk Financial Services to TransUnion for a total cash consideration of $55 million. VFS has a unique and proprietary data set that positions them at the nexus of payments, commerce and banking as the only provider of a full customer wallet view of consumer banking and spending behavior. This transaction will best position Verisk Financial to capitalize on the changing market dynamics and continued digitization of banking and retail while providing increased focus for Verisk going forward. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. Like with 3E, we intend to return the after-tax proceeds to shareholders through share repurchases. Moving on to our Energy business. We continue to actively evaluate alternatives for this business with relevant work streams underway. This includes preparing for the potential creation of a stand-alone public entity that would benefit from enhanced independence, agility and unique brand value. We are also exploring how to structure such a transaction in a way that enhances tax efficiency to the benefit of our shareholders. We believe the 2021 ACV momentum, the penetration runway we have for Lens and the long-term growth prospects of the Energy transition represent an immediate growth and return opportunity. We are also undertaking a more intensive review of where we can leverage data sets across our Insurance and Energy businesses to create value for our clients and shareholders. These actions, combined with an improving energy industry end market and newly changed leadership team within the business unit, give us confidence in the continued momentum of this business and gives us the necessary flexibility, regardless of which long-term strategic path we pursue. In connection with our comprehensive portfolio review, we are also undertaking a proactive study of our cost structure to make sure that we better align our costs with the scale and requirements of our ongoing Verisk businesses. Under Mark's leadership, we will continue to work to reduce our overall expense base by more than just those costs associated with the two business units we have agreed to divest. This work includes productivity initiatives from our Lean Six Sigma teams, use of our global talent optimization hubs, the continued modernization of our technology infrastructure and careful management headcount. Certain of these actions are already underway and we plan to further update you on our progress on our next earnings call. We have confidence that through our active management of costs and ongoing transformation of our portfolio, cost structure and technology infrastructure, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives and deliver OCC adjusted EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. On our technology transformation, we continue to make progress on our move to the cloud and 2022 marks a pivotal year. I'm pleased to share that Verisk no longer owns a mainframe and we've outsourced our small remaining mainframe footprint. Additionally, as we approach over 3/4 of our compute environment residing in the cloud, we will reach the point late this year where we will begin closing the first of our U.S. data centers, with the second to follow in 2023 and officially retire the mainframe of that time. This is an exciting milestone for Verisk and we look forward to achieving these goals and delivering all the benefits of cloud to our customers. Before turning it to Lee, let me touch on our strong free cash flow generation which enables us to fund the highest return on invested capital opportunities, while also directly returning capital to our shareholders. In 2021, we returned over $660 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our annualized cash dividend to $1.24 a share and an incremental $1 billion in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital return. And now with that, let me turn the call over to Lee for the financial review.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Scott. And on behalf of the entire team, let me thank you for your leadership and dedication to Verisk. You have driven the success of Verisk, broadened our horizons and provided a rare balance of leadership and humanity. It has been a privilege to work with you and learn from you over the past five years and I'm fortunate to know that I will have your support and counsel through this transition. I'm humbled to be named Verisk's next CEO and excited about our opportunities to build upon our track record of success and further strengthen the company ahead. I would like to thank the many shareholders, who have personally expressed their confidence in my leadership ahead. And it has been a pleasure to get to know so many of you over the past five years, understand your perspectives and take your input. I look forward to building on this dialogue going forward. Before we discuss the financial results, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted our traditional quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. For the fourth quarter of 2021, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 7.4% to $766 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 19.5% to $142 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk decreased 18.7% to $0.87 per share. Our GAAP results include a release of a $50 million litigation reserve previously taken for a patent suit with EagleView Technologies that has now been settled and a $134 million noncash impairment charge related to our Financial Services segment. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for nonoperating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are very pleased with our operating results, led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.2%, driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement within our Energy and Financial Services segments. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic, increased 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021, our strongest quarter of growth for the year. This stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model and the mission-critical nature of our solutions. Our COVID-sensitive revenues which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, declined 1.1% as compared to declines of 12.5% in the fourth quarter last year. While certain of our businesses are back to pre-pandemic levels, we experienced a modest step back relative to the third quarter in certain transactional businesses, including workers' compensation claims solutions, repair cost estimating solutions, auto solutions and energy consulting services. Additionally, we saw continued COVID-related weakness in the part of our Financial Services segment related to bankruptcy volumes. To be specific, our COVID-sensitive revenues decreased 2% in both our Insurance and Energy segments but increased 4% within Financial Services. As we move into 2022, we will no longer report this breakdown of our revenue growth as it's becoming less relevant as we are two years into the pandemic and compares have normalized. Consolidated OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting core operating leverage on solid revenue growth and cost efficiencies. Total adjusted EBITDA margin which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 49% in the quarter, up 80 basis points on a year-over-year basis and still well above our pre-pandemic margin level of 47.1% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. While we are experiencing some inflation in certain of our salaries and benefits and the return of certain COVID-related costs back into the business, we were able to offset that with core operating leverage and efficiencies. This level of margin also includes approximately 70 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs which we absorbed into our cost structure. That said, we are already generating real economic value from our cloud transition as our cash flow benefits, primarily from lower capital expenditures on third-party hardware and software, exceed our P&L expense. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6.4%. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, claims analytics solutions, extreme event solutions, life insurance solutions and international insurance software solutions. We did experience a 2% decline in our transactional revenues because of a slower storm season versus last year and a modest step back in certain COVID-related revenues, including workers' compensation claim solutions. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.3% in the fourth quarter, while margins declined 50 basis points to 54.1%, reflecting a return to a more normalized rate of headcount growth compared to the prior year, higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense and the return of certain travel expenses. Nevertheless, this quarter's margin is still 160 basis points above our pre-pandemic levels recorded in 2019 and continues to reflect accelerated investment in our high-growth areas like Life Insurance and Marketing Solutions, the impact of acquisitions as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue increased 2.8% in the fourth quarter, a modest sequential improvement from the third quarter, was building momentum as we enter 2022. In the quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in energy transition and chemicals research, coupled with modest growth in our core research subscriptions. As Scott mentioned, we continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytic environment and had a successful renewal cycle in the fourth quarter of 2021, our largest renewal quarter of the year. Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.3% in the fourth quarter and margins expanded 360 basis points to 36.2%. A portion of the margin expansion reflects favorable comparisons versus last year's fourth quarter which included a timing difference for certain compensation expenses that were onetime in nature. For the full year, margins in the Energy segment expanded 90 basis points, reflecting core operating leverage and inclusive of continued investment in our Lens platform and our cloud transition. As we look forward to 2022 for modeling purposes, 3E contributed a high teens percentage of segment-level revenue and adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2021. Given that the transaction is likely to close in the first quarter of 2022, financial results for this business will be included in our GAAP results but will be excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. Financial Services revenue was essentially flat in the quarter, reflecting double-digit growth in combined spend-informed analytics and portfolio management, offset by continued weakness primarily in the bankruptcy business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.6% in the quarter, while total adjusted EBITDA margins were 28.9%, up 230 basis points year-over-year because of expense discipline. Like 3E, results from VFS will be included in our GAAP results but will be excluded from all organic constant currency growth figures. Our reported effective tax rate was 13.7% compared to 18.4% in the prior year quarter. This quarterly tax rate benefited from higher levels of stock option activity and certain onetime discrete items in the quarter. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect our full year tax rate to be between 20% and 22%, though there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock option exercise. Adjusted net income increased 14.8% to $240 million and adjusted -- diluted adjusted EPS increased 15.7% to $1.47 for the fourth quarter 2021. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower effective tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $188.6 million for the quarter, down 24% from the prior year period, reflecting the impact of the onetime payment related to the settlement of the EVT litigation. For the full year, net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion, reflecting growth of 8.2% versus the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $85.3 million for the quarter, up 17.8% versus last year, reflecting increases in capitalized software development, offset in part by savings on third-party software and hardware as we move to the cloud. CapEx for the full year 2021 was $268.4 million as we continue to invest in innovation and future growth opportunities. Capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue was 9% for 2021. As we have discussed previously, our business is becoming increasingly software-intensive, both organically and through our recent acquisitions. Our customers are recognizing the value and capabilities that our proprietary software can deliver, as evidenced by increased subscription pricing and deeper integration with our customers' workflows. As we look forward to 2022, we expect our capital expenditures to approximate $280 million to $310 million. This range supports our plans to increase our software investment through the acceleration of our pace of development in Lens and extending software development into core underwriting, where we believe there is a similar opportunity for platform enhancement. Additionally, it reflects the reality of inflation for hiring talent in software deployment, data science and cloud architecture and the impact of prior acquisitions. These software investments generate some of the highest internal rates of return as we drive incremental value by distributing these platforms across our broad customer base and become even more deeply embedded in customer workforce. We believe these investments will continue to build upon the trend of improving returns on invested capital we recently delivered. Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $220 million to $240 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $145 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the fourth quarter, we returned $122 million in capital to shareholders from share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest-growth and highest-return initiatives, while also returning capital to shareholders consistently. As we look to 2022, we expect to deploy the after-tax proceeds from the sale of our 3E and Verisk Financial businesses for share repurchases in addition to our normal pace of quarterly repurchases which we generally execute through an accelerated share repurchase program. In summary, we are seeing increased momentum across our businesses as demonstrated by our quarterly business. At the same time, we are making important progress executing on strategic, operational and governance initiatives, several of which we announced since our last quarterly call and some of which remain ongoing today and all of which are consistent with our commitment to enhancing shareholder value. We will continue to move diligently ahead in pursuing the most value-creating path for our shareholders and all of Verisk's stakeholders. And we have confidence that through our active cost management and ongoing transformation of our portfolio, cost structure and technology infrastructure, we can return to growth in line with our long-term objectives and deliver OCC adjusted EBITDA ahead of revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Great. Thank you. I was hoping, Lee, that you'd talk to us a little bit more about the rationale on why a spin is the right move for the Energy business. We're just not getting the price that you wanted. And maybe, also, I'll sneak another one in. Like, could you just talk about how you're viewing the growth priorities for the remaining Insurance business as well, just international, life or just other new products? Thanks so much. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thanks, Toni. So first, I want to be clear that what we're describing is an alternative. And so as we think about the strategic review that we've undertaken, it's clearly an option to think about a separately capitalized entity that enhances the independence, the agility, leverages -- that leverages the standalone brand value of the entity. So from our standpoint, given the momentum that we see within the businesses, as we talked about with the ACV growth in 2021, we want to make certain that we understand the mechanics, the timetable for that option. But we will continue to evaluate the market conditions and our ability to continue to contribute to the growth of that business overall. So to us, it's a natural and understandable alternative for us to consider in terms of overall value creation for the shareholders. I want to make it clear that all options are still on the table. We haven't ruled anything out. And we're, as we've described before, in the process of evaluating those but taking clear steps to be prepared for whichever alternative we think is the best from a value standpoint. On your second question with regard to overall growth priorities, yes, I would say that, firstly, the breadth of what we can address within the insurance industry, given the number of data sets, given the demands, is very broad. And I think we've demonstrated by identifying areas of growth under Mark and his team's leadership. In life, internationally, we've been able to tap into a wide range of new ways to acquire data sets. A part of what, I think, I would like to spend more time thinking about is really elevating the broader utility and industry-oriented mission of our Insurance business. We've done a great job focusing on the needs of our clients. And I think there are opportunities to think about what we can do on a broader industry basis, where we have additional leverage across our existing insurance clients and the functions that the insurance industry provides.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next one we have the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Charles Peters: Hi, good morning. I guess, congratulations on your retirement, Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Greg.
Charles Peters: And for my question, I guess, I'm going to focus on the CapEx guidance and your comments around CapEx, just looking for more color. So you said, I think, 9% of revenue in '21. If I look at your guidance and I just did some quick back-of-the-envelope math, it looks like CapEx for '22 could be growing faster if at the top end of the range than certainly organic revenue and if with the divestitures as a percentage of revenue is going to increase. So I guess, you've provided some comments, but if you could give us some more granular detail about what's going on there, that would be helpful.
Scott Stephenson: Go ahead.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Greg. This is Lee. So I think your observations are accurate and I think they reflect a couple of elements that are contributing to that. One is that as a function of a number of initiatives, most significantly Lens, but also some additional CapEx investment that we have made in the Insurance business that we anticipate making in 2022 as well as some CapEx related to the ongoing cloud transition. We have been able to take a lot of hardware and software out, but there are elements of investment that we made in that migration that will continue as we migrate more data sets onto the cloud. Along with the impact of a higher level of capital is capital intensity for our acquisitions. Those are still providing upward pressure on our CapEx as a percentage of revenue, as you've identified. However, one thing that we think is important to balance is that, at the core, those investments, particularly in the software-oriented aspect of capital investment, those are supporting substantial growth and return opportunities within the business. As I mentioned in the comments, our ability to invest in those platforms and broadly distribute them to our client base generates growth. We have seen that specifically with our Lens platform investment, which required a meaningful investment of capital which we were happy to do. And we've been able to observe, as a function of the value that, that has created for our client base, high single digits, even low double-digit pricing increases because of the value of that platform, as well as returns already on that investment at an early stage that are in excess of our cost of capital. So part of, I think, the tension that you've observed is that we do see opportunities to invest capital to support growth and higher returns. And as I said previously, when we're in that situation, we are going to prioritize growth and returns relative to overall capital intensity. And it is our expectation that there will be opportunities to bring that CapEx intensity down over time. But in the near-term, we still see very good growth and returns coming out of that. So hopefully, that gives you some context, in addition to the comments that we made earlier on what's driving that in 2021 and in 2022 with the guidance we provided.
Charles Peters: It does. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question, we have the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your lines are open.
Hamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. Thank you. Congrats on the new role and also congrats on the retirement. My question is just on -- just your go-to-market strategy. There'll be a lot of changes. You talked about Board level, corporate governance, portfolio changes. Could you also talk about whether you've looked at your go-to-market strategy and sales force incentives and maybe how that structure can also change or maybe it doesn't change? And if not, why? Maybe just talk about that. Thank you.
Mark Anquillare: Sure. This is Mark. Let me focus a little bit on the insurance answer there. I think it really starts with our ability to interact most effectively with customers. And over the course of these last few years, I think we've been very pleased with both the level and the number of meetings we've had with executives. So people are very open to getting on a team's call, a virtual call. And we have seen that increase our NPS scores which are internal indications, certainly one of the many. We've seen higher and excellent retention rates. And probably, most importantly, we've seen the best of -- year of new sales that we've ever experienced, all of that driven by what I refer to as higher goals, higher expectations on our sales teams. But what we do is keep our targeted comp generally unchanged. So meaning, the rates or the commercial rates are generally and gradually going down as we achieve more. So I think we're pleased with our go-to-market. We're always looking to refine it. We are always looking to become more effective. And I think the focus right now has been the combination of let's put a team focused on our biggest clients. And we've done a wonderful job with all the insurtechs and newer players, where we've had a lot of new opportunities. So that is how we've, I'd say, adjusted over the last couple of years. Commercial versus commercial -- personal versus commercial focus, attention at the highest level and then attention on those new insurtechs. So always looking to improve but I think we've been quite effective. That's a good summary.
Lee Shavel: And also, I would add on the Energy side. One of the opportunities that we've been very directly engaged in is with the integration of our PowerAdvocate and Wood Mackenzie teams. It's given us an opportunity to think about how we take that core PowerAdvocate product and distribute that more effectively on a joint marketing and sales effort across it. And it's given us opportunity to think more broadly about what our go-to-market strategy is and how we approach that. So that's just on the Energy side, a specific example of our thinking around that topic.
Hamzah Mazari: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next one, we have the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.
Alexander Kramm: Yes, hi, good morning, everyone. I want to come back to the earlier question from Toni, I guess, Lee, your new focus areas as you take over the company. I'm asking in particular in what this means for maybe the outlook in the medium term. And I'm asking because you see a lot of companies in the space recently capitalized on new growth initiatives and actually thought positioned themselves for a faster medium-term growth. So wondering, as you refocus the company on the insurance, as you have some maybe new growth opportunities, should we be thinking about maybe accelerated growth rates? Or is 7% still the right number to think about as you take, Lee, the lead here? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Alex. So keep in mind, with the announcement of less than a week ago and the focus on the two transactions that we announced recently, only started to define my objectives and how we think about growth. And they will continue to develop as I spend more time with the business and, most importantly, our clients. I'll start by saying that, at the quarter, as I think all of you can proceed to a phenomenally powerful engine, two, in fact, that I see powering the Verisk plane. One is that rapidly growing number of data sets that have relevance to our clients and industries. And the second is the growing demand and capacity of our clients to ingest and utilize the data. And the fuselage with Verisk in the 9,000 colleagues that we have here who passionately harness those two engines by allowing us to invest in that data and the analytics on behalf of the industries that we serve more efficiently than they could individually and allow us to create value for them, value for our shareholders. So that's really what supports our fundamental growth expectations for the business. The opportunity that I'm immediately focused on is how do we improve our operating leverage internally and externally to expand the lift of those engines: internally, by increasing the operational focus that is a natural extension of the discipline that we've deployed; and externally, by thinking more expansively about how we serve our industries to create value for them and leverage the industry's scale. I'm a big believer in simple wisdom. And I think Archimedes once said a couple of millennia ago that if you give me a big enough lever and a fulcrum to place it on, I can move the world. And we have a lot of compounding levers within Verisk and I'll be focused on bringing them to bear on our business and financial performance. And for the time being, we think that the long-term growth objectives that we have are reasonable growth objectives. Obviously, our objective is to try to improve against those. And I'm looking forward to your input and providing regular updates as we move forward.
Alexander Kramm: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next one, we have Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Silber: Thank you so much. I wanted to talk about margins. I think on your prior call, you talked about adding some expenses over the course of 2022, though you still expected margins to be above the pre-pandemic levels. I was wondering if you can give some color and if, possibly, you can quantify what the order of magnitude will be this year on those additional expenses. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Sure. So that is something that we are anticipating. I think there are a couple pandemic-related expense items that we are managing. One is the T&E impact and the kind of the normalization of that. And that is a timing aspect of when do we begin to see travel return. The other that I think all companies are experiencing right now are the heightened level of inflation and impact on compensation expectations over time. So each of those are having an impact. We think that the T&E aspect will be gradual. It has had a -- in the fourth quarter, we began to see a little bit more of an impact. It was approximately a negative 50 basis point impact in the fourth quarter on the business -- I'm sorry, on the overall margin for it. We have only seen in 2021 a bit of an STI normalization impact but we'll probably experience a little bit more pressure on that ahead. I think as we think about the overall margin, you hopefully heard it in our comments with regard to the impact of the divestitures and the specific actions that we're taking to eliminate stranded costs, our expectation for 2022 is that we will be able to deliver increased EBITDA growth relative to revenue growth, implying an expectation that through the mix of those elements, the divestitures, the actions that we're taking and also taking into account some normalization of the T&E impact and increased compensation pressures, that we expect to deliver improvement in the margin in 2022.
Jeffrey Silber: Okay, very helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, Lee, you could imagine I wanted to jump in a little bit more on that margin comment you just made about '22. Is that going to be margin expansion, let's just say, in the current portfolio? Or is that '22 margin expansion only on an organic basis when you exclude acquisitions that you recently made? And then the other question is, within the medium-term financial targets for the company is double-digit reported EPS growth and I wanted to know if that's also appropriate here for '22.
Lee Shavel: Yes. So Andrew, with regard to 2022, the margin expansion that I described which is a special case because of the structural changes that we are describing, I will say. And you can kind of appreciate that this is not our typical guidance, right, given kind of the structural dimension of it that we believe, based upon factoring all of those elements in the portfolio changes, the actions that we are taking, the impact of acquisitions as we know about at this point, that we do believe that we will be -- we are in a position to deliver margin improvement over that period. We also believe -- and I think this goes to your organic question. We believe that we will be able to more than offset the impact of stranded costs related to the two businesses that we are divesting. So that's our sense of where we are. There are a lot of variables that affect that but that's our expectation at this point. With regard to your question on EPS, we are not -- we still believe that the double-digit EPS objective is something that is achievable as part of our longer-term growth. But we also have to recognize that we will have an impact to EPS as a function of the two divestitures in the period. We don't think it's a significant one but it will certainly be a near-term impact on EPS for 2022. But the underlying dynamics of our expected revenue growth, EBITDA growth and then the management of our share base still positions us to be able to deliver on that double-digit EPS growth over time.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking the time.
Operator: Thank you. The next one, we have Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your lines are open.
Jeffrey Meuler: Yes, thank you. Just given all the comments on the inflationary environment, wanted to also ask how you're managing from a pricing perspective, just given the high and growing value clients you're getting from your solutions? And given that I think you just took the annual pricing in ISO and some other solutions, so just how are you factoring in the expense base inflation into how you approach pricing?
Mark Anquillare: So maybe I'll try to take that. What we have typically done is we have tried to value price all of our solutions. And to the extent that you think about the value that we provide as a kind of Verisk providing a platform or an analytic. We've typically entered into multiyear contracts. They're typically three years in duration. So as those come due, we're certainly going to try to push on a little bit more on the increase as it relates to kind of reconciling and talking about the people and the cost of labor. On another front, we have some of our deals that are somewhat tied to premiums. So in the world of a hardening insurance market, that could have some wind at our back over the course of the next year or two. So I would say to you, we are thoughtful about it. We're not aggressive about it. We're trying to make sure we maintain the long-term relationship with customers and that's what is in everyone's best interest.
Jeffrey Meuler: Got it. And congrats to the three of you and best wishes, Scott. Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital.
Ashish Sabadra: Yes. Let me add my congrats as well to all three of you and best wishes to Scott. Just in terms of question, one quick clarification on the tax leakage on the Financial Services. I was just wondering if you provided the cost basis there and how should we think about the net proceeds versus the gross proceeds? And then maybe a quick question on the insurance. You mentioned some headwinds there in the quarter from a transactional side. But how do we think about the claim business going forward? Are these headwinds just one-off in the fourth quarter? And should we think about the claim business getting back to 7% in '22? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Ashish. So I'll take the first one and hand the second one over to Mark. From a proceeds standpoint, we -- for Financial Services, we're expecting essentially a very similar number to the headline number, slightly less for that. So not a lot of tax leakage on that specific transaction.
Mark Anquillare: And I'll try to address the second topic. A couple of things happened in the quarter that we highlighted from a transactional perspective. First of all, our repair estimating business does benefit from what I'll refer to as some severe weather. Obviously, there's more instances where there is estimate needed to repair property. There was quite a bit of severe weather in the fourth quarter of 2020. It was a rather light and quiet 2021. And the second topic around transactional is in this world of COVID, there is fewer -- we are in a business that relates to workers' comp claims. And we help insurers quantify the cost that they will incur before Medicare picks up those costs. It's called Medicare Set-Aside. And there just have been fewer workers' comp claims in that space as people generally work from home and do the work kind of in a more remote or local setting. So we've seen those two instances on the transactional side of things. Thanks.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for the color. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next one, we have George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
Keen Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I'd also like to add my congrats to Scott and Lee. So Verisk has announced divestitures of Financial Services and 3E as part of it's portfolio review. How motivated are you to divest the remaining Wood Mackenzie business in the Energy segment?
Scott Stephenson: Hi, George, I think we've been pretty clear that we are looking very deeply at all possible ways of maximizing the value of this very strong business that we've got. We talked specifically about a pathway which would be to make it a free-standing company. That's receiving a great deal of attention right now. At the same time, we're accounting for the condition of the business. We're looking at the real-time progression of the performance of the business. We're looking at the state of the markets and we're looking at the macro environment. And at the intersection of all those things, we will make the ultimate and final decision about the very best way to make it the very best outcome for our shareholders. So very active, very deeply considered and ongoing.
Lee Shavel: And I would just add, our motivation is focused on what is the best value outcome for the business and for the shareholders, George.
Keen Tong: Very helpful. You mentioned that EBITDA growth this year should outpace revenue growth after taking into account P&E, inflation, stranded costs, et cetera. How do you expect margins to perform moving through 2022?
Lee Shavel: So George, I would refer you back to our general guidance is that we expect, over the long term, for EBITDA to exceed our revenue growth given the operating leverage and feel as though we have demonstrated the underlying model that delivers on that. So that continues to be our expectation.
Operator: Thank you. Next, we have Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.
Andrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask about ESG. I think last week, you announced the launch of some sovereign ESG ratings via Maplecroft. And I was just kind of curious about that opportunity, if you could spend some time maybe talking about the size of that business. Any kind of internal targets for growth or size you can share? Bigger picture, just trying to get a sense for really how big this opportunity could be for your ESG assets specifically. Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: Yes, it's -- thanks for the question. It's exciting. At the moment, we treat it really as an interesting extension of things that we already do. A lot of the strength that we have to offer and the insight that we can bring has developed out of the -- our participation in the vertical markets that we're in, beginning with insurance but also energy. There are important observations that come out of both of them. And so we are trying to render that information and additional information in a way that's useful to a broad set of customers, including insurers and energy companies but also corporates in other places. So it is -- in a sense, it's momentum out of what we already do but it's also kind of new business. And so the overall ultimate appetite of the world for ESG-oriented analytics is probably quite large but we are starting where we are and building out from there. We are -- there are established players in providing comprehensive ratings at the corporate level that we would have to think very carefully before we chose to move in that direction. But we can create a lot of indexed information that is really quite insightful and that's the path we're on right now. So it's a very good vector. It's a long march. The world will have a big appetite for ESG analytics and we will do the Verisk thing in serving that world.
Andrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next we have Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations to Lee, Mark and Scott. I just wanted to focus on the Insurance segment. A lot of good examples of new data set contributors, progress, et cetera, investments that you were referring to earlier. I think you also just rebranded the business as well. So just in the context of all of that going on, I just wanted to try and get a sense of in what time frame should we start seeing some of these investments start generating revenues that could be accretive to overall kind of that 7% growth you guys have talked about before?
Mark Anquillare: So thanks for the question. I think we're pretty excited about the places that we are investing. We tried to highlight a little bit of the work that we're doing with life insurance and marketing. Those are clearly areas of investment. Also, we talked a little bit about just our core business which represents the ways we go to market and provide our customers with the cost of goods sold and the policy language that they're -- the insurance contracts. We're going to spend some time, hopefully, helping our customers better consume and take on our information in a more cost-effective and efficient way. So in my mind, we've been doing this for like five years or even more, probably 10. And we've been seeing those benefits over the last five in the form of a combination of top line growth which has accelerated and also in the form of customers much more appreciating the services and offerings we provide. So we continue to look very deeply at return on invested capital. We're very thoughtful about where and how we invest. We're kind of tied about that, if you ask our teams, as to how we go about this. So we try to prioritize these in a way that we think will both help our customers and, ultimately, help all stakeholders involved. So we'll continue what we're doing and, hopefully, we can even go faster. I'd say the theme is accelerating.
Lee Shavel: And Manav, thanks. We appreciate the question. And obviously, we're sorting through the impact of a number of the transactions that we've announced recently. And our hope is that, as that settles, we look forward to getting together with investors broadly and talking about all of the elements of growth within the business to give a clearer picture of what Verisk looks like ahead. But we're very excited about that future. As Mark described a couple of those opportunities, one of the ones that we've talked about a fair bit with investors is the investment that we've made in our LightSpeed platform, where we've been able to find a new way, new areas to assist our insurance clients. And it's a perfect example of how we've been able to develop an industry solution. And I think there are a broad range of opportunities that we're thinking about in addition to the investments that we're making in our core lines business to really expand and elevate the services that we provide to our customers there.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next one, we have the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. And let me add my congratulations all around as well. I wonder, I guess, Lee or Scott, if you could give us some thoughts, it seems like the majority of the proceeds is going to go to buyback as opposed to M&A within the kind of framework of the Insurance business overall. Any thoughts as to M&A within the context of that as opposed to buyback and just a decision on the buyback as opposed to maybe increasing some targeted M&A?
Lee Shavel: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. So we generate, I think, as you'll appreciate, a very substantial amount of capital. Well, I've certainly talked at length around the discipline that we have brought to our M&A function. It's been focused on where we can create value. There has been no constraint on the deals that we want to pursue that we think can generate good returns or additive and value-creating. And so given the proceeds that were released as a function of this transaction, we don't see any need to reserve any portion of that amount for M&A. We can fully fund that out of our existing capital generation. And we think this is a demonstration of our capital discipline of when we have excess capital beyond what we can immediately deploy, we return that to shareholders.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next one, we have Andrew Jeffrey with Truist Securities.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, thanks for screening in. I really appreciate it. I apologize, I jumped on the call a little late. I don't know, Mark, if you addressed this at all. But I'm wondering about insurtech broadly. And if you could talk a little bit about the nature of those customers versus, say, legacy P&C customers, what the contracts look like? If there's anything unique about those customers other than their apparently faster growth rate that you think gives Verisk an advantage or you think is notable generally as you look at your overall customer roster? I'm just trying to understand what you think the opportunity is there.
Mark Anquillare: Sure. Let me take that on. So when I think of insurtech, there's two types of insurtechs. There's those folks who are kind of technology-savvy digital agent or underwriter and then there's service providers. And I think your question is focused on the former. Let me say this; we've done exceptionally well with insurtech. And I think, in large part, it's because they are not kind of living through what is a lot of legacy technology and a lot of legacy integrations. They have the ability to choose what we think is the best and most accurate solutions and best analytics, depending on need. And they have, in many cases, almost all cases, chose Verisk which we're delighted to see. What we had in the form of these partners is usually because of their ramping kind of business model, we typically start with kind of a lower price kind of a -- hopefully and get them on door type of price. But what they do is they buy not just one or two solutions but they bought the entire suite. So we have, with these insurtechs, usually a broader and more widespread set of solutions and a broader partnership with these insurtechs. And then as they grow, usually a little bit tied to your size and your premiums, we're able to grow with them. So, I think it's been a great nurturing type of relationship. I think they've helped us get better. They're very creative, very innovative. We think we are the same and it's been a wonderful partnership. So our new sales, our growth and our opportunity has really been bolstered by these insurtechs, Andrew.
Andrew Jeffrey: Helpful, thanks.
Operator: We don't have any further questions at this time. And with that, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-11-03 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Verisk Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call has -- is being recorded. Currently all participants are in a listen-only mode.

The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about their future performance, including, but not limited to, the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid third quarter results building on our deep domain expertise, innovative offerings, and strong relationships with our customers. Specifically, Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 5.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 2.1% for the third quarter.  What I find encouraging is looking at the results on a 2-year basis to adjust for the lumpiness related to the pandemic. And this to Verisk delivered 2-year cumulative organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.7% and organic costs in currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.8%, demonstrating strong core operating leverage and a sequential improvement from the second quarter. We will provide more details in his comprehensive financial review. Across insurance, we're seeing strong demand for our products as our customers are striving to become more digital and more automated and are turning to Verisk's solutions to help them.  Engagement with our customers remains at very high levels as we continue our virtual work, and our sales force and customer service teams are doing an excellent job staying connected. In fact, we recently hosted our signature underwriting conference called Verisk Velocity, again, in a virtual format. This year's event was another success with over 600 attendees, participating across 27 different Ematic (ph) sessions. This year's focus was accelerating the digital transformation and developing new ways to increase efficiency and improve underwriting outcomes to better serve their customers.  Strong customer engagement within insurance is translating into strong sales. But growing ACVs, longer contract terms, and very robust sales pipelines. To that end, we have been very successful penetrating the new ensure tech companies as they can take advantage of the full suite of Verisk's Solutions across underwriting and claims. Additionally, with our more traditional P&C customer base, we're also having success leveraging our scale and our comprehensive insurance solution offering. These are two of our competitive advantages. By bundling our solutions together, we're driving increased adoption of these solutions across many different customer segments.  And these bundles are proving to be quite sticky. One area of growth we are particularly excited about is our international expansion within insurance, which is predominantly in the UK today. So we see a long runway as we expand our analytic capabilities within the UK and extend our global footprint into new developed markets. Within our sequel business in the UK, we are building out a truly integrated and digital ecosystem across carriers, syndicates, brokers, and managing general agents, throughout the specialty market. And we are bringing in new customers and expanding our suite of products across existing ones.  Most recently, we made a tuck-in acquisition of Ignite Software Systems, a SaaS platform that includes policy administration, rating engine, and digital engagement for brokers, managing general agents, and insurance. This acquisition expands Sequel capabilities and enables Sequel to add a modular API -driven SaaS platform for the Sequel suite of products. Within our core underwriting, we are using the time-tested playbook that has worked in the U.S. for years, using proprietary data assets to help better price and understand risk, and extending to the UK with our data in Richmond hub.  Data Insight Hub is enabling the digitization of the personal and commercial lines insurance in the UK, deploying a data forward strategy to prefill key data elements and provide predictive analytics that help customers with risk assessment and pricing. Our recent investment in HUG HUB extends these capacities upstream to support the ecosystem at the point-of-sale and distribution. Our international travel business has experienced significant declines due to pandemic related travel restrictions. But we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of the rebound when across border travel returns.  On the claims front and consistent with our focus on the insurance business and international expansion, we recently announced the acquisition of ActiNeo. A market leader for personal injury claims, digitalization, and medical assessment in Germany. ActiNeo will be integrated into our broader Verisk claims Europe business and should provide a strong platform to grow our footprint across Continental Europe and establish Verisk SB pan-European leader in the personal entry and medical malpractice sectors. We are encouraged by the opportunity to create incremental value by helping deploy ActiNeo technology and services across Europe and leveraging customer relationships. We also plan to introduce other claims solution to these key European markets.  And lastly, we are excited about the growth opportunity within international markets for our extreme event business. In June, we released an on-time update to our Japan Typhoon and earthquake models. These updates reflect the latest science and learnings from recent catastrophes in Japan. Our extreme event business has very strong share in the key Japanese market with both primary insurers and reinsurers as customers. Both of them rely on our models for the quality of the science and the local knowledge that we incorporate through our partnerships with local insurers. Within the energy segment, we're seeing a strong uptake of our new and innovative solutions, including our energy transition and chemicals research, as well as our innovative Lens platform. We are realizing double-digit growth in ACV for contracts that include Lens, as our customers recognize the value of this innovative solution. Importantly, Lens is being adopted by customers across industries, including Upstream oil and gas, financial services, and powered renewable. Moreover, with roughly 10% of our customer base on Lens today, we see a long runway for growth, as we expand its use cases to include additional commodities and geographies over the next few years. You've heard me say before that at Verisk, we are moving ever closer to our customers and that we are on an exciting and successful journeys delivered best-in-class customer experiences. Our collaborations with management leaders, along with a customer first mindset, helped power this journey.  Customer experience is not just the responsibility of our dedicated customer service teams, but it runs throughout the entire organization. In the third quarter, colleagues from every part of Verisk participated in Verisk 's Discover CX Summit. It was a moment in time when we came together to listen, learn, and collaborate on how we can be better partners for our customers. Leaders across every area of the Company assembled to focus on learning CX, Best Practices, and we have emerged with a robust pipeline of ideas that I believe will lead to innovative solutions and outcomes that benefit our customers and Verisk.  On the personnel front, I am pleased to publicly welcome Sunita Holzer, as our new Chief Human Resources Officer and Dianne Greene, as our new Head of Inclusion, Diversity and Belonging. Sunaina brings with her three decades of enterprise level human resources, leadership across several industries, including technology and insurance. Dan brings a business - centric mindset to IDMB from her decade long experience as a business leader and the payroll in HR Solutions Industry. At a time when attracting and retaining diverse talent is top of mind for every business, I'm really excited about partnering with Sunaina and Dan and to develop a comprehensive and differentiated human capital strategy for Verisk and foster our diverse, inclusive, and equitable culture.  Finally, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value, and as part of that commitment, to allocating capital to the highest growth and highest return opportunities. Accordingly, Verisk has been undertaking a bottoms-up review of our businesses and portfolio composition. Our review is ongoing with a focus on the most value created path for sustainable growth and success. And doing what's in the best interest of our shareholders and all of Verisk 's stakeholders. As we've said previously, we believe that portfolio changes are probable in the next 2 to 3 quarters, subject to market conditions. With that, I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 8% to $759 million. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 8.6% to $202 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk increased 10.7% to $1.24. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we're very pleased with our operating results led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the third quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.1% driven by continued strength in our insurance segment and modest growth in energy and specialized markets.  This was offset in part by weakness in the financial services segment as we experienced the final quarter of impact from the contract restructurings as well as continued COVID related impacts. Our non-COVID sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic increased 5.6% in the third quarter, which was consistent with results reported in the second quarter of 2021, despite tougher year-over-year comparisons. As our non-COVID sensitive revenues included 7.8% in the third quarter of 2020.  The stable growth in our non-COVID sensitive revenues representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model and the mission-critical nature of our solutions. Our COVID-sensitive revenues, which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, increased 1.6% as compared to declines of 10% in the third quarter last year. Growth was primarily the result of improvements in consulting in our energy segment and a return to pre -pandemic growth rates in many of our products and services within insurance, particularly within the U.S.  We did experience continued COVID related weakness in our financial services segment as COVID forbearance programs are negatively impacting bankruptcy volumes. To be specific, our COVID-sensitive revenues increased 8% and 12% within the insurance and energy segments respectively, but registered declines of 28% within financial services. It's also important to note that that 28% decline also included the impact of the contract restructuring that we have described previously and which ended in the third quarter. Given that financial services in the segment with the largest percentage of COVID-sensitive transactional revenues, this had a disproportionate impact on the overall result.  Organic cost in currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 2.1% in the third quarter. Organic cost currency adjusted EBITDA growth was impacted by tough comparisons as we took aggressive cost actions in the third quarter of 2020 in response to the pandemic across all our segments. Total adjusted EBITDA margin which includes both organic and inorganic revenue, and adjusted EBITDA was 49.9% in the quarter, down 221 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but still well above our pre -pandemic margin level of 47.4% recorded in the third quarter of 2019. Much of the decline is associated with the normalization of our costs as we anniversary, the COVID benefits from last year including reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation. This level of margin also includes approximately 100 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs, which we absorbed into our cost structure.  On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the third quarter, insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, demonstrating strong resilience in recovery. We saw a healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, repair cost estimating Solutions, Claims Analytics Solutions, Catastrophe Modeling, Life Insurance Solutions, and International Insurance Software Solutions. We also experienced solid growth in transactional revenues, including 8% growth in our COVID -impacted revenues as we compared against flattish results last year. We also experienced a modest benefit to growth from storm-related revenue resulting from [Indiscernible] Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.8% in the third quarter while margins declined 200 basis points to 55.9% Reflecting a return to a normalized rate of headcount growth compared to the prior year and higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense.  Nevertheless, this quarter's margin is still 300 basis points above our pre -pandemic levels recorded in 2019, and continues to reflect accelerated investment in our breakout areas like life insurance and telematics, as well as our technology modernization, including our Cloud transition. Energy and specialized markets revenue increased 2.5% in the third quarter due to recovery in our consulting and project-based revenues across energy and power. Strong growth in environmental health and safety solutions and in our breakout solutions, including energy transition in Chemicals. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytics -- data analytical environment.  And we're very pleased with their contributions to our annualized contract value progression over the course of the last two quarters. Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.6% in the third quarter while margins contracted 300 basis points, reflecting tough comparisons from last year when we enacted headcount reductions, furloughs, and compensation adjustments in reaction to the challenging operating environment in 2020. This was still well above the 33.3% margin we reported in the third quarter of 2019 before the pandemic. We remind you that some of the costs taking in the third quarter were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2020, making for easier comparisons in fourth quarter '21.  Within our Energy segment, we are working to combine the proprietary data assets, skill sets, infrastructure, expertise, and deep capabilities of our Wood Mackenzie, Genscape, and PowerAdvocate businesses. Specifically, we are taking the best-of-breed from each business and combining it with a common data architecture as the backbone. This modern and flexible data architecture will enable more efficient and effective sharing of data, thus, accelerating the innovation process for new solutions in key areas like supply chain, cost management, power and renewables, chemicals, hydrogen, carbon, and metals in mining.  This will also empower stronger cross-sell of solutions across the various customer basis, particularly in the global power in renewable sector, as we help our global customers navigate this broader energy transition. Financial Services, revenue declined 13.5% in the quarter, reflecting the final quarter of impact on the contract transitions that we undertook in 2020, as well as a lower level of Bankruptcy revenue because of government support and forbearance program. Spending Form Analytics demonstrated strong growth as spending in advertising levels continue to improve as the economy emerges from COVID.  Adjusted EBITDA declined 42% in the quarter, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. Total adjusted EBITDA margins were 19%, still down from the prior year, but an improvement from the first half of 2021 as a result of expense discipline, and lower bad debt expense. Our reported effective tax rate was 20.8% compared to 22.6% in the prior year quarter, in line with our expectations. Looking ahead, we expect our tax rate to approximately 18% to 20% for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income increased 7.4% to $234 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9% to a $1.44 for the third quarter of 2021.  These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $285 million for the quarter up 38% from the prior year period. The prior year periods cash flow was negatively impacted by the timing of certain federal income tax payments and certain employer payroll taxes because of the CARES Act. Year-to-date net cash provided by operating activities was $967 million, reflecting growth of 18% versus the prior-year period.  Capital expenditures were $61.4 million for the quarter down 5% versus last year, reflecting cost savings from third-party, hardware and software as we move to the cloud. We continue to believe that capex for 2021 should be in the range of $250 to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda. Our technological transformation, as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to capex, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization should be within the range of $200 to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $175 million.  Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases, and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the third quarter, we returned $197 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return capital initiatives, but also return capital to shareholders consistently. In summary, we are not sitting still at Verisk as demonstrated by our third quarter performance and Scott's earlier comments regarding our portfolio review. Looking ahead, we have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure, to protect profitability.  We continue to believe that we have tough cost comparisons relative to the COVID impact in quarters last year. We should retain much of the margin expansion we experienced in 2020, delivering margins ahead of our 2019 pre -pandemic level of 47%. Further, we believe that the COVID, impacts continue to abate and global economies further open up, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage, allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue.  We hope this provide some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll ask the Operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik [Barclays].
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just the portfolio review I think this is the first time you've put it in writing in the press release I suppose. So I was just hoping you could give us a little context. Give us a look at all the non-insurance businesses or just any color there would be appreciated.
Scott Stephenson: Our focus is on the high mode -- our focus is on the non P&C parts of our business. That said we're always asking questions about the utility of capital we have invested everywhere. But the depth of our analysis is non-PM. You remember that at the beginning of the year, we ask Lee to take responsibility for those businesses, and his review has been everything from operational, to organizational, to the strategic questions that are in the portfolio review.
Manav Patnaik: Got it, appreciate that. And then just on the international expansion this is something you guys have been trying to go after for a while. Is it still fair to say that the opportunities and more of these in a stuck-in deals that get to build upon, or are there any decent-size assets out there?
Scott Stephenson: Well, we're getting -- where we're always starting from is strategy. So what is it that is logical relative to what we're doing that will be meaningful for our customers? And of course we'll filter that through questions like, the size of assets that we might add. You've seen our record recently. We've been focused on, mostly [Indiscernible] I don't want to constrain with -- kind of artificially constrain. Kind of what size range we might be in, but what were driven by is, the logic of 1 plus 1 becoming 3.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters [Raymond James].
Greg Peters: Good morning, everyone. I was looking over your exact report. Because the insurance industry is really struggling with inflationary pressures. I guess it's -- there's a frequency issue, but also a severity issue. And I'm curious if you could provide some more color about how your services are helping the industry during this time? I know the auto insurance market is probably in a period of the most distress it's been in in the last 10 or 15 years. And they are having -- they're struggling to get their rate increases approved with regulators, so some color on how your services are helping them would be helpful.
Scott Stephenson: Well, maybe a couple of comments here, and Mark (ph) leads our insurance vertical, so please dive in, Mark (ph). But first of all, I think -- I hope folks are familiar with the range of things that we do on behalf of the insurer. So it's everything from how to select risk to half price risk. And then when loss occurs, how to think about the value of the loss, whether the claims, amount of loss is accurate. So we're really across the entire insurance value chain. And one of the things that helps us to be so relevant for our customers is the speed with which we
Lee Shavel: ingest data signals which tell us what's going on in the market and then translate them into a forward view and provide that to our customers. So one of the things we do is to move as rapidly as the environment is moving. So you reference exact where. So just to pick that 1 in particular. So we have a very dynamic way of assessing the underlying factor costs associated with repairing a structure and the speed with which we update the data helps our customers to stay ahead of where the likely next claim is going to be with respect to cost.  So the depth of the data and the speed of the data both help us to give really reliable signals to our customers. And yes, the insurance Companies are looking to respond to a marketplace that has been moving around a fair amount. But that's really always the case. There are unique conditions associated with the pandemic. But that's just a particular inside of the general case. So it's speed, it's automation, it's depth of data. Those are all the things that allow us to add a lot of value for our customers.
Greg Peters: Thank you for that answer. I guess my follow-up question again, something I hear a lot of your customers talking about would be just the pressure around recruiting new employees and employee retention. And Lee, I heard your comments about the margin expectations going forward relative to what you did pre -pandemic. But I'm curious if -- I was hoping maybe you could spend a minute and talk to us about what you're doing from an employee retention standpoint, what you're doing from a recruiting standpoint, and how this might -- how rising compensation costs might affect your margins.
Lee Shavel: So we add a lot of people to our organization on a consistent basis. So we have very well-established pathways for recruiting talent into the Company that can be from industry, that can be at the entry level. A lot of our focus is on hiring technical talent, something that we've been doing for years now, actually is to go right to the head end of the data analytics and data science. Educational pipelines and basically to build our own programs where we bring people in.
Scott Stephenson: as it really as their first encounter with industry. And then lead them through a series of development activities and deploy them into the business. We have found doing things like that to actually be more cost constructive than simply going out and hand-to-hand combat with other tech Companies. We do hire people from name-brand technology Companies, but we have found that our own efforts to cultivate our own team have been highly reported. That's not just data science, that is cloud architecture, that is software development, that applies everywhere basically.
Lee Shavel: And we like -- I think most companies have experienced a degree of the needs to be extra alerts to retain talents coming out on the disruptive, or moving through the disruptive moment that we've been in. But actually our experience has been pretty good. On trend relative to where we've been prior to the pandemic, it's not that different for us. So yeah, we're paying attention, yeah, it's important. We have a diverse set of talent sources, and I would mention here that we operate not only in the United States, but also in other economies around the world, including, we have a very large footprint in India, which gives us additional options for staffing our team. One thing I would add to discuss comments, is of course I appreciate you raising that. I think a lot of businesses are struggling on that front from a recruiting retention standpoint. That's one dimension of it. I think we would recognize that there probably are some -- we're anticipating some higher costs as most companies are.  But we're also experiencing some savings as we adapt to this new environment. We have -- are working through our real estate portfolio, finding efficiencies as we are adopting more remote work. I think our belief is that the level of travel expense is going to be the lower than it was previously. And so while we are experiencing some of those pandemic induced -- spend induced inflationary pressures from a recruiting
Scott Stephenson: standpoint but I think all Companies are. We also are generating probably more net benefits from that. And then finally, I would say on the retention standpoint, there are -- one thing that we often have to take into account is, what is the cost of attrition? You have to bring somebody else in, you have to bring them up the curve. Sometimes that creates opportunities. But often we find that you can realize some attractive efficiencies by retaining the talent upfront as opposed to allowing that talent to attrite. All of those are factors as we think about that cost element.
Greg Peters: Great caller, thanks for your answers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm [UBS].
Alexander Kramm: Just coming back quickly to the, I guess portfolio review is what you call it. It sounds -- you've been talking about this a little bit more over the last I think 3 quarters now. And now you're putting a timeline out there of 2 to 3 quarters where we should be expecting something when something's probable. But I guess the timeline is a little bit out of context without really knowing what's on the docket. Can you maybe help us a little bit how you think about those 2 to 3 quarters maybe what's on -- what we could expect and how the timelines relate to that. I guess what I'm saying is, are there some little things that you can identify that may be coming very soon or what are the big things that you're considering that maybe take a little bit longer and that's why you're talking about this two to three quarter timeline here? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: Well, I would just say in the most general sense, Alex, that it's a comprehensive review that we're doing. As I mentioned upfront, our focus is everything which is outside of the P&C segment. I don't think it would be productive to call out specific parts of our portfolio, I just don't think it's constructive inside of the process that we're on here right now. But we are looking deeply and broadly, essentially at everything. And we're certainly aware of where we stand IN the process of consideration, but I just don't think it's constructive to name individual piece parts at this moment.
Alexander Kramm: I figure that's right. Thank you. And then maybe just shifting gears to the Energy business for a second year. I think in your prepared remark you mentioned, I think, Lens with specific numbers. You also talked about the energy transition as the area of upset again. Maybe -- can you just put some -- more numbers around that in terms of how big that business is today? What the growth rates are you experiencing and where you having the most success, actually selling some of these new products into the marketplace as everybody is clearly thinking about energy transition these days? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Thank you, Alex. Let me try and give you some context. And I think the most important thing -- the most important element that I would draw your attention to, because I think it represents where we are seeing the most significant impact from our investment in Lens. And I want to differentiate it from the fact that, within energy transition and within chemicals, those are businesses that we had invested in 12, 18 months or so ago and have already been generating double-digit growth. They are becoming a more significant component of that.  But what we are experiencing more recently, which isn't reflected in the revenue numbers yet, is the our ability to increase the pricing on for Lens delivered products. The Lens platform has enabled us to demonstrate to clients improved ability to access and interact with the datasets, with the analytics, and as I've described before, we have been able to translate that into double-digit price increases for those products where Lens is now a component of what we do. That is contributing directly to the reference that I made to the increase in our subscription growth of ours are annualized contract values on where we have seen mid-single-digits and more recently, high single-digits increases in the overall level of that.  As -- to those of you that follow other companies with kind of an ACV dynamic that immediately on hits ACV, but it will be realized over time. The other point that I would emphasize that we mentioned is that we currently our only -- approximately 10% penetrated into our customer base. And so as we further penetrate that customer base and add more products onto the Lens platform over time, it has a multiplicative effect on the revenue opportunity.  And so that's where I would specifically draw all your attention in terms of representing the growth opportunity and for me certainly, the return opportunity on the investment that we've made in Lens that encourages further investment and acceleration of many of those products. All of that is supported by the ongoing growth. Certainly anyone I suspect, on this call has seen the level of focus in the energy transition from all of the press around COP 26 is driving nearly incessant demand or our expertise and our perspectives on the energy transition.  And then finally as we pointed out, the consulting element of the business is also experiencing net cyclical uplift of strength in the sector. So, hopefully that gives you some context around what we are experiencing and how we expect that will continue to translate into improved growth performance as we look ahead.
Alexander Kramm: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra [Deutsche Bank].
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on the margin trend. The margins on this quarter were pretty robust when you look at it on a sequential basis. There was that discussion around compensation cost. But I was just wondering, how should we think about the margins going forward as some of the P&E comes back? And as your unpopular investment. Is that enough that you can bring into cost savings, that can continue to maintain these margin levels? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thanks, Ashish. One of the challenges is that there are a lot of elements that factor into margin and I appreciate you raising the shorter-term on dimension. There we're in the third quarter on some impacts on margin. Part of that which we described on where some accept -- an exceptionally difficult comparison to the third quarter, particularly in energy and specialized markets because of some of the furlough compensation reductions that we took in that period that normalized in this period. And some of that will be -- you will see a corresponding rebound in the fourth quarter when we reverse those based upon the performance of the business. And so that's an element that is more acute in the third quarter.  In addition, we had some higher level of legal expenses in the third quarter across some of our businesses. That again, was an acute short-term effect. There will be -- all of that, again, is to say that in the third quarter, there was probably a higher level of expense than we would normally expect impacting margins, that they were still above where we were pre -pandemic. But going forward, I don't think we expect that same acute impact.  There will be ongoing normalization, potentially on travel, potentially on compensation as things normalize. But I think that we will still be able to hold on to some meaningful portion of that structural benefit that we've had come through in the pandemic. Hopefully, that helps you dissect a little bit of some of the short-term elements that impacted us a little heavily in the third quarter and our expectations ahead.
Ashish Sabadra: That's a great color, Lee. And maybe if I can ask a quick follow-up question. Is -- it would it be possible to quantify the benefit from storm-related revenue? I understand it was very small. And should we see a similar benefit going into the next quarter as well? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Ashish. If it isn't material enough where we feel that it's necessary to call that out. And I think that when it becomes a market impact or a material impact, we do it but we don't think it rises to that level at this point.
Ashish Sabadra: That's very helpful and congrats on good results. Thanks, Lee.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Ashish.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari [Jefferies].
Mario Cortellacci: Hi, this is Mario Cortellacci, filling in for Hamzah. I know you touched on this in the past and you just mentioned when you get on the call around your ability to help insurers through automating various paths. And whether that be underwriting or in the Claims Process, but maybe you could just talk about how much of an opportunity that may be still, going forward. And, then could you also just touch on your new product growth and your vitality index and how that looks within insurance today?
Mark Anquillare: Thanks for the question. This is Mark. Let me just describe that. I think I've already highlighted that the world of insurance is really focused on 3 things right now; Data analytics, I think we've rode that way for a while. Clearly, the other 2 things are intersecting, but its digital engagement, as well as this push towards automation, which we refer to as this interconnected ecosystem. What insurers are trying to do and you probably experienced if you wanted to go online and get an auto growth. You can get a very quick and efficient auto growth and what [Indiscernible] because of all the information about you is available.  It's all publicly available. You would clearly provide for yes, the privacy. And what we're trying to do is make that experience available to not just personal auto, homeowners, small commercial, and you have the ability to now get a quote very efficiently, very effectively using what I refer to as both data and analytics to make it cheaper, more efficient, and more accurate. And it's all interconnected in a way that the digital experience that small business owner, or you as a homeowner, have the ability to get that quote live.  And that's where the push is. Both on the InsurTech side, as well as the traditional insurers. And I'm proud to say that we were kind of at the forefront of helping people do that. And I think there's a lot of runway there because it's both reducing the cost for insurers as well as creating a better experience for those policy holders. So we'll look forward to that continuing in the coming couple of years. I think the next question was a little bit of the [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible]. I think that we feel like the solutions we have are as robust and as numerous as we've ever had. There's a lot going on at Verisk. I'm excited about it.  That's both on the claim side. I think that's on the underwriting side and I know that we always talk about verticals. I think there's opportunity to take with some of the things that we do today and focus them on insurance, but also see if there's a way to horizontally get into other verticals. And I think that's on a second dimension as well. As an example, a lot of things we do with climate and climate change, corporate needs to know as we think about ESG and resiliency. Those are the types of things that they get us excited, but we're still on the early days. So thanks for the question.
Mario Cortellacci: Absolutely. And then just to -- on a follow-up. Could you talk about how the competitive dynamic within financial services segment has changed, if at all? You had the credit bureaus, you had the fintech and payments all getting more aggressive on M&A and doing more internal investment around datasets. Just wondering if you've seen any real shift there and how is that being considered while you're doing your business review of that segment?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, Mario (ph). Thank you. We do look at that competitive dynamic. And I would start by saying that our financial services business is at the core, a bench-marking service for the large credit card issuing banks. And that's a very unique position where the large banks trust us to provide their data, so that they can understand their performance against others. There is no one that collects as broad or provide s as comprehensive a bench marking service in that context. And so to a degree that is a less competitive space for us.  Where we do see more competition is around some of the consulting aspects of the business, outside of that bench benchmarking. And in some of our businesses, such as in fraud detection, naturally, there are a lot of small companies and businesses that are offering similar detection fraud of Wheaton's types of solutions. And so that becomes a consideration. So yes, overall, we look at the level of competition. We look at some of the other scale players in the industry, what they're doing in the space and evaluate our competitive strengths and merits that factor into our assessment of our ability to both create value and optimize value for those businesses.
Mario Cortellacci: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question is from the line of Kevin McVeigh [Credit Suisse].
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much and thanks for all information. Could you give us a sense in terms of where you are in the cloud transition? I guess overall across the enterprise and then maybe a little bit of detail in terms of insurance versus financial services versus energy.
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. So there are multiple elements to our migration. So first of all, every new application is being authored in the Cloud at this point. And we author a lot of new applications, So we're 100% with respect to that, which is current and new. With respect to legacy, we're substantially along the way, but implicit in some things that we said earlier. Not completely done. So we are at the point of essentially turning off our operation of the mainframe that we use to make use up. We are close to the moment when we will shut down our power data centers, but not quite there yet.  And a large, by count, the larger fraction of all of our applications have migrated. Our Legacy applications have migrated into the Cloud. So we're still in process. We're making lots of good progress. And as Lee was referencing before, we've already seen the cash flow benefits associated with this transition. And there is more to come, because we will shut down data centers that aren't yet shutdown. And then the corresponding point on all of that is -- because computing in the Cloud is so productive, one of the things that's happening is we're doing more development in the Cloud. So we've got lots of new things that we're doing that will consume cycles in the Cloud in the future, that we just literally didn't used to do. So there's kind of a
Lee Shavel: put and take. Volume grows in this really productive environment. The legacy stuff gets shut off the net effect of it is, it is beneficial to cash flow and does interact with both the capex and OpEx lines.
Kevin McVeigh: Very helpful. And then just wanted to clarify, when you folks talked about the 79% returning to that, Lee, is that as the portfolio is currently constructed or would, I guess, point thing if you were to monetize certain parts of the business, they'd be upside to that number or is that -- show me any type of strategic outcome in that 79%.
Scott Stephenson: I would describe it as our expectations for the business as a whole and doesn't implicitly assume anything in terms of the portfolio restructuring. As we said before, we expect each of our businesses in a normalized environment to be able to achieve 7% organic growth. Obviously, there has been differentiated performance against that but that's the expectation for the business as currently configured.
Kevin McVeigh: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan [Morgan Stanley].
Toni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Wanted to ask another question to clarify the margin expectation for next year. You mentioned that margin should be higher than 47%, but that seems like it doesn't really bake in any of the efficiencies that you talked about. And so maybe I was thinking about it as if you look at this year, you don't have the T&E, and that this year until hopefully that'll normalize next year. So is it fair to think of it as margins in 2022 will essentially be 2021 levels -100 basis points for T&E. And if a 100 basis points isn't right, feel free to correct me on that.
Scott Stephenson: Toni, I appreciate the question. I think it's hard to anticipate what the impact on travel is going to be in 2022, and it will fundamentally be driven by what we think is best from a client interaction of business development dimension for the business. I mean, I think that's inherently unknowable at this stage. If we feel that it's in our best interest, as we have new products and want to be in front of clients to develop those ideas, to be out there then than that will influence our T&E spend. And then obviously the environment, in terms of safety and regulatory aspects, is unknown as well.  So I'm very reluctant to make any forecast of what that is going to be because I think it will depend upon the business circumstances and the environment at the time. I do think that we have been able to realize savings. Some of which are structural and which, we think, we will be able to retain over time in terms of real estate costs. It'd probably be a lower level of travel, but in the short-term of -- looking at year-over-year comparisons, I'm just -- I don't think we're in a position to be able to make an estimate of what T&E, as a percent of total revenue is likely to look -- is going to be.
Toni Kaplan: Yeah. Understood. That is the only real delta though between this year and next year? Is that the main one?
Scott Stephenson: I think the other element, Toni, is our level of headcount growth within this. And here again, you have a tension between the retention element and the retention pressures that we are experiencing our ability to fill those positions. That was clearly an impact in terms of where that influenced our compensation expense in 2021. We would like to be able to certainly recover to where we were and to support the growth of these new initiatives. So that dimension is also difficult to predict.  And is our most significant expense come from -- at about 70% of our overall operating expenses. So that will be just the other area that I think is an uncertain variable. Naturally, we have more control on that but in this regard, we do want to continue to be able to grow headcount to support the development of these businesses, but the environment is making that more challenging from an actual hiring and also from a compensation expense standpoint.
Toni Kaplan: Got it, and then, I Just wanted to ask a follow-up on energy transition. I guess, who are your main competitors that you're facing up against there -- is it IHS market or are you competing in different product areas? And then also separately, is there any cannibalization from energy transition services, from those customers that are buying Upstream, or is it completely additive? Those are just my two questions on that. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Toni. On the first question I think there are a range of other players at one level, I think you have the high-level consultants that are like Mackenzie or Boston Consulting that are doing a lot of work in the energy transition space that is high-end. And we have consulting consultants that also do that work. So there's competition on that -- on that front. There are in kind of thought pieces around what's happening. I think with Bloomberg,
Scott Stephenson: New Energy, they are providing competition. And I think most other large energy data players are certainly looking to take advantage of the demand for analytics and data in the new energy space. We do think that our competitive advantage in that area is one that we have been applying and developing of our specific datasets on the Upstream space, in our PowerAdvocate area in terms of what companies are spending on infrastructure for poor facilities, new-generation capabilities, as well as our familiarity with real-time data that we acquire from our Genscape, which is part of the rationale for why we think that's additive. So we have I think a very valuable dataset, and we have a great brand and reputation in the energy sector. So, there is other competition, but we feel as though we're very competitively differentiated.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Nicolas -- Andrew Nicholas [William Blair], I apologize.
Andrew Nicholas: Thanks for taking my questions and good morning. The first question I had was for you, Scott. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about some success you've had with the International playbook, at least as it relates to Sequel. And now you've made an acquisition of that Denayo in Germany. So I'm just wondering if you could maybe spend more time on that deal. How it fits into your existing product line up and maybe what the playbook looks like for that asset in particular.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So ActiNeo participates in the claims process in the Germany market. The claims process is a very central part of what we do on behalf of all insurers. And, one of the things that applies when you are the kind of data analytics companies that we are, is that methodologies can travel across national boundaries, but you still need data at the local level in order to be able to do analysis that is relevant for the local level. And fundamentally that's what ActiNeo provides. So they're in a particular part of the P&C world in Germany where they face auto and then the medical issues that arise from automobile accidents. That's the part of the marketplace they're at. So the growth that it's going to occur relative to ActiNeo will be along a couple of dimensions. One is being potted in Central Europe,
Lee Shavel: we will seek opportunities to push the method out into other national economies. But secondly, we've got a whole set of claims solutions where the methodologies are perfectly applicable to the German market. Now we will have a [Indiscernible] in which to go in behind the relationships with the Germany Companies that come along with ActiNeo. And now present our other solutions basically. And then we'll do what we always do, which is aggregate ideally contributory data which is specific and which is even unique inside these customer relationships. And then just have the cumulative benefit, a deeper connection with customers, more forms of value, because we have more kinds of data. But within general categories like claims, underwriting is another general category.
Andrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, I want to switch gears to the bit you talked. I think for some time about the opportunity on the cybersecurity front and the cyber risk front. And it seems at least from our vantage point that there is a growing number of providers targeting that space, that some of which have some positive momentum. So I'm wondering if you could just refresh us on various positioning in that market and maybe where you feel the biggest opportunities are for both organic or even inorganic growth there in terms of helping client underwrite cybersecurity risks, specifically. Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: A couple of comments on Cyber. One is it's an important line, but you have to have that in context as well. It actually is not that big in line when you talk about
Lee Shavel: direct rent written premiums. So you have sort of the emergence of Cyber cover is enabling, is still actually still waiting to happen. But we take a very broad -- our positioning is that we have the broadest set of offerings of all with respect to Cyber stuff, you're asking about us versus other providers because we sort of -- we're sort of soup to nuts in the cyber space. So we model way upfront so that you can have a high-level portfolio view of the amount of cyber risk you might you might be holding as an insurer in your portfolio. We actually can diligence individual companies for the cyber risk that they represent.  And that can be used in the risk selection and underwriting process. And then on the back-end, we've actually got a completely unique activity which is through our PCS unit, where in the same way the ensures tell us after a natural disaster exactly what they're -- progressively with time they tell us what their actual claims experience was denominated. We now have a variety of insurance who are doing that with us in the Cyber now. So, there isn't any other Company that does those 3 things that I just mentioned. So our positioning is tied strongly to Brad, and we're very happy to be in this place and happy with what we're doing against the line that gets a lot of attention but it's not -- there isn't really that much premium in the Cyber line just yet.
Andrew Nicholas: Thanks, that's helpful.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Andrew Steinerman [J.P. Morgan]
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, it's Andrew. 2 questions. First one is as your team probably sells one or more of your industry-specific data and tech businesses, will Verisk likely become an info services provider that’s just more focused in terms of number of end markets, or is it likely that Verisk will expand into a new industry after exiting an end market or end markets. I also have a second question.
Lee Shavel: So it is not inside our pattern of thought, Andrew (ph), to say we need to be an end vertical markets. That -- we don't have that thought at all, actually. And so it simply would not be in our analysis or pattern to say, well, okay. We may have stepped out of this vertical market or that vertical market. Here are some proceeds and less investment in the next -- new vertical market. That is not the way that we think, not at all. So I think that's the primary answer to your question, but I will go back to what Mark said before. One of the really nice opportunities for our Company, is a function of the fact that you get to observe so much of the economy through the mechanism of insurance.  Because almost everything is insured. Maybe it's not as completely insured as it should be, but more or less, every category of asset is insured. So you get to see what's going on economy-wide. And my point here is, that we really like solutions where -- I'll call it the killer app, grows up in the insurance vertical. But then it's extensible to other customer groups. Oh, great. Particularly, it doesn't need to be modified very much in order for it to be relevant to that next customer groups.  So I'm really sending you 2 messages here and I think they are clear and I hope we have them distinct, which is we don't need to platform ourselves in other verticals. We are interested in following from the powerful place of the insurance industry and the killer apps inside of the insurance industry. If they have applicability in other places, that's good business. And we'll pursue that all day but we want it yoked to the power place where we start.
Andrew Steinerman: That makes a lot of sense. So here's my second question, could you also talk about the typical rebound ahead for Verisk energy organic revenue growth. Just noting that the end market now has some tailwind.
Scott Stephenson: I'm sure Andrew. Thanks for the question. There is certainly a sense of the physiclical trends that we're experiencing on the consulting side that are driving some of the strength in the performance of the revenue growth within that sector. And while that's a positive, it is not as much of a focus for us, as the broader --
Lee Shavel: what I would describe as secular trend to understanding the datasets for the energy transition and our structural ability to tie those datasets together through the Lens platform, which I was describing earlier on in response to Alex 's question. And so that, we believe is the more material secular trend within the business, that as opposed to existing within those discrete upstream, midstream, downstream, chemicals, elements, we're now looking at data across that, and building an architecture that allows us to meet those growing needs. I do think that some of the cyclical short-term uplift is encouraging more adoption of those broader applications that we've described. So there is a bit of a tailwind effect that we're beginning to experience certainly on the subscription side. And then as we realize the revenue from that subscriptions, it should become more apparent in the overall revenue results.
Scott Stephenson: And Lee if I could just add to what you were saying there just very briefly. And maybe this was a little bit implicit in your question, Andrew. Over the course of the last 7 years, there have been 2 remarkable price shocks in the underlying commodity, particularly oil and gas, petroleum. There has been a Brexit and there has been a pandemic. Hopefully, the next pandemic is decades away from now. The UK can only Brexit once. And the first of the 2 price shocks was totally supply led. It was basically Saudi Arabia sort of flexing muscle with Russia.  And I think it's interesting to consider the fact that on a go-forward basis, Saudi Aramco now answers to market forces in a way that it didn't 7 years ago, where it was like the piggy bank for the royal family. So I think the environment is different than it has been over the last 7 years. And we're structurally different in that our exposure to onto that as a result of the development of our data businesses, the growth of other elements has substantially muted the FB impact of that. There would still some impact that we just described, but it is much less acute and it would have been certainly 3 years ago.
Andrew Steinerman: That's well said. Thank you.
Operator: At this time, I would like to thank everyone for joining today. This will be our last question. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks everybody for joining.
Lee Shavel: Thank you.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-08-04 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Verisk Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investors Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Jay, and good day, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2021 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business. Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer and Group President, will follow with the financial review. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and Group President, will join the team for the Q&A session.  The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. Earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in.  Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about their future performance, including, but not limited to, the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a strong second quarter result. The strength of our business model has been on full display since the start of the pandemic and continues in the recovery. We delivered solid top line and profit growth in every quarter last year despite the weak economic environment and operating challenges from lockdowns because of the consistent and durable growth in our subscription-based businesses. As expected, we are now fully participating in the recovery as our transactional businesses are showing strong resilience and rebounding with the rollout of vaccines and global economies opening up. To be more specific in the second quarter, Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 6.3%, comprised of growth of 5.5% and are mostly subscription-based non-COVID-sensitive revenues, and growth of 12.1% in our mostly transactional COVID-sensitive revenues. In fact, certain of our transactional businesses have already returned to pre-COVID levels. We have confidence this general trend can continue and believe that as the COVID impacts fully abate, we can return to delivering financial results in line with our long-term model. Lee will provide more details in his financial review. These results were delivered through the hard work, dedication and consistent focus on our customers by our 9,000 employees around the globe. In many parts of the world, we've already begun welcoming our employees back to our offices, with a plan guided by our mission of protecting the health and well-being of our team members and in line with directives from local governments and public health officials. While our Global Protection Services team is keeping a close eye on developments with the delta variant, our teams are energized to work together in person again. In fact, Currently, more than half of our global offices are operating in a Phase 2 or 3 format. Across the U.S., we have plans to return to full use of our offices in September, unless circumstances change considerably. We have implemented a return to office policy of 3 days in the office, 4 with customers and 2 days for hub. This approach, which incorporates the best learnings from the pandemic, balances individual flexibility with the collaboration and creativity that stems from working together in person. We also believe that this flexible working policy will help to retain and attract the very best talent as we continue to grow in what is a very competitive hiring environment. Not only are we returning to office, we are also beginning to have certain in-person meetings with our customers, including on-site training and sales opportunities. Given how effectively we've worked in a fully remote format, we have confidence that this return to office policy is the optimal design. Our computing and network capacity have consistently and comfortably exceeded what we require, and our teams have adjusted to using all the virtual collaboration tools we have implemented enterprise-wide. On the topic of technology. We continue to make great strides on our efforts to modernize and optimize our technology platforms to always be best in class. As of today, we have effectively and seamlessly moved most of our applications off the mainframe. This has been a huge undertaking and is a great example of true collaboration and partnership between our IT teams and business units around the globe. In total, we currently have thousands of solutions running native in the cloud, including those that were moved from prior on-premise environments and those built native to the cloud. We are advancing our cloud-first strategy and currently have more than half of our compute environment running in the cloud. The migration to the cloud is a multifaceted multistage project, and we are pacing this transition in lockstep with our customers to ensure that we are always delivering on their highest expectations. In addition, as we advance on this journey, the process is ever improving, and we are seeing real benefits in terms of pace of innovation, resiliency, security and compliance. Our ability to introduce new products and release updates to existing products in a quick and efficient manner is vastly improved because of our shift to the cloud. We are also able to onboard new customers and enter new geographies faster and with reduced capital intensity. For example, we've successfully deployed our new cloud-based visualized ISO ClaimSearch platform to our P&C insurance customers. This modernized version of our industry-leading ClaimSearch platform provides a more engaging user experience for thousands of claim adjusters and investigators, and allows us to offer new features, functionality and solutions quickly and easily to customers through this platform. In addition, our new insurance digital media contributory database will take advantage of the flexibility and efficiencies of cloud technology to process, store and analyze claim-related digital images from more than 160 insurers. Initially, we expect to receive over 8 million digital media files per week as this new offering ramps up to help insurers better detect potential fraud and increase settlement fee for meritorious claims. The cloud is also advancing our sales process as we can offer customers an easy and cost-beneficial way to pilot or trial new solutions that was previously much more cumbersome in Verisk's prior on-premise format. This allows customers to truly see in action the value of our solutions. Our sales team can then focus on converting those customers to long-term subscriptions. The cloud has also made our solutions more resilient with less downtime as the duration of maintenance windows are greatly reduced. We no longer must take our cloud-native solutions off-line to do things like update or release new features or protect them with the latest security patches and protocols. We have also constructed a cloud security program that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to continuously monitor our entire environment, making us more secure and able to audit our entire process for full accountability. And finally, the cloud makes it easier to keep applications and data that are running in local geographies to adhere to the increasing nuances of regulatory and compliance requirements that are geographically specific. As our business expands globally, this becomes an increasing benefit of cloud. From a capital perspective, our cloud migration has reduced our ongoing need to spend on third-party hardware and software. We are reallocating those savings towards internal innovation and spending more on growth CapEx. We are leaning into our highest growth, highest return on invested capital organic opportunities across insurance and energy.  Within Insurance, we have seen great success with the development of the LightSpeed platform. This organically developed data-forward platform has automated and improved the underwriting process for our customers, and is driving strong top line growth within our ISO business as we have extended it across personal and commercial lines. Specific to Commercial Lines, we've seen continued success in small commercial for business owners and commercial auto. With LightSpeed, we have augmented our AI and machine learning capabilities, introducing image analytics that will help present a holistic view of risk at the point of quote and ensure that small business owners get the coverage they need. We've also expanded our entity resolution and benchmarking data and analytics to help our diverse client base scale and increase their speed to market. We are also accelerating our customers' journey towards 0 application questions, helping drive speed and efficiency. With over 80 traditional and InsurTech customers, leveraging LightSpeed commercial, we are enabling the industry to free up underwriting talent to focus on more complex risks and helping our customers become the carrier or managing general agent of choice in this fast-moving and profitable space. Within energy, our internally developed cloud-based Lens platform is transforming the way customers interact with the Mackenzie data as we are integrating our complex data sets seamlessly into their workflows. We have greatly reduced our research cycle times from days to hours, allowing us to commercialize solutions more quickly and update data in existing solutions more frequently. This empowers our customers with the data necessary to make timely and well-informed decisions about commodity markets around the globe. We are seeing strong value-based price realization and revenue growth, resulting in solid returns on capital for this platform. The capital management discipline is also evidenced in our acquisition strategy. While interest and valuations for data analytic assets are high, we've been very selective and focused our attention only on assets where we can create incremental value by combining data sets for new solutions, leveraging our infrastructure or improving sales and distribution, through our strong customer relationships and industry scale. Our recent acquisition of FAST is a great example of how we are leveraging our relationships across the industry to accelerate the adoption of FAST software, driving strong returns on invested capital. On the engagement front, even in a mostly virtual mode, we continue to get ever closer to our customers. This engagement starts with the C-suite and runs through all levels of the organization. This is evidenced by increasing frequency of meetings, better attendance at our virtual events and increasing interest from customers to work with us as development partners. In fact, we recently announced 2 key development partners for our Lens Power solution, namely Vestas and Quinbrook. It has also translated into building sales pipelines and more sales opportunities. And we're having great success converting these sales opportunities into new contracts as we benefit from our ability to bundle our broad offerings to meet our customers' unique needs. This is particularly evident with our fastest-growing customer segment in InsurTech. On the innovation front, we recently launched the Cyber Risk Navigator, our cyber risk modeling application. This release represented a year-long effort to redevelop the platform from an on-premise solution to cloud-native SaaS solution. Given the scalability of the cloud, clients are now able to run analyses in minutes that used to take hours. It also provides us the ability to bring new features and model updates to the market quickly, rather than being tied to annual software releases, which is essential for a rapidly changing risk such as cyber.  We also made great strides in advancing our offerings in the telematics space with the introduction of the DrivingDNA Score. This enhanced solution is powered by the unique data from Verisk Data Exchange, that includes 260 billion miles and growing of robust driving behavior data from 8 million connected car drivers. The DrivingDNA Score enables our customers to enter and expand to the rapidly growing usage-based insurance market and is another key addition to our whole suite of telematics solutions. Finally, I'm excited to share about the progress Verisk has made on our environmental stewardship commitments. We recently completed our 2020 greenhouse gas emissions inventory. And I'm pleased to report that, for the fourth straight year, we balanced 100% of Verisk's reported Scope 1, 2 and 3, including business air travel emissions, through a combination of purposeful reduction initiatives and investments in renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets. We remain focused on implementing meaningful physical and operational changes that will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. Those include the consolidation of multiple Verisk offices in Boston and London into new energy-efficient business centers as well as the continuing strategic realignment of our data management activities, to take advantage of the major efficiencies presented by cloud computing. Building on the progress we've already achieved to date, I'm also pleased to share that Verisk has committed to an absolute 21% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2024 compared with the 2019 baseline. In developing the targets, Verisk collaborated with Ecometrica, an accomplished leader in the field of sustainability metrics, software and services. The resulting targets incorporate the latest science-based targets guidance, aligned with the 1.5-degree celsius global future. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we remain committed to addressing the very real impacts of climate change today and for the benefit of future generations. I have great confidence that our focus on innovation and serving our customers will help us deliver on our long-term growth objectives, creating lasting shareholder value. As our business recovers from the short-term impacts of the pandemic, we continue to actively study the signs of resilience across the different parts of our company. Our dynamic capital process is designed to ensure that our capital is deployed into the highest-growth and highest-return opportunities. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10.1% to $748 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 14% to $154 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk declined 13% to $0.94 per share. These declines are the result of a noncash revaluation charge related to the U.K. tax law change. Adjusting for the impact of the $0.21 per share noncash revaluation charge, diluted adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.38. Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we were very pleased with our operating results, led by consistent growth in our subscription revenues and recovery in our transactional revenues as our business rebounds from the COVID-related declines from last year. In the second quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 6.3%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement in our Energy and Financial Services segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic, increased 5.5% in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the growth of 6.5% in the prior year quarter. This stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model. Our COVID-sensitive revenues, which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, continued on a sequential improvement trend and returned to growth this quarter, increasing 12.1%. This compares to declines of 20% in the second quarter last year and the prior quarter performance of declines of 5.9%. Growth was primarily the result of improvements in consulting in our Energy segment and a return to pre-pandemic growth rates in many of our products and services within Insurance, particularly within the U.S. We did experience continued COVID-related weakness in our Financial Services segment as government forbearance programs are negatively impacting bankruptcy volumes. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.2% in the second quarter, led by solid growth in Insurance and Energy, offset in part by weakness in Financial Services. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 49.6% in the quarter, down 172 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but still above our pre-pandemic margin level of 46.6% recorded in the second quarter of 2019. Much of the decline is associated with the normalization of our costs as we anniversary the COVID benefits from last year, including reduced head count growth and lower incentive compensation. This margin also reflects an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs and the impact of acquisitions. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the second quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.8%, demonstrating strong resilience and recovery. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and international insurance software solutions. We also experienced strong growth in transactional revenues, associated with an increased level of securitization revenues in our catastrophe modeling business, a modest benefit from storm-related revenue and double-digit recovery growth in our COVID-impacted revenues as we compare against declines last year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6% in the second quarter while margins declined 148 basis points, reflecting a return to a normalized rate of head count growth compared to the prior year and higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense. We also continue to invest in our breakout areas as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue increased 5% in the second quarter due to a recovery in our consulting and project-based revenues across Energy and Power, strong growth in environmental health and safety solutions and our energy transition research. Included in the quarter was revenue associated with the strategic consulting project that added approximately 1 point to segment growth. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytic environment. We remain a key part of our customers' most strategic conversations as they deal with the ever-changing energy landscape and our broad base of solutions across all commodities are mission-critical to our customers as they navigate through this dynamic environment.  Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.4% in the second quarter, while margins expanded 74 basis points, reflecting continued cost discipline and leverage from sales growth. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we want to remind you that we have a very tough margin comparison in the third quarter, associated with some head count reductions, furloughs and compensation adjustments that we made in reaction to the tough operating environment in 2020. However, some of these costs were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2020. All that said, we have a solid track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well-positioned with our energy transition solutions as well as our Lens platform to continue to outperform the end market and help our customers navigate this broad energy transition.  Financial Services revenue declined 8.1% in the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of contract transitions that we undertook in 2020 and will continue through the third quarter of 2021 as well as a lower level of bankruptcy revenue because of government support and forbearance program.  Spend informed analytics demonstrated stronger growth than expected as spending and advertising improved, which enabled us to reduce some of the negative impact on revenue growth from the contract transitions that we originally anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA declined 77% in the quarter, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. We continue to believe that the actions we have taken with E&S over the last few years are setting the business on a stronger foundation from which to grow going forward. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.6% compared to 20.4% in the prior year quarter. This higher tax rate is the result of an earlier-than-anticipated enactment of a U.K. tax law change that caused a noncash revaluation charge. This is simply a timing difference from our original expectations as the impact occurred in the second quarter instead of the third quarter as we had originally forecast. There is no change to full year results. Given the earlier timing of the tax law change and the fact that this charge was onetime in nature, we now expect our tax rate to approximate 20% to 22% for the second half of 2021.  Adjusted net income was $191 million, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.17 for the second quarter 2021, adjusting for the impact of a $0.21 per share noncash revaluation charge related to the U.K. Tax Law change described earlier, diluted adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.38. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $233 million for the quarter, down 6.5% from the prior year period. The prior year period cash flow benefited from a deferral in both federal income tax payments and certain employer payroll taxes as a result of the CARES Act, partly offset by earn-out payments.  Year-to-date, net cash provided by operating activities was $682 million, reflecting growth of 11.4% versus the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $62.5 million for the quarter, up 10.2%. We continue to believe that CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the second quarter, we returned $197 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest-return growth initiatives, but also return capital to shareholders consistently. Our strategy to deliver long-term and sustainable growth remains unchanged. We are encouraged by the recovery we are experiencing in our COVID-impacted businesses, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability. While we do have tough cost comparisons this year, we believe that we should retain some of the margin expansion we experienced in 2020, delivering margins ahead of our 2019 level of 47%. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate and the global economies continue to open up, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth, with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it is difficult to determine that -- to predict that timing. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all of the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James.
Charles Peters: I'm going to let the other analysts focus on the financials. I'd like to pivot to the Insurance business beyond specifically, for the property casualty industry, we're seeing 2 variables, first of all, the -- come out of the lockdown. And then secondly, favorable pricing. And your organic was quite strong in insurance. The insurance industry is forecasting a moderation of growth for them for the balance of the year and into next year. Can you give us an expectation of how those variables are affecting your business?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Scott here. Thanks for the question. Two things. One is, if you were to look at the pricing algorithms that apply into solutions that we provide to the insurance industry, the way that we price our solutions is related to the value of the solutions that we're getting to our customers. So it's not the case that in our -- to the pricing algorithm is a term, which is significant, and that relates to the amount of premium that our customers are putting through their own books of business. Our solutions are priced according to the amount of profitability and growth that they generate for our customers. And every CEO that I speak to in the insurance industry, every one of them to a person considers their business -- to grow the business. And so they are leaning into new methods as a way of trying to grow their businesses. And we expect that to persist. And it's always been the case actually that in our Insurance business, we have grown considerably faster than the underlying product marketplace. And actually, that's true to the energy vertical as well. And why? Because our customers are trying to make increasing use of data analytics solutions. So we're not really yoked to the net written premium volumes in the insurance industry.
Charles Peters: Got it. My follow-up question, again sticking with operations, and you talked about your claim analytics and products and the suite of products you're offering there. Insurance industry is really beginning to struggle with inflation costs, repair costs on cars. Rental car rates have gone through the roof. And I'm just curious, from an operational perspective, the products -- your service providing to the industry, how are they adapting rapidly to these changing conditions in the marketplace to help the insurance industry?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, that is something that our customers care about a great deal. And so it's really incumbent upon us to make sure that the cost factors associated with the kinds of solutions we've got, which are aimed at understanding what it takes to repair something, we need to make sure that the underlying cost factors are current. And that is something that we give a lot of attention to. That has always been a part of the way that we approach this. But it's particularly important in a moment like this where demand, demand surge and, therefore, the price of the underlying commodities moves around.  You have highlighted something that our customers care quite a bit about. Actually, I'm going to turn to Mark here, who leads our insurance vertical. Not long ago, we were on a call with the CEO of one of the largest insurance companies in North America and this was one of the topics they highlighted. And we had a lot of conversation about what we're doing and the way that our solutions do keep up. So I'm really just affirming that the topic that you've highlighted there is on the minds of our customers. Mark, anything you want to add to that?
Mark Anquillare: No, I think our customers expect us to be on top of that. So as an example, it's -- the repair cost estimate solutions, we're making constant updates on a weekly basis. We're providing them what's the cost of lumber, as an example, which has been a very significant inflationary item. And their repair cost estimates are reflected that -- are reflecting that increase. We are very much into the world of social inflation, right? The cost of litigation and the cost of claims is up as a result of that. So that -- those trends are reflected in our loss costs. That's the pricing they do. It's reflected in the repair cost estimates. It's reflected in how they underwrite a property or any insurance risk, and I'd like to think that we are at the lead in thinking for them on that topic.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of Bank of America.
Gary Bisbee: Scott, thanks for the updates on innovation and technology. And I wanted to ask a little bit about that. You talked about how the tech modernization progress you're making is accelerating the ability to innovate and reducing CapEx, which you're trading that off for higher capital spending on innovation and new products. I guess a 2-parter. As we think about innovation broadly across the company, do you keep internally -- or can you help us think about like the concept of a vitality index? How much more is all of this change you're doing contributing to growth from innovation? And then secondly, do you see that benefit more as something that should allow you continue to deliver to the long-term 7% revenue growth target that you have? Or is there potential as that innovation accelerates that you could begin to outperform that target more meaningfully as innovation and new products become a larger part of your revenue?
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Gary. Well, maybe to your second question first. We do feel very good about the shape of our business, where we sit in the flow of what is happening in the business world. One of the most important things happening in the economy is businesses becoming the better, more analytic digital version of themselves. And that is fundamentally what is in and around and underneath our business and that we enjoy these tremendous relationships with our customers founded upon trust and some really, really valuable and distinctive solutions. That's our business. And the environment in which we're doing our work, obviously, the pandemic has had an effect as it did on everybody. But over longer periods of time, there are these very constructive trends. And so that's kind of fundamentally our growth story. Against that, our customers look to us to be their fill in the blank tech partner. There are -- in every one of the verticals we serve, there's a fill in the blank tech, InsurTech, fintech, energy tech. There's a list of players like that as long as both of your arms. Our customers expect us to be providing innovation. That is one of the reasons why they lean into the relationship with us in the first place. So I think the nature of your question, Gary, was like this investment into that solution and what is the effect of that in terms of our growth. We pay attention to that. It would probably surprise you to know the relatively modest size of investment opportunities that all the way to the office of the CEO we're looking at because it's the lifeblood of our business. And so we do -- we are resolving things down to the level of the individual solution, and we pay attention to how they're doing. And we make decisions about should we put more in because it looks very promising, should we pull back from it because it appears not to be gaining steam. We're doing that all the time. That is what we do on a moment-to-moment basis. But when you talk about vitality, you really -- you have to take it holistically. Because as we said earlier in this call, by count of corporate entity, in the insurance industry, the most rapidly growing segment are the InsurTechs, the new players. And I take such comfort in the fact that they show up with a clean sheet of paper. And they're rethinking everything. How are we going to build an insurance business? And they seem so consistently to want to standardize on all of our solutions. That's vitality. Now they're adopting solutions that we -- in some cases, that we created years ago. But they're buying into them because they remain right at the leading edge. I mean, they're very insistent that everything be cloud-native, tech-forward. They just -- they're not even going to look at you if you're not that way. So I would just encourage you to understand vitality means a lot of things. It means the infusion of value into a solution that has been around for a long period of time as well as the new solution. It's new customers as well as existing customers. But there's no question, if you pop all the way to the top of the organization and ask the question, look at that top line rate of organic revenue growth. One of the most powerful things that drives our growth is the adoption of solutions, whether it's a new solution by an existing customer or an existing but enhanced solution by a new customer. And the investing that we do in innovation is in support of all that. Mark, do you want to add something?
Mark Anquillare: Yes, just maybe to provide a good example of everything Scott described. I think one of the big success stories is really inside of what is our underwriting and rating ISO business. We continue to have a very big business focused on what we refer as loss cost rules and forms. And we have been growing kind of an inflationary way because we've been very thoughtful with our customers. The growth that we've seen, that has increased over the last several years is because of that innovation investment and kind of bundling things for these InsurTechs and others. So I just wanted to reaffirm and maybe provide tangible evidence to that.
Gary Bisbee: And then just a quick follow-up for Lee. Margins, you did a nice job keeping the majority of the pandemic benefit from the prior year in this year's quarter. What caused, I guess, travel's one probably that hasn't come back. But what other cause may not have fully normalized and sort of -- is this a good rule of thumb going forward? Or would you expect that more of the costs that came out last year likely will come back in, in the next quarter?
Mark Anquillare: Yes. Thank you, Gary. I try to look at the cost structure and evaluate what's temporal and what's structural. And there is some temporal element of this that we've been able to hold on to. But I think to your point on the travel and entertainment side, I think there are structural savings that we are -- we'll be able to take advantage of over time. And so I think some of that, there is a structural change.  I also think over the longer term, as we adopt or adapt to the flexible work structure that Scott described in his comments that it will provide opportunities for us from a productivity, from a real estate cost standpoint to reduce some of those expenses over time. But of course, that follows kind of the lease renewal process. But those will be things that we're able to achieve over time as well. And then finally, the other element is compensation, and that is more directly tied to our overall performance against the growth targets and overall head count growth. And I think that will -- that's the element that is likely and we'll certainly hope is going to normalize consistent with the achievement of our revenue growth and our EBITDA growth.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies.
Hamzah Mazari: I just wanted to go back to the question on your long-term sort of 7%-plus organic growth sort of aspiration. It was very consistent prior to 2015. And I realize, post-2015, you had mix issues, cyclicality, the business mix changed in the portfolio. But going forward, is it just the world reopens and you can get back to 7%-plus? Or you need to see some of these benefits from the big investment spend that's been going on? And that really lags. Just give us a sense of -- is it just the macro? Or is it execution or any other thing we should be paying attention to, to get back to 7%-plus consistently?
Scott Stephenson: Well, as I said before, the nature of our business is that because we're providing a unique kind of value to our customers, very consistently, our experience has been that we grow at a rate greater than the rate of growth in the verticals that we're serving. And I don't see any change in that. When you describe it that way, kind of stable normal environments are, all else equal, supportive. And you would have to expect over long periods of time, if you look at the marketplaces that we serve, they're very important elements of the economy. So a thesis, which is -- they will remain important is a pretty sound one. And then actually, the demography of the customer set inside of these verticals, they don't really change all that rapidly. Of course, we're always paying attention to that, but they don't tend to -- so you've got that as the background. But there is no question that there is a huge dependence upon execution. The whole innovation agenda has to be done well. We have to dig in with our customers as development partners to make sure that we hit what's needed, that we get it to market faster. All of those things have a lot to do with returns on any given innovation investment that we've made. So that's very important. And another thing, which -- I don't know, I suppose if you watch us really carefully over a long period of time, this would be evident, but I just want to highlight that there is a great deal of dynamic inside of what we're doing in terms of looking at the solution families and the solution sets that we've got and deciding where are they and where are they headed.  And we have a very long track record. I'll just -- I'll pick the insurance vertical since it's the largest one for us. Investing more inside of things that are showing a lot of promise, but retiring in some cases, selling off solution sets that we have as well. And so it can all look -- it's kind of like the duck on top of the lake. It looks very steady, but underneath, there's various paddling going on. And we get down to the level of individual solutions. Again, just using insurance as an example, through the years, we've retired a number of things that we were doing. We invented a whole lot of things. All of that is inside of getting to this long-term view of growth potential.
Lee Shavel: If I can just kind of supplement on that to provide some validation, I think you referenced a couple of elements here. But if you look at the underlying insurance business, it gets consistently delivered on that 7% organic growth area, where there have been negative impacts from that is it has either been because of some of the nearer-term cyclical elements associated with the energy business. But that business, as we have seen and demonstrated, particularly with the Lens platform, the investment in the energy transition practice, has demonstrated their potential to move to similar levels of growth. And Financial Services has been undergoing a transition to a more focus on sustainable growth, reducing some of that volatility. So I want to make certain that you appreciate that underneath the space is a consistent track record of delivering on that potential, with some of the other elements as we move down this path of investing in the platform in order to -- for us to deliver the value of those rapidly growing data sets, improved platforms against the business. That's been the recipe that is delivered and supports our conviction of the achievability of that going forward.
Hamzah Mazari: That's extremely helpful, really appreciate that. And then just my follow-up question is around capital allocation. Your leverage is arguably going to get very low next year. Your CapEx at some point is going to go down and so free cash flow should inflect a lot. Should we be thinking about buybacks being a much bigger piece of return on sort of your cash deployment? Or should we be thinking outsized growth in the dividend? You haven't done much large-scale M&A. So I'm assuming you can do M&A and return cash. Just any thoughts as to when you see that big free cash flow inflection at some point, what do you do with the cash?
Lee Shavel: So Hamzah, thanks for the question, and we appreciate you identifying the strength in the cash flow. I think the important thing to emphasize here is that we believe that one of the strongest elements that we have, the strongest opportunities that we have to create value is investing internally within the business, as Scott has described, in the technology, in the data sets, in new services for our clients. And so we want to make certain that we are taking every advantage to where we think we can generate incremental growth, where we can generate high incremental returns on capital from that. So we start from the position of how much capital do we have available that we're generating from the business. What are our opportunities first to invest in the business, in a way that takes advantage of those opportunities to generate growth and returns? Secondly, are there opportunities that we see in the M&A market to invest in businesses that we can create value by meaningfully improving their revenue growth through our distribution, utilizing their data sets more effectively or improving their technology? And FAST, as we've described, this has been a great example of that. Genscape in our energy business has been additive, has generated attractive returns on capital for us. So that's the second use. And then the decision on share repurchases is really an outcome of what capital do we have that we don't have an opportunity, we don't see an opportunity to invest, to contribute to growth or returns on capital. So it is an outcome of our capital allocation process, not something that we target at the outset. So kind of taking your question, if we don't see those opportunities, if the M&A market doesn't present opportunities for us given where valuations are or the nature of the business to create value, then we would expect that excess capital to be returned either through the dividend or through increased share repurchases, but it will all be driven by that investment opportunity and our discipline.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of Truist Securities.
Andrew Jeffrey: Mark, maybe a question for you on LightSpeed. It sounds like it's one of the more exciting revenue growth drivers within your insurance businesses, especially as you expand beyond auto. Can you maybe dimensionalize for us the kind of pricing power you might have in that business and how important that is to the durability of that 7% segment organic revenue growth target?
Mark Anquillare: Yes. So let me try to maybe provide some parameters. The way we're going about this is we really believe that insurer, in their search for the best experience to the customer, the digital engagement, they want information that's actionable and they can kind of have a bindable quote, meaning when you go online and you want to get a price, you don't want it to change. And basically, 33% to 40% of the cases, that price changes, if you say I'm interested. And they do all this underwriting and pull the information. we're bringing all that information forward and the combination of data we have and analytics so that the insurer has confidence to quote. And that's a big change. So that is noteworthy and important. And what we've tried to do in kind of thinking about the opportunity here, we know who's providing that information. And we feel it's about $1 billion that's going to be type of market opportunity in the insurance space. So we simply have a lot of runway, especially on the personal line side. We have a strong base on the commercial line side at the so that's kind of an extension, which hopefully provides you with a little bit of context of why we think it's important and also why we've continued to emphasize that .
Andrew Jeffrey: Yes, that's really helpful. I think being able to quantify some of these TAMs will really help investors gain confidence in the long-term growth targets. And then a quick follow-up on cat modeling. It seemed like that was a decent tailwind this quarter. Is that something we need to think about in terms of volatility? How much of an impact does that have on your business from an issuance perspective on a quarterly basis?
Mark Anquillare: So the majority of our catastrophe modeling is around a touchdown subscription model that we've taken a lot of customers and we've had a lot of wins. So the growth you've seen, the underlying foundational growth, is us winning customers and bringing them on to the platform.  Where you're seeing a little bit of a spike and valley is inside of what is the ILS market. Those are the cat bonds we referred to. And that is a little bit a function of timing of the market. We had a good couple -- we had a good quarter. We probably would expect a strong for end of year. It's a little bit tough to tell whether that's going to grow in 2022. At the same time, I would say to you that the market in general is getting more and more collateralized those type of risks. So if you were to ask me what the growth perspective is for cat bonds over the next 5 years, I would say it's going to be up. It's going to be bigger, and we're well-positioned for it, whether it's going to be up or down in one particular quarter, that is a tough estimate for you. And I hope you can appreciate the difficulty we have in forecasting quarter-by-quarter, but I think we have feel for year-over-year.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse.
Kevin McVeigh: I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more context on the Duck Creek announcement earlier this quarter where they talked about the enhanced integration within your insured workflows and what that can mean to the business longer term in terms of similar template. Should we expect similar opportunities?
Mark Anquillare: Let me continue. Thank you for the question, another good opportunity. I think I've highlighted in past sessions here, one of the things we're seeing more and more frequently is our customers are looking forward to this interconnected ecosystem. They want the ability to use their internal solutions, their solutions or other third-party solutions in a connected way, whether that's through APIs or micro services. And we're spending a lot of time and money making that happen. So what we're seeing and what we're hearing and what it does is it really helps us because there are a lot of customers out there on those big insurance software solutions like Duck Creek. Guidewire would be another one. And we have integrated with those solutions in such a way that those customers get access information from Verisk and analytics from Verisk or claim solutions from Verisk, in a way that makes it easier for us to operate, more efficient for them to operate. And what it also does is it gives us an opportunity for easier to sell because the integration is built in and it's connected. So we find it to be very customer-focused, and it also gives us some runway in accelerated pipeline for sales.
Kevin McVeigh: Mark, just a follow-up. Does the cloud conversion enable you to do more of those, whereas maybe a year ago when it was more on-prem, you wouldn't have the functionality to do it? Or is it just coincidence in terms of the timing?
Mark Anquillare: So let me say it this way. I think what we have done over the last 20 years is we've had SaaS-based environments. So these are not locally installed solutions. So the SaaS-based business model facilitates this. Your question now is a good one. I think we can do it quicker and more efficiently when we want to integrate using the cloud and as we've kind of transitioned to cloud. So it's not been an enabler, but it has become more efficient in cost-effective.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird.
Jeffrey Meuler: I appreciate all of the updates in terms of your current thinking on the cloud transition. I was hoping you could give us a similar update on the associated expense park. I think we said that there's a headwind from increased cloud transition costs this year. So just would love any thoughts on how much are you spending per year. When does it flip positive? And when it flips positive, is it a step function change? Or should it just be viewed in the context of expanding organic EBITDA faster than organic revenue over time because there is a reallocation of those savings?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. There are several elements to it. And I know that you're asking it was in the context of cost, which I'll address. But I also want to make sure that there's an appreciation that there is a CapEx element to this. And then there is also the productivity element to this transition. First, on the cost. You are taking on an additional cloud capacity from the provider before you are eliminating some of that legacy. So you have kind of a redundant, redundant period. In addition, you were taking on recoding expense for the applications as you migrate them into that new environment. And so as we have been implementing this process across hundreds of applications in our various businesses, you have that upfront cost that is a negative cost impact, which we view as an investment. And we look at it on individual project-by-project basis. Our technology team does a great job tracking the specific costs and the savings, but think of this as rolling across the organization.  And for the first year and second year, we are still in a net investment mode from a cost perspective within the business. CapEx will be more limited going forward, so you will be extracting CapEx savings over time because the CapEx intensity of our technology footprint is declining, but that's something that's achieved over time. And we're beginning to experience that in this second year of the project, but that will continue naturally into the third year and beyond. And so if we think about OpEx and CapEx, we're still in a net investment mode in the second year. We would expect that in the third year that turns into a positive contribution. Now the other thing to factor in is that, as Scott described on the CapEx front, that is -- it will enable us -- and this is also true on the OpEx front, to shift some of that OpEx into other investment areas. So when I've talked about margin in the past, I've described there is natural operating margin expansion on a pre-investment level, but then we consume a portion of that from an investment perspective, and that's where we generate incremental growth and returns. So we do believe that this will be additive going into the third year, and then we'll determine do we see investment opportunities to pursue that. Beyond and riding on top of all of that is, I think, the more material benefit of this, which is the pace of innovation, the ability to associate more data sets to populate platforms that are creating a broader lift, I think, within the business and is sensed by, I think, a number of the questions in terms of its impact on our overall growth. So I wanted to give you kind of a comprehensive sense of the way that we are thinking about it. And because of that complexity, I think it would be very limiting to kind of specifically just focus on the cost element of it. Yes, there will be cost benefits, but those have to be -- will be balanced by our investment decisions and then the broader impact from the transition.
Scott Stephenson: And just to add to what you were saying there, Lee, and not trying to sort of specify sort of a particular level of margin impact. I do think of this transition as being an event at a moment in time. And it does have some discrete elements associated with them. Just to call out a few of them, there will come a moment where we're no longer computing on mainframe. We're not fully at that point yet, but there -- I mean, we will have an event where we'll get out the sledgehammers and literally break up the cores inside the mainframe. And that -- we're already reducing the load on the mainframe, and we can find some ways to benefit from that. We run power data centers, 2 of them, in the United States. We will close them at some point. There are fixed costs associated with data centers. And so that will be an event, and we'll call out those events for you when we get to those. And then something else, which I think is really extremely important, is that you used to buy compute capacity in relatively large chunks. And then as we move more towards the server environment, the chunks got smaller, but you're still buying chunks. In a world like that, anybody who's writing an algorithm, anybody who is demanding compute power, for them, you've already bought the capacity within limits. And so incrementally, it doesn't cost you anything. And in a world like that, you can actually be a little bit -- I don't want to use the word sloppy, but you can essentially use more compute capacity in how you want to get to the answer you're trying to get to.  And maybe you don't have to cash that analysis you just did quite as much or you don't have to summarize at the column and row level once, and then work through those derivatives, et cetera. My point here being that there should be an interaction between how you analyze for -- how you compute in the context of analysis and the way that you consume computing capacity. And in a variabalized world, you have to pay more attention to that than you used to. And so our development and analytics are responding and need to respond to that. But on the other side of the transition you actually think differently about literally what do you encode that you did before so that you can be efficient in your use of compute capacity.  So what I'm saying is there's a multiyear thing here. But on the other side, it is actually very different than where you were into this transition. You don't run physical facilities. You don't run really large hardware and you think very differently about how you structure analysis. And that will just be a more -- that's a better world for a company like ours.
Jeffrey Meuler: I appreciate the comprehensive response. You addressed the InsurTech impact and the vertical software providers that serve the insurance industry. I want to ask about, I guess, the third category of maybe adjacent players to you, which is there's a lot of funding going to companies that are gathering data with or, I guess, horizontal ambitions, but some of them also have ambitions to apply the data to the insurance industry, and there's the real estate digital twin image capture companies, the satellite base, the telematics, there's a whole bunch of these companies that are out there. And I know you have the Verisk Data Exchange, but curious as to how you view the impact on Verisk or your customers from those types of options and if they're competitive partnership opportunities for you, et cetera.
Scott Stephenson: Yes, sort of in reverse order on your question, yes, there is partnership opportunities. It would probably be of interest to you. If I took a list of the top 50 InsurTech companies, the number of them that we're in communication with today. When I say InsurTech companies, I don't mean new form insurance companies, I mean providers of solutions. And the number of those companies that we're in conversation with -- many of those conversations, they are coming and looking for us. So we start out aware of the fact that, in this world, you can start out with some programming capability and try to create something where you're hosting it. And it's mostly about digital workflows, et cetera. We see this all the time. And so we do pay attention to it. I would just say also that there are a lot of reasons why our customers lean into a relationship with us. Some of it has to do with the breadth of our family of solutions. Some of it has to do with our proven track record. Some of it has to do with reliability. And customers really care about that when you're talking about an enterprise-level application. There are a lot of reasons. And we're powered by really, really strong content assets. And a lot of the fill-in-the-blank tech start-ups, they don't start with content. So we never walk around feeling overly confident. We're very aware of these developments, but we do feel as if we start out in a very strong place in this discussion. And we like talking to these fill-in-the-blank techs and they like talking to us. So if there's some place where 1 plus 1 can be greater than two, we're very alert to that.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS.
Alexander Kramm: Sorry if I missed this earlier, but on the COVID impact, the 15% that grew 12% this quarter, did you -- or can you talk about where we are there? Do you feel like we are fully recovered? Or what areas do you still wait for, I guess, improvement? I guess I could point to a couple. But yes, where do you think we are in that transition?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Thank you, Alex. I appreciate the question. So I would say that we are -- when we look at our COVID-sensitive revenues across the business as a whole, we're looking at it business-by-business. And so we are seeing some recovery, stronger recovery in certain areas, for instance, on the property side. We've seen in the insurance front probably the strongest recovery. Some recovery in driving, although driving is -- would not be what we would describe as fully recovered at this point. In Energy and Specialized Markets, we are seeing a strong rebound in consulting revenues, so that is demonstrating relatively robust recovery. We're also seeing some strengthening in our new subscriptions, which will flow in over time, I think, reflecting some of the improved pricing dynamics. Whereas in DFS, there is an element, which I refer to our spend-informed analytics, which because of advertising and marketing, we have seen an uplift. And that's performing better than we expected, but the bankruptcy element of our business is still experiencing the challenges of all of the government support out there in the environment. And so that's yet to recover. It becomes very difficult to kind of quantify how far -- how much of a recovery. I would say it's certainly a partial recovery, not a full recovery, but the trends that we see, we expect to see continuing improvement in that recovery for the business. And it's probably worth noting in our insurance -- in the Insurance and in the Energy and Specialized Markets business, our COVID-sensitive revenues were up 20% year-over-year. Financial Services are still seeing a year-over-year decline, even though we've seen an improvement in spend-informed analytics and a deterioration -- or not a deterioration, but kind of the same level of declines on the bankruptcy side. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of texture across the business for some of the trends that we're seeing.  I would also note, naturally, it should come as no surprise, that our travel business internationally is still suffering significantly from very low international travel. And so that's an important component.
Alexander Kramm: Okay. Maybe just a very quick follow-up on this. On the energy side, specifically, if I look at some of the recurring transactional breakouts, which -- I know they're not perfect, but it does look like a lot of the upside this quarter came from that consulting on the more transactional side. Given all the things that you're talking about with Lens, et cetera, is that not driving the impact yet that you are hoping for? Or are there maybe some retention issues elsewhere? Doesn't it look like it's flowing through the business quite yet, the success you were talking about there. So maybe just flesh that out a little bit more.
Scott Stephenson: Sure, Alex. Thanks for asking that question as a follow-up in that regard. So I think it is a good distinction to make that the consulting element is where we are seeing that recovery on the COVID-sensitive side and focusing on the subscription side of the business, and I kind of want to build on my earlier comments. The impact of Lens, which has been very positively received by a lot of our clients, has been generating significant contract renewals with price increases in the mid- to high single digits. Now there are 2 elements to that in terms of its ongoing impact. One is going to be the rolling impact of that as subscriptions become -- come up for renewal. And the second element of that is that then, again, that subscription is something that will phase in over time given the nature of that. But the important point from my perspective is that we are seeing a very positive uptake. Clients are working with Lens. We've gotten several operational assessments. They've been very positive. And we've been able to achieve those price increases. So that will be based upon our feedback so far, a slow rolling but an improvement to the growth in that business, even before we also begin to utilize that platform to expand that customer set and the applications. We also are still experiencing some impact from the last cycles, loss of 1 client in the energy space and some consolidation in the upstream area that is having a near-term impact on the research component. So that's another element that's factoring into it. But I think the distinction that you made is relevant. Hopefully, that differentiates that near-term consulting boost against what we see as constructive longer-term trends from Lens, and the pricing experience that we've had and how that should flow through over time within the business.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Lee, I wanted to ask you, as you've taken over the operational responsibility of Argus, what have you found in terms of the fit of Argus in terms of Verisk's ability to create further customer value, five new customer segments for Argus data or just innovate in general within a subscription model?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you for the question, Andrew. I have been able to spend more time with the team at Verisk Financial Services. And one thing I would first emphasize is that they have been very focused on trying to integrate the data sets that we have from the various businesses and move from a more compartmentalized approach to the business to a focus on our broader client objectives. And in fact, Lisa has implemented some organizational changes that support that approach and focus from the business, which we think moves that to a more effectively integrated platform for our businesses. And we have also taken the steps structurally to move that business from a more consulting-oriented revenue base to more sustainable growth. And we are seeing that from a new business signing and pipeline perspective in the way that we are bringing on new business and how we're structuring it and the types of business. To your question, one thing that's important to emphasize is that Verisk's Financial Services, in many ways, has been an intellectual capital engine for much of the rest of the business. A lot of what they have learned in dealing with very large data sets and integrating them, managing them, data architecture elements have been exported to the rest of the business. Many of the data scientists, including our CIO, Nick Daffan; our Chief Analytics Officer, Vikas Vats, have come from that background and are -- we're drawing from their expertise. So there are other elements of the -- of what they've contributed to Verisk has been helpful. We are pulling from some of those externalized elements in a variety of ways analytically to developing new products, the replatforming of Argus 2.0 is an example of where we've been able to draw from some of that external expertise. So I think there is a good dialogue across the 2 entities. And we also look for interactions between the credit dimensions that Verisk Financial Services have and some of the insurance elements of our business to inform and generate new opportunities.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: Wanted to ask another question on the fintech side. I guess, by partnering with the software platforms, it sounds like there's potential for upside from selling additional solutions on there. Just wanted to understand, compared to history before these platforms were as prevalent, were you providing a platform to your customers? Or are they just using their own platform? And so in this case, this is just complete upside? Or is there any revenue that is sort of lost by them going to a sort of software platform that's not yours?
Scott Stephenson: No, there's not revenue loss by them going to a platform provided by another third party. So just to expand on that answer just a hair, so if you look at sort of over -- I'd say, over the course of the decade, you go back a decade ago, it was either -- basically, what we were doing was going to market either through our own platforms or our solutions were operating more as point solutions and most of the integration was occurring customer by customer. They were doing their own integration. So now that's where it's where we are today and where we're headed into the future. We are more platforms than we were, significantly more platform than we were. And that is constructive inside of the growth of our business now and into the future. And if you actually look at the pattern of investment, what are we spending money on, a great deal of it and a lot more than it used to be, is on developing software, which you should hear us building our own platforms. But when we strike a relationship with a third party that is itself, providing a platform. It's -- we're analyzing that in the context of, well, okay, we could go direct the customer through the integration themselves. But basically, that third-party platform that isn't ours is substituting for the customer's own integration efforts, but not in a way that it impacts the underlying value of what it is that we provide, which is being integrated and over there. So the whole movement towards platforms is customer-friendly and it's constructive for Verisk because we, ourselves, are doing a lot more of that than we used to.
Toni Kaplan: That's helpful. And then just in the past couple of quarters, Financial Services has had single-digit EBITDA margins. Is this the new normalized margin? Or is there something depressing it temporarily? And any updated thoughts on strategic options?
Scott Stephenson: Definitely not the new normal. Lee, I don't know if you want to add on that.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Toni, thanks for the question. It's not the case. We are -- what you are seeing in that quarterly impact is the impact of some of the contract transitions, but we are expecting, as we come through that third quarter, a period where we reached the end of that contract transition impact, that you will see more normalized margins within that business. So that is not -- what you see now is not the expected sustained element here.
Toni Kaplan: And normal looks like what it did last year, for example?
Lee Shavel: In that vicinity.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays
Manav Patnaik: Yes, I just wanted to follow up on the Financial Services as well. We've heard the positive spin on the business for quite some time. But for 5 years now, the growth has declined. The margins have come down as well. So like you guys decided to cut the cord or what's the plan? How do we get comfortable that it can be additive to growth?
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, Manav. And we -- it's a fair point. We understand the frustration in -- with regard to growth. I think it's important to understand that there are 2 factors that are influencing where the growth rates are right now that are very significant. One is the -- are the contract transitions that we believe are, one, absolutely the right operational decision. They are structural, and they are finite. And as I've just indicated in the answer to Toni, we move those after the third quarter of this year. Element is naturally the impact from COVID on the business on our COVID-sensitive revenues, which clearly had an impact on spend informed activity, bankruptcy activity and even some of the bank consulting revenue. And so when we are evaluating, and we are constantly evaluating what we do with all of our businesses and what are our options to optimize the value of that, the right time frame that we think is to look at what's the structural transitions and the impact from COVID. And so certainly, 2022 should be what we believe is a much more normalized level from a revenue, revenue growth and from a margin perspective that informs our view of the more normal operating state of the business as well as a sense of how the structural changes that we have implemented and the operating changes will demonstrate their impact more clearly in terms of growth at a top line and an EBITDA level. So in short, I think, as we move through these 2 temporal impacts and the structural impact on the contract transition, 2022 should be a much more normalized basis for us to be...
Lee Shavel: Well, I'll say it more strongly. 2020 would have been coming out year party for Verisk Financial, but for the pandemic. 2020 would have been a coming out party for Verisk Financial. All these changes that we're talking about making. And yes, I mean the fact that the business has an above-average level of transaction revenues relative to the mix that is in Verisk has caused it to sort of respond differentially. But beginning in 2018, we acknowledge changes that needed to happen in the business model. They were all packaged and on deck and ready and then the pandemic happens.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then maybe just a similar question on Energy. I think Lens obviously has been doing really well, and you talked about energy transition growing. But I think, collectively, they're still a small part of the business, right? So how do you -- what is the other initiatives going on there as you helped us grow 7% in what's a pretty cyclical industry?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So in that situation, when we look at the rapidly changing landscape within power, I think it's important, Manav, to understand kind of a legacy perception of where Wood Mackenzie was from an oil and gas market, resource asset, pricing orientation and their expertise and where they have evolved and where they -- their potential to continue to evolve in an environment where the energy transition from carbon-based to alternative tools and all of the capital decision, investment decision, expense decisions that this client base investors are addressing is we are incredibly well-positioned. And Lens is the platform that puts us in the space to be able to capture the rapid growth in data sets and analytics for that business. We're already seeing it, as I indicated, in terms of the pricing on the legacy product. We're seeing it in the growth in our energy transition revenues, both on a consulting and subscription basis within chemicals. You saw an acquisition in metals and mining, which have increasing relevance given the importance of battery raw materials. And so we view Wood Mackenzie and PowerAdvocate, our primary energy businesses, as positioning themselves very well for capturing the growth in demand for those products. And we see through the impact on consulting revenues and some of the challenges on the subscription basis that growth potential ahead. So I think it's a combination of both that future opportunity and the success that we've had to date in moving that business forward. One piece of evidence from that, if you look at a number of our competitors in that space, I think you will see very differentiated performance from a revenue growth and an earnings growth perspective, reflecting the significant progress that we've made in moving it from that legacy orientation around the upstream oil and gas sector.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets.
Ashish Sabadra: I just wanted to focus on the strength in the software within the Insurance segment, both international as well as the life insurance -- or international as well as life insurance. You obviously talked about strength in the FAST business. I was wondering what's really driving it. Is it new customers? Is it ability to cross-sell? How do you -- can you comment on the pipeline? And maybe just a follow-up on that is -- there was a lot of discussion about platform and partnership, but how do you think about buying and building or increasing your software intensity and expanding on the platform that you already have?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. Well, thank you for the question. Let me describe the 2 different verticals or 2 different businesses described. So first of all, with regard to international software, so the most part that represents our Sequel offering. So we were talking a little bit about platforms before the [indiscernible] the claim systems. We are a player in the market. We are the most significant player in the market. And that is about growth in customers. That is about extension of different solutions and products, including some of the acquisitions we did that helped extend that platform, line space, roll block sequel, all of those are this interconnected ecosystem. And we've taken that capability as it relates to, for the most part, specialty and commercial lines, and started to extend it outside of the U.K. and even into the United States. So those are good wins, those are good extensions and it's been very positive.  If I was to go over to the FAST side, which is the life side of things, what we've done is we've infused it with some analytics. But in large part, what you're seeing is, there are some very major life insurers who've made some very major decisions, and they've chosen FAST. These are very long-term contracts, 5 and 10 years. And we are implementing as we speak, and that will be a very nice and very substantial run. Because as we implement, what we will get is I'll refer to it as subscription-types of revenue. And as they put on new products and there's new volumes, we would see increased revenue on each of those lines. So the major wins across the life insurance software platform space, it's been with FAST, in almost every case that we're aware of. And again, those are new logos as well as extension into other solutions or products within existing customers. So hopefully, that answers your question. And what I did try to at least kind of conclude in there, we have significantly increased the investment to make sure we transition to the SaaS environment, to transition to the cloud. We've extended both our capabilities through acquisition and build.
Operator: Thank you. I will turn the call over to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you. This is Scott. I'm seeing some more names. Okay. we are concluded. Thank you all for your time today, your interest. We'll be following up with a number of you. And appreciate as always the dialogue. Have a great rest of the day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Verisk First Quarter 2021 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today’s prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, where we will limit participant to one question and one follow-up. We will have further instructions for you at that time. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk’s Head of Investors Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Mayra, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2021 financial results. Today’s call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business. Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer and Group President, will follow with the financial review. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and Group President will join the team for the Q&A session. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30-days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today’s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today’s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk’s future performance, including, but not limited to, the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Hello, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. 2021 is a special year here at Verisk as it marks our 50th anniversary as a company. For 50 years, our mission and purpose has been the same. We work non-stop in partnership with our customers using data and insights to make a difference by helping protect people, economies, society and our planet. On this journey, we used our unique data and combined it with advanced technologies in new ways to unlock meaningful insights about risk, becoming a global leader in cutting edge analytics. And while we are very proud of our accomplishments over the last 50 years, it inspires us to look ahead to all the difference we can make over the next 50 years. I’m pleased to share that this year is off to a solid start marked by continued growth in our subscription businesses. We’ve delivered solid growth in Insurance, a modest sequential improvement in our Energy segment. Yet we had a challenging quarter within Financial Services. While certain of our businesses continue to be impacted by the pandemic, those revenue streams show resilience as the underlying causal factors improve and we have confidence in this relationship. We will provide more detail on this financial review. For 2021, we remain focused on building long-term shareholder value, delivering for our customers through innovation and service, while also protecting the health and well being of our teammates around the globe. Currently, most of our offices are operating in a Phase 1 format and are available for those employees who have volunteered to work from the office. We do have certain offices that have advanced to Phase 2 and even Phase 2 as conditions in their local markets allow and employees are energized to be back in the office. Our Global Protection Services team closely monitors directives from local governments and public health officials around the world, as well as incorporates learnings from our local market experiences to make real-time decisions to maintain the safety of our people. To that end, our teams are closely monitoring the current situation in India in the face of the severe second wave of COVID and we are providing relief and assistance to our India colleagues including vaccination coverage, virtual medical services, emergency relief funds and other essential programs. To-date, we have experienced minimal or no disruption to our business or the services we provide. Over the duration of the pandemic, our teams have proven they can transition efficiently into different work modes with minimal interruption in service to our customers. So while there remains some uncertainty around return to office timing across our many different markets, I have complete confidence that our 9,000 plus teammates at Verisk will continue to navigate through these times effectively and deliver the highest value to our customers. Throughout the pandemic, I’ve maintained a high level of engagement with our customers, CEOs across all three of our segments. Despite the virtual setting, the frequency of these meetings has increased, and the level of engagement and mutual respect has deepened. In these conversations, we are discussing our customers’ highest strategic priorities. In all circumstances, we are receiving feedback that Verisk is a trusted and differentiated partner, and that our solutions and innovations played large and increasing role in our customers journeys to becoming more digitally engaged, more automated and more efficient. These types of constructive meetings are happening across all levels of our organization, most recently within our underwriting and claims councils, which include representatives from our top 25 customers in the Insurance vertical. With regard to digital engagement, we continue to see very strong adoption of our virtual claims processing platform, claims experience, as insurers continue to find additional use cases for remote claims handling outside the pandemic. Our virtual claims tools enable our customers to conduct business at a time when in-person processes were not possible. But it also has the added benefit of settling claims with greater speed. In fact, virtual claims are paid on average 30% faster than the traditional process. We’ve recently added new features to enhance the solution including remote measurement, object recognition and an automated damage assessment tool. We also are having success converting customers from transactional usage to long-term contracts with committed volumes, as they build comfort with the tool and realize the value that remote claims processing can bring to their organization. One of the strongest signals of the deep and expanding relationships with our customers in our view is the fact that they entrust us with their data. I’m pleased to share that in the most recent year 29 insurers have decided to newly contribute data to our ISO Statistical Database. This is the highest number of new participants in a single year over the last 10 years and represents a range of different customers from insure tech startups to multi-state carriers. On the sales front, we’re having great success selling in virtual mode and remain committed to advancing our techniques with ongoing training across the many new virtual selling tools we employ. Our pipelines of new opportunities are some of the strongest in our history and they continue to build. Our customers are more engaged with Verisk as a partner, as evidenced by increased numbers of meetings, better attendance at our virtual conferences, and contract renewals and signings of new deals that are longer in duration. On the innovation front, we continue to make advances with our solutions to drive digital engagement, automate processes and create a seamless interconnected ecosystem, what we have various referred to as platforms analytic environments. While this is a journey we’ve been on for some time, the pandemic has catalyzed our customers to move forward with greater urgency and speed. These platforms analytic environments offer our customers deep integration into their workflows and allow a massive amount of information to be rendered so that decisions can be made quickly and accurately. Often these environments are more software intensive, as we are utilizing this software to gather more data, automate more processes and become even more deeply embedded with our customers. These platforms are also driving healthy and profitable growth for Verisk across our verticals. Let me give you a few recent examples. Within Life Insurance, we’re driving strong growth and profitability as we bundled the industry leading module software offerings at FAST. With the data analytics we have developed across Verisk to create a full suite of Life Insurance Solutions in one singular platform. We’re having great success extending and accelerating the adoption of FAST Solutions across our broad customer base and have a strong pipeline of future deals. In addition, we recently launched new analytics including EHR Triage Engine and Life Risk Navigator. Electronic Health Record Triage Engine uses advanced data analytics and natural language processing to distill 1000s of pages of electronic medical records into a short summary and provides an automated underwriting store, both of which reduce underwriting costs and speed up the process and that leads to an improved buying experience for the end consumer. Life Risk Navigator is a cloud-based modeling platform that offers in depth portfolio analytics to enhance risk selection, quantify changes in mortality rates and drive overall better decision making. Further in March, we enhanced our capabilities in Life Insurance, through the acquisition of 4C Solutions, a software advisory firm with expertise in Group Life Insurance. The addition of 4C enables us to extend our expertise into the Group Life market and help address the needs for Group Life insurers and institutional annuity providers. While each solution is strong on its own, we believe we deliver even more value for our customers, as these solutions are integrated into one holistic interconnected ecosystem. We are also delivering very strong growth at Sequel as we help our customers in the specialty markets digitize and modernize. Sequel Solutions create a truly integrated ecosystem across carriers, brokers and managing general agents throughout the specialty market, and we’re bringing in new customers and expanding our suite of products across existing customers. We are also beginning to see traction in our global expansion of Sequel with new clients signed in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific. To further enhance the value and capability of the Sequel ecosystem, we recently acquired a majority stake in Whitespace Software. The powerful combination of Whitespaces’ digital placing platform with Sequel’s pricing distribution and policy administration applications enables a seamless real-time quote-to-bind solution with straight through submissions for our existing and prospective customers. In our Energy business, we continue to make advances on the development of new modules and sales of new subscriptions for our Lens platform. Despite the softness in the energy end market, customers are recognizing the value and uniqueness of the platform, and this is reflected in new customer subscriptions and constructive pricing for customers that adopt Lens. Additionally, we have lots of interest in future releases for Lens and already have a group of development partners in place to support Lens Power, backed by the proprietary data assets of Wood Mackenzie and Genscape. Lens Power enables customers to maximize investment opportunities in clean energy and be on the forefront of the energy transition and further advances our market leading position in the energy transition. We are well positioned to capitalize on the growing trend of countries and companies around the world, increasing investment toward renewables and green energy, and our solutions will help inform these critical decisions at the highest levels. Lens Power is part of a broader suite of solutions that we have within our Energy segment to help our customers navigate the changing ESG landscape. We are seeing a positive market response to our Energy Customers Solutions for improve management of supply chain risk and ESG priorities like emissions benchmarking and supplier diversity programs. Not only are we helping our customers with their ESG initiatives, we have also moved forward on our own ESG agenda. In early April, we released our Annual CSR report, which you can find in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website. This year’s report is notable for three reasons. First, the environmental section features our Climate Disclosure report, which speaks to the four pillars of TCFD, governance, risk and opportunities, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our Board and senior management team are very engaged on these subjects, including climate change and climate transition, both on the risks we face, but equally important on the opportunities they present for our business. We’ve been helping customers understand, measure and manage risk associated with climate and weather for decades. Wind storms, wildfire and flood risk among others, and are building on a base of knowledge, data, predictive models, analytic expertise, industry leading standards and investments that are already in play, and serving our insurance and energy customers failing. Second, we used the CSR report as the vehicle to deliver our first ever disclosure in accordance with SASB’s recommendations for professional and commercial services companies. The disclosure includes baseline metrics around workforce composition, diversity, engagement and turnover. We intend to update those metrics in our CSR report each year. And finally, the CSR report calls out Verisk approach to cybersecurity, a comprehensive document that describes our commitment and investments to strengthen data security and privacy. That commitment doesn’t just exist on paper, but is reinforced through the mandatory training we conduct annually for all of our employees. We’re very proud of the progress we made throughout 2020. Our Board and senior management team are very much engaged and our entire organization is committed to continue to move forward our ESG agenda over the coming years. I’m confident we have the right strategy and team in place to meet our long-term growth objectives. Our deep domain expertise and relationships with our customers help inform our innovation agenda. And we are treating the year 2021 as one that provides a unique set of signals on the resilience of the different parts of our company which we are pulling into our always active capital process to ensure that our capital is deployed into the highest return opportunities. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone’s attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Additionally, you may notice that we have a slightly new presentation of our financial statements. As Scott mentioned earlier during the quarter, we closed on a majority investment in Whitespace Software. As a result, we now report net income and earnings per share attributable to Verisk. Moving to the financial results for the first quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.3% to $726 million, net income attributable to Verisk decreased 1.8% to $169 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk declined 1% to $1.03, reflecting a $19 million gain on dispositions in the prior year that did not reoccur. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release. We were very pleased with our operating results considering the continued impact from COVID-19. In the first quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.4% led by continued to strengthen our Insurance segment and modest sequential improvement in our Energy segment. This quarters’ performance fundamentally reflected a year-over-year comparison to a largely pre-pandemic quarter, although we began to see progress in our COVID sensitive revenues, which improved sequentially. Our non-COVID sensitive revenues as we defined at the start of the pandemic grew approximately 4.9% on an organic constant currency basis, down from 6.5% rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting a lower level of catastrophe bond securitization activity at AIR and a higher level of impact from consolidation in the Insurance and Energy segments. We did continue to experience as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our revenues. However, we saw an improvement as certain of these products and services returned to growth on a year-over-year basis. COVID sensitive revenues declined approximately 5.9% on an organic constant currency basis during the first quarter, compared to the 12.5% decline in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of improved consulting activity in our Energy sector, but also reflecting a return to growth of several products and services, particularly in the U.S. Despite the impact on revenue in the first quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as a result of effective expense management and lower travel expenses. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.2% in the first quarter, up from 4.9% growth in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA was 47.6% in the quarter, representing leverage across our Insurance and Energy verticals offset in part by weakness in Financial Services. This margin level includes roughly 150 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to a more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. On that note, let’s turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the first quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and insurance software solutions. We experienced a modest benefit from storm related revenues as a result of the ice storms in Texas and the Southeast. However, this was more than offset by lower level of securitization revenues in our catastrophe modeling business as issuance was lowered year-over-year. In addition, we experienced declines in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19, as we had very minimal COVID impact in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.3% in the first quarter, while margins expanded 196 basis points, demonstrating strong margin expansion, despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and increased costs associated with our cloud of transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 0.6% in the first quarter, due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. Growth in core research and environmental health and safety service revenues was offset by declines in transactional and consulting revenues. We attribute our performance to the diversification of our revenue streams into higher growth breakout areas like the energy transition and chemicals, the broad range of end markets that we serve and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6% in the first quarter, while margins expanded 237 basis points, reflecting continued cost discipline and the benefit of lower travel expenses. As a key partner to our Energy customers, we are deeply engaged with them and part of their most strategic and important decisions. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well-positioned with our energy transition solutions, as well as our Lens platform to continue to outperform the end market and help our customers navigate this broad energy transition. Financial Services revenue declined 12.8% in the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of contract transitions that we undertook in 2020 and which will continue for the next two quarters, as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 74%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment’s smaller base. We continue to make progress on our journey to transition Verisk Financial Services to a more sustainable subscription based business. We are achieving the goals we have set for the business and have taken actions that we believe benefits a business in the long run, but are likely to continue to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. To that end, given the continued impacts from COVID-19 and the contract transitions, we expect to see a similar level of revenue and profit performance in the second quarter of 2021. However, as the impact of the contract transitions abate and our COVID sensitive revenues improve, we anticipate a stronger back half of the year performance. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.5%, compared to 20.8% in the prior year quarter, mostly owing to lower stock option exercises in the current period. As we have discussed, there will likely continue to be some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personal decisions. As a result of a tax law change in the U.K., we now believe that our full year tax rate for 2021 will be between 23% and 25%, up from the 20% to 22% we had previously provided. This U.K. legislation was passed in March and will increase the U.K. corporate tax rate to 25% from 19% previously. This U.K. tax rate increase is likely to create variability in our quarterly rates, as we expect we will be subject to a one-time non-cash revaluation charge in the third quarter related to a deferred tax liability when the bill was expected to become law. Our best estimate at this time is that our quarterly rate in the third quarter will be in the range of 33% to 35%. But we expect this to be primarily one-time in nature and do not anticipate a material long-term impact from this increase. Adjusted net income was $203 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.23 for the first quarter 2021, up 4.6% and 5.1% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid topline growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. This was offset in part by a higher effective tax rate. Net cash provided by operating activities was $449 million for the quarter, up 24% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $59 million for the quarter, up 12%. We continue to believe the CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation, as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to capital expenditure, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be within the range of $200 million to $215 million. However, we now forecast intangible amortization to be approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to foreign exchange variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. During the first quarter, we returned $147 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, in May, we repaid our 5.8% senior notes in the amount of $450 million through a combination of cash from operations and proceeds from our credit facility. Our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. As we approach the anniversary of the onset of the pandemic, we plan to continue to provide updates on our non-COVID and COVID sensitive revenues to offer transparency on the recovery of our business. We remain confident the COVID impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate with the rollout of vaccinations and the opening of global economies, we will show strong resilience in recovery. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, that we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging beginning in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth, with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it’s difficult to predict that timing. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I’ll ask the Operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks a lot. I was hoping, Scott, that you could give us an update on the renewables business. I know you touched on it in the prepared remarks. But I guess how big is it now? What are the fastest growing areas within it? And what -- what’s proprietary within the renewables and energy transition? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Right. So it -- what we do in the renewables area, Toni, is across a very broad front. So it is everything from solar to wind to biomass. What differentiates us is a couple of things. One is we believe that we actually have unique data about really the supply side of those industries. In addition to that, we’re able to relate the developments in that part of the energy ecosystem to the rest of the energy ecosystem. And that’s really critical, because that is what all the players in the in the energy space want to do, including the traditional hydrocarbon-based players. They are all very, very interested in how they modify who they are in order to move into this future. And then on top of all of that, we believe that we have the best platform analytic environment going in Lens, which permits us to put all of this wonderful content into our customers decisioning workflows in a really easy to consume and we believe differentiated way.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: You’re welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. I was just wondering as things are opening up here and you guys get a little bit more visibility. Just longer term, I guess, I wanted to just understand, how you guys think about that 7% growth targets for your entire company? I was just curious, like, if anything has changed if you need to kind of revisit that target?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. Nothing has changed in our perspective on that Manav. One of the things that and I sort of referenced this in my comments upfront, but we are watching very carefully the results we’re producing in 2021, both the -- what we deemed the COVID sensitive revenues, but also the non-COVID sensitive revenues and those would relate more to the subscription products that we have. And actually we see good progress in the performance of those and actually they really have been the most steady part of our performance over the last several quarters. And we also referenced our pipelines, both renewals, as well as new product -- new sales opportunities. And as I mentioned in my comments up front, we have some of the strongest pipelines we’ve ever had. And our focus is so very definitely on subscription-based solutions. So the context from my answer to your question is, that’s where we’re focused. Those are in good shape. They have been in good shape through the pandemic and we think that they will remain on that track going forward.
Lee Shavel: And Manav, it’s Lee, if I could just add to that. One thing that I think gave us confidence on the resilience of the growth rates, well, that -- was the overall performance of our non-COVID sensitive revenues through this period, that we maintain stability there, and in a lot of cases, given some of the value of our data and workflow-oriented products in this more remote environment. In some ways, I think, as we come out of this, it has accelerated some opportunities for us for the deployment of our data and analytics into these new environments.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Understood. And then just on the breakout area investment, we -- I think you’ve talked about kind of the ROIC and metrics and so forth before, but I was just curious from -- what time parameters do you put when you even make those decisions, like, how much of the long-term investment or do you have certain criteria that it has to return within a couple of years, et cetera? I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about that.
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. Lee, that’s kind of into our work papers on how we look at the many investment opportunities we’ve got. So maybe you want to talk to that?
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Manav, thanks for the question. And I think as you can appreciate that we -- when we look at that investment portfolio, we think of it in that regard, where we have a wide range of products with different time horizons and different levels of kind of risk associated with them, some earlier stage business opportunities, some later stage. We do try to manage those naturally in the country -- overall to deliver on return clearly in excess of our cost of capital and for higher risk, smaller projects at a level well above that at some premium reflecting that higher risk. And I would say that, on average, this of course, is going to vary from project-to-project. But we’re generally looking to achieve those types of returns on a three-year to four-year timeframe in order to get to an acceptable return with upside on beyond that. That’s the general parameters of the portfolio. And I think we also want to make it clear that that is not just internal investment or external investment in M&A, we are evaluating the utilization of capital against both of those investment opportunities. Certainly, on the internal investment, the opportunities to leverage our existing assets and our position in infrastructure are substantially enable us to deliver higher returns we expect, but on lower investments. On the M&A front, they are larger investments from a skill standpoint, but we are clearly focusing on how we are adding value to those and the success that we’ve had with the life -- the FAST acquisition, with the Genscape acquisition, with a acquisition in our 3E area are all evidence of our ability to deliver value either through reduced costs or improved functionality of those businesses. So, hopefully, that gives you some context in how we look at both the internal and the external investment and some of the benchmarks that we use.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We have our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Bridging to Manav’s question, what are your current capital allocation priorities among acquisitions and share repurchase when you evaluate those two at current prices and valuations? And then third would be dividend growth?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. So I’m glad you added that last bit, David, because we have multiple forms for returning capital to shareholders. But even before that, I would really emphasize investment into the business to build these engines of growth. We -- you hear us talking all the time about platforms analytic environments. They are really the source of so many forms of goodness in terms of value for customers and the result of them is that we have much stickier relationships, which are just that much more recurrent. So I would -- so if I was to prioritize our use of capital, I would actually start with internal investment, which is a genuine focal point. We’re very happy to return capital to shareholders. We have a long track record of doing that and we feel very good about that. And with respect to M&A, Lee, was already talking about kind of how we look at it. I mean, it’s not as if we’ve earmark some number of dollars or percentage of total capital available to go into M&A. They’ve -- it’s more a question with that third leg of whether or not the opportunity is compelling and meets our return hurdles. And we are definitely emphasizing that which in combination with what we -- who we already are, the whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts.
Lee Shavel: And David, it’s interesting that you -- the -- and it’s not uncommon for folks to make a comparison between share repurchases and M&A. I will tell you that we think of it differently in that, we view M&A as more akin and evaluate it relative to our internal investment, because both of them are capital investments that we’re making to generate return for shareholders. And both of those are subject to our return thresholds that we think are necessary to create value. And then if we are unable to find return opportunities in either of those and I want to emphasize, Scott’s point, we think there are -- one of the strengths of Verisk is the breadth and the depth of opportunity for us to invest internally in new products at very high incremental returns across a broad range of client driven opportunities in our industry sectors. But similarly, we see our other opportunities on the M&A front. If we don’t see acceptable returns in either of those ventures, then we view share repurchases as with dividends an opportunity to return capital that we can’t create value from in terms of higher returns. And then, finally, with regard to dividends, the -- as you have seen, we have established a pattern of increasing that dividend that becomes -- that remains subject to the Board’s view on the dividend increase. But there is a recognition that companies that have demonstrated an ability to deliver consistent growth in the dividend over time are rewarded for that discipline. We believe that it has introduced a valuable additional component to our investor base, as more yield oriented investors that are looking for both growth and yield have been very additive to our shareholder base and so we think that that is a useful additional component in our capital return strategy.
David Togut: Thanks very much. Appreciate it, Lee and Scott.
Scott Stephenson: You bet.
Operator: We have our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Financial Services revenues are continuing to see the impact of contract transitions, which you know that will continue for the next two quarters. Is it possible to parse out how much impact is coming from contract transitions and how much is due to core reduced spending from banks and fewer bankruptcies?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. George, thanks for the question. We estimate that the impact of the contract transitions in the first quarter was approximately two-thirds of the of the revenue decline that we saw on a year-over-year basis. And as you know, this is something that will cycle through, we believe that those contract transitions, I would just remind folks represented in part, a rebalancing of our relationship with several of those contracts, shifting in our general strategy to move from less upfront revenues to more revenues extended over the relationship. So it reflects that. There is some upside in future periods that that balance that impact. But the short answer is, in the quarter it was about two thirds of the impact. And as you mentioned, we expect that impact to be to follow for the next two quarters.
George Tong: Got it. Very helpful. And just to follow-up, on the cost side, you mentioned that cost comparisons will be tougher in 2Q. How much in expenses do you expect to come back in the coming quarters?
Lee Shavel: So, yeah, George, thanks for the question. I appreciate what you’re looking for. It’s hard to quantify, I guess, I would approach it this way. One way to think of it as clearly we had a benefit from T&E of the reductions of the elimination of travel and we have described what the impact is from a margin standpoint of that, for instance, 150 basis points in the -- in this quarter. And we would expect that we would continue to see that benefit and so we will see an increase in T&E expenses, but I think that’s going to be a gradual increase over time. The other element is going to be compensation and our incentive compensation in particular, where we’re going to see a more normalized level. As we saw in 2020, the responsiveness of our compensation, particularly incentive compensation flex down. We are expecting a more normalized return, so we’ll see some increase in that. Plus we are also beginning to normalize headcount, as we see demand from the businesses to support their overall growth. So there are a lot of factors. But as we move through 2021, one way to think about it is in reference to 2020. 2020 we saw the revenue impact, but we saw expenses decline more than the revenue impact driving EBITDA growth of nearly 10% over that period. In 2021, I think, we’re going to see a recovery in revenue, but as we look at those comparisons, we will see higher expense growth. We still expect to be able to deliver EBITDA growth, but it will be driven by the pace of expense growth, fortunately, which remains within our control. So our hope is that we will be able to manage that expense growth on the T&E, on the compensation front in terms of headcount growth in order to continue to deliver growth, although not naturally at the same level that we were able to achieve in 2020. Another way to think of it is that, we do expect that that dynamic will drive some reduction in margin, but we still are expecting to be able to retain, as we’ve said in the past, some meaningful level of the efficiencies that we achieved in 2020. I hope that gives you some direction towards your question, George.
George Tong: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you, Lee.
Operator: We have our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just starting on the Energy business, not sure if I missed it? But clearly, trends have gotten better. You sound pretty optimistic about Energy transition in pipeline here. Does that basically mean you think the business has bottomed or are you still cautious in terms of the next few quarters? Maybe the broader cyclical impact could still be negative?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. I’ll just go back something that we’ve said for a long period of time, which is, for business, in the Energy sector, in general to perform, we just need a normal environment. We don’t need a roaring commodity price. We just need a normal kind of environment. And our view is that that’s more or less where the system has gotten to?
Lee Shavel: And I would say, Alex, I think, we’re encouraged by what we are experiencing both in the sales pipeline and in the consulting pipeline. We’re also encouraged by the receptivity of our clients on two of the Lens platform as they are interacting with it and as they’re using it. They are clearly seeing the value that we are adding to the data and the research products that we’ve provided before. So, clearly, there is a lot of risk ahead as we manage through the pandemic. But we are seeing -- we think very constructive signs based upon the level of engagement we have so far.
Alex Kramm: Okay. That’s fair. And then secondarily, a little bit more holistic question, but Lee, obviously, the Energy and the Financials business started reporting to you I think it’s been now three months. Not a long time, but three months nonetheless. And I think last quarter, when asked about the business mix, Scott sounded a little bit more open to holistically review the portfolio. So just wondering, Lee and maybe Scott to as you have maybe dug deeper into those businesses, any early findings, any areas for improvement or any things where you’re saying, hey, this is maybe not as good of a fit than we thought historically. So any updates will be helpful on that front? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: Well, why don’t I start, but Lee, I think questions kind of directed to you and your oversight. But I’ll just say that there is a playbook at Verisk, which when it is in place works very, very well. And that playbook is really centered on creating what we call platform to analytic environments and analytic objects, which become industry standard analyzed output. And the more that we feature those in the mix of what we do, in any part of Verisk the business becomes very sticky, very resilient, grows well, represents a lot of value for customers. And I’ll just say that and I’m going to pick Financial Services in particular, the focus here at the moment is, first of all, make sure that we capture all the COVID sensitive revenues as the environment changes, make sure that we capture all those revenues back into the mix, one. And two is the continued development of the platforms inside of Verisk financial that will represent that same kind of Verisk ways, the Verisk model really for joint business. And that’s really what we’re focused on and -- in the near-term and we’re expected about both of those things as it relates to the business so that with respect to VFS and particularly. Lee, I don’t know if you want to add anything to that.
Lee Shavel: Yeah. I do. Alex, thanks for the question. And I would say just briefly really it is still early. I’m spending a lot of time with both the Financial Services and the Energy business and really drilling into complement because of a top-down view from a financials, the bottoms up focus on products, on clients, on people to understand the underlying economics of the business. And one, I think observation that it’s worth pointing out is that, of course, what’s happening at those businesses is not wholly represented in what you see within the quarter. We’ve talked about the contract transitions that while clearly a negative impact in this quarter represent very strong progress in the objective that we have on the management team and there has been moving very concertedly towards improving that base and I continue to work with them to evaluate what that broader opportunity is and what the sustainable growth rate for profitability and value is for over the long-term as I do with the Energy business. So we’re actively engaged in it. I would just ask for everyone’s patience as we work through that and evaluate the business as a whole rather than focusing on the specific quarter’s results, but that’s what we’ve been doing.
Alex Kramm: Very good. Thanks for the color.
Operator: We have our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Greg Peters: Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide some updated views on the changing competitive dynamics in the Insurance space, especially when we hear about or hearing more about the success of these software companies like Duck Creek and Guidewire. It seems like these companies are selling competitive -- competing services, we hear them talking about their claims management platform, their underwriting platforms, their reinsurance capabilities, it seems to be gathering some momentum in the Insurance vertical. So maybe you can provide some color around market share for Verisk versus these other companies or how you’re working with these companies.
Scott Stephenson: Well, Lee, you want to take one.
Lee Shavel: Sure. Well, first of all, thanks for the question. I think what our customers are looking for these, our Insurance customers, they are looking for an interconnected ecosystem a way to pull information, a way to pull and process it seamless way. So we are very tightly aligned with a Duck Creek and a Guidewire. As an example, all of our ISO loss cost renewals, meaning, the way we codify rates is inside of both Duck Creek and Guidewire. We pull -- customers able to pull underwriting information from us through those two platforms. Claims fraud, same thing, we are integrated in a way that we are partners. So there is a way that we partner very effectively, but at the same time, the world is heading towards the analytics, Duck Creek, Guidewire as an example are doing more analytics probably more focused on the individual insurer information as the process to claim look like over the last quarter. How the rates looked for that insurer of last quarter. Where we tend to focus is we have aggregated view of the industry. So our analytics is more benchmark, its rollout to other peers. It’s an industry view. Let me also remind you that as we think about software, we’re becoming more software intense. So, Sequel software had been moving into United States, becoming certainly more a global player beyond the London market. So I think there is some more overlap with the two, but we continue to work together to satisfy customers. So, hopefully, that’s responsive to the software play and I’ll just highlight because of the nature of our industry standard programs, we’re integrated with almost every policy and vendors. We are kind of across the Board. So we’ll continue to do that to share our content with any insurer or reinsurance that needs it.
Greg Peters: Got it. And then my follow-up question would just be pivot back to some comments, I think, we made earlier regarding just sort of the long-term targets around organic revenue growth and then EBITDA 7% and then EBITDA growing a little bit faster. I was wondering if you have a similar viewpoint or the Board has a similar viewpoint around free cash flow?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. I don’t see over the long-term a significant gap between the EBITDA -- the revenue and EBITDA growth rates and the -- and our cash flow. The two should be fairly consistent, obviously lot of variables that from a timing standpoint may influence that, but as kind of core growth rates. I don’t see a substantial difference there.
Greg Peters: Got it. Thanks for the answers.
Operator: We have our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. As we see the greater digitization of insurance and more lifecycle solutions. I wonder if Verisk sees an opportunity in payments as far as supporting disbursements from the carriers to the insured?
Scott Stephenson: So thank you for the question and thank you for the look forward. We have recently introduced VeriskPay and we do believe that in this kind of world of interconnectivity automation electronic payments are going to factor into that. The places where we started was the places where we thought most weekly integrate into our solutions. So think of our exactly solution, which is representative as repair cost estimates and payment of property damage, and also in the world of real estate where we do some similar work and we feel that those electronic payments could facilitate, thanks for our customers. We’re working with a big partner Pfizer and we hope to extend the use cases beyond claims and into some premium and other places like subrogation where we think that our insurance customers will benefit
Andrew Jeffrey: Great. I look forward to learning more.
Operator: We have our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff Meuler: Thank you. Good morning. I want to ask about Insurance and I know the growth rates kind of in the typical pretty tight range, but it decelerated, so I heard a call out on cat bond issuance. I think I also heard something about some end market consolidation to me the cat bond issuances just more naturally variable quarter-to-quarter, the consolidation would be something that would take longer to recover from, so just any help parsing out between those factors? And then on the growth driver side is ISO pricing this calendar year similar to prior calendar years. And I heard you on pipeline, Scott, I guess, how is pipeline conversion and bookings especially for those strategically important platformed analytic environments and analytic objects?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. So maybe I can start at the top it. Mark, you should come in real quick on especially the first part of Jeff’s question. Thanks for the questions, Jeff. Yeah. I mean the -- most of the selling effort goes where we have the priority and the priority is on these, as just as you said, the platform to analytic environments, the analytic objects. So that is the majority of the pipeline and so all of those comments about contract length stretching out and the depth of the pipeline that applies fully for that part of the product suite. So there is no real differentiation there. When you look quarter -- when you look year-over-year on cat bond insurance, Q1 2020 was strong quarter. Q1 2021 was a strong quarter. We pay a lot of attention to that, cat bond issuance has picked up since the first quarter. So we don’t see anything different in the environment, it was just really kind of moment in time. Mark, anything you want to add on that?
Mark Anquillare: I think the only thing I’ll go to some of our traditional ISO information and that is again rock solid with customers. If you were to look at the way we kind of think about this, remember we’re taking a long-term view. We would prefer to gather new sales from new solutions and customers as opposed to kind of past artificially high price increases. So, I think, we remain pretty modest in kind of the way we handle pricing price ISO. And you are correct, we did highlight some industry consolidation, which doesn’t necessarily one plus one doesn’t equal one, but sometimes equals like about 1.8 in the way. Some of our pricing algorithms work. So that was a headwind for the year, yes,
Scott Stephenson: There is no change to the pricing algorithm itself…
Mark Anquillare: I know.
Scott Stephenson: … in 2021.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you.
Jeff Meuler: Got it. And then a question on the expense management approach in financial services, it seems like revenue is kind of rebasing lower for a period of time and I think you said that Q2 profitability should be similar to Q1, which was fairly depressed I guess in my eyes. So are you taking expenses out of the business or does it need to start growing again to start getting margins back up? Thanks
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Thanks Jeff. And certainly understand the questions. And so on the revenue front, we naturally have that impact of the contract on transitions. A part of that are contracts that -- are not there going forward. But as I indicated, there also is a component where revenue has shifted into future periods. So it’s not a -- I wouldn’t describe it as a complete rebasing or elimination of that. But the other factor or some of the COVID sensitive revenues that we have seen the impact, we’ve talked about bankruptcy. We’ve talked about spend-informed analytics. We’re actually seeing some stronger improvement on the spend-informed analytics as things open up. So hopefully if that continues, we’ll see strength in that regard. And of course, we’re also watching the bankruptcy very carefully and then the overall performance of the banks, which are doing well and hopefully that translates into greater opportunities on the analytics and the consulting front. On the expense front, yes, in the quarter, we had probably a heavier load of expense than we typically have. And so looking ahead, we would anticipate and not as heavy an expense impact. And we are looking at making adjustments from an expense management standpoint that will help us avoid or offset the margin impact that we experienced in the first quarter.
Jeff Meuler: Got it. Thank you all.
Operator: We have our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Great. Lee, two questions, beyond the cap bond volatility in industry consolidation that you just recently mentioned, could you list any other drivers of why Verisk organic revenue growth on its non-COVID business that’s the 85% of revenues decelerated to 4.9% in the first quarter versus 6.5% in the fourth quarter? Let me just kind of put out my other question too, it’s the question about 2021 EBITDA margins. Lee in the last two quarters you mentioned a comment about 2021 EBITDA margins relative to 2020 and 2019. Just could you update your comments and is there any year that the margins are likely to be closer to this year?
Lee Shavel: Yeah. And thank you, Andrew. I mean, I just want to clarify, you were addressing the question of both at a consolidated level?
Andrew Steinerman: Yeah.
Lee Shavel: Is that correct?
Andrew Steinerman: Consolidated. Yeah.
Lee Shavel: Yeah. So I think we did describe that, the primary impacts as you’ve indicated in terms of the catastrophe bond impact and some of the consolidation impacts. Naturally you can look at the other -- the performance of the other business units from a revenue standpoint in Financial Services in particular with the contract transitions and the COVID sensitive. I think from an Energy and Specialized Markets, it was kind of relatively flat quarter. So I would probably just point out that Financial Services clearly had a contribution to the overall growth rate in that regard. And as to your question on margin, I’m going to kind of go back to the way I answered a previous question, which was that clearly we saw the margin benefit in 2020 resulting from or the reduction of expenses to a greater degree than the decline in revenues and looking ahead to 2021 where we will be coming out of this. We are expecting some revenue growth improvement, but that probably will be exceeded by the normalization of expenses. However, if you think about the responsiveness or the growth rates of those two lines, we are expecting that the rate of recovery from an expense standpoint will be slower, meaning that we will hope to hold on to some of that margin benefit that we experienced in 2020, but not all of it.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay.
Lee Shavel: So that is I think the outcome of our expectations at this point kind of looking -- kind of reiterating that we are expecting that our margin still will be above where they were pre-pandemic, but will probably come down as those -- as the expenses normalize.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We have our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Hamzah Mazari: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. My question is around the international business within Insurance. I think a couple of years ago, you guys had flagged that you expected that business, I guess it was growing high-single digits and you expected it to double organically in five years? I think that was a couple of Analyst Days ago. And maybe I think you guys had flagged U.K., Ireland and Canada, Germany, France, India, Southeast Asia as future growth. So maybe just update us how big is international today as part of the total offering in Insurance? And then which countries are you sort of under versus over penetrated and where is the opportunity?
Mark Anquillare: Thank you for the question. This is Mark. So let me kind of give you a quick summary. So, first of all, good recollection of the overview that we provided. If I would now grade ourselves on where we are at that I would say from a U.K. perspective and Ireland we are well ahead of that plan. I think we are doing extremely well and I think we’ve highlighted some of the benefits of the Sequel acquisition and just the progress that’s been made there along with some of the work that we’ve done on the claims and underwriting front. As we think about other regions, we did highlight France and Germany. And I would say there it’s been a tougher sledding. We were looking for a combination of organic access, as well as moving into maybe some businesses that provide services there. I think from an M&A perspective. I think we’ve done well from a cat bond perspective, cat modeling perspective. So there strong rates just probably less progress with some of the other underwriting and claims in that like France and Germany field. I think we kind of had talked about Asia-Pacific is more long-term. I’m not sure I can comment on that. That’s probably still on the horizon. So thank you for the question and I think it give ourselves overall strong grades.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. And just my follow-up question and you touched on it, Lee, a little bit on the timeframe in evaluating the Non-Insurance segment, but do you sort of have any high level color if that Financial Services business has changed structurally. I know a while back, and Lee, I know you weren’t there at that time. But the healthcare business has structurally changed and the government had gotten more involved. The business wasn’t as a global and there were some other items. As you look at this business with new competition or other stuff maybe diversifying away from banking customers has been slower. Do you have a sense of a timeframe wise is that sort of you’re still looking into that or do you guys have a pretty good view there already?
Lee Shavel: And so, Hamzah, I think -- thank you for the question. And I think there are -- there was an external perspective and an internal perspective, if you’re asking about the structural has the business changed structurally. And I think your primary question is from an external standpoint. And I would say that the presence of other players that serve that banking -- the banking industry particularly as it relates to cards, it remains -- has remained relatively consistent, the large players whether the credit bureaus or the network companies are there, they serve that industry. And the Verisk Financial Services entity has for a long time competed very successfully within that environment, given the very unique nature of the dataset and the unique relationships that they have with the industry and they provide a service by integrating that data set and delivering it in a way that others aren’t able to do. And so I don’t believe that there has been a material change, but we are mindful of the competitive environment that they operate in. From the other perspective from a structural change, I can say unequivocally that we have changed and improved the business in shifting it to more of a sustainable focus on growth within the business with the steps that the management team has made. Some of those have had obviously a up a challenging financial impact in the short-term, but we believe that the business is better positioned for the long-term given those structural changes. So I want to do address both parts of those questions.
Hamzah Mazari: That’s great. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Gary Bisbee: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to some earlier commentary on the Energy business. Scott, I think you said, you just need sort of a normal market environment, not necessarily a robust one to deliver to your goals in the business. I guess I wanted to ask, what is it you would expect to deliver in a normal environment. In the five years you’ve own the business it’s grown 7% once and not grown a couple of those years and so it’s just not clear to me that this business is positioned particularly given the volatility inherent in the end market to deliver to the long-term revenue growth targets you’ve set for the company and on a number of occasions actually said this business should outperform those over the long-term growth faster than some of your other assets. So what is it you’re playing for in a normal Energy market if we’re moving back into that today? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. You bet Gary. Thank you for the question. Yeah. When you sit and actually related to the way that we was responding to that prior question about Financial Services. So if you kind of get to the top of sort of our business and that ecosystem. What you’re looking at is global customers that are large that are facing challenging issues in terms of how they’re going to run their businesses in the future. Our calling increasingly upon data analytics to try to help these very, very important decisions and have only a few places that they can turn to outside of their own four walls in order to find support with respect to the kind of data analytics that they want to make the commercial decisions that they need to make. And then I would add to that one other point, which is the range of topics and the ecosystem that that can be covered. And those have really expanded in light of the Energy transition. And there was an earlier question about what do we do with respect to renewables. But I would point out also that in the Energy space, there is a great sensitivity to topics of climate change and so our ability to also observe on things like emissions is an important capability and a distinct capability. And so the summation of all of that for me Gary would be that, if you’re right about the track record. I would point out in -- over the course of the last five years, there have been two relatively unprecedented shocks to the pricing of the commodity and I’m not here to predict that there can’t be any more of those, but they were pretty unusual and in a relatively compressed period of time. Against that I would put a very large global market with increasing appetite for data analytics of the kind that we provide. And so my summary and all of that would be that I look for this business to contribute at or above the targets we had as a company overall, we’re going to hold it to that standard, so that’s really it.
Gary Bisbee: Yeah. And then just one quick follow-up for, Lee, that -- a couple of years ago you had -- the company had discussed sort of a glide path lower in capital intensity, now of course, I think that was in large part on the Geomni business at the time and since then you’ve stepped up technology investment considerably? I guess I’m just wondering, if you can level that for us today, how are you thinking about capital intensity over the next few years as you get through more of the cloud projects should we, is the goal still that that moderates a couple of points lower over time or where are you at now? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Gary. And so the short answer is, yes, and it is a function as you’ve described of our migration to the cloud, which is reducing the level of CapEx that we would have typically spent on hardware in infrastructure. Now offsetting that, but we still think it’s not completely offsetting that benefit is an increasing level of internal software development intensity, which is a function of some of the trends that Mark was talking about in terms of utilizing software opportunity as a way to activate and deliver our datasets and provide solutions for our clients. And so that is clearly an element that we think is added to our business, it’s generating good returns. We never want the CapEx intensity metric to obscure our fundamental return objectives. So we do expect to see that improvement over time. It has probably been obscured by some of the real estate renovations that we have done recently that are included in that. But we are realizing real benefits in terms of reductions in CapEx and even OpEx, and expenses related to infrastructure as a result of that. And some of those are being reinvested in some of the software development elements as we develop that component of our -- of the delivery of our datasets.
Gary Bisbee: Thank you. That’s helpful.
Operator: And there are no further questions. I’ll turn back the call over to you, Stacey.
Stacey Brodbar: Okay. Well, thank you everybody for joining us. Appreciate all the questions and the dialog and we will certainly as always be following up with many of you following this call. So thank you for the continued interest and support. We’ll speak with you soon. Bye for today.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you all for participating and you may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-24 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Verisk's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investors Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Mary. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business. Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer and Group President, will follow the financial - with the financial review. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer and Group President; and Ken Thompson, General Counsel, will join the team for the Q&A session. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30-days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including, but not limited to, the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our Q4 2020 earnings conference call. While 2020 was the year like no other for everyone, at Verisk, it was a year that demonstrated the resilience and stability of our business model, the relevance and mission-critical nature of our solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. And this was all powered by the strength and creativity of our over 9,000 Verisk teammates around the globe, who I want to thank for their dedication and commitment to deliver on our core mission to serve, add value, and innovate during these challenging times. The net results in 2020 was another strong year in financial performance marked by organic constant currency revenue growth of 4.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.6% after normalizing for the impact of the injunction related to roof measurement solutions. More importantly, in 2020, we delivered 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth in the 85% of our revenues that we identified as non-COVID-sensitive, essentially in line with our long-term growth target. Conversely, our COVID-sensitive revenues declined 11% on an OCC basis, yet, those revenue streams continue to show resilience as the underlying causal factors improved and we have confidence in this relationship. Throughout the year, we've been very deliberate in our cost actions and have protected profitability by matching headcount growth with the trend in our revenue growth. As such, the pace of our hiring and our overall headcount growth has increased sequentially following the moves that we took at the onset of the pandemic in early spring 2020. As a result, Verisk delivered strong organic adjusted EBITDA growth and solid margin expansion throughout the year. Lee will provide more details on our performance in his financial review. 2020 also exhibited the importance of our strong cash flow, the disciplined capital allocation mindset and our emphasis on creating long-term durable shareholder value. Despite the challenges of the operating environment during 2020, we were deliberate about our continued investment in our innovation agenda by inventing new solutions and enhancing existing ones. We also partnered with our customers to bring them solutions to help them be more automated and digitally connected during the pandemic. We funded the continued transformation of our technical infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization of key data assets, and the development of cutting-edge data fabric to underlie our analytics solutions. This is a journey we embarked on in earnest two years ago and we have made significant progress within our datasets and solutions for the cloud. Yet, we still returned over $500 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend and a $300 million increase in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital return. On the innovation front, our Insurance business continued to advance our existing solutions and introduced new innovations. In our commercial property business, we substantially enhanced and updated our database of commercial properties by building an advanced analytic model for over 8 million commercial properties that give insurers information for five key building attributes, including building use, construction class, building age, number of storeys and area. This brings the database to a total of 12.2 million commercial properties and this data can be delivered to our insurance customers' workflows in an automated and easy-to-use format. Additionally, during the quarter, we continue to advance our analytics and offerings in the fast-growing area of cyber risk, with the addition of Nationwide to the Verisk Cyber Data Exchange. The Cyber Data Exchange has a contributory database of aggregated and anonymized insurance data from participating cyber insurers globally. The insights and analytics that Verisk derives from this data help our insurance customers make intelligent strategic decisions about their portfolios and select risk and benchmark their performance against peers. The cyber exchange is an important part of Verisk's cyber solutions fleet, which is an end-to-end ecosystem that helps insurers and reinsurers more quickly deliver new cyber programs or enhance existing ones. I'd like to take a minute to observe on recent developments related to our ongoing patent dispute with EagleView Technologies. We continue to disagree with the current outcome of the case and are aggressively pursuing all [indiscernible] and operational options. In September 2019, we recorded $125 million legal reserve related to this matter. We filed our appeal of the original ruling at the end of the fourth quarter 2020. On February 16, the trial court granted EVT's motion for trouble damages, as well as some interest and fees. We intend to appeal this ruling as well. As discussed in more detail on our 10-K because our appeal is pending, we're unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. Still, we remain committed to providing our customers with superior aerial imagery solutions and remain very excited about our partnership with Vexcel, which has not been impacted by this ruling. At Wood Mackenzie, we continued to expand our Lens energy analytic platform. In the fourth quarter, we released Lens subsurface discovery on-time and on-budget, rounding out our five upstream solutions within the Lens platform. This module enables faster, more accurate decision-making for exploration and resource development teams as they have access to a comprehensive global dataset and can run custom analyzes and perform benchmarking studies right into the workflows. Despite the softness in the energy end market driving industry consolidation, we continue to see demand for Lens across our different customer segments, which is reflected in increased adoption, constructive pricing and longer contract terms. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch a suite of modules related to the energy transition into the Lens platform, namely Lens Power, which will include global discovery and valuation, as well as carbon-emissions benchmarking solutions. In Financial Services, we've launched small business attributes, a new solution in partnership with Enigma Technologies that provides greater insights into the financial health of small businesses, which have been the hardest hit part of the economy during the pandemic. This solution offers our bank customers near real-time information about sales trends that can be used by a bank's risk underwriting and marketing teams, so they can better serve small business customers. This partnership is a great example of how VFS is leveraging our unique data assets to send and serve new segments of the Financial Services end market. On the acquisition front, in the fourth quarter, Verisk closed on the acquisition of Jornaya, a leading provider of consumer behavioral data and intelligence. The acquisition will add Jornaya's proprietary view of consumer buying journeys to Verisk's growing set of marketing solutions for the insurance and financial service markets, delivering better experiences and improving customer acquisition and retention for our customers. In addition, we've made great strides throughout 2020 with recently acquired companies. We have now own FAST and Genscape for a full year. And I'm happy to share that we are having great success expanding and accelerating the adoption of their solutions across our customer set, as well as improving profitability through cost synergies. We're very pleased with these results, as they're tracking ahead of our plans at the time of acquisition, and are great example of management's focus on delivering strong returns on the capital invested in acquisition. 2020 also marked another high-point for our company's culture and our commitment to investing in our people and their skills. Despite the remote work environment, the Verisk team increased productivity, boosted connection and collaboration through internal communication tools and engaged in training and development courses through our many different platforms and across all levels in the organization. This year alone we trained more than 700 teammates in our leadership and management development programs. And in our Lean Six Sigma programs, Verisk teammates earned 900 yellow belt certifications and 70 greenbelt certifications. Lean Six Sigma is an embedded mindset across Verisk and we continue to leverage this established methodology and set of tools to serve our customers better every day. Some examples of important accomplishments this year include, first, model developers work to reduce the time spent collecting data and creating models, improving time to market from new models. Second, field representatives develop new timesaving procedures for completing and updating property surveys, increasing their productivity. Third, sales and support teams develop new processes to execute new contracts or amend current ones quicker with our customers. The benefits are reflected in increased productivity, high customer satisfaction and improved employee engagement. In fact, this year, our employee engagement score increased 8 points to 78%, and for the fifth consecutive year, Verisk received US certification from the Great Place to Work Institute for outstanding workplace culture. We also received first-time certification in the United Kingdom, India, and Spain. Finally, I'd like to share my enthusiasm and my views on the recently announced leadership changes and expanded responsibilities for our executive management team. These changes reflect the thoughtful and strategic approach to our long-term growth in planning for the global organization and are a testament to the deep bench of talented leaders we have at Verisk. I'm pleased to share that both Mark Anquillare, Lee Shavel are taking on new leadership responsibilities within Verisk and both have been elevated to the position of Group President. Mark Anquillare, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Operating Officer is adding oversight of the Company's enterprise risk management function to his current responsibilities of leading the Company's Insurance business and government-facing businesses. Our risk management operations will continue to be led by our very talented and seasoned team that work diligently every day to make sure that our technical infrastructure remain secure and then we are always using the most advanced data protection techniques. This move also more closely tied to our enterprise risk assessment and management with core - the core operations of our business. Lee Shavel, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Financial Officer will add oversight responsibility for the operations of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment and our Financial Services segment, bringing in an even more direct link between our capital allocation discipline and our business unit operations. Lee will continue to be supported by our Eaton [ph] tenured finance organization, including our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, David Grover and our Treasurer, Brian Aird. Finally, I'm pleased to publicly welcome Kathy Card Beckles to Verisk, that's our new General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Kathy joins us from Chase Consumer Bank, where she most recently served as General Counsel. Kathy brings with her extensive experience in intellectual property and technology and significant expertise partnering with an advisory boards of directors and management teams. I look forward to having Kathy formally join the team on April 5 and working with her to advance our long-term strategy. Kathy will replace Ken Thompson, who announced his retirement late last year. To ensure a smooth transition, Ken will continue with the Company as Executive Counsel. Over the last 14 years, Ken has been an integral part of Verisk' success and a valued partner and a friend to many across the organization. On behalf of the entire organization, I want to personally thank Ken for his dedication to Verisk and his counsel through this transition. We wish him much health and happiness in his retirement. And now, I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.4% to $713 million, net income increased 33% to $176 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 33.8% to $1.07, reflecting a $28 million acquisition-related earn-out expense in the prior year that did not reoccur. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results considering the impact from COVID-19. In the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.5% led by continued strength in our Insurance segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the start of the pandemic, grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis. This sustained growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription-based business model. We did continue to experience, as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. These COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 12.5% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter, though, the performance across our three segments deferred. In our Insurance segment, we continue to experience sequential improvement in these revenues as the underlying causal factors continue to abate, though, the pace of recovery varies across the different solutions. On the Energy side, our consulting business remained under pressure from lower CapEx budgets at our customers, but trends appear to have stabilized. And finally, within Financial Services, our COVID-sensitive revenues took a further step down as our bank customers reduced their spending levels in response to weakness across their lending portfolios. Despite the impact on revenue in the fourth quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense management. OCC adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.9% in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA was 48.2% in the quarter, representing leverage across the business. This margin level includes roughly 220 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions, and insurance software solutions. Similar to the third quarter, we experienced a modest benefit from storm related revenues as a result of a more normal storm season in 2020 as compared to the very slow season in 2019. This was offset in part by a decline in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12.2% in the fourth quarter demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and our cloud transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 3.9% in the fourth quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms and environmental health and safety service solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the criticality of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the energy transition and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA declined 19.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a catch-up of certain compensation expenses associated with furloughed employees that are one-time in nature. As a key partner to our energy customers, we continue to closely monitor the operating environment with a focus on consolidation in the upstream space and the potential impact of a broader, more climate-focused political agenda in the United States. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well positioned with our energy transition practice to capitalize on the global growth in spending across zero-carbon technologies like solar, wind and energy storage. Financial Services revenue declined 13% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of certain contract transitions, as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies versus 2019 as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 28.1%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales, while margins were impacted by certain portfolio transactions we took earlier in the year. We continue on the journey to transition VFS to a more sustainable subscription-based business and have taken actions that we believe benefit the business in the long run, but are likely to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. Our reported effective tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter, compared to the 23.2% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly rate came in lower than our expectations, owing to increased levels of stock option exercise, which depend on personal employee decisions and the Verisk stock price. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that our full-year tax rate will be between 20% and 22%, though, there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock option exercise. Adjusted net income was $209 million and adjusted diluted - I'm sorry, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the fourth quarter 2020, up 10.8% and 12.4% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $249 million for the quarter, up 41% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections, a reduction in income tax payments, owing to higher levels of stock option exercise, the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes resulting from the CARES Act, and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $72 million for the quarter and $247 million for 2020, including some one-time expenses associated with our office consolidations in Boston and London. CapEx came in at the lower end of our initial range as certain expenditures were delayed owing to the pandemic. For the full-year 2020, CapEx represented 8.9% of total revenues. As we look to 2021, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation and our people, as well as the carry-over certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects, and future M&A activity. During the fourth quarter, we returned $94 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Scott mentioned, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend to $0.29 per share this quarter and has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchases, bringing our total available authorization to more than $500 million. For the full year 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 11.7% over 2019, a strong result considering the challenging operating environment. We invested this cash flow back into our business through $247 million in capital expenditures and funded $285 million in acquisitions. We also returned $176 million in capital to shareholders in dividends and an additional $349 million through share repurchases. As we look to 2021, our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. However, we do expect certain COVID-19-related pressures on top line growth to continue, though, we expect the impact to be less than it was in 2020. We remain confident these impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience in recovery. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, so we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging as we begin to anniversary the onset of the pandemic in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it's difficult to predict that timing. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of the analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. I just had a broader question on how you guys are looking at the company portfolio today? Because, I guess, has over the last five years, I think declined. And even the Energy business has been flat to slight growth. And I'm just curious, like, how long before major changes need to be made to clients spur that growth to match, which obviously a phenomenal insurance asset?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. So, we spend a lot of time thinking about the way that we're deploying capital around the company and that thought process really occurs in a couple of levels. So, we do think about the shape of our business overall and it's very evident to everybody that we have a very strong insurance franchise. We believe that we know what are the elements of a trade data analytic business and our primary focus has been trying to bring those qualities bear across everything that we do. And we have definitely given a lot of attention in Energy to trying to make those investments and make them productive across all parts of the portfolio. And so, we're constantly reviewing what we're doing kind of at the segment level and at the individual solution level and we won't stop doing that and if - and those who are familiar with the history of the company know that if we ever get to the point where we conclude that something that we are doing is unlikely to be productive into the future, then we are not reluctant to respond to that kind of a conclusion. So, this is an ongoing thought process. It's consistently a part of what we think about at the company.
Stacey Brodbar: Operator, next question?
Operator: We have our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Greg Peters: Good morning. I was interested, there has been a lot of activity in the insurance industry around insurance tech IPOs and rhetoric around cyber. Let's just focus my question on your telematics business. Can you give us some detail of how big that business is for you? And what your key differentiation in terms of the products and services you're offering relative to some of these recent IPOs, I think that they have solved the matrix for telematics and auto insurance?
Scott Stephenson: Mark, could you take that, please?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, let me kind of describe what we've done and what we think is rather unique. We have moved primarily to the OEM side of the equation. So think of GM, Honda, Hyundai and Ford, and we have aggregated information from those vehicles. And remember, access to those vehicles, those data is being harvested off of newer cars, right, because the history doesn't go back to allow harvesting. So every day we have more cars, more miles and we are now tapped in two of the largest insurers, many of the largest personal auto writers. Cuate [ph] they are either using that [indiscernible] to do their own modeling. It's an opt-in service by the way. Or more likely, they're using our score to assess the driving behavior to offer discounts, market or actually price insurance. So, if you think about kind of the future of insurance, which I think is where you're going, historic rating algorithm is driven by sets, driving behavior from the standpoint of moving violations and accidents, age, those type of things. Clearly, understanding the driving behavior from what's happening behind the wheel is probably more accurate and more relevant. So we think we're very well positioned. We think it will nicely integrate and does integrate with all the underwriting work we do when we talk about moving the data forward in underwriting an insurance policy, picking, selecting a risk and pricing it. To kind of answer your question generally, it is still a small part of our business, especially around the personal auto line of business, but we do believe it will grow, it will become the approach for rating going forward. Now, I think your second question was a little bit about competitive advantage. We have some very unique and exclusive rule [ph] arrangements with, a, the OEMs. But more importantly, we feel that our data being at the center of those OEMs and all the insurers that we know so well and we are integrated with creates a unique relationship where they come to us once as opposed to integrate many times. We are trying to extend then out - that information out beyond what I'll refer to as just the car manufacturers. But I think that hopefully, describes to you a little bit about what we do and how we do it really more focused on insurance than some of these other telematic solutions that are extending beyond insurance and trying to provide to - marketing and other verticals.
Greg Peters: Thank you for the answer.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Jeffrey from Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. Scott or Mark, I wonder if I could ask for an update on a couple of newer lines of business that I didn't hear called out specifically. One would be Life and the other is LightSpeed. I know you touched on auto book, seem like big TAMs with potential pricing leverage. So I wonder if you could just comment on sort of contribution to growth and any changes in that contribution prospectively.
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. So two topics about which we're very excited. Mark, those are both in your column. Do you want to speak to those?
Mark Anquillare: Yeah. You can't see me, but I have a smile on my face, only here a little bit about that. First of all, what we're doing in Life is led by that acquisition of FAST, which is this, I'll call it, low-code, no-code solution for life insurers. What we've added is a bit of relationship and some analytics to the underwriting approach, so things like understanding from your voice, whether you're a smoker, those are the type of things that we've added and the Life business in whole has done exceptionally well. We probably are not talking about it quite as much is because we typically focus a little bit on organic revenue growth. So, I look forward to having some conversations probably in first quarter of next year when we become a little bit become an organic part of our math. Separately, distinctly, when we talk about the resurgence and the great growth at [indiscernible] ISO our underwriting business, we've had a very stable and strong business as it relates to our historic loss culturals [ph] and forms. But the growth that you're seeing in most part is driven by just LightSpeed conscious. It is taking a lot of data, not just our own proprietary data, but that in combination with other third-parties scoring it so that we have a confidence level, so that as opposed to doing first a quote, providing that rate to potential policyholder, they like it and they need to - and they're underwriting to understand if there is any other accidents, moving violations, traffic. Typically 33% of the time that rate changes. That's very, very much. And inventory attracted to the policyholder not the digital engagement looking for. So a bindable quote is really the heart of what has driven a lot of our underwriting and rating growth over the last year and we are doing more and we are extending kind of, I'll call it, from an investment perspective doubling down as we speak.
Andrew Jeffrey: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi. Lee, I remembered you talked about the normalization of T&E on the third quarter call. So I just thought I'd revisit the subject, kind of, given that '21 does appear to be a year of rebound in organic revenue growth, that's just, you know, the assumption around the COVID drags abating, yet, do you still think that the normalization of T&E will be more of a drag to margin that core operating leverage? And could you just mentioned what T&E expense level was in the fourth quarter and how you envision kind of normalization of T&E post-COVID?
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. And it's certainly something that we're watching very carefully and expect to manage very actively in 2021. I think you characterized it accurately. In terms of the - we are expecting that as and if the pandemic impacts continue to abate over time, the revenue impact relative to our targeted growth rate should be more modest. So, we're certainly hoping for improvement in that regard. However, as you saw in our expense management in 2020 and not just including the T&E expense, which as we mentioned represented about a 220 basis point benefit to our margin, but also our management of headcount levels, incentive compensation levels in the fourth quarter and over the course of 2020 reflected an ability to manage that expense impact. Now, naturally as we move into what is hopefully a more constructive environment, we will want to normalize the earnings level — normalize the headcount level for the business to pursue the very attractive opportunities that we have with our clients. We have control both over the level of certainly headcount that we are taking on and T&E and our objective will be to manage that in a way where we hold on to as much of the benefit that we experienced in 2020 as we can. But we are expecting that on year-over-year, particularly as we anniversary the onset of the pandemic that we will see an uptick. But we - overall, we'll try to manage that in a way where we preserve our operating leverage and that becomes a clear, as we talk about it, through the course of the year.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay. Thanks, Lee.
Lee Shavel: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.
Andrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Lee, you added Group President of the Energy and Financial Services businesses to your list of responsibilities. Obviously, as CFO, you have plenty involvement previously. But is there anything specific you'd call out for us that you're particularly focused on in that role? Any changes you'd like to make or strategic priorities you've identified that you're willing to share?
Lee Shavel: Well, thank you very much. I would say, we'll get - at this stage, it's very early. I do know and respect those teams and what they have accomplished. I'm looking forward to working with them more closely. Our overall objective as it has been - at a corporate level has been focusing on how we can invest in those businesses, generate good returns and support the strong position that they operate in and really extend the growth that they represent. So, at this stage, no clear determinations. I'm really just looking forward to spending more time with them on the operating side and determining how we can make them more effective, enhance the growth story and continue to find good opportunities to invest.
Andrew Nicholas: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Bridging to an earlier question on the Financial Services business. Do you think you have the right mix of services for bank card issuers in that business? We've seen a big change in demand trends, at least what Visa and Mastercard have called out in their similar businesses during COVID a big shift towards cyber. Could you maybe comment on the services that you're offering in that business currently? And whether you're intending any, let's say, shift in services mix and offerings as a result of COVID?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. We feel good about the range of solutions that we're able to issue — we're able to offer to a credit card issuer. In fact, that has been explicitly a part of the way that we have built the portfolio of solutions that we offer. And to the point you just made, David, that we do believe that working on issues of risk and fraud are really important issues and we feel that we have some unique intellectual property to help our customers work on that. So - and there are a variety of other things that any one customer can also look to us for. In fact, we have a fairly broad portfolio of solutions. And so, we feel as if we are positioned well in terms of being able to be a partner that a customer could look to for help and support across a variety of dimensions. We're not - even though it would be very easy for folks to kind of look at us and say, okay, well, that phenomenal dataset, which is transactional in nature and so kind of building around that, what we have built around that, but we've extended around that as well. Lee, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that?
Lee Shavel: The only thing I would add is that, as with all of the businesses within Financial Services, we are leveraging an exceptional dataset in that core business that allows us to triangulate in on issues like fraud in ways that other players in the industry can't. So, we're looking for angles where we can utilize that insight to create a differentiated product.
David Togut: Understood. Thank you very much.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, David.
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. So my question is on Energy and Specialized, and I understand what's up and what's down but it's less clear to me, I guess, what stable, what's better, what's worse from a trending perspective from one quarter into the next? I think you said consulting fairly stable. But if I look at the overall worsening year-over-year trend, is it - that the core subs revenue is still growing but decelerating? Was the issue the tougher power advocate implementation comp or the consolidation that you called out? Just any help on the Q4 year-over-year trend relative to what it was the last quarter or two? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Thank you, Jeff. This is Lee. So, I would break it down into a couple of influences. Within Wood Mackenzie, the things that we would point out is that, we saw a modest but positive growth in the subscription side of the business. And so, that I think is a reflection of the durability and the value of those products, even in this more challenging environment. And so, it also, I think is reflective of the value of the investment that we've made in Lens because that subscription component and particularly the pricing on renewals that has benefited from our clients receptivity to what Lens provides them. So, I think that's the core positive and of particular note in a challenging environment for the industry, where the end market, I think, has had a different experience. On the consulting side, that's where on a year-over-year basis, we're — in reported revenues, we are still seeing that 30% year-over-year decline within that business. However, our sense is that, our clients are engaging more actively on the consulting dialogue and we feel better about where the pipeline is headed in that area. So, that is not been demonstrated the financial impact yet, but we feel a little bit better about the level of engagement with clients. And then within Power Advocate, we are experiencing some pressure, particularly on the implementation side of the equation for our clients. We've had some of our clients that experiencing the pressure of this environment have pulled back or reduced, but we still seeing strong demand over the near-term for the cost management and supply chain dimensions of that product side as a whole. And I don't want to overlook also our health and safety business, which continues to contribute strong revenue growth within this segment as a whole, as well as strong EBITDA growth and operating leverage within that business. So that gives you I think the three primary areas within that segment, and some of the elements of the growth for that.
Jeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you, Lee.
Operator: Your next question is from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Chu: Hi. This is David Chu for Gary. So, on margins, cost rose $33 million sequentially or about 10% versus the revenue, up $11 million or 1.5%. This is despite, like, lower T&E. So how much is cost that were deferred earlier in this year building back versus like other investments or other factors?
Lee Shavel: So - and, I guess, the way I will address it and happy to spend time later in talking through your build back analysis. But when we think about the expenses, we want to kind of remove the inorganic component, so that we understand the trends. And I think simplistically, while our overall revenue growth rate was in kind of the 3.5% level, we were able to reduce overall expenses on a year-over-year basis as a function of headcount controlled and T&E. And so, our frame of mind as we're looking at the organic growth of the business that we were able to make that adjustment in expenses downward, which allowed us to deliver the strong EBITDA growth performance even despite that decline in the revenue growth. As we look ahead to 2020, we are expecting a higher level of growth if these trends continue with regard to the pandemic. And as a consequence, from an expense standpoint, we are expecting a higher growth rate. We're not expecting expenses to decline. And so, the year-over-year comparisons are higher, but we're going to try to manage those in a way where we preserve that operating leverage and hold onto as much of that benefit - as much of that benefit as we practically can while still pursuing our client events. I know that doesn't put that in the context that you're asking, but it's kind of the I think the best way to think about the overall performance of trends, absent the - naturally the impact from an M&A standpoint. But we'll be happy to spend more time with you later on the way you're thinking about it.
David Chu: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Hamzah Mazari: Yes. Hi, good morning. My question is just on the non - on the transactional side of the business. I guess, it was down 12.5%, Q3 it was down 10%. Could you maybe talk about what has to happen for that business to come back? Is it a vaccine? Is there anything structural going on in that side of the business that it may just take a lot longer to recover? Maybe just if you could parse the transactional side out of the business?
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Hamzah, this is Lee. So, it is a - and while you were referring to, it's kind of in aggregate as a transactional business, we're really talking about probably a dozen to 20 individual products that have various transactional elements, everything from the consulting business at Wood Mackenzie, some of the consulting and the analytics projects in Financial Services, the claims business with auto claims that are driven by it. So, you have a lot of different, different factors. And so, if you can think about it over time and if I describe it in 2020, we had some businesses that demonstrated as the year progressed pick up in driving activity. And so, when we talked about the improved performance within Insurance on our COVID-sensitive revenues, it was reflecting in earlier impact and benefit from the uptick in driving and driving activity and those - that portion of that transactional business. While the consulting revenue on the Energy side, which is not going to be tied as directly to a possible impact is going to improve over a longer period. And in Financial Services, we were seeing a dynamic where the weakness in the fourth quarter reflected an increasing - what we interpreted as increasing concern over potential credit losses, which caused them to pull back on some of their project analytics in the fourth quarter where we typically see stronger elements. So to try to get to your - to give you an answer is that, as we look across all of these products, as we proceed through 2021, as things improve, we'll see - we should see gradual improvements but at different rates within each of those businesses. So there is no simple answer because it involves multiple products with differing levels of impact across that. So, hopefully, that gives you some context, but I can't kind of define it more precisely for you.
Hamzah Mazari: Right. No, that's very clear. Thank you so much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your Financial Services segment had revenue declines of about 13% organic constant currency in the quarter that reflected some contract transitions as you noted, as well as some COVID impacting lower project spend. Is it possible to perhaps break out the two impact to determine how much of the decline is structural in nature and how much of the decline you expect to recover as COVID becomes more in the rearview mirror?
Lee Shavel: Yeah. George, thanks for the question. It's Lee. So, it's a great question. And when we look at that in the fourth quarter and recognizing that it is fourth quarter, I would say that there was more of an impact on that on the transactional - on the contract transitions. And some of that involved kind of restructuring our contracts to better reflect the annuity nature of our business and we also had some contract transitions that were a result of some strategic exits from a portion of our businesses. But that probably had a more significant impact in the fourth quarter relative to some of the environmental impacts and - which were, as I described in the recent - another question recently, was that, we saw some weakness in the banks pulling back on some of their project - the project analytics, which had a - had an overall impact - negative impact. So, that gives you kind of a rough proportion, probably a little bit more on that contract transition. But there was also a meaningful impact from what we were seeing in the project analytics front.
George Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Ms. Brodbar.
Stacey Brodbar: Okay. Well, thanks everybody for joining us. Appreciate your interest as always. And as always, we will be following up with you on some of these more specific points. And so, we'll be in touch with many of you in the near future. Until then, thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone for joining. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk third quarter 2020 earnings results conference call. This call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Jill Brodbar - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2020 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business. Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, will follow with the financial review. Mark Anquillare, Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, will join the team for THE Q&A session. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including but not limited to the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, Stacey, and good day, everyone. I'm glad to be with you today and certainly hope you and your families continue to stay safe and are well in this moment. At Verisk, we continue to focus on our key priorities to build long-term shareholder value, delivering for our customers through innovation and service while also protecting the health and well-being of our teammates around the globe. To that end, the majority of our offices continue to operate in a Phase 1 format and are available for those employees who have volunteered to work from the office. Our Global Protection Services team closely monitors directives from local governments and public health officials around the world and makes real-time decisions to maintain the safety of our people. Over the duration of the pandemic, our teams have proven they can transition efficiently into different work modes with minimal interruption in service to our customers. So while there remains much uncertainty around the pandemic, I have complete confidence that our 9,000-plus teammates at Verisk will navigate through these times effectively and deliver the highest value to our customers as we have in 2020. During the third quarter, our business performed solidly, posting sequential growth from the second quarter in both our subscription and transactional revenues. In addition, we saw improvement in the year over growth rates of both our non-COVID-sensitive and COVID-sensitive revenues. During the quarter, we kept a keen eye on cost by pacing head count growth, while also benefiting from the responsiveness of our compensation structure and lower travel expenses. That said, we continued to fully fund investment in our business, including our innovation agenda and the modernization of our computing infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization of key data assets and the development of cutting-edge data fabric to underlie our analytics solutions. The net result was strong organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Lee will provide more details on our performance in his financial review. During the third quarter, we advanced our innovation agenda with the release of new solutions across our verticals. In Insurance, we expanded the Verisk Data Exchange with the addition of Ford Motor Company. Owners of Ford and Lincoln vehicles will soon be able to easily access usage-based insurance programs for many of the US auto insurers that connect to the exchange. The Verisk Data Exchange employs advanced proprietary analytics to refine driving telemetry from connected vehicles into normalized, easy-to-use, insurance-ready information, including our rating and scoring solutions. We're excited to have Ford as part of the exchange and believe their addition will help our insurance customers expand their usage-based insurance programs. At FAST, we are very pleased with the success we are having, extending and accelerating the adoption of FAST's solutions across our broad customer base. Since we acquired FAST in December, we have seen leading life insurers including Amica, Kansas City Life, Lincoln Heritage and Financial and Pacific Life license FAST's SaaS-based software to enable their digital transformation and become more automated and efficient. Finally, in our repair cost estimating solutions, we have launched XactAnalysis Insights, a new add-on feature to our core XactAnalysis platform. This tool uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to create interactive and customizable dashboards that enable our customers with a more holistic view of their claims data. We believe XactAnalysis Insights should help our customers to work more efficiently and effectively as they can more quickly identify trends in their data. In Energy and Specialized Markets, we continue to make advances with our differentiated analytic platform called Lens and recently released the upstream portfolio optimization module. We are on track and on budget for further releases by year-end, namely in the areas of power and renewables and upstream carbon emissions. Despite the softness in the energy end market, we continue to see increased demand from our customers for our Lens platform, where our investment has delivered value for our clients and is reflected in increasing contract values and deeper integration into our customers' workflows. In Financial Services, we launched Merchant Tracker, a unique solution that allows businesses to better understand where consumers are spending and how their sales compare to other merchants. This solution enables business leaders to benchmark themselves on a weekly basis across metrics including sales and market share versus other named merchants down to the zip code level. The data can also differentiate between physical and online sales. Merchant Tracker built upon the COVID-19 consumer spending dashboard that we developed in March to help our customers navigate through the early stages of the pandemic. Merchant Tracker is an example of how we are creating new commercial opportunities from the disruption of the pandemic while also delivering for our customers. On the sales front, our teams have fully embraced digital engagement, and outreach to our customers continues to be robust. We are experiencing increases in call volume in the 60%-plus range, and continue to benefit from the availability of customers who are still working from home. We recently hosted Verisk Velocity, our signature conference for underwriting and rating, as a fully virtual event this year. The digital format allowed us to expand the concept to feature more industry speakers and to create on-demand access so customers could watch sessions they were interested in at their convenience. The event focused on accelerating the future of insurance and included sessions on the latest emerging issues, including the digitization of insurance, lessons learned from COVID-19, cyber insurance and ransomware, millennials and insurance, social inflation and what it means for insurance, and combating racism with ethical artificial intelligence. We had over 1,900 people register for the conference, which was more than four times larger than our in-person event last year, and those numbers continue to grow as customers are still accessing the on-demand content. Additionally, we experienced improved representation from our global clients as well as deeper penetration into our customers as we saw more people per account in attendance. Overall, this event was a great success and really reinforces Verisk's position as a thought leader in the industry and a partner for our customers. Taken together, all this activity has created increased numbers of sales leads and growing sales pipelines as we partner with our customers to help them become more digitally engaged and connected. We continue to experience the modestly longer sales cycle relative to historic norms that we discussed last quarter, and are managing this carefully. Putting the customer first is one of the guiding principles at Verisk, and improving our customer experience is a key focus for everyone across the organization. I'm very pleased to share with you that we recently achieved our highest Net Promoter Score in the company's history, a score of 50. This is an improvement of six points from last year, which was our then peak score, and reflects an increase in our investment in what we call our Customer-First Program, a solution set of customer experience data, analytic tools and cultural drivers. Our nearly 40 frontline teams across the organization listened to the voice of our customers, helping us to observe what is important and creating action plans to drive customer value and improve customer loyalty. The meaningful insights we glean from these day-to-day customer interactions and from our growing customer experience analytical capabilities helps us improve our solutions, highlight important trends across solutions and businesses and alert us to problems. In the COVID moments, putting the customer first is needed more than ever, and our teams across all verticals have stepped up in unique ways to support them. On the sustainability front, we continue to make progress on our plan. For the third consecutive year, investments in renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets helped balance 100% of Verisk's CDP-reported scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. While we've implemented many important energy-saving initiatives during the recent past, investing in renewable energy certificates is a practical option for a company of our size that leases all of its office space. Taken together with carbon offsets, the investments represent an immediate step forward, balancing Verisk's greenhouse gas emissions for the near-term to a degree that the company could never achieve otherwise. In fact, based on CDP's scope 1 and 2 revenue-based intensity calculation, our 2019 emissions are more than 15% lower now than when we first measured emissions five years ago. Finally, I'd like to publicly welcome General Vincent Brooks to our board of directors. General Brooks joined our board on October 1 and brings with him more than four decades of leadership experience in some of the world's most complex and challenging situations. General Brooks served in the US Army for 42 years from his entry into West Point until his 2019 retirement as a four-star general. Most recently, General Brooks was in command of all US forces in Korea, where he concurrently led the United Nations Command and the Republic of Korea-US Combined Forces Command, which was comprised of more than 650,000 Korean and American soldiers. I'm confident that as a member of our Board of Directors, General Brooks will reinforce Verisk's culture of operational excellence, and his experience and guidance will be instrumental as we work in complex global-scale environments. General Brooks becomes the fourth new director to our board in the past four years. So now let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the third quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 7.6% to $703 million. While net income and earnings per share increases reflected a $125 million litigation reserve and $29 million acquisition-related earn-out expense in the prior period that did not reoccur. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, considering the impact from COVID-19. Normalized for the $8 million revenue impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions, organic constant currency grew 4.9%. The third quarter 2020 was the final quarter of any material organic impact from the injunction. In the third quarter, our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined last quarter, grew approximately 7.8% on an organic constant currency basis and normalized for the injunction, which was an improvement from the 6.5% growth in the second quarter. This sustained growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription-based business model. We did continue to experience, as we did in the prior quarter, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. These COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 10% on an organic constant currency basis during the third quarter, which was an improvement from the 20% decline in the second quarter and reflects improvements in all three of our segments, as the underlying causal impacts began to diminish and some of the pressure on our revenues abated, though the pace of the recovery varies across the solutions. For example, we have seen a rebound in our commercial underwriting surveys as our field staff is now allowed to enter buildings. And we have also seen improvements in trends across personal auto. On the energy side, we have seen a more modest improvement as CapEx budgets at our customers continue to be under pressure, affecting our consulting business. Despite the impact on revenue in the third quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered strong EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense and head count management. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, normalized for the injunction, was 17.7% in the third quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 52.1% in the quarter, representing strong leverage across the business. This margin level includes roughly 140 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects substantial investment in our business and infrastructure, including our cloud transition costs. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis and normalized for the injunction. Insurance segment revenues increased 7%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry-standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions and repair cost estimating solutions. We experienced a modest benefit from storm-related revenues as a result of a more normal hurricane season in 2020 as compared to the very slow season in 2019. This was offset in part by a decline in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Adjusted EBITDA grew 19.8% in the third quarter, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines and investment in our breakout areas. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 1% in the third quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms, environmental health and safety service solutions and weather analytics solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the criticality of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the energy transition practice, and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Despite the revenue declines, adjusted EBITDA grew 10.7% in the third quarter, driven by strong operational controls and modest actions taken during the second quarter to reduce head count to be more balanced with the current level of consulting work. We continue to closely monitor and partner with our energy customers as they navigate through this tough operating environment with a particular focus on consolidation in the upstream space. We have a track record of managing through these times effectively. Additionally, we now have the tools to capitalize on the commercial opportunity that consolidation brings through our cost intelligence solutions, which utilize our proprietary data assets to help identify cost-saving opportunities and reduce spending for these companies. Financial Services revenue increased 1.6% in the quarter driven by growth in subscription revenues. This was offset in part by declines in our spend informed analytics solutions stemming from COVID-19, and reduced levels of advertising. We continue to focus on building a more stable and a recurring revenue base for this business. Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7% for the quarter, reflecting cost discipline. Total adjusted EBITDA margins declined in the quarter as a result of portfolio actions we closed earlier in the year. Our reported effective tax rate was 22.6% for the quarter compared to 15.5% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly rate came in lower than our expectations, owing to increased levels of stock option exercise, which depend on personal employee decisions and the Verisk stock price. Looking forward, we now expect that our full year tax rate for 2020 will be between 20% and 22%. Adjusted net income was $218 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.32 for the third quarter of 2020, up 17.2% and 17.9% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19, and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $207 million for the quarter, down 3% from the prior year period primarily due to a deferral of federal income tax payment under the CARES Act from the second quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020, partially offset by the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes as well as higher customer collections and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $65 million for the quarter, up 6.8% from the prior year period. CapEx represented 9.2% of total revenues in the quarter, reflecting some leasehold improvement expenditures associated with our office consolidations in Boston and London. We continue to expect capital expenditures to decline as a percentage of revenues. For 2020, we expect CapEx to be in the previously provided range of $215 million to $270 million, as investing in our business and our people continues to be our highest priority. Related to CapEx, we continue to expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $185 million to $195 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020. During the third quarter, we returned $94 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.27 per share dividend for the fourth quarter to be paid in December. I also want to note progress with the integration and sales momentum of our recent acquisitions, including FAST, BuildFax and Genscape. On the revenue side, while still early, we are seeing success selling these solutions into our broad customer base and are innovating new products and enhancing existing ones by incorporating the data sets into our solutions. On the cost side, we are experiencing synergies consistent with our expectations at the time of the deals as integrations are moving smoothly. We're monitoring these acquisitions carefully and supporting the management teams to ensure that we are generating a solid return on invested capital. As we detailed last quarter, we continue to believe that the collective causal factors from COVID-19 represent pressure on achieving our 7% long-term growth objective in 2020. However, we remain confident they do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience in recovery. Each of these causal factors has its own recovery curve, making it difficult to predict the duration of the impacts to our revenue growth. We continue to have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively, and deliver operating leverage while also continuing to invest in our innovation agenda. While we restrict head count growth at the outset of the pandemic, with improving revenue dynamics, more recently, we have begun to partially release deferred hiring restrictions. That said, we are watching the environment carefully and will calibrate head count growth accordingly to protect profitability. Taking this all together, we continue to believe that the stability of our subscription revenues, along with our core operating leverage, driven by the responsiveness of our compensation structure and cost discipline, will continue to support revenue and EBITDA growth in 2020. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Your insurance margins have been exceptionally strong this year, and I know you've talked about T&E savings and comp, et cetera. Should we be thinking of 2019 as the normal baseline year and you'll expand from there? Or has there been a permanent step-up this year if you take out some of the temporary COVID impacts? Maybe you could go through some of what you saw this quarter to just help us think about what a normal baseline looks like.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Toni. Appreciate the question. And, as always, when we talk about margins across the enterprise as a whole and even just within the Insurance segment, there were a lot of factors that are going into this. I think if we can think about it on one level in the third quarter, the exceptional margin expansion was a function of, in part, the COVID-19 environment, meaning that we did see a larger reduction in expenses owing to travel and entertainment and some compensation costs relative to the revenue growth chain. So that was certainly an element that contributed. Our view is that there may be some permanent benefits from that as we look at the way we orient our, or size our travel and entertainment activities. There may be some permanent benefits in terms of longer term real estate expense savings. And so I think that there is some permanent element of that that we achieved. So that's kind of the COVID dimension. There is another dimension in the margins in Insurance which reflect the contribution of our aerial imagery business, the Geomni business to Vexcel. And so there was a substantial reduction in expenses and, if you will, EBITDA margin benefit from that transaction. That did represent a permanent improvement across Insurance as a whole, and so that is certainly a, what we would expect is a permanent benefit. I think those are the larger pieces. We also had in the quarter, particularly some particular strength in our AIR catastrophe modeling business that was helpful with some stronger transactional revenue, and some other business related things. The storm revenue in the claims business probably also boosted margin a little bit higher. But I think your thesis is correct. There are some permanent elements to that. We're going to try to manage the recovery of expenses, particularly T&E and head count through the recovery here in a way to continue to allow that operating leverage to be reflected to it. But there are going to be some permanent benefits. Hopefully that captures it. I do think I want to end by saying that I think looking at 2019 is a legitimate reference point. We do think that the levels that we will achieve in 2020 reflect some exceptional benefits, but we will be looking at our margins I think in 2021 relative to 2019 as a more normalized base.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, wanted to ask about Energy. The organic growth improved versus second quarter despite the really difficult comp. Obviously COVID has probably moderated a little bit, but the CapEx spending in the energy industry is still tough, as you've mentioned. Just help us out with how you're thinking about whether you could see growth in that segment in 2021 just given that 2020 was so challenging. Just talk about how you see Energy playing out.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure. So, Toni, the way that I would approach it is first with regard to the Wood Mackenzie component of that, we are experiencing two dimensions. One of course, the consulting element, where, from a COVID-sensitive perspective, and the challenges that the industry is facing, that's where we're feeling the pressure as reflected in the COVID-sensitive revenues. And so it's difficult to predict how that Energy sector will continue to experience that and reflect it. So I think we're expecting some level of that to persist into 2021. On the subscription side, I think as we said, we've continued to see growth in that portion of the business. That has been bolstered by the investment that we've made in Lens and the perceived quality of that product platform and our ability to continue to grow subscription levels. There are some impacts from consolidation within the industry that will have a negative impact going into 2021. But we still expect, from an organic standpoint, to see contributions to growth from that. The other element is going to be in our PowerAdvocate business. 2020 reflected a transition from a great 2019 where we have a lot of new projects and implementation revenue that came out as we moved to more subscription revenue for some of those pieces. We do think the contribution in 2020 from that business will be stronger in 2021 as they have rebuilt the pipeline and that should continue to grow as well. So I will end by saying, we continue over the long term to believe that the entire Energy and Specialized Markets component of the business has the potential to deliver growth, consistent with our organic constant currency growth targets of 7%. That will vary from year-to-year. We're obviously experiencing pressures within this environment. But we do believe that the business as a whole can deliver on that.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And, Lee, I just want to make a general point around that specific point, and Toni, good to hear from you. So, we can always observe the relative impact of the macro environment at any given moment, which I think is the basis of your question, and there is some impact, as Lee was talking. But another thing which is true about our business and I wanted to make this point, and it actually relates to everything we do, is that we consistently grow faster than the underlying markets that we serve. And the reason is a combination of what it is we do, which is fundamentally helping them become more data analytic, which is the direction of travel anyway, and actually in the COVID moment, many companies really, really have discovered their need to accelerate their rates of digitization and deepen their data analytics. So that's the first point. The second point is the rate at which we grow is really going to be strongly a function of how much value and increased value we're able to bring to our customers. So there is definitely a relationship to the macro environment, no question about it. But what I wanted to emphasize was, we always feel that we have the opportunity to increase the value that we bring to our customers. And that does get reflected in how much of their increased value they share with us, even in a relatively difficult market. That's kind of the underlying story of Verisk, actually.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. Thanks very much.
Stacey Jill Brodbar - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Next question.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, Lee. I wanted to jump more into the third quarter margins, both a question on T&E and incentive compensation. Are you able to call out the temporary margin benefit for cash incentive compensation during COVID – this is for the third quarter – like you did for the second quarter? I think there was a 100-basis-point figure back in the second quarter. And then the second part of my question is when thinking about the 140 basis points of benefit that you've called out to the third quarter from T&E, is there a sense with the company that sales productivity has been strong enough that you could quantify how much of that 140 basis points of benefit in the third quarter will remain an ongoing benefit, meaning not as much travel will rebound even post COVID?
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. So, first to answer the first part of your question, we estimate that the impact of incentive compensation change was about 40 basis points relative to the 140 basis points of T&E benefit. And that's just looking at the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. So that would be I think the number that you were looking for on the compensation front. With regard to your second question, I would say it's still too early for us to associate the productivity on the sales side, which Scott described and I think we're all very pleased with, to how we calibrate our T&E expectations looking ahead. I think there are two levels. One, from a financial perspective, we obviously want to manage that in a way that we continue to see the operating leverage within the business. But the other dimension, and clearly the more important dimension, is what do we want to see from our customers, and to what degree is it important to them that we're engaged with them face to face. This is a business where we think that we benefit from that. We're obviously doing well within this environment and that productivity is up, but at the end of the day, we need to make certain that we are interacting with our clients in the way that is most effective for them and for us. So, we'll follow their lead. I do think that that's going to be a gradual process and we'll have the ability to calibrate that, but that would be the way I would say we are thinking about it, and it's too early for us to quantify or define what we think the permanent, potential permanent benefit from the T&E perspective is.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Right. But you do think when you quantify it, it will be material. You're just not ready to quantify it yet, Lee.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I mean, I think there's a certain unknowable quality to it. I think we'll know it when we see it kind of experienced over time. As Toni indicated, kind of looking at over a period of time, perhaps as we look at travel and entertainment as a percentage of our revenues, maybe in one way for us to gauge it. But I think it's undeniable that, having been through this experience, that we have the scope to think about the degree to which we're spending on that relative to revenues and/or have other ways and more efficient means to interact with our customers. But it will be something that we're tracking and hence, by tracking, be able to manage more effectively.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And maybe a word of context around that, which is we are actually, right now, in the early stages of envisioning what will our physical plant look like over longer periods of time. And I'm certain that all of our customers are doing the same thing. And so in the future state, that person, she or he, that one of our people needs to encounter in a deep way, where will they be? I mean in the same way that we are considering exactly how dense our physical space – we will definitely have physical space, but how dense will it be? Where will it be? We're asking those questions right now. Our customers are as well. So I think Lee's answer is exactly correct because we can't presume on the decisions that our customers are going to make. And yet we will want to encounter them deeply. They will want to encounter us deeply. And so we're just going to figure it out with them, basically. But that will emerge over time.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Andrew.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, hey. Good morning, everyone. You mentioned in your prepared remarks some comment – you made some comments on digitization. I think you just brought it up again to Toni's question. Can you go a little bit deeper in terms of what you're hearing from your clients, specifically how COVID has maybe changed their appetite to revisit their processes? And what areas there may be the most new demand for products or digitizing total processes and, obviously, how you can help as this post-COVID world plays out? I know that's a loaded question.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. No, thanks, Alex. Mark, you want to make some observations from the insurance world?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for the question. I think what we're all saying is that our customers need to make sure they operate as effectively in this post-COVID world as they did in the past. And that digital engagement with their policyholders is hugely important, whether that's on the underwriting side or on the claims side. So the things that we've seen become kind of very important to insurers is some of the things we've talked about in the past. So to the extent you're thinking about adjudicating a claim, we have a tool that we gave away free during the pandemic, at least the early stages. And what it does is it allows that adjuster to sit at his desk and do a desktop adjustment, meaning actually adjudicate a claim by interacting with the policyholder, taking pictures, taking videos, taking that measurement from inside those pictures and developing repair cost estimates so that the contractor can get out and fix the property at the same time the policyholder gets the payment from or the contractor gets the payment from the (00:37:43). On the underwriting side, very similarly, we have tools that have helped them digitally engage. If you're going to go underwrite a commercial building or a very high-value home, you want to go out and see it. Now that's difficult. And what I think key is all of these insurers attempting to do that from their desktop, interact with the policyholders and have them walk around the home or walk around the property. And finally, it takes a form of automation, right? People are looking to automate that co-process. So anything we can do, we refer to it as LightSpeed, to bring all that data forward so that they're able to quickly and efficiently provide a quote using public information, using proprietary information. That is the digital engagement that we're experiencing. And I think what we'd like to say is a lot of our insurance companies are trying to become a better digital form of themselves. So this time has kind of spurred some investment in IT so that they can be there in the advent (00:38:36).
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Very good. Thanks. And then just a quick one, just following up on the energy question earlier, I think you answered more about 2021. But can you give us a little bit more near-term outlook here? I think you said, obviously, there's consolidation. There are also – I think bankruptcies are just starting to happen. Is there a likelihood that things get worse before they get better? Or how do you see the near term from there?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, the point I think to really bear in mind here is the nature of our business in the energy space. Just even a few years ago, something on the order of 70% of our revenue was related to the upstream part of the hydrocarbon wing of the energy ecosystem. Now it's less than 50%. And most of what we do there is with the integrated globals or with the national oil companies in the hydrocarbon space as well as the financial services sector that finances and does deals with those kinds of folks. Our exposure to Lower 48 unconventionals, which is the part of the market that has really been affected, and when you referenced bankruptcies, for example, is actually quite low. It's never been a large part of our mix. And so, actually, we're fairly insulated from those kinds of effects. So you're right, Alex, those things – some of those trends are going on right now, but I would encourage you to lay over that the actual structure of our business, which tends to be more immune to some of those effects. And there are also compensating effects in other parts of the supply chain. So, as you know, we have a very nice footprint in the petrochemicals world. At the moment, petrochemicals players are benefiting from the fact that feedstocks are cheap.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Fair enough there. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: There are puts and takes.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is open.
Andrew Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. good morning. I was hoping you could provide an update on the cloud transition work you're doing right now. Or are there any milestones you can point to that can give us a sense for some of the incremental progress there of late? And maybe comment on where you are in terms of realizing the cost benefits from that work.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So we're plowing ahead. And there are multiple work streams inside. So part of it is actually sort of grooving the pathways and hardening the pathways and ensuring security as we rotate things into the cloud. But another part of it is the migration of our footprint away from premise computing, and especially the mainframe. So we're at work. We're in the middle of it right now. The work will proceed faster than the visible cost benefit associated with what we're doing. It's just the nature of the thing. The cloud spending, for example, is a linear function. And premise spending is more of a sort of – you sort of take shelfs of spending down, but you have to reach points where that has occurred. And I would say that we are well along. And we've talked before about the fact that mainframe migration, for example, is a couple of years. And so I have kind of like a two-year horizon on when we can say we are fundamentally done or close to done with mainframe migration. So that's where we are. The rate at which we will get the cost benefit of that will emerge kind of as a trailing function. And this is what we've said about it all along. Actually, I hope that those of you that have been with us for a while have noted, we've been making these investments for quite some time. They're all baked into our P&L. It's not like we have to declare some special project. We're just – this is what we do, and this is what we were doing. So, anyway, so a couple of years is sort of the window for technical migration, and the rate at which the cost benefits sort of layer in will sort of be a trailing function. They will express themselves in the intermediate period but even more after we have achieved the technical migration.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And Andrew, one thing I just want to add to Scott's comments, kind of two things. One, just to kind of address the broad question, I'd say there's no material cost benefit that we've realized at this point in the process because we are still in the – bringing the cloud costs in. And we are in the process, as Scott has described, of stepping down that on-premises cost over time. We believe that – and that's more a function of the phasing of this. And we're dealing with hundreds of data sets that have to be re-migrated, power has to be migrated, applications that have to be re-coded. But we will achieve those savings over time. So there's nothing, I think, material in the margin. The second point that I want to make is there's also a revenue benefit. And I will tell you that the thing that we're probably most excited is getting these data sets into the cloud, substantiating the data fabric that we are building across the enterprise. And our ability to innovate, associate data sets and create new platforms and analytics of commercial value is indisputably enhanced by that. So I think we are seeing some of the benefits of that on the new product development side that we're excited about commercializing.
Andrew Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. That's really helpful. And then switching gears a little bit, in Financial Services, obviously, transaction revenues are a bit challenged near-term, but it looks like subscription revenue has ticked higher each quarter throughout this year. So I was hoping you could speak to where you're seeing the most momentum in that business. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, it's really broadly based. I think we've described to you in the past that we have multiple categories of solutions. Lee called out that, at the moment, spend-informed analytics, which does relate to folks that are trying to promote their products, and therefore, ultimately things like advertising. That has been feeling the effects of the COVID moment so we called that one out. But all the other things that we do are a part of the overall results that we shared with you.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's true. There isn't anything that I would call out specifically. I think it has been fairly broad-based on the subscription side.
Andrew Nicholas - William Blair & Co. LLC: Appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks. This is David Chu for Gary. So you highlighted lower T&E costs with short-term comp as part of that T&E benefit. So just wondering if you can speak to the level of overall underlying margin expansion improvement ex these potential short-term benefits, and also wondering if there was any benefit from equity grant timing in the quarter.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks. So the short answer is, even when we exclude the T&E benefit, we are still seeing operating margin expansion. So when we look at our overall improvement in margin, the T&E and the incentive compensation benefit in the third quarter was some but not all of that. So we are very pleased to see that that operating leverage in this environment, even absent those savings, is still expressing itself. And that's before we take into account the non-organic or the M&A related impact. So within the core business, we're seeing that. But also in our breakouts, we're seeing a contribution from improved operating leverage within those businesses. But I think your question went to the key element, is the T&E and the incentive comp impact greater than the overall level? No, it's just – it's a component, and we're actually having operating leverage beneath that.
David Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then just in terms of the improvement in transactional revenue being down 10% versus 20% last quarter, can you just dive into that a bit more? Just what are the biggest drivers of improvement? I think you spoke to it a bit, but just where are things lagging still?
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I would say that where we are seeing recovery, and you will – if you go back in the script, you'll see some comments around our survey – our commercial lines survey business where we have seen improvement. Part of that is access to the buildings. We've also seen an improvement on the personal lines, or the personal auto segment because with greater driving activity, we're seeing a benefit to that in some of our transactional businesses. Those are probably the largest components. We continue to see the pressure probably unchanged in more of the consulting businesses that we've seen. And also, of course, travel remains extremely restricted, and so we're not seeing any material benefit on that front. So that hopefully gives you some compositional color on those changes.
David Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I wanted to focus more on the InsureTech, I guess, update from your perspective. We've obviously had a few of them go public this year already. And I was just curious, from your perspective, how things are going there. I know in the past you gave us some win rates and stats. I don't know if you have any updates there as well.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Manav, it was really hard to hear you. I think you were asking about InsureTech and maybe you gave us kind of an environmental question about sort of what's going there or perhaps also its intersection with us. Mark, do you – assuming that that was your question, I (00:49:28).
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, that's correct, yes.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. All right. Mark, do you want to maybe kick off on that?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure. So obviously, it's a very robust market for anyone with a (00:49:37) IPO from the InsureTech world looking to underwrite risk. And I think like many people, there are InsureTechs that are aggressively looking to explore that IPO opportunity. The good news about that is the way these InsureTechs seem to be attractive to the market is because of the tech play, the automation, the way they go about things in the non-traditional sense. And I think what we have been fortunate to be a part of is, as these new InsureTechs come to market, whether initially as a managing general agent, where they don't actually underwrite the risk but they select it, or a full-blown underwriting insurer, they have looked to us for data analytics information as a part of that trail. So we have benefited from the InsureTech world as it relates to those insurance companies. And some of the biggest ones that are in market or those that are coming to market behind the scenes are quite effectively using a full suite of Verisk solutions. So I feel like we're great partners to those InsureTechs. I think the other part of the question that you have, and I don't want to be overly exhaustive, but there's also InsureTechs that are providing services. And those InsureTechs that are providing services in part compete against us. And those businesses clearly have (00:51:10) enhance and increase the views, the awareness of insurers of alternate sources of doing business. And I think the combination of a little bit of competition, which always makes us better, but also the fact that now insurers are hearing that message, they're probably a little more open and interested to talk about our solutions and opportunities there. So I hope, Manav without really hearing your question, that was hopefully, what you were looking for.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And Manav, I want to add one thing, building off of Mark's comments on the competition dynamic. And he was describing it with regard to other InsureTechs that provide services to us. You know, on the former point in terms of the new entrants, the secondary benefit, and frankly, in some ways, potentially even the more significant benefit, is that that competitive pressure of new approaches to the insurance industry, it puts more pressure on some of the traditional players that are looking to address and respond to that. And so for instance, in our LightSpeed product, I think the LightSpeed product where we've had great success is in many ways a competitive response to other new markets that are out there. So it's serving to, I think, lift the industry as a whole apart from kind of that purely incremental amount of revenue that we get from those new entrants.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, that's helpful. Thank you. That's what I was going at. And for my second question, hopefully you can hear me. But the breakout areas, some of them that you've talked about in the past might have already broken out. But just what are some of the key ones we should be keeping an eye on in terms of where the investments are going in to-date?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, I would just highlight, sort of at a kind of high-thematic level. The businesses that we have, which are very much sort of SaaS-powered business models, are doing very well. And those show up in multiple parts of our business. And in general, the more that we lean into, as we are, what we refer to as platform analytic environments, the better basically. And there are development cycles associated with those, but when you get to the place where you are the environment, where your customer finds it productive to do their work, that's a really, really powerful place to be. And that's a theme which spans much of our company today and all the verticals.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of George Tong for Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. Thanks. You have Ryan (00:54:01) on for George today. So, you had mentioned earlier that you're able to outgrow your end markets due to the increased value you bring to customers. I was just wondering if you've seen any impact to pricing in the current environment. And if so, which segments are pulling back the most? And then also, could you remind me what lift to organic growth that pricing tends to provide in a given year?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So let's see, in reverse order, you should think of pricing as sort of a GNP-ish kind of a number sort of, inside of what it is that we do. I don't really think that there have been differential effects, in different parts of – I think your question was at the level of verticals. I don't really think there have been differential effects. I would go back to what Lee cited before, which is services is the place where, when the economy softens, there tends to be a softening, and so, kind of that as a category. But in terms of licensed solutions, I wouldn't make sharp distinctions across the verticals. Lee, I don't know if you would see it any differently. But doesn't feel that way.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No. I agree.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: To me. And then the way that we think about pricing our solutions, and we've tried to be very deliberate about separating COVID-sensitive and non-COVID-sensitive revenues. You've heard our report in terms of the non-COVID-sensitive, which tend to essentially be licensable, subscription-based kinds of solutions. And we talked about slightly, modestly longer sales cycles. But in terms of the terms that we're striking with our customers, I have not picked up any signals that there's any real change there.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think maybe the question that you were asking and making reference, as we get in the text, COVID was focused on the Energy and Specialized Markets performance relative to the end market. And the one area that I would point out, it was with reference to the Lens platform. And there, I think it is a microcosm of where we are adding substantial value to the customer in this environment. And that's enabling us to secure larger contract values, because of the value that we're delivering into that end market. And I think that, in a way, is what's powering us to outperform the end market as a function of the value that we're creating there. And I think there are other instances of that. That's a, I think, the investment and the return dynamic which is I think a separate answer than the point of view that Scott expressed, which I agree with in terms of differential on the segments.
Unknown Speaker: Great. Thanks. And then for my follow-up, I know the – I was hoping to get an update on the Geomni situation. I understand that the injunction was supposed to lap for their revenue impact in 3Q essentially. But you'd previously discussed some other options to continue pursuing Aerial Imagery, such as commercial licensing even with EagleView. And I was just wondering if there was any other options that, or things that are looking more realistic to you at this point.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks for the question. This is Mark. So, first of all, we continue to explore our legal options with regard to roof measurements. As well, you probably referenced earlier, what we did was we kind of moved a lot of our image capture to Vexcel. What that allows, and to just emphasize the importance of that is, what's expensive and what's very important is coverage, right? And coverage not only in what geographies you have, but how frequently you refresh that. So with a combined source of image capture, we are now able to, better than anyone else, cover the United States and cover the United States frequently and go international. With that inventory, we have put together some solutions for underwriting purposes, which represent things about the outside of the building, physical structures, pool, things like that as well as ways to go about looking at claims and triaging claims after an event, a catastrophe as an example or extreme weather. And we've taken some of that inventory and we've moved it over into the energy space and ways we go about helping energy companies do things around their assets and their physical network. So what hopefully you hear is we've tried to leverage and gain scale on image capture, while still doing the analytics. And that analytic approach is not just insurance. It's more broadly even into real estate, construction and other verticals here. So that has been our focus. But at this time, we are not able to provide roof measurements, which is the very important act or approach inside the claims space.
Unknown Speaker: Great. Thanks for that.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So sorry to beat the dead horse you've already tried to address four times. But – so I hear you that there's an extraordinary kind of margin benefit this year. So it sounds like a year-over-year step back in 2021, that makes sense. You referenced in one of your answers, Lee, that 2019 as a reference year to build off of. So it sounds like higher than 2019. Just want to make sure that I'm considering the appropriate building blocks. So, I guess, you referenced the Vexcel benefit, I guess, two years of some form of normalized margin expansion in the business and then only a partial return of T&E or some of the temporary cuts. So do I have the categories right? Anything that I'm missing? And can you quantify the Vexcel benefit for us? Thank you.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So – and, Jeff, it was a little bit hard to hear the last one. The short answer is I think that you have the components correctly in the business. The variable is going to be the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and the inherent unpredictability of that. We're certainly hopeful that we'll continue to see a return to a more normal environment. And in getting there, I think our hope is that we will be able to hang on to some of these elements of margin improvement that we saw, probably not all of them. We will need to travel and visit with clients. If we are performing better relative to our targets, then we should see our compensation structure adjust to that. But I think you have the components correctly. And I think all we want to do is highlight on some of those temporary impacts and then to begin to anticipate the return to a normal environment that we're going to try to manage. So I think that hopefully addresses the first part of your question. The second part of your question I just would ask you to repeat because it wasn't entirely clear to me, not that you weren't expressing it clearly, but I had a hard time hearing it.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: It was just if you could quantify the Vexcel benefit to margin.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I can't. It's part – I can't because I think we view it as, this margin is reflective of the core underlying margin of the Insurance business. Vexcel – I'm sorry, the Geomni business, as we have discussed in the past, was a business that we were making a substantial investment in, that it was not contributing a positive margin as we were investing in it. Now without, you can kind of see the core element of the business. But we don't quantify that.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then on Lens, what percentage of the client base that it would be a good fit for have transitioned over to Lens at this point? I guess, roughly, what is the immediate price lift? And then maybe more importantly, how does it change the long-term interaction with the customer and revenue opportunity? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, Jeff, if you were to understand Lens as – in sort of the Lens market space opportunity picture, basically, it's the product of all the different content families times all the accounts. And when you think of it that way, we're in a very early stage of our journey.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. This is Emily McLaughlin on for Seth this morning. My first question, just building on an earlier one, can you talk about the monthly trends or the exit rates in the 15% of the business that's COVID-sensitive relative to the down 10% for the full quarter?
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So it's obviously just one month, I would say, that so far, based upon what we've seen, we're seeing similar year-over-year growth rates in the COVID-sensitive revenues and in the non-COVID-sensitive revenues. So I think that we – while certainly the third quarter demonstrated a sequential improvement relative to the second quarter, so far, and again, it's just into the start of this, we are perhaps seeing the impact of going into the winter season and some impacts of increased restrictions on a global basis that may create less opportunity for sequential improvement relative to the third quarter. That's kind of speculation. Nobody knows for certain. But at least looking at October, we're seeing kind of stable levels of year-over-year change in the non-COVID and the COVID-sensitive revenues.
Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And my second question, just a housekeeping one. Are you able to quantify how much the storm-related revenue contributed to the Insurance segment growth?
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No. It's not a significant enough number. On the margin, it was beneficial, but we aren't quantifying that.
Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks very much for the time.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the lines of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Hamzah Mazari - Jefferies LLC: Hey, good morning. Thank you so much. My first question is just on the international Insurance business. And my question really is, a number of years ago, I think at an Analyst Day, maybe it was 2017 or 2018, that business I think was $130 million. And we had talked about potentially doubling that business organically over the next five years. And so I know Rulebook and Sequel were powerful acquisitions to further penetrate international. I also know that AIR is pretty well penetrated, but maybe not certain other solution sets. So just any update on where that international business is today, how it's performed, where you think there's further opportunity.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So thank you for the question. I do like talking about this topic. I think if you were to think about that presentation, and I appreciate you bringing it back to us. The UK was, in particular, a point of particular focus. And if you recall, we did a series of acquisitions. It brought a series of new products there. And I think that thesis has proven out wonderfully well. I think we are growing probably in excess of that plan. And we have definitely added to our growth rates in Insurance as a result of that international dimension. A couple things just to highlight, where I think we've been particularly effective. Sequel, Rulebook was and continues to be a wonderful acquisition, not just because of the solution set, but its ability from a technology perspective to integrate and weave together a lot of the various insurance solutions. So we have a more holistic and more interconnected set of solutions as a result of that acquisition. We also have some acquisitions that are in kind of the ISO world that really represent some of the things that we've done here, but it's sending it out. And that's about writing risk and pricing risk and understanding where risks are. So that, again, has been positive. I think the place that I continue to aspire is I would love to, and I think we would as a team, love to recreate some of the success we've had in the UK in other geographies. And finding the right mix of solutions and acquisitions although into European nations, that has been a little bit more of a challenge, but we continue to pursue that.
Hamzah Mazari - Jefferies LLC: That's very helpful. And just my follow-up question is just on Financial Services. And really the question really is, it seems like you've done a lot of work there from a few years ago where the transaction, or where the subscription piece was a lot smaller. It seemed like the customer base was much more concentrated to banks. Could you maybe contrast this business to where does it sit today? Is it pretty similar to the Energy and Insurance business? And how does it differ from the healthcare business that you've divested? Which, I guess that business became not very global in nature, and I guess the customer base became very concentrated towards the government. And so just big picture, is that business kind of fixed, for lack of a better word, in terms of where it should be?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: We're very happy with the progress that we've made. For me, the primary point of distinction with – you chose the healthcare vertical, and all the factors that you cited are accurate. But to me, the primary difference was and remains that we have a remarkable and proprietary data set inside what we do in the Financial Services vertical. We had the hypothesis when we began the journey in the healthcare vertical that we could establish a data advantage. And because of developments in the market environment, that proved not to be the case. And so caring about returns that we drive for our shareholders, we'd said, okay, probably the best thing to do is to invest in other directions. So this situation is very different from that situation. And the number one factor that I would cite is a remarkably proprietary data set.
Hamzah Mazari - Jefferies LLC: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks so much.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: Thank you. There are no question at this time. Presenters, you may proceed.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for your continuing interest in Verisk, and appreciate all your questions. We will, as always, be following up with you and look forward to that. So thanks. Have a great day, rest of the day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-05 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, JP, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2020 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide an overview of our business; Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer will follow with the financial review; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; Nick Daffan, Chief Information Officer; Neal Anderson, President, Wood Mackenzie; and Lisa Bonalle Hannan, President, Verisk Financial will join the team for the Q&A session. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including, but not limited to the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Good day, everyone, and I'm glad to be with you today. The second quarter was unique as we dealt with the macro effects of the COVID-19 event, and I hope you and your families continue to stay well in this moment. At Verisk, our priorities are unchanged as we remain committed to delivering for our customers, protecting the health and well-being of our 9,000 plus teammates and continuing to drive our innovation agenda. I'm pleased, but not surprised that our second quarter results reflect the strength and stability of our business model, the mission-critical nature of our solutions and the hard work and resilience of our teammates, who quickly adapted to the work-from-home environment and have remained focused on customer needs and innovation. I'm proud of our team and want to thank each teammate for their dedication and focus during a fluid moment. Before we discuss the quarter, I want to make two related points about where Verisk stands. First, we believe that the net effect of the COVID-19 moment should benefit Verisk in the long run, given that our customers will persevere and make it through to the other side with even more focus on becoming the better digital versions of themselves. This should make our customers more capable and desirous of using our many solutions. And second, the consistent performance you see from us now and into the future is a function of our structure and position and not only cyclical or momentary effects. Our results are a function of the steady and ongoing accumulation of innovation and success with customers. Our business performed as we had expected in the second quarter. We previously communicated to you our analysis that approximately 85% of our revenues are subscription-based and subject to long-term contracts, and therefore, we did not see any material impact on these revenues from the COVID-19 environment. In the second quarter, those revenues grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis when normalized for the one-time impact of the injunction related to roof measurement solutions. Of the remaining 15% of revenues that are more transactional in nature and are subject to COVID-19 impacts, those revenues declined approximately 20% on an organic constant currency basis in the second quarter in line with our expectations. We experienced sequential improvement throughout the quarter and into July, as the underlying causal factors began to diminish and we expect to see continued progress on that front. During March, as the expense of the pandemic became clear, we quickly moved to action and deliberately protected profitability without, and this is important, cutting investment in our business. We did this by moderating headcount growth, but without resorting to large scale furloughs or layoffs by focusing on operational discipline and by benefiting from the natural responsiveness of our compensation structure. Together, these actions delivered strong organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. Even while delivering strong profitability, we continue to fund investments in our innovation agenda and continued monetizing our technical infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization of key data sets and leading-edge data fabric supporting great analytics as we have done for the last several years. We will provide more details on our performance in its financial review. During the second quarter, Verisk operated predominantly in a work-from-home environment and our teams across the organization have remained highly effective. Operationally, our computing and network capacity has consistently and comfortably exceeded our daily requirements even as demand for our solutions and platforms have increased meaningfully in this remote environment. For example, in our Insurance segment, usage of our digital claims settlement tool increased over 55% in the second quarter. And we are successfully converting free trials into paid subscriptions as customers realize the benefit of this new innovative platform to help them on their journey to becoming more digitally engaged. And in the energy vertical, we saw visits to our portal grow by over 40%, as customers value our content, particularly in moments of uncertainty. We moved our innovation agenda forward evidenced by our continued investment across the enterprise. And the use of digital collaboration tools has helped our team stay connected to develop new and updated solutions for our customers. A few examples. In Insurance, we launched a new micro-business insurance program with advisory forms, rules and loss costs, specifically for the small businesses. This program is designed to help insurers cover the unique risks of micro-businesses that are often part of the gig economy, often operated out of home or shared spaces and having fewer than four employees. We also released an updated cyber risk modeling platform and launched Life Risk Navigator, our cloud-based stochastic risk modeling platform that offers in-depth portfolio analytics, which can enhance risk selection, quantify changes in mortality rates, improve hedging strategies and drive better financial decision-making for our life insurance customers. In our catastrophe modeling business, we have released Version 8 of our Touchstone platform, which includes timely updates for many of our models in the U.S., Australia and the Caribbean, and continues to fulfill our innovation promise. In Energy and Specialized Markets, we continue to push forward with our differentiated analytic platform called Lens, and are on track for further releases in the back half of the year related to upstream portfolio optimization, renewables and carbon emissions. Despite the softness in the Energy market, we continue to see demand from our customers for Lens, which is reflected in both adoption and constructive pricing. Also within our Energy segment, we launched a solution in April, which analyzes pandemic-related supply chain risk and allows our Energy customers to anticipate potential disruptions in their business operations. We are currently enhancing the existing solution by adding data sets from across Verisk that address additional elements of supply chain risks such as vulnerability of suppliers to extreme events, the environmental, social and governance risk factors that suppliers may pose and movements and commodity markets impacting supplier costs. And in Financial Services, our loan loss forecasting model called LookAhead is gaining momentum with customers as it helps them understand the changes to their anticipated loan loss curves related to government stimulus programs, trends in unemployment and COVID-19 generally. This solution is unique to the marketplace given that it is founded on the total customer wallet view data set, which is proprietary to Verisk Financial Services. On the sales front, our teams have adjusted nicely to a fully digital sales model. To help our salesforce adjust to the virtual environment, we developed a series of trainings for best practices. We use virtual tools, including Skype, Zoom, Teams and Prezi. These sessions were very effective in making our sales teams comfortable with the new format. Outreach to our customers is robust, and with customers in their home offices, we have found they are often more reachable than ever. As a result, calls with customers increased over 50% in the second quarter versus the prior year. In addition, we successfully converted most of our scheduled in-person customer events to virtual events. Virtual events have enabled us to increase reach and attendance, including at our Signature London-based InsurTech Event in June called Verisk Vision, which saw a 63% increase in attendance this year versus the prior year's in-person gathering. Additionally, we hosted 48 webinars across our Insurance segment in quarter two, and had over 8,000 customers in attendance, which is more than a doubling versus last year. In Energy, we hosted a number of virtual events throughout the second quarter, delivering thought leadership and content to more than 3,000 clients and prospects. We continue to invest in the virtual space and make enhancements to our platform. We've decided that all events for the remainder of the year will be virtual and we're making plans accordingly. Virtual engagement with customers extends to the executive level. It is clear from these discussions that the pandemic has heightened the recognition among our customers that they need to become more digital and more automated and to do so at pace. At the CEO level, I have also been pleased to maintain a steady and high degree of contact with our customers' CEOs in the virtual moments. Like me, our customers' CEOs are highly focused on the well-being and productivity of their teams and consider the further digitization of their companies to be a highest priority. I continue to receive feedback along two lines, one, Verisk is a unique and differentiated partner; and two, our customers look to us for a steady stream of innovation to help them on the journey to becoming more digital and more automated. Even with a video screen between us, the depth of alignment and degree of mutual respect is as high as ever. The net result of all this activity across all levels is that sales opportunities and our pipelines continue to grow, as we capitalize on this structural growth trend. We are experiencing a modest lengthening of our sales cycles across our businesses as compared to historic norms. We are managing this closely and view this more as a timing issue and a function of the complexity of bringing stakeholders together and closing deals in a remote environment. While we have been successfully executing in a work-from-home format, I'm pleased to share that we've begun to open some of our global offices for a safe and phased return to office for those employees who would like to work from the office. In fact, we have opened more than 50 of our global locations in a Phase 1 format over the past few weeks, including our headquarters in Jersey City. I'm hosting this call from our offices, and it feels great to be back in the office. Additionally, as the stay-at-home restrictions have been lifted across the US, we have seen our field force return to a five-day week schedule, so that they can begin to work on the backlog that built up when entering commercial buildings was restricted. I also want to note how pleased we are with the integration and sales momentum of our recent acquisitions, including FAST, BuildFax and Genscape. While still early, we are realizing both revenue and cost synergies consistent with our expectations at the time of those deals. We're monitoring these acquisitions carefully and supporting the management teams to ensure that we are generating a solid return on invested capital. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 4% to $679 million, while net income increased 19% to $179 million. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 20% to $1.08 for the second quarter 2020. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income and EPS is primarily the result of organic growth in the business, cost discipline, the impact of the timing shift of a $10 million expense related to annual long-term equity incentive grants and a decrease in acquisition-related costs. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release. We are pleased with our operating results, particularly in light of the impact from COVID-19. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 1.1% for the second quarter of 2020. This growth was driven by positive results in our Insurance segment, offset in part by modest declines in Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services. Normalizing for the $8 million revenue impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions, revenue grew 2.4%. As we detailed last quarter and Scott mentioned in his prepared remarks, we completed a careful review of our solutions and services to evaluate the potential exposure to COVID-19 impacts. Through that exercise, we noted that we did not expect to see any material impact from COVID-19 on approximately 85% of our consolidated revenues because they were generally subscriptions or subject to long-term contracts. As such, in the second quarter, those revenues grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis when normalized for the injunction. This speaks to the stability of our subscription business model. Moreover, as we expected, we did experience a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or 15% of our consolidated revenues. These revenues declined approximately 20% on an organic constant currency basis during the second quarter, owing to weakness in the underlying causal factors, including lower auto and travel insurance activity, the inability to enter commercial buildings to perform engineering analysis, decreased capital expenditures in the Energy sector and reduced levels of advertising spending and project-based work from the banks. While we did experience revenue declines in this group of products and services in each month of the quarter, as the underlying causal impacts began to diminish, we did see some of the pressure on our revenues abate. For example, we have seen trends improve sequentially in our auto insurance lines as driving mileage has recovered and are also experiencing improvement in our commercial surveys, as our field staff is now allowed to enter buildings. On the Energy side, the macro backdrop continues to pressure consulting, but trends seem to have stabilized, and we are starting to have early discussions with the strongest operators about future engagements. The net result is that we have experienced continued progress in sequential revenue improvement throughout the second quarter and into July. Despite the impact on revenue in the second quarter, we are pleased to report that we maintained strong EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense and headcount management. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 12.4% in the second quarter, and normalizing for the impact of the injunction and the LTI timing shift, organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA increased 11.6%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA was 51.3% in the quarter. This margin included a one-time benefit of approximately 150 basis points from the previously communicated timing shift of annual LTI grants. Despite the expense control driving EBITDA growth and margin improvement, we continue to invest substantially in our business and infrastructure, including our cloud transition, and those costs are reflected in this margin as well. On that note, let's return - let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 2.5% growth, while our adjusted EBITDA increased 13.8% for the quarter. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions and repair cost estimating solutions, offset by the impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions and a decline in certain transactional revenue that was negatively impacted by COVID-19. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction and LTI timing, Insurance would have achieved 4.3% organic constant currency revenue growth and 13.8% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines and investment in our breakout areas. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 2.8% in the second quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and lower events revenues across the Energy segment. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms, environmental health and safety service solutions and weather analytic solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the must-have nature of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the Energy transition practice and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Despite the revenue declines and normalized for the LTI timing, adjusted EBITDA grew 2.4% in the second quarter, driven by strong operational controls and modest actions taken to reduce headcount to be more balanced with the current level of consulting work. Financial Services revenue declined 2.7%, owing to weakness in project-based retained analytics and spend-informed analytics, as our bank customers reduced spending due to the pandemic. Despite decreased spending across the banking industry, we experienced growth in our subscription businesses, an area that has been a strategic focus for us over the last six quarters. Normalizing for the LTI timing, organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA remained flat for the quarter, while margins declined owing to portfolio actions we closed earlier in the year. Our reported effective tax rate was 20.4% for the quarter compared to 19.7% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we now believe that our full-year tax rate for 2020 will be between 21% and 23%, up from the 19% to 21% range we had previously provided. This is primarily the result of UK legislation that was enacted in July, but retroactive back to April 1st of 2020, that increases the UK corporate tax rate from 17% to 19%. As a result, we will take a one-time catch-up charge in the third quarter of this year related to the valuation of a deferred tax liability, which will likely drive the quarterly rate above the full-year range provided, but we do not anticipate a material long-term impact from this increase. Adjusted net income was $213 million, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.29 for the second quarter, up 15.8% and 17.3% from the prior year respectively. These increase reflect the cost discipline in the business, lower travel and entertainment expenses, contributions from acquisitions, the above-mentioned timing shift in expense related to annual long-term equity incentive grants and lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $250 million for the quarter, up 24.6% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $57 million for the quarter, up 20.9% from the prior year period, and CapEx represented 8.4% of total revenues in the quarter. We now believe that CapEx in 2020 will likely be toward the higher end of our previously provided range of $250 million to $270 million, as investing in our business and our people continues to be among our highest priorities. Related to CapEx, we now expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $185 million to $195 million higher than the prior provided range of $170 million to $180 million. This increase is related to the timing of implementation of certain internally developed software projects as we continue to push forward on introducing innovation to the marketplace. We continue to expect intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020. Free cash flow was $193 million for the quarter, an increase of 25.7% from the prior year, primarily due to an increase in customer collections and operating profit, a reduction in travel and entertainment expense as a result of COVID-19, as well as the deferral of federal income taxes and certain employer payroll taxes resulting from the CARES Act, partially offset by earn-out payments of $65 million. During the second quarter, we returned $119 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.27 per share dividend for the third quarter to be paid in September. As we detailed last quarter, we continue to believe that the collective causal factors from COVID-19 represent pressure on achieving our 7% long-term growth objective in 2020. However, we do not think they represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience in recovery. Each of these causal factors has its own recovery curve, making it difficult to predict the duration of the impacts to our revenue growth. We continue to have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively and deliver operating leverage, while also continuing to invest in our innovation agenda. While we have restricted headcount growth in the shorter-term, we will pace new hiring as we see a return to a more normalized operating environment. Taking this altogether, we continue to believe that the stability of our subscription revenues along with our core operating leverage, driven by the responsiveness of our compensation structure and cost discipline will continue to support revenue and EBITDA growth in 2020. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. We ask for the Q&A session that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And with that, I will ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Manav Patnaik: I just wanted to focus firstly just on the Energy and Specialized Markets segment. Last quarter you gave us some anecdotal commentary on the different mix between upstream and renewables so on and so forth. I was just wondering, if you could just give us some color on how each of those are doing within that business?
Scott Stephenson: Neal, would you like to speak to that?
Neal Anderson: Yes, sure, certainly, Scott. First thing is we're very, very pleased in terms of our subscription business, how robust that business has been. And as Scott and Lee mentioned, it grew through the second quarter. Whilst we had, as we predicted on the transactional, both the consulting and the event side, that was more of a challenge. When we look at the Wood Mackenzie in the Energy Specialized business, it's a fundamentally different business than it was four years or five years ago at the time of the acquisition. At that time, the majority of our revenue was more exposed to the upstream side. Today, that, that part of the business is less than 50% of our business. Just as Scott mentioned, we're much more focused on the Energy transition and all the key growth areas, which will drive the business in the longer-term.
Manav Patnaik: And Scott, just the other question I had is, you've been talking a lot about software being an increased focus for you guys at Verisk. And I was just wondering, is there a way to quantify like how much as a percentage of your business software is today, and if that's just an Insurance phenomena or is it across Energy and Financial as well? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: It's definitely a committed part of our strategy, Manav, in all parts of our business and it is a growing part of the mix. What we talk about all the time at Verisk is the best expression of what we can do for our customers is to provide them platform to analytic environments and great, what we call analytic objects. And the mix of both of those things inside of all of what we do is increasing and it is - and it is a strong focal point. You get kind of an interesting thing if you're trying to parse your revenue streams, taking energy as an example. So Lens is our platform. Moving through that platform is content that customers - some of what moves through that platform is content that customers have made use of through time. And so if we talk about sort of where the - where the revenue stream is headed and growing, it's a little bit artificial to parse how much of that you're attributing to the software that you generated versus the sort of the total platform and the value that the customers find in it. But definitely, software is a growing part of our mix and it's meaningful in all of the verticals.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Toni Kaplan: Wanted to start out with the margins, really strong quarter there expanding - EBITDA margins expanding 470 basis points. I know you attributed about 150 basis points to the LTI shift. But wanted to ask if it's fair to say that the remainder is coming from lower variable comp and T&E, and should that come back once this period is over or is there some level of permanent savings that we should be expecting to remain?
Scott Stephenson: Lee, would you start with that question, please?
Lee Shavel: Sure, absolutely. Thank you, Toni. So, I think your observation, I agree with Toni, I would say once you eliminate the LTI impact, as we've indicated about 150 basis points and then look at, as I typically described at the businesses on a pre-investment basis, we are still seeing strong margin improvement across the three businesses. And to give you some kind of some sense of the overall contribution in the margin, the reduction in T&E was approximately 150 basis points and the short-term kind of the compensation impact was about 100 basis points. So naturally, that's a function of the growth impact that it relates to the overall improvement. So we are having kind of the, what you might describe as the COVID-19 impact on our cost structure that is benefiting us in that period. But there are efficiencies that we are - have identified that I think will enhance our operating leverage ahead. Some of that it relates to the nature of our sales function and the sales productivity. We don't expect to be in this completely remote format for an extended period of time, but we have found potential efficiencies that may improve the margin on a longer-term basis. So I think there are some structural elements that we've identified that will persist, but clearly a significant part of this margin improvement is a function of the responsiveness of our cost structure and the actions that we've taken to manage headcount. So it's as always, a blend of a lot of different factors that are influencing margin.
Scott Stephenson: I would just add, Toni, one item that you didn't have in the ones that you - the factors which you highlighted is the increasing efficiency of our technical infrastructure. So we have been over the last couple of years as many know working to rotate to the cloud, as well as upgrading the data fabric inside of our analytics, and that continues. And as we move forward, the unit cost economics is associated with our technical infrastructure do improve and that's happening now and will continue to happen.
Toni Kaplan: And wanted to ask about the 15% of the business that's non-subscription that you said dropped 20% in the quarter. It sounds like your business overall is improving. Just wanted to find out if where that 20% would be sort of in the July timeframe, what that looks like, and which segments saw the greatest declines in the non-sub side? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: So we - at our call in May, we actually parsed for you the relative impact. We allocated the 20% across the three reporting verticals. I mean, generally, I would say that the sort of the recovery is being felt relatively evenly across the three verticals. We have noted in July even some positives in each of the three verticals. The one that I - personally I'm going to watch the closest is the recovery in sort of ad spending and how that relates to our revenues on the spend-informed analytics side in Verisk Financial, but as I say, all three verticals are showing that same upward movement.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Hamzah Mazari: My first question is just on the Insurance segment. As it relates to COVID-19, I know it's a fluid situation, but if P&C insurance companies are on the hook for COVID claims, maybe you could walk us through what you're hearing there, how it impacts your business? A couple of years ago, customer consolidation was a headwind. Claims tend to be good for you. And so I'm just trying to parse out how you think about that, just the puts and takes there?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. You actually had several points in there. Let me begin and then Mark, if you'd like to add anything. Specific to the idea of claims as they relate to the business interruption line of insurance, our view is - and we come from a very informed place because we actually author the contract language that goes into the policy is that it's really pretty clear that unless otherwise explicitly stated, and generally it's not explicitly stated, that business interruption insurance does not cover losses related to pandemics. And that's not to say that there won't be some court cases, maybe businesses which have taken out business interruption insurance naturally would like to be covered. But in reality, if you read the language carefully, our reading is that it's pretty clear. So we don't think that there is some substantial discontinuous event that's going to happen for our customers as a function of COVID-19 and claims related to business interruption. It is true that, that activity inside the insurance industry is a positive for us. The insurance companies remained quite active in the second quarter will remain quite active. Our customer demography actually doesn't change very much with the exception that as the InsurTechs come into being, we actually do very well with them. But the existing insurance companies, they really has - the pace of consolidation really is not all that great. And we don't see anything in the - in this moment that would stimulate that to higher rates. Mark, anything you want to add to that?
Mark Anquillare: Yes, I think I would just highlight or echo a couple of things you said. I think the language that we use in our programs have pretty clear - clearly states that the effort around pandemic or the situation around pandemic will not affect the property, and the property is really what's the key to coverage. There are other programs out there, especially on the reinsurance side, where some of this business interruption and the effects of pandemic will be invoked. So I think some programs, some insurers will have some payments to make and it's could be quite sizable. I think the other thing that kind of factors into the insurance economics is the commercial lines premium. I think what we're going to see probably in 2020 is a combination of exposures and premiums down 5% to 6%. We do believe from a forecast perspective that those rates, the actual premium rate itself, as well as the exposures will rebound in 2021, so that may affect some insurers. I think overall, we don't see that as something that is systematically problematic. I think during these times, insurers look to focus on underwriting discipline and a lot of the actuarial and underwriting solutions we provide them, what I'll refer to is that grounding. So hopefully, that provides color.
Hamzah Mazari: Thank you. My follow-up question is just around your commercial sales organization. We've talked about investing in software. We've been in an elevated investment spend cycle as it relates to CapEx on new products, et cetera. Financial Services, there have been some changes in restructuring. Have you changed sort of the commercial sales organization structure at all as it relates to either compensation or how it's structured from a vertical standpoint or has it been just pretty consistent over the last several years?
Scott Stephenson: The go-to-market teams are specific to the three verticals, and even within that, we have a multi-tier approach where we have account representation, as well as product specialists. The way that we take our products to market has not changed. What we sell is complex. Our products need to be explained. They need to be demonstrated. Very frequently, there have to be proofs-of-concept, followed by trials before we get to enterprise-wide agreements. So it's a process that takes time. We're good at it. We've done it for a long time, and we continue to do it the way that we have done it in the past. We're always open to and actually even interested to add teammates, who as the solution set expands, can take them to market and help customers find the value but in terms of the sort of the general approach, no. We've done it successfully for a long time and we're not going to fiddle with our successful model.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is now open.
Alex Kramm: First one is a follow-up to Toni's question when she asked about kind of what you saw during the quarter. And can you be a little bit more specific maybe on that 20%, how it trended in April, May, June and maybe even into July, so we can just see the trajectory? And if there's any incremental color you can give what areas you think will improve over the course of the year? I guess, trying to get to the trajectory a little bit, any help you can give us would be helpful?
Scott Stephenson: Lee, anything you want to add to your comments in the upfront part of the meeting?
Lee Shavel: Sure. Yes, thanks, Alex. So we're not going to get into kind of monthly results, but what I will reinforce is that within the segments, we saw the underlying causal impacts improve. And so, perhaps this is helpful, for instance, in Insurance, as we saw that driving activity begin to kick in that, that clearly had a positive impact. And so across the quarter for the COVID-sensitive revenues, that 15%, we saw sequential improvement across the quarter and that improvement continued into July. Obviously, we're continuing to deal with a lot of uncertainty in terms of the impact across the country and how that impacts overall driving activity, but at least through July, we saw a continued trend of improvement on that front. Within Energy and Specialized Markets, we also saw a - an improvement through the quarter and we are beginning to see some signs of re-engagement around the consulting side of the equation. I do think that with that component, there is going to be a longer-term or I should say a longer period in which that recovers, as the timing of the response from our Energy clients is going to follow the CapEx trend a little bit more closely in comparison to the driving activity, where we're seeing that rebound more quickly. So I think if you think about the timing of that recover - recovery, we are expecting that, that will take a little bit longer, but into July, we were beginning to see improvements. And then finally in our Financial Services business, a lot of this relates to, it's kind of a blend of two dimensions. One is the advertising component, which is down, but is showing recovery, and so that's more like the auto activity. But we also have the project analytics and the retained analytics from the banks that probably have a somewhat slower recovery result as a - in response to the COVID-19. So those are some of the factors, but within each of those categories, there are multiple products with different degrees of severity, but across them all, we did see improvement through the second quarter and have seen a continuation of that into July. And that's probably as much textures I can give you, Alex.
Alex Kramm: No, that's good texture. Thank you. A similar question maybe on the subscription side. You mentioned the sales cycles are lengthening, not surprising. Any kind of dimensions you can put around that? And maybe related to that, how is the pipeline looking today versus maybe a quarter ago?
Lee Shavel: Yes.
Scott Stephenson: Pipeline is good. Go ahead, Lee. Go ahead.
Lee Shavel: Sure. Sorry. Yes, so, Alex, it - you have - I would just describe it generally as a lengthening and so that can vary depending upon the project, again factoring in that we have a lot of different projects with different lead times, it's probably not useful to generalize across that. But we are seeing - what has been described by the salesforce as getting all of the stakeholders together with the disruptions is taking a little longer to get that done. So that's what I would call kind of the back-end of the pipeline closest to contract. However, at the front-end of the pipeline, as indicated by the increase in the sales calls, our engagement with clients, we're actually seeing a fairly healthy level of engagement on that front, I think because of the accessibility and the demand for our products. So we feel very good about what we've been able to generate from a pipeline perspective despite the disruptions. And I think that feeds into a longer-term perspective, meaning, as Scott indicated, we believe that in many ways, the pressures - the operating pressures that COVID-19 has put on our client sets within all of the verticals recommends and encourages more utilization of our product sets and analytic platforms to support what they do. There is more pressure on them to digitize more aspects of their operations, and we think that's very constructive for the long-term opportunity within Verisk and why we feel confident our growth drivers remain certainly not diminished, but probably enhanced as a result of what people - of what our clients have to react to.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
David Chu: This is David Chu for Gary. Just wondering, is there a lag effect to the 85% that is subscription. So just wondering, if net new sales is trending below the 6.5% organic that you mentioned?
Scott Stephenson: Well, the nature of the subscription business that we have, first of all, a lot of that is multi-year, and multi-year agreements feature price escalators year-over-year. A good fraction of it also is perpetually renewing, particularly as it relates to sort of the traditional rules, forms and loss costs that we provide in the Insurance vertical. So there is actually - there is a great deal of not just stability, but actually momentum associated with the 85% because of the way that we contract with our customers. And so when we talk about sales cycles, we're really talking about the cross-selling of a solution which hasn't been used by a customer in the past or a brand-new solution into the marketplace. And I think, Lee, was really taking pains to try to describe that our - we're going to move with our customers and - at the rate that, that they want to move. And I think he put his finger on exactly the right issue, which is just - it's a big decision when customers decide to subscribe to one or more of our solutions. These are high-ticket items. And it's not as if - it's not as if the consideration has fundamentally changed from - we're thinking about it in the year 2020 to like, don't even talk to me about it until the year 2021. It's much more just them having found their feet underneath them in the COVID moment. And now as they try to organize to make what is a material decision to buy one of our solutions, they just have to pull themselves together basically. But it's not as if the fundamental decision matrix for them has changed. The value - the value proposition is the same. And this relates to the emergence or the cross-sell than it does to the thing which is already established. And again, there is momentum inside of an exist - most existing subscription contracts because they are multi-year and they do have price escalators.
David Chu: And just has implementation of new products have been an issue in this work-from-home environment?
Scott Stephenson: Not at all.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird. Your line is now open.
Jeff Meuler: Scott, when you - in your prepared remarks, when you talked about the long-term benefits to Verisk of the digital transformation of your customers, you've talked not only about there - them being more desirous to use your solutions, but also their capabilities to consume what you provide. I guess just that on a capability point, how much of a barrier is that today? And maybe if you could illustrate the point with how it - how it's different to your business with one of the InsurTechs that you do well with or with a traditional carrier that's further along with their digital transformation?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So actually, I like the way you framed the question, Jeff, because I'm going to generalize a point here and that is that as I observed some of the InsurTechs which are kind of borne from whole cloth and essentially platforms into more - a more modern infrastructure. They are borne with a more modern infrastructure. I find their rate of adoption to be really high. And so it actually is a demonstration of what we're talking about here. Those who are more naturally able to connect to, to integrate, to consume from inside of an API to render content from the outside into their own environment quickly or even more importantly, to actually plant a platforms analytic environment right in the middle of their workflows, a company which is in that condition is able to consume the next thing from us just that much more easily. And as - really, I think there really is - there really is an observation there about the relative ease with which some of the InsurTechs are able to begin to work with what we provide them. And what it comes down to fundamentally is that, they have their own backlog of technology-oriented projects that they have - that they have to work through. And sometimes, one of those technology-oriented projects might be them doing whatever it is that they need to do in their environment in order to adopt one of our solutions. We've seen this many, many times over in much of what we do actually. And to the extent that they are actually able - they're more - they're more naturally digital, they'll be able to work through these kinds of implementations that much faster. And so I don't think it - I don't think that it - the - when they do their own ROI calculation on making use of one of our solutions, their cost of implementation in most cases is - there is something there, but it really isn't going to make the difference in terms of whether or not to make use of our solutions. Maybe with some of our thickest platforms that might be there a little bit more. So my point here is that the fundamental interest in making more use of what it is that we do, the ease of implementation is a part of it, but also as they become more analytic in the way that they make their own decision-making, the value of the content that we bring just stands up that much taller. And so there is also something about their own analytic environment and the quality of their analytic environment. And so at the intersection of I can get you implemented faster and I can make more use of this unique perspective that you've got Verisk. The value proposition just stands up even higher.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas of William Blair. Your line is now open.
Andrew Nicholas: It looks like at a geographic level, growth in the US was a bit stronger than international in the quarter. I'm assuming that's primarily a function of business mix and secondarily, exposure to transactional revenue. But I was wondering, if there is anything else to call out in terms of regional growth differences in the period?
Scott Stephenson: No, I mean, I think you really caught it inside of your question. As many folks know, we're excited about the growth of our international business. And we have - we have a variety of ways that we try to grow our international business. And in the early stages of developing a market, one of the things that's kind of a natural feature of our businesses that some of it may be more transactional in the early going. Customers when they are getting used to a new solution often want to start out in the transactional mode and/or it's just that much faster in terms of getting established with the customer. With time what we've generally found is customers would prefer to move towards a subscription model, where they have certainty about what they're going to be paying for what they get, but that's not always the case when they get started. So international being a newer part of our mix overall, it's not surprising that in this unique moment, there might have been a little bit of a difference there. Don't expect that to relate to the long-term growth picture.
Andrew Nicholas: And then I was hoping you could provide an update on your relationship with Vexcel, how that partnership has performed this year relative to your expectations? And as it stands today, if you could just evaluate or speak to your evaluation of how those capabilities and that functionality is replacing Geomni?
Scott Stephenson: Sure. Mark is one of our two Board members at Vexcel. So, Mark, would you take that on, please?
Mark Anquillare: Yes, absolutely. So what we attempted to do and I think pretty successfully is separate what is image capture, where we thought there was about opportunity to scale and provide what I'll refer to as greater coverage by combining the two companies. So if I was to think about that as job one, the combination of what I'll refer to as the Geomni image capture and Vexcel image capture has quite considerably increased the coverage in the United States. That is a combination of all of North America, U.S. and Canada, but it also has two different types of coverage, kind of that high up across the landscape and then that more higher resolution five - North-South-East-West views of things. What we're also being able to do is start to extend geographically. So now we have access to imagery across Europe and in certain parts of Asia-Pacific. So there we have opportunities to leverage that analytic, and I think we've been quite successful. On the Geomni front, where we're continuing to be focused on advanced analytics, a, we have more data to work with, so our algorithms, our machine is better and improved, and, of course, because we have more coverage, we can provide more analytic across various places. So let me give you an example. We now have the ability to take some of the weather analytics we have, put it on top of all this imagery and provide kind of a triage tool for analytic purposes and that's not just in the United States, but we can go throughout the world where we have that coverage. So I hope that provides you a little bit of color, the combination of leverage in getting access to all those images, we still have that from a Geomni perspective, and I think at Vexcel because they're doing it once instead of twice, there's a lot of scale and leverage there, so they're doing it cheaper.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Andrew Steinerman: Lee, I was wondering if you'd be willing to comment if Verisk expects company EBITDA margins to be up year-over-year just directionally, up year-over-year directionally in the second half of the year, and what puts and takes you might want to be willing to call out in terms of things that would affect the EBITDA margins in the second half of this year?
Lee Shavel: Andrew, thanks for the question. As you know, we don't provide forward-looking statements on the results. We're constantly looking to make certain that the operating leverage that we have in the business is expressed, and we certainly think that this quarter demonstrates the underlying operating leverage and our ability to manage that. So certainly, in this case, it's I think a very important differentiation period for us as we are dealing with some of the revenue impacts, but it shows one kind of the responsiveness of the cost structure, our ability to manage headcount growth in order to control growth in expenses, as well as achieve operating leverage through each of the businesses. So our focus is on managing the operations and expense business to deliver that operating leverage, and we're constantly working to achieve improvement of that over on a year-over-year basis.
Andrew Steinerman: And some of the expenses that were held back in the second quarter, will they naturally come back in the second half of the year like, could you just highlight what you expect in terms of what types of expenses to come back?
Lee Shavel: So, I mean, I talked about this earlier, Andrew. So we have - there are two primary elements that I think are influencing the margin, excluding the LTI impact, but T&E is down materially as a result of COVID-19. So as the impact of that abates as we begin to engage in a more normalized environment, you're going to expect that some of that will come back. I referred earlier to the fact that we will probably try to hold on to some of the efficiencies in part, but there is no substitute to being in front of the clients in person, but we're going to follow the clients in that regard. And then the second element is compensation, and two pieces of that, one, which is our incentive compensation which is tied to growth, and so that is going to be impacted by our revenue growth and our earnings growth impacts. But the second element is our headcount growth, and there we are managing that to be appropriate and consistent with the revenue growth impacts, so that we can maintain that operating leverage. Those are the primary expense elements that I think are in flux in the second quarter. And you can certainly expect we will continue to be influenced by COVID-19 and our active management of that cost structure in the second half of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Bill Warmington: Good morning, everyone. So CoreLogic going to [Marshall Swift/Boeckh], which competes with exactly in the residential property space MSPs towards the more weighted in the underwriting and exactly what we claimed. A couple of weeks ago, CoreLogic announced a lot of fanfare the competitive takeaway of Swift/Boeckh. How big a threat is CoreLogic's new property insurance solution in a way, is it a change in the competitive landscape?
Scott Stephenson: Mark, do you want to start with that one?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So let me just remind you, Marshall effect is a tool used to understand the replacement cost value to understand the cost you have on your home. So what's the replacement value, what CoreLogic also has, it's a tool called stability which they acquired a couple of years ago. These tools have been in the market for decades. I don't see or we haven't seen any material investment too clearly because Symbility is now part of CoreLogic they've talked about the two combined. I would tell you that we continue to closely monitor all of our wins and losses. We are on it every single month. We understand where the incumbent and there's a break-off. We understand where there is an incumbent. We do this beyond CoreLogic's only not be overly specific here. But what I will tell you as we continue to win much more frequently than we lose and that's the story that we have been kind of on. We’re probably five years now, I think we've been trying to share that at various Investor Days and I think the message and the direction remains very similar. So I think we're pleased with our competitive advantages, I think we're very pleased with where we are in the market. And I don't want to address the specific customer, but I'm not aware of that particular situation now.
Bill Warmington: And then a follow-up on LightSpeed I wanted to ask whether COVID-19 has impacted the usage and the adoption of the product?
Scott Stephenson: I'm sorry, LightSpeed was your question Bill?
Bill Warmington: LightSpeed, the POS system.
Mark Anquillare: So Scott, you want me to continue?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, please continue.
Mark Anquillare: So, let me remind you LightSpeed is our tool by which we're taking a lot of information and data and moving it forward in the underwriting process. Hopefully over time eliminating the separation between what is the quote and then separately binding later on. We want to make that one process upfront, season quote in buying with confidence. And we're bringing in both our data, third-party data and scoring in such a way that you have confidence in that information. And that has been quite a bit - we’re seeing quite a bit of success, both on the personal lines and now moving into the commercial line side of things. So the one point I'll make is back to Lee’s comments earlier during the middle of the COVID there was less driving. At the same time, I think many personal auto policyholders were kind of waiting for maybe their refunds from insurers. So there was less shopping, there was less people going online and seeing if they can get better quote. So we did see some decreased volumes, but as Lee described, we've seen that slowly return as driving has increased. So hopefully that's responsive to your question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
George Tong: After normalizing for the LTIs shift, your EBITDA margins expanded much more materially in your Insurance segment than your Energy and Financial Services segment. Can you elaborate on what drove that relative outperformance if it was related to be amount of investment spending in the other segments or other one-time cost actions impacting the insurance segment more?
Scott Stephenson: Lee would you take that please?
Lee Shavel: Yes, George one element that I think is a significant contributor to the insurance margin specifically that is probably - the largest factor is that as a result of the Vexcel transaction. We have been able as we've talked about in the past of reducing the expenses associated with that activity. And so that is - part of that margin improvement or a large part of that margin improvement not solely related to it is a function of that expense reduction specific to insurance. That being said, we still saw a very solid margin expansion even absent that effect within the business, but that probably is the significant element of the differentiation.
Scott Stephenson: George, are you still there?
George Tong: Yes, thank you. Turning to the Financial Services segment when you divested the Argus Data Warehousing business, the underlying growth rate for the segment improved pretty meaningfully to the 5% to 7% range before COVID. I guess I'm surprised to see organic constant currency growth down as much it is - as it is. Can you help unpack why Financial Services revenue declined as much as it did, especially given how you indicated that of the 20% of non-sub revenues impacted by COVID only 3% and some financial services?
Scott Stephenson: Yes so, George let me - so keeping in mind put that 3% in the context of financial services as a percentage of our total overall revenue. And so on a proportional basis it's a - that transactional element is a larger element relative to the other businesses. And so, if you take that and you recognize that we've had consulting impacts with regard to the retained analytics and the project analytics that had impacted that's kind of a similar effect of what we've seen in energy on the consulting business, that's one dimension. And then we also have the pullback in advertising and so when our spent informed analytics business, the lower level of advertising is having a primary causal impact from COVID-19. So both of those are influencing the revenue growth and there is a higher concentration of that COVID-19 sensitivity to overall revenues that is resulting in a bigger revenue impact in comparison to the others.
Operator: No further questions from the phone line. Presenters you may continue.
Scott Stephenson: Okay, well thank you everybody for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your interest, your questions, we'll be following up with many of you. And so, I appreciate your time today. Have a great rest of the day. Bye for now.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-06 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Verisk First Quarter 2020 Earning Result Conference Call. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar. Please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, operator. And good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2020 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer who will provide a brief overview of our business. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer, will then provide an update on our Insurance segment. Lastly, Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days. On our website and by dial in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance, including but not limited to the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. And good morning, everyone. I'm very glad to be together. Today we are in the midst of a challenge that is impacting each one of us. The outbreak of the Coronavirus is above all, a health crisis. And we hope that you and your families are doing what is necessary to stay safe. Our thoughts and prayers go out to those who have been directly affected by the virus and to the healthcare community and essential personnel working heroically to help us all overcome it. Today, I'm pleased to discuss how Verisk has responded to the COVID-19 event and give you a view of our plans and priorities for the company. I have really been looking forward to this meeting. Along with Mark and Lee we will describe for you three things. First, our actions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, with a focus on protecting our employees and serving our customers. Second, an update on our current operations and the role we are playing to help our customers and communities navigate COVID-19. And third, our long-term priorities and plans for Verisk. Given our presence in Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore, the COVID-19 event began for us in January. Our global crisis management team immediately began pandemic planning under our business continuity policy under the strong leadership of our Asia Pacific team we followed government guidance and moved into a remote work mode with zero interruption in delivery for our customers. When local guidance modified, we move to a hybrid mode with teams making use of our facilities. On an every other day basis in order to keep density down, again movement into this work mode with seamless. When a second wave of infection appeared in Singapore, we successfully returned to the remote mode. All of this experience was invaluable as January turned to February to March, and it became clear that the Coronavirus was not a regional but a global event. Combining our experience in Asia Pacific, with our longstanding plans for ensuring business continuity we engaged in large scale, pressure testing of our remote work capabilities in North America, Europe and India and we did this weeks in advance of any government restrictions on movement. I was pleased, but not surprised at the result. We moved our roughly 9,000 colleagues into a full remote mode with no interruption of operations or service to our customers. We remain in that mode today. Our primary goal was and continues to be the safety of our colleagues. Because of the essentially digital nature of what we do and our strong movement towards enabling technologies such as cloud computing, we knew that we could protect the well-being of our team without sacrificing service to our customers. An interesting fact about Verisk is that only about 100 people or roughly 1% of the team have a specific and regular need to enter our facilities. Despite the increased need to communicate digitally with one another and customers, our computing and network capacity have consistently and comfortably exceeded what we require. To highlight the relative ease of the transition, one of the more custom responses to the COVID event has involved our software developers and data scientists. In the office, they are accustomed to having two, sometimes three large monitors running simultaneously at their workstations. Lacking these at home, we arranged to have the equipment sent to their residences to help these valuable colleagues remain productive. While we look forward to all being together again in our offices, our business continuity planning and the nature of our operations enable us to continue to serve our customers and drive our innovation agenda forward in a work-from-home mode, while also flexibly following the lead of government officials about when it is safe to return. We have also significantly increased communication with daily updates to our global workforce, which we call The Daily Dose. We have held frequent worldwide town halls [ph] and have provided the team access to our COVID-19 Resource Center, which updates teammates with our leading research on the pandemic, as well as helpful personal advice on staying healthy and productive. Finally, we began by holding daily meetings of our global executive team and have modified that rhythm as the stability of our operations has been clear. We are now holding regular update calls with our executive team as well as with our Board of Directors. That's the journey we've been on up to this moment, so where do we stand? First, our teams remain highly active and productive. Sales calls are up versus prior years. Email traffic is greater than it was prior to remote work. The use of collaborative digital platforms has increased substantially. And from a pulse survey of just a week ago, employee engagement is actually up at this moment relative to our customary high levels. And our customers continue to engage with our Analytics and Insights as visits to our portals across our three segments have increased as well. Second, we've been active in bringing new value to our customers in the COVID-19 moment. In the insurance space, we have provided an innovative platform to claims departments, allowing them to settle claims and direct collaboration with the insured without requiring physical presence. We made this platform free of charge as a form of support and look forward it to become another subscription offering with high acceptance across the industry over time. Our pandemic model, a part of the AIR suite, has drawn intense interest and slices of the output from the model have been made available to customers again at no cost. In financial services, we have created a COVID-19 dashboard for our banking customers to help them see precisely the real-time changes in spending across industry categories, thereby helping them anticipate movement in the credit worthiness of their commercial customers. And in the energy vertical, through a hurry up six-week effort, our customers can now examine the vulnerability of their supply chains in light of a geographic analysis of where the virus has had its greatest impacts. I'm very proud of the work of all my teammates. Third, we've analyzed all our solutions and services to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our revenue streams. We have not identified any material impact of COVID-19 on approximately 85% of our revenues at this point, as much of these revenues are subscription in nature and subject to long-term contracts. We have also identified that COVID-19 is impacting about 5% of our people who have seen their work curtailed to some degree in the following categories. Our survey teams, which diligence the engineering features of commercial buildings for the purpose of supporting commercial property underwriting, have not been able to enter most commercial buildings during the lockdown. And even with repurposing their time, remain at the moment less than fully utilized. Our consulting teams across the company, and especially in the Energy vertical, has seen some reductions to their current and projected billable activities for the immediate term. And our team focused on supporting auto claims adjusters in the UK has seen claims volumes drop as fewer miles are driven in the lockdown period. Across these few places in the company where the macro environment has reduced the workloads, we are working to reallocate these resources to other growing areas of the business. When necessary, we are using a combination of four-day work weeks, moderate trimming of team size and a small amount of furloughing to keep the work and team in balance. And finally, we continue to make good sales progress as we have adjusted quickly to engaging digitally with our customers. The rate of sales closure has slowed modestly, though pipelines remain strong, implying that we could experience some timing effects measured in weeks to months for new sales. Despite the distractions of COVID-19, I want to note our ongoing focus and progress with the integration of several recent acquisitions. Including; Genscape, FAST, BuildFax and the 3E acquisitions; SAP's Content as a Service business. We are very pleased with the integration - We are pleased with the integration momentum, synergy realization and early business results we've achieved with these entities. Consistent with our expectations and supporting solid returns on the capital we've invested. For the balance of today's call, we will focus on our long-term priorities and plans for Verisk. Mark and Lee will take you through our view in detail, but let me paint the general picture for you. Our priorities for investing in our business and our people are unchanged, evidenced by our reiteration of our CapEx budget for the year. We are continuing to drive our innovation agenda and invest in our business, while also advancing on our move to the cloud. With respect to performance, we expect to realize the benefit of four key features of our resilient business model. First, continued growth in data sets and demand for analytics from our clients that remains unchanged in the long-term and continues to drive our performance. Second, a high proportion and broad diversification of subscription revenues that provide exceptional stability to our revenue. Third, operations that provides significant flexibility in managing our expenses. And fourth, strong free cash flow generation and access to capital, which enable us to continue to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders. On that topic, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a $0.27 per share dividend for the second quarter to be paid in June. Our business model has proven its resiliency in the past, delivering stable performance through the financial crisis and the last oil price shocks. We realize that no two events are the same, but we have confidence that we can deliver growth again through COVID-19. And while there may be some short-term headwinds to growth, we believe our performance will reflect our long-term goal of growing EBITDA faster than revenue. Finally, on a personal note, I sympathize with the small businesses that are unable to operate during these challenging times, and every one of our customers in this situation can expect the full support of our company. I also feel extremely fortunate to be a part of Verisk's business model. Now, I will turn the call over to Mark to walk you through developments in our Insurance vertical.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. I'm pleased to share with you that we had another strong quarter in Insurance with all businesses contributing to growth. Despite some reduced volumes in March due to the pandemic, organic constant currency revenue growth was 5.9%. After normalizing for the continued impact of the injunction on our roof measurement solutions organic constant currency growth was 6.9% yield by market [indiscernible] innovation enhanced customer engagement. Across our insurance businesses, our retention rates remain very high and we have seen increased customer engagement during these unique times. Our customers have effectively transitioned to working from home and are more available and open to calls and product demos. Since March, 15th, we've seen customer call reports grow significantly from 2019 levels and realized a surge in participants at our virtual industry events, focused on business interruption coverage, broad during the pandemic, virtual claims handling and virtual property underwriting. The effectiveness of our team is essential in maintaining great service to our customers. Our knowledge-based solutions allow us to service customers remotely and with continuity. Our cloud-first approach has fostered a technical infrastructure that is available, scalable and resilient, allowing for uninterrupted service to customers as well as employees. As an example of our preparedness, we had a major customer perform a review of Verisk infrastructure to ensure that our ongoing technical support for their operations during these unique times. This feedback was extremely positive, with the customer sharing that Verisk was well prepared ahead of their own internal infrastructure, and filed several best practices that they plan to replicate. Let me share an industry perspective and its impact on our business. Insurance coverage remains essential through this pandemic. Insurance renewals continue. I would doubt any participants joining this call had thought about canceling their homeowners are on mobile insurance policies. However, driving is down significantly, our telematics data exchange indicates the driving mileage is down almost 50% year-over-year in the US since the pandemic breakout, leading to reduced auto claims. But we've seen a rebound in mileage in recent weeks, leading us to believe the bottom occurred in late March and early April. Some insurers have committed to premium refunds, which have contributed to a reduction in shopping for lower premiums by policyholders. Other areas of weakness in the industry include a significant drop in travel insurance and more modest declines in commercial insurance. Over the immediate term, total exposure values in commercial insurance may be reduced. Our Insurance business benefits from subscriptions and long-term contracts with a small portion of the revenue transactional. Although modest, we expect to see some adverse impact from the pandemic in certain of our transaction revenues. As I highlighted in my opening, customer engagement has been very strong. Let me share a few examples. We continue to see great success in market share gains in extreme event modeling as customers are moving towards an AIR suite of solutions. To support our customers, we have made our pandemic forecasting tool available for free to the insurance industry, as well as the general public to assist in planning and resiliency. As Scott mentioned in his opening, we made our virtual claims adjudication and virtual inspection platforms available for free to customers to stay in business and to facilitate the timely payment of insurance claims. Over 30,000 adjuster's inspectors now have access to the platform. Since rolling out the program in mid-March, more than 1,100 customers with many more users have enrolled. We have received very positive feedback from insurers, thanking us for our contribution to the industry. And last but certainly not least, we have received strong interest in our life insurance Analytic solutions. The FAST technology and strong leadership team, in combination with Verisk Advanced Analytics and reputation in the insurance industry, historically has created significant opportunities. We have signed noteworthy contracts with Amica, Lincoln Heritage, Pacific Life, M Financial and partnered with SCOR on our Life Analytics platform. I'm pleased with the strong early results, as evidence the synergies and strategic benefits. In a period of heightened security [ph] analytics are more important than ever. And further, with substantially increased remote operations, the connectivity we provide our client is critically valuable to our industry, supporting in turn the value of Verisk's business. With that, let me turn it over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Mark. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10% to $690 million on net income increased 28% to $172 million. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 28% to $1.4 for the first quarter 2020. The year-over-year increase in GAAP net income and EPS is primarily the result of organic growth in the business, gains from dispositions and a decrease in acquisition related costs. These increases were offset in part by the previously communicated timing shift of a $10 million expense related to annual long-term equity incentive grants that was recognized in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the second quarter in the prior year. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we believe our operating performance remains solid. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 5% for the first quarter of 2020. All three segments delivered growth with insurance posting the strongest growth rates. We did experience a decline in certain of our transactional revenues during the last two weeks of March related to COVID-19, though the impact on the first quarter results overall was modest. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.4% reflecting operating leverage, despite a headwind from the timing shift of annual LTI grants. Normalizing for the $4 million revenue impact of the injunction, revenue grew 5.8% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9% on an organic constant currency basis. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 46.1%, down 59 basis points from the prior year. Normalizing for the impact of the timing shift of annual LTI grants, however, total adjusted EBITDA margin would have expanded to 47.5%, demonstrating solid adjusted EBITDA margin expansion inclusive of continued investment in our breakout opportunities. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 5.9% revenue growth while adjusted EBITDA increased 8% for the quarter. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, claims analytics and repair cost estimating solutions, offset by the impact of the injunction on roof measurement solutions. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction, Insurance would have achieved 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth and 9.9% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, demonstrating margin expansion while also investing for future growth. Energy and specialized markets delivered revenue growth of 2.6% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.8% for the quarter, driven by increases in core research and the breakout areas like the energy transition practice and chemicals. We also saw increases in our environmental health and safety service revenues and weather analytics revenues. These increases were partially offset by declines in core consulting related to lower capital expenditures across the energy sector, as well as the completion of implementation projects in market and cost intelligence solutions, resulting from an exceptionally strong 2019 that reduced related transactional revenue. Financial services grew 3% and adjusted EBITDA increased 15.9% in the quarter, driven by growth in management information and regulatory reporting as well as fraud and credit risk, and offset in part by declines in portfolio management and spend-informed analytics revenues. Our reported effective tax rate was 20.8% for the quarter compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. We continue to believe that our tax rate for 2020 will be between 19% and 21%, though likely at the higher end of the range. There will likely be some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personal decisions. In addition, we are closely monitoring potential tax legislation in the UK, which could impact our future tax rates. Adjusted net income was $194 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.17 for the first quarter 2020, up 13.6% from the prior year. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $363 million for the quarter, down 1% from the prior period. Capital expenditures were $53 million for the quarter, up 17% from the prior-year period. CapEx represented 7.7% of total revenues in the quarter. We continue to believe that CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $270 million for 2020 as investing in our business and our people continues to be our highest priority. That said, certain expenditures related to real estate projects could be further delayed because of COVID-19 stay-at-home restrictions, but it is too early to quantify the impact if any. Free cash flow was $310 million for the quarter, a decrease of 3.5% from the prior-year period, primarily due to an increase in interest payments and the timing of certain customer collections and operating expense payments. In light of the current environment, we are monitoring our cash flow closely. And in that regard, year-to-date through the end of April, we have seen year-over-year growth in both cash receipts and cash flow after operational expenditures including CapEx. During the quarter, we returned $218 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and the Verisk Board of Directors has approved a cash dividend of $0.27 per share payable on June 30th, 2020. Moving from the results of the quarter to our broader exposure to COVID-19, I wanted to address a few key elements related to our financial performance. With regard to revenues, as Scott described, we have completed a careful review of our solutions and services to evaluate their potential exposure to COVID-19 impacts. Through that exercise, we have identified specific products and services, largely transactional in nature that are being impacted by COVID-19. Collectively, these solutions represent approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. And at the segment level, the 15% consists of approximately 8% in Insurance, 4% in Energy and specialized markets and 3% in Financial services. On the 15%, we have identified specific solutions and services that are being impacted to various degrees by primary causal factors. Including, lower auto and travel insurance activity, the inability to enter commercial buildings to perform engineering analysis, decreased capital expenditures in the energy sector and reduced levels of advertising by financial institutions and marketers. A portion of the revenue attributable to these solutions could be negatively impacted by COVID-19. The impact on many of these solutions is expected to be modest with the deepest impact felt in the categories of travel insurance analytics, auto underwriting and claims analytics, consulting services to the energy industry and spend-informed analytic solutions in financial services. Although, we experienced a decline in revenue attributable to these specific solutions in the last two weeks of March 2020, the impact on the first quarter was modest. We do not anticipate lasting impacts of a material nature to our long-term growth profile. And as the global outbreak of COVID-19 is still rapidly evolving, we will continue to monitor its impact on our business. It's important to understand that the aggregate 15% is not what we expect the impact on our revenues to be, but rather it is the portion of revenue that we believe could be affected by the causal factors generated by COVID-19. Two observations; this should not be surprising as it is primarily a subset of our total transactional revenues, which represent about 20% of our total revenues. Of the transactional revenues included in the identified 15%, it should be noted that they are diverse in the nature of their exposure and generally are expected to show strong resilience and recovery. In addition, it reinforces the stability of our subscription revenues that make up the bulk of the 85% of revenues for which we were unable to identify an exposure at this time. Of course, depending upon the duration of COVID-19, we may see new contract signing or renewal delays, but we view these as primarily timing issues. With regard to Energy and specialized markets, while it's natural to draw comparisons to Wood Mackenzie's experience during the significant oil price declines in 2016, it is important to understand both that one; Wood Mackenzie has reduced its exposure to the more oil price sensitive upstream oil companies through the growth of its energy transition practice, chemicals and other sub-segments, and has limited revenue contribution from the lower 48 US operators. Secondly, Wood MacKenzie represents a smaller percentage of our energy and Specialized Markets segment primarily as the result of our acquisition of PowerAdvocate, which primarily serves the utility sub-segment and our environmental health and safety business, which has limited commodity exposure. The collective causal factors from COVID-19 represent pressure on achieving our 7% long-term growth objectives in 2020, but we don't believe they represent any structural changes in our fundamental growth drivers or operating leverage that would limit our ability to return to delivering on the long-term growth expectations for the business. Moving to expenses; I want to emphasize our ability to manage the cost structure. First, our short-term incentive compensation is directly tied to revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth and will automatically reduce our expenses at lower growth rates. Second, we have already slowed our rate of headcount growth and we'll continue to manage headcount growth carefully through the COVID-19 event. With compensation representing approximately 70% of our cost base and headcount growth representing a meaningful component of expense growth, this discipline provides significant flexibility. Finally, we are reducing non-compensation expenses, including travel and entertainment event and other non-essential expenses. What we are not cutting is investment in the business. We will continue our target of $250 million to $270 million for capital expenditure in 2020 and we will continue to invest in our breakout solutions as they are fundamental to our growth and value creation opportunity. We also remain pleased, as Scott has described, with our integration progress on recent acquisitions, where our focus on realizing synergies and generating attractive returns remains undiminished. Factoring all of the above, on revenues and expenses, we recognize the challenges this environment presents. But we believe the stability of our subscription revenues, our core operating leverage and expense actions we are taking will continue to support our revenue and EBITDA growth in 2020. While the impact of COVID-19 on first quarter results was modest, the second quarter will bear a larger impact from the causal factors reflecting the more significant duration and effective COVID-19 for the period. As and when the causal factors diminish, we expect the impact to abate. From a capital and liquidity perspective, we continue to anticipate solid operating cash flow and capital generation from our business, we maintain access to our committed revolving credit line, with approximately $595 million in currently available capacity as well as access to the investment grade debt markets, and we have staggered maturities with no debt maturing until May, 2021. We expect to continue to manage our leverage within our typical 2 to 3 times range. We hope this provides some useful context for you and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks very much. Glad you guys are safe and well. I wanted to ask about the Energy business. I know in the past, I guess when the price of oil gets below a certain level and now it's in the 20s, I guess how much of an impact should we be expecting on the business? I know you mentioned you have less exposure to upstream now versus in 2015, '16, I think it was about 80% then. If you could give us the updated percent upstream now. But just I guess how can - like where can you see the impacts from this lower oil price? Can customers change their contracts during the subscription term or need to wait for renewal? Just any sort of color on the energy business would be helpful. Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: Yes, Toni. Thanks for the question and thanks for your well-wishes. And the same to you and to everybody who is with us on this call today. I hope everybody is safe and well. So, first of all, to your factual question. The percentage of WoodMac business that was upstream was roughly in the neighborhood of the number you just cited and now it's below 50%. The other thing that I would say is that, as Lee mentioned, we have really diversified the revenues associated with the Energy vertical. We do much more now with utilities, which are proving to be relatively stable and definitely relatively more stable than oil and gas companies are at the moment. The whole wing of our business, which is aimed at helping with the transition to the renewables is in very good shape. One part of the world that benefits from a low petroleum price is the petrochemicals business and that is also a material part of what we do so. So as you started, our business is actually different than it was the last time we went through an oil price shock.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Alex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. You mentioned the very modest impact in the last two weeks of March. Can you be a little bit more specific what you've seen so far in April? I think Mark mentioned something about the lower auto claims, which is pretty obvious, but I think that may have bottomed as you said. But any other things you can highlight, but maybe a little bit more specifically, how big the impact was in April so far. Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: Let me characterize generally and then Lee, let me come to you. So everything that we've said in our call today is a product of having examined very carefully what happened in April. So all of the statements that we've made here about our view of 2020 and what it is that we've done by way of preparation. April is fully in mind when we've made every one of those statements. Lee anything you want to add to that?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Alex, thanks for the question. It certainly is something that we're watching carefully and I think a couple of comments. One, I think it's important to understand that in the 15% of the of the impacted products, there is a lot of diversity in that, and so you have different products that are having different effects across that and that provides some stability within that. The second is that while we're looking at April, we also have to take into account kind of the temporal dynamic of the duration of COVID-19 and its impact over time. And so, we want to be - certainly, our expectation is that that impact is going to - is going to moderate over some period of time. So with all that being said, on the 15% that we identified we did see the expected decline - a partial decline in those revenues on a year-over-year basis in April and with fairly good degree of predictability. But in the non-COVID-19 revenues, we saw are more typical growth rates. And overall, as we indicated, we still saw growth in revenues across the business as a whole factoring those two elements in. So beyond that, we're not in a position to predict given the complexity, given the impact of the duration, but I think within April with that full impact, we saw that partial decline. But overall, we still maintain the growth in the revenues so far.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning. Hope you guys are safe and healthy as well. My question is on the international side of the Insurance segment. It feels like you've been doing some M&A there and essentially been utilizing software platforms to target customers. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about that strategy and how much of your business today is [indiscernible] software and any margin implications with regard to that?
Scott Stephenson: Mark, would you take that question please?
Mark Anquillare: Yes, thank you very much. So what we've been able to do in the United States is, over time, aggregate a huge amount of data to build out some unique and proprietary analytic objects, analytic solution. Inside of our international strategy, obviously we have this ambition as we always do to aggregate some unique data. But to do that we had to look towards solutions that can help us aggregate the data. So in some cases, we have some - I'll call it natural catastrophe or hazard type information that we can use and pull across that we've done and kind of replicated from what we've been successful at in the United States. At the same time, we found the best way to aggregate some information is really from a software angle. So with a goal towards - driving towards an analytic outcome and providing solutions that are analytic at the foundation, we have done two things. We started to aggregate data where we can and we've also taken a software approach to things that help us, for the most part, aggregate that same data. I think what we have found, to be honest, is inside the UK, there is more of a thirst for a solution set that is ecosystem - interconnected across a lot of solutions. I think that drives automation, that drives digital engagement. So our focus has been to try to take some software componentry, penetrate [ph] this ecosystem to help customers, and along the way, aggregate some data and with that data, build out an analytic outcome. It's kind of where you start and that's how we've gotten into the markets. And I think we've been very happy with the success and progress we've made, particularly in the UK. As you referenced, we have a little bit more of a beachhead there. We have certainly some more assets, and those assets have been working very closely together to integrate things that are related to data, underwriting workflow and cat modeling or what I'll call the both reinsurers and insurers. So, thanks for the question and I think your observation was accurate. Hopefully that gave a little color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, Scott. In your prepared remarks, you indicated Verisk is confident that we'll continue to deliver revenue growth during this COVID period. And then your next sentence highlighted that the company is targeting EBITDA growth faster than revenue. And I wondered - my question is; I wondered if we're supposed to link those two comments together or specifically, is the company targeting EBITDA growth faster than revenue growth during this COVID period, and if that dynamic is on a reported basis or just an organic EBITDA basis?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So thank you, Andrew, good to hear your voice. So first of all, you are correct that those two statements are intended to stand together. They are part of a full-thought in terms of our bottom-line performance. And we have been addressing ourselves in this call to COVID-19 effects, which more or less also correlates with statements about 2020. But the ambition in terms of the long-term also remains the same. And that is that we would have very healthy rates of organic revenue growth and we would have rates of organic EBITDA growth that exceed rates of organic revenue growth. So, we're stating once again what our long-term plan is. So, my comments were specific to 2020; the general point remains for our business over the long-term. And then lastly, to your question, we are talking about both organic and reported.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Andrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. In hearing from some of the insurtech players over the past couple of months, it certainly seems like they've seen increased demand in the new environment. I'm just wondering if your conversations with those partners have evolved at all of late and whether your view of the Group's long-term trajectory has changed as a consequence of recent activity. Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Mark, would you please take that question?
Mark Anquillare: Absolutely. So once again, I think we differentiate two types of insurtechs. There is an insurtech in that definition really relates to those that want to be insurers or managing general agents, [ph] so it's about distribution. And I think what we've seen there is those continue to prosper. At the same time, many of those early start-ups who have decided to actually be underwriters are actually carrier risk. Sometimes those, I'll call it loss ratios, have been a little higher. The combined ratio it has not been as profitable. So, we think they will continue, but we have seen some pressure because all of a sudden it becomes a focus on liquidity and maybe a turning to profitability a little bit sooner. So, we are watching our insurtech customers and we are trying to help them out with everything we can. And I think it's a little bit of a mixed answer dependent upon where they are on their own life cycle as they evolve to a more profitable entity. The other type of insurtech is really the service provider. In some cases, those service providers are partners with us, sometimes say compete in part with us. And again, I think it really relates to are what they are doing. There is a definite need in the industry to help bridge the gap between the insurer and the policyholder because I can't be necessarily face-to-face, I can't be at the home, I can't be at the property. So like we referenced in some of the work that we're doing with our virtual property adjudication process and our underwriting platforms, those have been in widespread use and need. So, I think those players have reacted and certainly done well during this pandemic. In other cases, I think probably there is a little bit of hesitancy around what can I actually implement during these times. What do I want to buy? And then like any insurtech, the smaller ones; it becomes a little bit of a liquidity issue as to how much cash I have and what state I am along the evolution towards profitability. So kind of a mixed message there. And obviously, we've grown nicely through a lot of those insurtech insurers or MGAs and we're trying to support them during these difficult times.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Jeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I just underpinning - trying to better understand what underpins the response to Andrew's question about the expected organic margin expansion this year, and trying to understand the trend that you go into COVID with the margin expansion in Q1, looked quite good, especially in the Insurance segment, but really across the business. Can you just give us a bit more detail on what drove that and so we can understand the baseline you're going to COVID with? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Sure. So let me start and Lee, perhaps you'd like to add some detail. But fundamentally, Jeff - and Jeff, good to hear your voice and hope you're doing well.
Jeff Meuler: Likewise.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you. So a very substantial fraction of our cost structure is the cost of our people, our team. It runs at about 70% of our total. As Lee mentioned, one dimension of our compensation stack is our incentive compensation. And those of you who have observed what we have in the proxy, we have set the - sort of the baseline expectation for performance in that at the level of our long-term targets for organic revenue and EBITDA growth. In other words, I would say that we have set the bar at a pretty high level. And to the extent that this moment, for the reasons that we talked about, put some pressure, I would say - particularly on the topline at this moment. One of the natural adjustments which occurs inside of our compensation is that the amount of annual incentive that will get paid out logically would come down somewhat. And that's automatic. That's just in the design of what we do. The other thing that matters greatly here is our total headcount and there is two ideas that are paired one with the other. So one is, as Lee mentioned, our rate of investment in innovation for the future is unabated. Our expectations are that we will spend as much writing and capitalizing software in 2020 as we originally intended, and Lee spoke to that. But the other part of it is what is happening with respect to the rate of headcount growth. And let me put that alongside of the comment that I made earlier; there are very - it is an extremely small fraction of our team where, in this moment, their ability to get their work done is limited. I mentioned roughly 5%. And even in those cases, we - I would describe what we've done as a very modest amount of sort of trimming and realigning. So these are relatively small effects. The larger effect is that - as you've seen our company do over time, entering into 2020 we were also planning on pretty substantial increase in headcount in order to provide even more acceleration of our developments into the future. And as we got the sense that the COVID-19 effect was going to be global not just regional, we basically moved very aggressively to - not to let people go but simply to slow down in this moment, the rate of hiring. And it actually has a material effect on the rate at which our expenses move. And so essentially, we have already done what I think of as the most substantially important thing that we need to do in order to be in position to see our rate of EBITDA growth exceed our rate of revenue growth. Lee, anything you'd like to add to that.
Lee Shavel: Very little, Scott, because I think you describe the mechanics in terms of the steps that we're taking in this environment and how that's affecting our ability to manage EBITDA. And maybe just to kind of give some context as I have in the past around the components and their impact. So in this quarter, Jeff, as I think you identified and I presume in your analysis you're eliminating that impact of the LTI shift, but within that we're seeing before the impact of M&A and even before the impact of the Geomni Vexcel transaction, solid EBITDA margin expansion within each of the three verticals individually. And so that's generating a strong base of margin expansion. The Geomni impact, the reduction of expenses from that transaction, is very helpful. And then we have the impact of LTI, that LTI shift in M&A, but within the business we do have that ongoing core operating leverage. And everything that Scott is describing, is describing our ability to continue to manage and deliver on that core operating leverage, which serves to achieve and support both that organic and all in margin objective that Andrew asked about originally.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you, good morning. Scott, maybe just a follow-up on your comments you just made on plans to accelerate in 2020. I was just wondering if - maybe it's early, but in terms of conversations with your clients, this pieces that maybe everyone realizes they need to be - accelerate their digital plans and so forth. So in the context of opportunity once the dust settles, how do you think about whether that's Lens, or insurance and telematics [ph] or whatever, like where could things really pick up after this because of what's happened?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Thank you, Manav. Nice to hear your voice and I hope you're doing well. Yes, you've really put your finger on one of the most fundamental things about the context in which Verisk does its business. And that is fundamentally as our customers become, what I refer to as the better digital version of themselves, that's good for us. That means that they are more able to consume the data and the analytics that we put out there, and they are able to actually realize and acknowledge the value that they get. Not that there is any lack of acknowledgment today, but as their own processes become more data aware and data sensitive and FAST; the precision that our analytics bring and the speed with which we do what we do just becomes that much more active inside of their own environment. And I believe that one of the most fundamental consequences of the COVID-19 moment is that it is going to accelerate companies becoming the better digital version of themselves. Now, there is still a long distance to go. I mean, for all the discussion that is out there in terms of digital business, digital migration, et cetera, I would say that many companies are still at relatively early stages. But I do believe that there is going to be an acceleration effect based upon what's going on here. What does that mean specifically? I think what that means specifically is that customers will, across a variety of different attachment points, find even more interest in what it is we do. So analytic objects that we put out will be more consumable. And therefore, when our customers write their own business cases for making use of the next thing from Verisk that they haven't made use of yet, one of the factors that will be at work there is when they think about their own returns they will be able to generate returns faster because they will actually get to implementation of what we do more quickly. Same relates to if they want to attach to an API that we've put out there in order to access some of our content. The more that they do business that way, the more they will be able to go from the concept to the actual use of our solutions more quickly. And I would not localize these effects to any one part of our business. All three of the verticals, virtually everything that we do will respond to this trend.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Bill Warmington: Good morning, everyone. So a question for you on WoodMac. Maybe you could talk a little bit about whether there is seasonality of renewals for GEM and maybe you can give us some sense for what you're seeing and on renewals, an early read. Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Bill, good to hear your voice. Hope you're doing well. There is a degree of seasonality and most of the - or in many cases, the heaviest season for renewals is Q4 and Q1. So obviously, we just had our Q1. And the team is in the marketplace. I mean, one of the wonderful things about what we do, not only there but actually across the whole company, is the degree of intimacy we have with our customers. So a sales call is not only a sales call. A sales call is a relationship moment. And particularly at this time, the exchange with our customers is obviously at a very fundamental level. We're very interested in how they're doing. We're very interested in what can we do to be a support to them, and I believe that our customers really get out about Verisk right now. They really get that. And I believe that that, in addition to the acceleration of business becoming more digital, I believe both of those will be resonant for long periods of time into the future. That customers will remember this moment and they will remember what Verisk did. We were cited several things where, not only did we develop things in a very hurry-up fashion in order to respond to their interests, but we also, in some cases, made things available to them for free. And I believe that all of that is going to is going to be remembered. And we'll be - hopefully be yet more foundation inside of the relationships we have with our customers. That's true and that's true at WoodMac also. One of the things about WoodMac being out in the marketplace at this moment seeking renewals is that we are equipped in a way that we weren't in the past. Certainly, it's very different than when the oil price shock of '15 and '16 occurred because we now have the Lens platform, which is a very nice platform to analytic environment that customers - the value of it is obvious to customers. And so it's an amplification of the value that they've always gotten out of our content. And so there is a - we're able to lean into the discussion, even while we're listening very carefully to where the customers are, we're able to lean into the discussion with respect to affirming the value of what we bring and affirming the increase in the value of what we bring relative to say the past renewal, if it was three years ago or two years ago or whenever it happened to be. And so there is a - I would describe it as a kind of a quiet confidence when our team goes out into the market. Now, they know that they've got the goods and they're determined to represent that value even at the same time that we're trying to be very sensitive to where the customers are.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Your line is open, please ask your question.
JeffSilber: Thanks so much. I wanted to go back to your Insurance vertical. I know it's about 85% subscription, I think that's what you said, and you've got long-term contracts. But I'm just curious if you think you might be seeing any pressure on any of those clients, whether it's lower returns from their own investment portfolios, higher business interruption insurance claims. And then, also, can you talk about the percentage of contracts that come up for renewal each year and roughly what the seasonality there is as well? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So I'll start with that and, Mark, and then I'll turn it over to you. Just a couple of your points. I mean, insurers are not un affected by what is happening at the moment, for sure. And Mark described some of the dynamics, particularly the fact that - probably the single most observable in the moment Effects are related to reduced use of automobiles, and therefore, reduced damage to automobiles lower claims. And Mark pointed out earlier that a good number of our customers have chosen to reflect this in premium rebates to some of their customers. That doesn't mean that they're necessarily - that our customers, the insurers, are going to make less money on the line. I mean, their claims experiences, half of the combined ratio has just gone down quite a bit in the moment. So I think they are being very realistic in reflecting that and how they deal with their own customers. But that aside, there will definitely a be discussion about what does business interruption insurance cover and not cover, and specifically, our pandemic effects excluded. Our reading of the policy language is that it's relatively clear that pandemic effects are excluded. That doesn't mean that there will be less than maybe a spirited dialog in front of judges and juries, with folks wanting to claim well, yes, but, no, the policy really should cover that. And of course, we also have to sort of wait and see where public policy making comes out on all of this. But the industry will certainly make its case in terms of the - what is included and what is excluded in the policy language. Mark also talked about some of the smaller companies. And I would just add to what Mark said earlier that one of the things that we - there is a hallmark actually of how we work with our customers; is we try to be very flexible to meet them where they are. And so we're open, for example, if they're feeling extreme - and this is not most cases. In fact, this is in very few cases. But if they are under a relatively greater level of pressure at the moment, we might offer sort of a little relief in the moment for an extended contract with better terms in the out years. We don't find ourselves needing to do that very much, but we were trying to be flexible in those few cases where that makes sense. A lot of our business is on multi-year subscription. Some of it is one-year, but actually automatically renewing. And so Lee mentioned multiple times, the extreme stability of our subscription-based revenues and that's where it is basically found. It's either multi-year or it is automatically renewing, and all of it is so basic to what our customers are doing that it really - it really does fall into the category of must-have. So Mark, anything you want to add to that?
Mark Anquillare: I think you've covered it well, Scott. The contracts we have are typically like three years in nature. So there is no necessarily a concentration, maybe there's a little bit more fourth quarter when those are signed, but that's over three years. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, please ask your question.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on M&A. You've done several tuck-in acquisitions and some divestitures over the last few years. Given your solid balance sheet, how do you think about taking advantage of some of the market dislocation and doing more of these tuck-ins going forward. Any color on that front. Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So as I mentioned way back at the start of the call, we are talking within our leadership team on an extremely frequent basis. We always do, but even more so in this moment. There are two messages that I have for our leaders above all, and I'm almost a broken record on these points as we speak with one another with one another, counsel with one another. One is that we need to be extraordinarily alert to cyber risk in this moment. This is a great moment for bad guys because companies potentially could be distracted as they're dealing with the effects of this moment. We always look very strongly to our defenses at Verisk and - but I am just asking for extraordinarily - extraordinary alertness to that particular dimension of doing work. And by the way, all the monitoring that we do of our network definitely, definitely shows us that we remain secure, but we have to - we just have to lean into it. That's one of my messages for our leadership team. And the other one is you work for a company that is very strong, very stable, has a very substantial and solid balance sheet, and that is not true of all companies in the world today. So please keep your radars on maximum frequency and reach in terms of observing companies that are around us that maybe are logical relative to something that we're doing inside of Verisk and that perhaps are, or even some more specifically, were making a difference for our customers. Because it is possible that some of them may find themselves in a situation where they need to think about a different way of proceeding into the future. And therefore, if both there is strategic logic and there are terms, which might be available we should really be leaning into it at this moment. The message again as you - to our leadership, this is me to our leaders, you work for a company that is unlike a lot of other companies and this can be your moment. So all of that said, if the company happens to be, let's say in private equity hands - private equity has in quite a few cases become the reference bidder [ph] inside of our world. So I'm not - it remains to be seen just how much valuation expectations may modify downward. We'll see.
Stacey Brodbar: Operator, next question.
Scott Stephenson: Stacey. Maybe we'll give it one more moment to see if the operator comes back online.
Stacey Brodbar: Operator, next question. Did we lose our operator?
Scott Stephenson: I think we may have. Well, why don't we tie-off there then. So thank you all very much for joining us today. And my apologies if there are any of you that we're looking to ask a question, but you didn't get a chance to get the question in due to this technical glitch. We don't have the ability to open and close the lines, that's only the operator. So apologies if you had a question and you didn't get a chance to ask us. But in any event as always, we will be following up with many, many of you and I hope that you will take your additional questions and review them with Lee and Stacey. So otherwise, thank you very much for having been with us today. I want to wish you great health and strength in this moment to you and your loved ones and your firms. And we really, really appreciate your interest in Verisk and we have really been looking forward to having this conversation with you. So thanks very much for being with us today. Talk to you soon. Goodbye.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-19 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. At this time for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Verisk's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide a brief overview of our business. Eric Schneider, our Chief Technology Officer, will then provide an update on our technology strategy, including our cloud migration. Lastly, Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer, will join the team for Q&A. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that 2019 was another strong year for Verisk marked by solid financial results, while we continue to invest for future growth. Normalizing for the revenue impact of the injunction related to our roof measurement solutions, we delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 6.9%, and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.7%, demonstrating organic margin improvement in 2019. Moreover, our growth was driven by broad-based strength across our Insurance vertical and marked improvement in energy and specialized markets. The consistency of our growth comes from four sources: First, intimacy with our customers; second, ever deeper levels of integration between our solutions and their environments; third, a steady stream of innovative new solutions; and fourth, the cross-sell of existing solutions to existing customers. Within Insurance, we continue to enjoy strong market uptake of our platformed analytic environments, including LightSpeed for automated underwriting and Touchstone for catastrophe modeling. These solutions are being well received by both the traditional P&C insurers as well as the InsurTech start-ups, who need data analytics to effectively price and sell in a competitive market. We've experienced great success with the InsurTech segment with more than 100 new sales wins in 2019 alone. Our Energy and Specialized Markets segment delivered improved growth in 2019, driven by particularly strong results in our market and cost intelligence solutions, as well as improvements within our core research at Wood Mackenzie. In addition, we delivered strong top line growth and improving profitability from our breakout areas, including the Lens platform and our chemicals and energy transition solutions. As always, we are in close conversation with our customers as they navigate the near-term macro environment. In financial services, 2019 was a year of transition as we evolved from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach with an emphasis on steady growth. Along that journey, we took a very deep look at all our solutions in Verisk Financial Solutions and concluded that our data hosting business what we call Argus Data Warehouse, no longer aligned with our core business model. As such, earlier this month, we entered into an agreement to transition the Argus Data Warehouse by transferring approximately 50 people and licensing our intellectual property to a partner, so that we can focus on data analytics. We believe this transaction will position the Financial Services segment for stronger growth and higher levels of profitability going forward. Continuing on the strategic front, on February 1st, Verisk closed on the previously announced sale of our aerial imagery sourcing group to Vexcel group. This transforms Geomni into an asset light operation with a focus on advanced data analytics. Moreover, it meaningfully reduces the cost structure of our Geomni business, while giving us access to the leading US image library along with favorable economics. Regarding our roof measurement solutions, we have applied for a patent on our new technology for roof measurement, while continuing with our plan to appeal the recent court decision. On February 14, we closed on the sale of our compliance background screening business. This business was in the claims sub-segment of our Insurance business. This transaction will allow us to continue to have access to this important dataset, but in a more capitally efficient manner. Together, these three portfolio changes are examples of how we are actively managing our mix of businesses to capitalize on our competitive advantages and say close to our proven business model of offering platformed analytic solutions and unique analytic objects. These moves position Verisk for continued long-term sustainable growth and improving returns on capital. On the strategic acquisition front, in December, we acquired FAST, a leading SaaS company for the life Insurance and annuity industry. FAST offers a modular flexible policy administration system that allows Life Insurance companies to modernize legacy systems and stages and without a large upfront capital commitment. It also provides a channel for Verisk to deliver our new analytic objects to the Life Insurance industry. Adding FAST to the Verisk portfolio is a strong step forward as we make advances into the Life Insurance market. The software intensity of our overall business has increased over the years and we are excited about the opportunity for FAST software to deliver our analytics and embed more deeply into Life Insurance customers workflows. I'm pleased with the early steps towards integration with FAST. Another key strategic initiative for Verisk is our journey to migrate to the cloud. What we refer to internally as cloud first. We have made significant progress on this campaign and are poised to keep the momentum going. When we first started this journey in earnest two years ago, we saw customer feedback and listen carefully to their concerns. Today, in all of my discussions with CEOs of our customers across all of our verticals, there is full support of our migration to the cloud as our customers realize the benefits of Verisks faster pace of innovation and our ability to enter new geographies more quickly. Erik Schneider, our Chief Technology Officer, will discuss with you in more detail, our cloud migration and broader technology strategy. 2019 was also a milestone year for our ESG objectives. We became a participant in the UN Global Compact, the world's largest sustainability initiative, which encourages companies to align their operations and strategies around universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environments and anti-corruption. We view participation as an extension of the vision and principles represented by our Verisk way and an appropriate calling card as our business grows and embraces all geographies, cultures and people. Several Verisk businesses work with UN sponsored initiatives addressing human rights and climate weather issues by contributing data analytics professional insight and scientific expertise. Additionally, the Global Compact distinguishes Verisk with customers and prospects and sets an example for our suppliers and business partners. On the environmental front, we again reported for the carbon disclosure project, or CDP. And for the second consecutive year, we balanced 100% of our reported scope 1, and scope 2 emissions and scope 3 business air travel with the purchase of energy attribute certificates and carbon offsets. We're committed to reducing our emissions and have continued to do so through office consolidations, building improvements and greater data processing efficiency. In the fourth quarter, we named Pat McLaughlin, as our Chief Sustainability Officer, our first for Verisk, reporting directly to me. Pat and I have worked together for nearly 20 years, and in that time, Pat, led a major business unit for us. His depth with the company gives him intimate knowledge of who we are, and what we value? And so in 2014, I asked, Pat, to work with leadership and employees across Verisk to build a framework for understanding and addressing our impact on society, including the environment. He is championing sustainability efforts across our operations and advancing initiatives for measuring and reporting Verisk in the context of sustainability. I would also like to publicly welcome Laura Ipsen to our Board of Directors. Laura, joined us at the end of 2019, and brings with her more than 25 years of experience working as a technology executive at Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle, yielding a deep knowledge of the cloud, artificial intelligence and SaaS business models. Laura becomes the fourth woman serving on Verisks Board of Directors and also our fourth new Director in the past five years. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved an 8% increase in our cash dividend to $0.27 per share this quarter and has also increased our share repurchase authorization by $500 million. These actions underscore confidence in the stability of our business, its profitability and its cash flows. Our core position within our three verticals is sound. And we are confident in our ability to deliver on our strategies to drive long-term shareholder value as we focus on serving our customers while also investing in market-leading innovation and our people. So with that, let me turn it over to Eric to provide some insight into our technology strategy.
Eric Schneider: Thank you, Scott. Technology is mission-critical to our business. And as such, we are continually working to optimize our technology environment and are always striving to be best-in-class. Working in partnership with our business units, we have identified four strategic areas of equal importance dedicating much of our focus energy to them as we believe these are the areas most impactful for driving growth and efficiency in our business. The four areas are: First, Data Stewardship; second, Analytics; third, our Cloud First strategy that Scott referenced; and fourth, our people. I'd like to take a few minutes to describe each of these and what we are doing. Let me start with data stewardship. One of our key distinctives is our unique data assets as data is the core of everything we do. Within this area of strategic focus, we are advancing how we protect data, how we acquire new data assets, and how we process data more efficiently. Our relentless focus on data stewardship continuously increases the usefulness of our data and analytics for our customers. To reach the next level, we recently added the role of Chief Data Officer in each of our industry verticals. This role is responsible for driving our data agenda together our three Chief Data officers are sharing best practices across verticals to amplify the value of our data. More specifically, the Chief Data Officers are identifying new and valuable data assets, making our assets more usable, improving and unifying data stewardship, modernizing our data processing pipelines, and standardizing data governance across the enterprise. For example, they champion the standardization and adoption of data protection methods like tokenization for sensitive information across our broad portfolio of products. For new data sets, our Chief Data Officers discover and align both internal and partner data for valuable business applications. They are leading with cloud-based architectures to speed up data processing times for faster consumption by our customers. And finally, they continuously add higher quality data assets with more coverage, actively improve data quality and use cutting edge techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning to link our data assets. Improved data assets, with strong governance form the basis of our Analytics portfolio, which I would like to speak about next. On the Analytics front, we are pushing the envelope by bringing advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to solve the business challenges facing our customers. We successfully partnered with regulators to enable the uses of machine learning techniques to improve analytical outcomes. We are developing novel methods to leverage unstructured data sets such as images and audio in conjunction with our already differentiated structured data assets to further improve their value. Our AI and machine learning center of excellence, together with our business units, leverage our University partnerships to bring research and advanced techniques quickly and efficiently into our solutions for our customers. Our team is focused on accelerating our innovation process and leverage our Analytics platform to explore scores of ideas through quick proof-of-concepts such that we are focusing our energies on ideas that quickly gain market traction. Now let's turn to our cloud first strategy. We are well underway on our journey to the cloud. We are multi-cloud enabled and have workloads running in all leading cloud providers. Approximately one-third of our computing environment is currently running in the cloud. Our multi-cloud strategy aligns our migration approach with our customer requirements when and where necessary and the pace of our migration continues to meet our customers' expectations. We are leading the migration via our centralized cloud center of excellence, which is offering advanced capabilities to our businesses in the areas of cloud architecture, financial management, security, operations and training. Each of our businesses in all three verticals actively engage and work closely with our Center of Excellence to ensure a secure, timely and cost effective migration takes place. A significant benefit of our move to the cloud is our ability to reduce and forecast our compute costs. In the cloud, our unit costs are reduced and are linear, in lockstep with our utilization of cloud services. We are taking advantage of near infinite compute capacity by flexing and contracting in direct response to demand by both scaling horizontally for peak periods and contracting turning environments off when not needed. Let me share an example of an environment, we have moved from on-premise data centers to the cloud and the benefits we are realizing. Our Telematics platform, which houses over 100 billion miles of driving data has been completely re-architected to enhance the quality and timeliness of the analytic provided to our customers. By moving to the cloud, we have reduced processing cycle time, while at the same time reducing cost. Offering an overall improved experience for our customers or our telematic solutions. As we move forward, we will incur transitional costs associated with re-architecting and optimizing our solutions to best benefit from cloud platforms. Fourth and perhaps most importantly is our people. Our talent access is superior globally and we continue to build and attract world-class talent in both our data science and cloud disciplines. Data scientists and cloud architects want to work with us, because we have some of the most interesting business problems to solve and we are doing so in the cloud. Our data science excellence program is an immersive four-plus year rotational training program that brings the brightest talent from top schools to Verisk and exposes them to our customers' business challenges as meaningful contributors to our Analytic teams. And from a cloud perspective, we are advancing the cloud skills of our people. Our teams have obtained hundreds of cloud certifications and we plan to double that number in 2020. In addition, we have augmented our internal teams by attracting experienced cloud professionals in the areas of cloud architecture, security and development operations. We continue to invest and optimize in all four of these strategic initiatives and are confident in the value they are bringing to our people to our customers and to Verisk overall. Now, let me turn the call over to Lee, who will provide an update on our financials.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Eric. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10.2% to $677 million. Net income decreased 9.6% to $132 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share decreased 8% to $0.80 for the fourth quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease in GAAP net income and EPS is primarily the result of acquisition-related earn-out expenses of $28 million, as many of our acquisitions are on target to achieve payments for strong performance. In addition, a higher effective tax rate due primarily to higher option exercises in the prior year period related to expiring options associated with our IPO 10 years ago reduced net income and EPS in the quarter. Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for non-operating items as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we believe that our operating performance remains solid. On an organic constant currency basis and including the impact of the injunction, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 5.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019. Growth was led by the Energy and Specialized Markets segment, which was our fastest growing segment for the second consecutive quarter. Insurance also delivered solid growth, while Financial Services results were stable. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 9%, reflecting leverage from organic growth across all three segments. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 47.1% flat with the prior year period, including substantial investment. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenues and adjusted EBITDA. Normalizing for the revenue impact of the injunction, organic constant currency revenue grew 6.3%; organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA, increased 11%; and total adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 47.5%. Moreover on an organic basis, and particularly on the pre-investment organic basis that we've discussed before, we saw margin expansion in all three of our segments demonstrating the exceptional operating leverage at the core of our businesses. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 5.2% revenue growth, while adjusted EBITDA increased 6.6% for the quarter. Normalizing for the impact of the injunction, Insurance would have achieved 6.5% organic constant currency revenue growth, and 9.1% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth, demonstrating margin expansion, while also investing for future growth. Within our underwriting and rating business, organic constant currency revenue growth accelerated to 8.2%, and was very broad-based across our solution sets in personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry-standard Insurance programs, LightSpeed suite of products, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions revenue. We also had positive contributions from our international business. Within claims, organic constant currency revenues declined 1%, primarily driven by the injunction. Normalizing for the impact from the injunction, claims delivered 2.9% organic constant currency revenue growth held back by fewer severe weather events this year as compared to last year, reducing transactional revenue growth. However, our claim subscription revenues continue to see solid growth and were primarily driven by claims analytics and repair cost estimating solutions. Insurance adjusted EBITDA margin was 53% for the quarter, flat with the prior year period. Normalizing for the impact from the injunction, the Insurance segment adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 53.5%, reflecting leverage from the organic growth offset in part by continued investment. Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 7.1% for the quarter, driven by particularly strong sales of our market and cost intelligence solutions and core research revenues, as well as contributions from our chemicals, solutions and the energy transition practice. We also had positive contributions from environmental health and safety and weather and climate analytics revenues. Energy and Specialized Markets adjusted EBITDA increased 23.8% reflecting leverage on strong sales balanced with ongoing investments in breakout opportunities, including our Lens platform, chemicals and the energy transition practice. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 32% from 30.8%. Financial Services revenue grew 2.1% in the quarter led by growth in fraud and credit risk management solutions as well as portfolio management solutions. This was offset in part by declines in enterprise data management revenues. As Scott discussed, we have decided to transition our data hosting operations to a partner, which will better position this segment for more predictable, sustainable growth. As evidence, the Financial Services segment would have delivered revenue growth of 7% in the quarter without the impact of the Argus Data Warehousing business. Financial Services segment adjusted EBITDA increased 6.2% and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 40.3% from 37.9% reflecting strong cost discipline. Our reported effective tax rate was 23.2% for the quarter compared to 18.6% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of a higher level of option exercise in the prior year period. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 20.9%, which was in line with our targeted range. For 2020, we expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. So there will be likely some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personal decisions. Adjusted net income was $188 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.13 for the fourth quarter of 2019, up 8.7% from the prior year. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and lower average share count. These increases were offset in part by higher depreciation and amortization, increased interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. Net cash provided by operating activities was $176 million for the quarter, up 1.7% from the prior-year period, reflecting primarily a higher effective tax rate due to the option exercises in 2018 mentioned earlier. Capital expenditures were $64 million for the quarter, down 16.3% from the prior-year period, primarily the result of reduced capital expenditure at Geomni. CapEx represented 9.5% of total revenue in the quarter. As we look to 2020, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million. Included in this number are one-time expenditures of approximately $35 million related to the consolidation of office space that we have planned in two key cities London and Boston. We are excited about the long-term benefits of having our business units and people together under one roof. Relating this to CapEx, we expect fixed asset, depreciation and amortization to be within a range of $170 million to $180 million in comparison to the $186 million for 2019. Depreciation and amortization should be lower year-over-year helped by the sale of our imagery sourcing group, including the planes and sensors to Vexcel. We expect intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2020 in comparison to $138 million in 2019. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and completion of projects and future M&A activity. Free cash flow was $112 million for the quarter, an increase of 16% from the prior-year period primarily due to lower capital expenditures. During the fourth quarter, we returned $141 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares at a weighted average price of $145.07, for a total cost of $100 million. At December 31st 2019, we had $128 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We remain committed to ongoing capital return to shareholders, and as Scott mentioned we are pleased that Verisk's Board of Directors approved an additional authorization of $500 million for share repurchases as well as an 8% increase in our cash dividend to $0.27 per share this quarter. As Scott mentioned, we have recently engaged in a series of transactions that focus our portfolio of businesses to fully capitalize on our key distinctives and our core competitive advantages. Each of these transactions is unique in its structure, but share the motivation of active capital discipline and achieving more predictable long-term growth at Verisk. Before I conclude and looking ahead to the first quarter, I want to inform you of a timing shift in expenses between the first and second quarters that will impact our reported financial results. The company recently changed the timing of the grant of long-term incentive compensation into the first quarter from the second quarter previously. This timing change aligns Verisk with a greater market and more closely times employee compensation with calendar year results. The resulting impact will be increased expense of $10 million in the first quarter related to long-term incentive compensation, but that will reverse to a benefit in the second quarter. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts that we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. You may ask your question.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. My question is around the cloud first strategy. So just kind of a two-parter. So one, Scott, when you referenced you were talking to your customers and they are supportive of your move. Other customers also sort of in this cloud move and are ready to adopt it, or will there be a transition period of duplicate cost in order to serve the customer better. And then Lee. I was just hoping you could put some financial parameters around it, like how much of spend, savings, et cetera, we might start thinking about?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So I'll start with that, Manav, good morning. Our customers are in various stages of considering how they're going to manage their own technical infrastructure. I would say in general, that our company has moved faster, probably considerably faster in modifying our compute environment relative to our customers. But it doesn't really create an added burden for our customers or put more cost into the system as we work with them. In fact, if anything, the interface between us and the customer becomes a little bit easier to manage. So there is no systemic increase in cost. We -- obviously, as we've talked many times, we are adding the cloud dimension to our business even as we are working to retire the premise dimension of our business. The premise dimension comes off sort of in shelves, the cloud, it sort of grows in a linear fashion as Eric said before. But we've absorbed all that into our P&L and are just -- we continue to head in the same direction at the same pace. And so it all feels very organic. With customers; it's really nothing, but good for customers. And it doesn't add an additional burden for them. And Lee, I don't know, if you want to just talk a little bit more about the specifics.
Lee Shavel: Sure. And Manav, thanks for the question. I appreciate that. Very simply, we aren't providing an estimate of the cost savings for a couple reasons; one is that this is a multi-year project as we are rolling out these transitions across many data sets, many individual businesses. And while we're tracking it on each of those bases, and we look at each of those situations as test cases, where we can see the savings, we can see the return on capital for the investments that we're making because of the rolling impact of us achieving some savings, investing in the transition over time. We don't want to create a fixed benchmark. I think from our perspective, our view is that, this activity will generate both operational improvements, in terms of lower OpEx relative to this function. And so there will be a margin benefit that supports our overall margin improvement objectives as well as EBITDA growth ahead of revenue growth as well as capital efficiencies that will boost our return over time. But given that it is deeply embedded within our businesses and something that we're managing as part of their full technology spend, it's not something that at an aggregate level we are going to provide that full estimates for that reason. But we absolutely have seen those benefits in the projects that we have executed within specific data sets in the businesses and we will expect that to kind of roll forward as we prosecute this initiative overtime.
Stacey Brodbar: Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. You may ask your question.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, Lee, it's a margin question. So the fourth quarter 2019 reported EBITDA margins were flat year-over-year, that's reported, that's including past acquisitions, as well as the drag from the roof report injunction. You were good to say how much that drag from the roof report injunction is? And also we're seeing the operating leverage coming from the breakout initiatives at the core. So as such, is Verisk positioned to see 2020 reported EBITDA margins to be flattish to perhaps leaning forward?
Lee Shavel: Yes. So, thank you, Andrew. I appreciate the question and the consistent focus on margin. We bring the same discipline in looking at our overall business. So I appreciate the fact that what you've recognized is at the core, we are generating very strong and consistent operating leverage in the businesses on a pre-investment basis. So in the fourth quarter, we did see that margin expansion for all of our core businesses before the impact of our breakouts, which include Geomni as well as the impact from our acquisitions. And so we -- it certainly shouldn't come as a surprise that Geomni was a significant impact in terms of investment in the fourth quarter of 2019, as it was in for the year as a whole. And so that element will certainly benefit from the transaction with Vexcel. So at least that component in 2020 should have a substantially reduced impact overall on margins, but that's balanced then again, of course, the ongoing investment in our businesses that we make on a return basis as well as the impact from acquisitions. Our long-term objective continues to be to generate EBITDA growth in excess of revenue growth on an organic basis and to improve that margin over time. And I think going into 2020, we feel as confident as ever in our ability to achieve that.
Andrew Steinerman: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. Scott, just thinking about your strategy of getting out of the data collection in aerial imagery and also the data hosting business in Argus, it doesn't sound like your view on the value of data has changed. But maybe just some tangential ways of how you get the data? And what you do with it is slightly changing? And so I just wanted to understand like does the new partnership around that Argus Data Warehouse change anything with regard to the ownership of the data? And just how you're thinking of that? And then, Lee, if you could give some additional color on the financial impacts like the net cost savings from the Vexcel transaction? And how much revenue in total will be reduced by other portfolio actions? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Thanks, Toni. So, first of all, our view of the value unique data assets is completely unchanged. And actually if anything, I think going forward unique data assets actually will be even probably more rare, not that we feel that there is any, there will be -- we will take any step back, in terms of the volume, or the value of the data that we've got. So our view of that as a part of our business is completely unchanged. Data remains the oxygen in our bloodstream and it always will. So the two changes that we made; first of all, what I would really like to emphasize around the Vexcel transaction is, that we actually put ourselves in position to have an even better dataset. Vexcel was -- as we've already described, already engaged in data capture. There are also one of the globe's leading providers of sensor technology. And so putting together our image capture process with their methods and some of the commitments they already had to creating this image library. We actually have access. We will have access and we have access to a better set of images than we had before and that substantially improved economics. So it's merely about how do we get to the data, not, are we interested in the data. And with the move with the Argus Data Warehouse, that's a little bit different, because the Argus Data Warehouse was not about our gathering of data from customers. It was really customers who would observed our facility with dealing with their data and they said, can you essentially white label your way of managing data to me. And we said, yes, as another benefit for our customers. And what happened over time is, this whole space of hosting data warehouses in particularly cloud-enabled has just sort of exploded over the last several years. And it was never founded -- the ADW [ph] work was never founded upon, providing us a data source which we then translate through our analytics. It was really more of an accommodation for our customers in their own workflows. So there's really no change in terms -- well, there is zero change, in terms of our access to data in the Financial segment. So, we view data as we always have. We have as much or better access to data than we used to and our economics have improved as a result of these changes that we made. Lee, anything you could add to that?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Toni, to give you some sense that from a financial impact standpoint, I understand, you want to get a sense from a revenue perspective, that we would kind of roughly estimate approximately on -- in the fourth quarter there were approximately $8 million of revenues associated with the image capture business that will be moving to Vexcel. So that gives you kind of some sense of the scale. From an EBITDA standpoint there is not a material impact from the impact of those revenues. So kind of roughly equivalent level of EBITDA expense associated with that. But on a year-over-year basis, we are expecting the benefit of eliminating the costs associated with the individuals and the flight operations associated with that image capture business that we will no longer continue to bear, even though we will continue to have access to all of that data on very preferential terms looking ahead. So, it will clearly be a benefit to us from an EBITDA perspective.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of Bank of America. You may ask your question.
Gary Bisbee: Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. I wanted to ask just a bit more about the margins in the quarter. So a quarter ago, you'd talked about in the loss of revenue from the injunction not having enough time to really get at or reduce those costs, and yet the Insurance margin was quite strong. So obviously, you're able to get rid of a bunch of that cost. And on the energy business, we'd also thought there would be -- maybe more of a drag than it appeared there was from the Genscape deal that I think you on for a couple of months in the quarter. So just help us think about as we think moving into Q1 and moving forward, what the dilution from Genscape is, and what -- how we think about the Geomni lost sales and the impact of that all in with Vexcel? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you, Gary. So a lot of elements, I'm here, so let me try to give you a couple of components of that. So I think the statement that we made in the third quarter with regard to not being able to make substantial headway on the expense for Geomni in the fourth quarter is accurate kind of specific to the overall entity within our GAAP results. Naturally, the Vexcel transaction will be moving a substantial part of that expense, not all of it, we will have operating expenses associated with our analytics component of that business that will be retained. But in excess of the majority of the expenses will move out of the business. But the margin uplift with Insurance really wasn't driven by cost savings within Geomni. I think it was just the natural operating leverage within the business as a whole. And specific to the energy and specialized markets discussion there our market and cost intelligence business and the strong growth that we experienced within that business as well as cost discipline at Wood MacKenzie was really the primary contributor to the margin expansion within that business and for the business as a whole. And so there we are benefiting from a very strong growth in that product and relatively low associated expansion within that. So I think that is when we look at that margin strength there were certainly some component of it within Insurance. But a lot of that benefit came from those activities. So as I mentioned with regard to Andrews comments, I think all of those effects we think will put us in a very good position to continue to work towards that margin expansion objective that we have over the long-term in 2020.
Gary Bisbee: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. Historically you guys have not talked a whole lot about your commercial sales organization on calls. Maybe just give us an update, is that an opportunity, how do you measure sales force productivity? And any changes to incentives maybe that you've made there, or haven't made as you look forward the growth. It seems like you're doing a lot of acquisitions around software due to sort of penetrate customers, but any thoughts as to adding salespeople and going after more revenue? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So obviously, an important dimension of our business across all the verticals we take a three-tier approach to selling. So we have account representation where -- we have people who are owning our end-to-end relationship with our customer. Then we have product specialists, whether they be data analytic solutions or software solutions. Almost everything that we do is very technical. And so we do need people who are focused on specific parts of our product suite to go in, present credentials, work on issues of integration, et cetera. And then thirdly, we have inside sales to help us cover what -- in some cases is the fairly long tail of smaller customers inside of our market spaces. Generally, we find it a good use of money to expand our go-to-market team and we're always looking to do that. And the only other thing, I would say and this ties a little bit to the point that Lee, was just on, as we make acquisitions, which are inside of verticals that we're already serving one of the things we think hard about is, how are we going to integrate the two. And I will say by the way that, that we had ambitious plans for Genscape integration and the team has met all of their marks. And so it's gone very, very well. But one of the places where we're fairly slow to take any cost out actually is with respect to market representation. So as we say integrate something that we acquired, we actually want to hold on to the go-to-market resources as much as, as we possibly can. And then we're always asking the question would more be helpful. I mean, in general, I would just say that, I've really been pleased and impressed with what our teams accomplished in 2019, in terms of building our book of business. So, yes, it's always on our mind. We've always had the same structure. We always lean into more investment in that area when it makes sense.
Hamzah Mazari: Thank you.
Stacey Brodbar: Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. You may ask your question.
Jeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. With the preface that I fully recognize the importance of data and analytics as a source of value into solutions. Scott, I would love kind of your perspective on where you draw the lines or what types of software solutions you expect to provide. So just talking about the increased software intensity, the Life Insurance software acquisition and some other software acquisitions you've done. But you also continue to partner with the likes of Guidewire, and I think there was a relatively recent announcement with Duck Creek. So what types of software solutions do you expect to provide? Where do you look to partner? Do you increasingly compete against some of those vertical software providers over time? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. No, it's a good question, and it does relate to the fabric of our company. So bottom line for me is, that I would only want to see us in software businesses that have the potential to yield data assets that we can use and reuse for analytic purposes. That's really sort of the bottom line. So there are core transaction processing platforms that tend to exist in all the verticals that we serve. And to the extent that those particular platforms are unlikely to yield any sort of data rights, then it's just less likely to be of interest to us. That's the first dimension of it. And the second, sort of relates to the first. And that is, what we're really interested in is what we call platformed analytic environments. So we want to be the place where somebody who is trying to make a decision goes. They go in the morning and they stay there much if not all of the day. That's our ambition. That's where we want to be. Almost by definition, if that's the nature of the software you're providing, then you are close to the datasets. So, that's really the distinction that I would trace for you here.
Jeff Meuler: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi, good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. When I think about a few call out drivers that you discussed in Insurance, I'm thinking about the opportunities in life and InsurTech, which sounds pretty robust as well as the UK, which I think it was mentioned, Lee, I think you mentioned has been pretty strong. Can you over the next few years, perhaps quantify or dimensionalize how those may bend the growth curve in your Insurance business?
Lee Shavel: Sure. So, I'm going to -- I'll take a first cut at it. And I'm sure Mark can provide some broader perspective on it. So, I think, as it relates to the InsurTech dimension, our view is that it contributes to incremental growth across two dimensions; one is that we have a group of new clients that we are serving in a traditional context with our industry-standard products and other data sets. But the other dimension is that they are bringing innovation, new ways of doing things that is putting more of the focus around our traditional customers to utilize data more intensively than they may have in the past. And that is creating new opportunities for us to develop products to support their needs. And our LightSpeed suite of products is probably a perfect example of that dynamic. And so it is -- I would describe it one level as accelerating the demand and the expansion of analytic objects in demand for platform analytics that has enabled our underwriting and rating business to generate levels of growth as you've seen in this quarter and that probably wouldn't have been expected two years or three years ago. So I think that's one dimension of it. And we've spent a lot of time thinking about the life opportunity, and I'll hand it over to Mark to describe how we see that opportunity influencing and providing incremental growth for us.
Mark Anquillare: So let me basically say it this way, I think, there's two types of InsurTech's. One is, I'm an insurer or probably a managing general agent on underwriting business or at least trying to find business. There what they are looking for is to get into business fast and automate. And that drive towards automation, drive towards technology has been a wonderful opportunity for us. And we have had some great sales there and it is accelerated growth across all of Insurance. There's also InsurTech, but they're trying to do some technology around data and information, and although probably on the outskirts could be competitive over time. So we certainly keep track of them. I guess the theme that I'll bring out, which kind of may tie together a couple of questions is, our customers are interested in content, that's King. But at the same time, they're pushing towards automation. They want is seamless ecosystem. So they can tap into any data, or any solution, whether it's their own or third-party. And they expect through a series of APIs and micro services to be able to consume that information or consume that application in a very seamless way. And I think that is a large part of why we're thinking that the fast acquisition will help us quite a bit. It is that light touch, quick implementation, low upfront cost, that life insurers are looking for. And we see the same thing, probably P&C is a little bit of ahead from an analytics perspective, but we see the same thing for our P&C customer. So, hopefully that provides a little broader color.
Andrew Jeffrey: Thanks, Mark.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Your pace of M&A activity has picked up in recent quarters, particularly with the acquisition of Genscape. When you had a similar level of M&A activity in 2018, EBITDA margins did contract by about 100 bps. So diving deeper into margins in the year ahead, can you discuss how the margin profile Genscape compares to your earlier acquisitions particularly ones being integrated in 2018. And if you intend to change your pace of investment activity in the breakout opportunities this year ahead versus earlier years? Thank you.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thanks, George. So whenever we talk about the margin impact, I wanted to kind of start with the fact that the important thing for all of our businesses is that they have fundamental operating leverage that allows us to deliver on EBITDA growth in excess of revenue growth, because we think that's the fundamental value creation driver for that business. And so we look at each of those businesses and every business has a different margin dynamic, but we want to make certain that, that dynamic is present, and we have the ability to improve upon that over time. So when we are looking at acquisitions, George, we are fundamentally making a capital decision and a growth decision, in terms of, is this going to be a good use of capital. Can we generate a good return on the business? And what we can do to enhance it? And beneath that is their operating leverage that will allow us to continue to generate that EBITDA growth over time. And so when we talk about our organic constant currency revenue growth, yes, we are making that adjustment, so that we see that dynamic across our business as a whole. We tend not to be overly focused on the portfolio impact of the acquisitions because if it is a good return acquisition and it has operating leverage, then it will allow us to generate that EBITDA growth over time. And I think talking about it in individual acquisition like Genscape, which is going to come in at a lower margin than the rest of the business, that will naturally have a portfolio impact. But what we can -- we hope to generate with that business and its association with Wood McKenzie and generating incremental returns and incremental margins should really drive what we're focused on, which is that EBITDA expansion ahead of revenue growth. So, I know that isn't a complete answer to your question, but philosophically, I think it's important to understand that's the way we think about those acquisitions and their contribution.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Kevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks. Lee, you talked about kind of three different portfolio transactions in the area of Financial Services and Insurance. Can you give us kind of the overall revenue and margin impact from those dispositions?
Lee Shavel: So, I think, I gave the impact from the Vexcel -- from the Vexcel transaction. So I -- and the other, the other ones, I think, we can deal with in a follow-up call, they're not that material overall to the business, I think the $8 million is really the bulk of it. So we can probably find -- we can fine tune that with you offline, separately, but it's the Geomni Vexcel transaction that would have the more significant impact. The rest are less significant.
Kevin McVeigh: Super. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeff Silber: Thank you so much. Just wanted to step back and kind of look at your portfolio of assets. You did some pruning, I think over the past quarter or so. Is there anything else left to divest. And then also did you see synergies between your three major verticals? Obviously, within Insurance, there's a lot, but I'm just wondering across synergies with the other verticals? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: So we're always looking at the mix of assets we've got. But I would say that, I think we have done a fair amount of -- the kind of work that was expressed in those three moves. We'll always keep our eyes open, but there is nothing major, which is imminent. To your question about synergies across the verticals, we have re-purposed energy data into the Insurance vertical. We're looking at opportunities to tie together observations from retail banking with consumer forms of Insurance. So that work is always going on in the background. But the thing I would really highlight for you is, all of the technical work that Eric described before. This is the kind of work where it would be more burdensome for any one of our verticals or even a business unit inside of a vertical to take it on, on their own, because these are pretty large expenditures. And if you're going to do it right, you have to really commit to these things. Eric, talked about the work you have to do to transition to the cloud, or to create a data fabric inside of the platform data environment that we provide to all parts of Verisk. And not only does doing this work excellently in the center, provide acceleration to each of the businesses inside of each of the verticals, but it really represents a very cost efficient way of doing it as well. And so that is – that's actually to me one of the large major points of logic as to why we should be in multiple verticals. And another one is, all of what we do in these verticals, and not every vertical has this quality, but all the verticals that we're in, the opportunity for unique, differentiated data assets exists. And that's not true in a lot of verticals, but it is true in the places where we do business.
Lee Shavel: Okay. I would add as a case in point. We often -- you get questions about the relevance in of the Financial Services business. And as we've talked about the deal with a dataset that is in order of magnitude, if not more larger than many of our other businesses, but the expertise that we have developed in cloud technology and data analytics within that business generates a return on intellectual capital that we have leveraged in our Lens platform within the Insurance business as we're implementing that cloud technology and probably wouldn't be as effective in bringing those efficiencies and advantages, if we hadn't been dealing with that dataset and with that level of expertise. And so I think it's a great kind of case in point how we leverage that.
Mark Anquillare: Yes. I'll just -- I don't want to answer too many times. But case in point is inside the London Insurance market. The expertise and technology associated with the Verisk Financial Services assets were combined with kind of ISO expertise to build a platform there that has been kind of changing some of the London market transaction processing. So it'll be very effective.
Stacey Brodbar: Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So quick question on Claims. Even excluding injunction, it was a bit soft because of the fewer other events. I was just wondering, if you can provide any color on how much of the revenues generated from these other events? And as we think about going forward should we see this business re-accelerate given the stability of the subscription business? Thanks.
Mark Anquillare: So, this is Mark. Thanks for the question. So, first of all, I want to start with the Insurance business as a whole was very strong. We think of it as a portfolio and we're very pleased with the interaction with customers and where we've progressed. Specifically to Claims, I think there's three things that we've seen over the course of a little longer term and clearly short-term. One, I think we've talked about some of the extensions we've had really on the claims fraud or claims fraud detection side of the world related to outside of P&C health companies and like, where we've brought some kind of -- some big customers in and that has kind of rolled off. But more specifically as it relates to the fourth quarter, clearly the injunction affected us. We weren't able to deliver the growth that we've been delivering inside of Geomni, that was a negative. And the other thing that was clearly changed or different in the fourth quarter of 2019 relative to 2018 was a relatively modest set of storms. There was a very quiet storm season. This isn't about catastrophes. This is just severe weather throughout the nation that had quite a bit of impact on what I'll refer to as the Claims business. So those two things. We're kind of the anomalies in the quarter. I will reinforce the underlying business, the underlying economics remain very strong. Customer engagement very strong. And I think the mission we're on with regard to automation and automating claim adjusting is kind of the theme inside the industry. So we remain optimistic.
Scott Stephenson: And Mark, let's just clarify real quick. When you talk about the effect of the health insurers coming into our ClaimSearch platform and you referred to as rolling off, what you meant was it provided -- it's not that they went away…
Mark Anquillare: They certainly didn't.
Scott Stephenson: They're still in the process as much as they ever worked.
Mark Anquillare: The grow-over…
Scott Stephenson: Right. It represented growth in 2018 and into 2019. But now they're in, and there's all that we have.
Stacey Brodbar: Next question?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. You may ask your question.
Greg Peters: Good morning, and thank you for fitting me in. The large Insurance brokers seem to be pushing data analytics as a growth area for their business. Can you tell us, how you're working with them, or should we view their strategies is potentially encroaching on your business. They've also reported good organic revenue growth and it's in part due to the strong pricing environment and commercial lines. Can you talk to us about how your business is affected by pricing trends in commercial lines Insurance? And then finally on LightSpeed, can you give us an idea of the size of that business. I've been struggling to identify actual customers and our channel checks, but that doesn't mean, I'm looking in the right place. So any help there would be appreciated.
Scott Stephenson: Well, you managed to get three questions in there at least.
Mark Anquillare: I don't know. I think counted four.
Scott Stephenson: I'll just take -- Mark, why don't you and I do this together? I'll just take the first part of that, which is the question about the brokers. So the brokers and we really do not have a lot of overlap. The brokers from time-to-time to attempt to put together some forms of data analytics, in order to try to add value inside of their customer relationships. But fundamentally they -- they're much more of a service-oriented kind of a business. We license subscription solutions to our customers. And the brokers touch a good number of situations and they have the data associated with the transactions that they're engaged in. But those datasets are really not overlapping of the datasets that we have got. And so, I mean, it's a practical matter out in the marketplace. We just don't compete with the brokers, and nor do I think, we will compete with the brokers. They're just a fundamentally separate kind of an environment. And in fact, they operate as customers because particularly our catastrophe modeling solutions are made available to them as well as to others. So, yes, you know, if I was running one of the major brokerages, actually, if I was running almost any business in the world, I would try to make it more data analytic, as a way of trying to achieve advantage. And that's what they're working on. But I don't, their business model and ours is very different basically, and I think will remain. So, Mark, you want to take on those other points?
Mark Anquillare: Yes. And I'll just add to yours. I think from a brokering theme perspective, clearly, they're looking to differentiate themselves that they are providing analytics. I think most of that analytics, at least, the way we've seen it, is sold into and provided to the corporate customer, where we're more on the insurer side of that. I think your second question was around pricing and pricing impact. So commercial line's hardening market, if you will. I think the short answer is that, if our customers are growing quicker, there is more opportunity to focus on top line, focus on dancing and potentially purchasing new solutions to foster that growth. So, I think it's a friendly environment when everyone is growing and it's probably more opportunities to buy new solutions or extend them. We do have this wonderful solution inside of underwriting and rating our ISO business. When it is a difficult period or it's a soft market, people have to go back to the actuarial fundamentals. They have to go to fundamentals around how I underwrite because they want to be profitable. So clearly that supports our business as well, but I think everyone is in a better shape with a high tide floating all boats. Last question, I think, it was around LightSpeed. Let me say it this way. The way we've packaged up LightSpeed is, we are trying to take and in the world of Insurance, I'll use personal automobile, you can get online and you can get a quote pretty quickly. But what typically happens is after you get that quote, people then run all the different reports to get information about you, whether you're in an accident, whether you're impacting history, less accidents. And all of that motor vehicle record data, all that costs money. So they then run that information and they more or less changed price in about 35% of the cases. That's a customer-unfriendly way to go. So we are pushing this data forward strategy. We are trying to move to point of sale, so there is no separation between buying a quote that is more attractive for consumer. And we are very uniquely positioned in the commercial lines market because of the data and information we have, more so than even in personal lines. And that strategy, that approach has been gaining quite a bit of receptivity among major customers both large ones and those InsurTechs we're talking about. So, when we talked about LightSpeed, it's a package of solutions and products and many, many insurers are buying pieces, and a few very large ones have signed up for what I'll call the full package. So that has definitely been contributing to growth inside of our underwriting and rating business.
Scott Stephenson: When customers use it, Mark, I just -- I would think a lot of them actually identify with Verisk rather than saying, "Oh, that's Touchstone," because it's a whole series of services.
Mark Anquillare: Yes. [Indiscernible].
Scott Stephenson: And we tie them together as Touchstone, but I think the customers are relating to the overall brand Verisk.
Greg Peters: Thank you for your answers.
Scott Stephenson: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.
Bill Warmington: Good morning. And the question I had was to see, if we could get an update on the new product pipeline specifically around loan verifier, also some of the Life Insurance underwriting products? And then maybe also, if you could comment on, how you plan on leveraging some of the unstructured datasets, audio and images that Eric mentioned in his comments?
Scott Stephenson: Why don't you take those on, Mark?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So let me kind of walk through those. I think you were talking about loan verifier. You were talking about Life Insurance and some unstructured data. So let me start with the final two, because in some ways they're connected. So Life Insurance, we think provides a pretty big opportunity for us. We do have some solutions already available. So think about our catastrophe modeling, what we refer to as extreme event modeling. We do work along longevity models, mortality shock model. Think of pandemic, coronavirus, we do that type of work and that fits into some of the Life Insurance models that are necessary and interested. What we're also doing is, we're doing work around model that it relates to specific underwriting decisions. So that is around partnerships with the medical inspection bureau, which represents a group inside of life around, I'll call it, physicals and health. We've done some work around electronic healthcare records and doing some analytics there. The two analytics that you're most focused on, we have done some work around tobacco. We've done some work around avocation. If you're kind of like the skydiving, that doesn't make you the best risk. And kind of combining some of the technology that Eric and his team were talking about with some of the specialists we have from an Insurance perspective, we have used some voice recognition technology, which allows us to understand things about your voice and whether there is an indication that may lead to tobacco use, as an example. So, hopefully you can kind of understand one small example of how it fits into a) a wonderful technology group helping Insurance business extend into Life Insurance. And FAST provides some of that. Hopefully, that responds.
Scott Stephenson: Maybe talk a little bit also, Mark, about using imagery to interpret damage to vehicles.
Mark Anquillare: Absolutely.
Scott Stephenson: Without having to send a human being.
Mark Anquillare: So, I think one of the things that we would love to do is part of automated adjusting is do a quick look. So this is a what I'll refer to as low severity type of crash, small dollars, but highly frequent. You can do a quick review and make payments. So we have some abilities to take a look at images. Just think about machine learning and understanding a couple of things. One is the image legitimate and accurate based upon time and date and stamp and things like that. Was it manipulated? But we go beyond that to do a few more things. One, we're saying is, it's eligible or not. Should it be complete loss. And then two, if it's eligible, we can do a quick estimate as to what it's going to cost to repair it. And those are the type of things that advanced analytics provide to automate this process. And it's a quick way to do things that have typically taken quite a bit of time and effort to in the past. Great. Bill, I think you also talked about loan verifier. Loan verifier is another important idea for us. What it does, though, with any of our really differentiated ideas, it does take us time to aggregate data. But what we are working with is, working with insurers to get information access to a lot of that information behind the scenes. So that we can connect those folks who are on the loan side of things, think of the banks, with those insurers who are kind of ensuring that risk and piece those together. Some of that information we have in-house. At the same time, we have a very strong standard stewardship approach to things. And we can only use data for use cases that have been provide to us. So we are working with insurers to validate the use case and I honestly bring on customers. So hopefully, maybe a little long-winded, but a full answer to your questions.
Bill Warmington: Well, thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. You may ask your question.
Andrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Realizing your acquisitions of Genscape and FAST are still pretty fresh. I was hoping you could provide an update on how those integrations are trending. And then any commentary on the early pipeline builds for those products? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Integrations are right on-track with both of them. We actually just reviewed that a week ago. And with respect to everything from cost factors to sales, they are performing almost exactly the way that we expected them to. And in both cases they nest very nicely inside of existing organizations. So these transitions have been very organic. And the pipelines are good. The pipelines are strong.
Lee Shavel: The other thing I would add is, I think that there is a genuine enthusiasm in the case of Genscape among the Wood MacKenzie team, for the ability to utilize that data and integrate it in their analysis and the products that they're serving for their clients. So every time I'm in contact with Wood MacKenzie, I hear their enthusiasm for utilizing that data. FAST is more recent, but I can tell you, I think the -- on the Insurance side, particularly on the life side, our ability to work with them as we described before high level of excitement about what we can potentially accomplish together.
Stacey Brodbar: Final question?
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. You may ask your question.
Joseph Foresi: Yes. So maybe I should ask like an 18-part question. I'm just -- I'll give you a softball to end the day. On the Insurance and energy side, maybe you could talk about the differences in the demand backdrop heading into 2020 versus 2019, either from a pipeline, or necessity on your customer part perspective? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So let me just give you the perspective that really explains Verisk Analytics. We have -- and this has been true for a long period of time. Our company has grown faster than the end markets that we serve. And the reason is that our customers are rotating their own budgets in the direction of what it is that we do. They want to become more automated. And they want to become more deeply analytic in the way that they run their businesses. So you will see a lot of discussion about the level of technology spending on the part of the companies that populate the verticals that we serve. And that in and of itself is a very constructive trend. But you have to actually take that pool of spending and break that down further into sort of data center, keep the lights on, sort of spending versus the platformed analytic environments analytic objects that we provide. And even within the technology category there has been a rotation in the direction of what we do. So, if you're looking for explanation, in terms of where our business is, and where it's going to go, that is the driving force of what our companies are trying to do. And the fact that because of our vertical approach, we understand their issues. We have deeply intimate relationships because we sell -- in the case of Insurance, we may be selling up to 20 families of solutions to our customers. And from all this depth of relationship and all of the data that they make available to us, it is really the perfect place from which to try to think about the next thing that they need and work collaboratively with them to develop it. And that's why our business grows. The actual macro environments inside of Insurance and energy, I mean, they sort of wax and wane, a little bit. But I don't -- those will not -- in my view have explanatory power in terms of the growth of our business in 2020, 2021 and on.
Joseph Foresi: Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: You're welcome.
Operator: There are no further question at this time. Presenters, you may continue.
Scott Stephenson: Yes, great. Well, thanks everybody for joining us. And as Lee mentioned, we'll have a number of follow-ups with you and look forward to those. Thanks for your interest. We'll speak with you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-30 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Verisk Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, all participants have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations Ms. Stacey Brodbar for opening remarks and introduction. Ms. Brodbar you may begin your conference.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Jay and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide a brief overview of the strategic direction of our business. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer will then provide an update on our insurance segment. Lastly, Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer will highlight some key points about our financial performance. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the investor section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacy. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Verisk had another strong quarter of growth fueled by our market-leading innovation and continued focus on delivering an exceptional customer experience. Verisk reported organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.6% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.7%. This growth was driven by strength in our Insurance segment and solid improvements in Energy and Specialized Markets. On the innovation front, I'm especially pleased to see strong revenue growth tied to the investments, we have made in platformed analytic environments. Such environments include our visualized ClaimSearch for fraud fighting and claims adjudication; our Touchstone platform for catastrophe modeling X1 for global property estimating, Lens for energy analytics; and our PowerAdvocate platform were adjusting and understanding supply chain costs in the Energy space. These platforms take the level of intimacy with our customers and their workflows to a whole new level and deliver enhanced growth and operating leverage. Specifically at Wood Mackenzie, this month we released the second module to Lens called global upstream valuation, which expands screening and valuation capabilities across the whole world. This solution enables our customers to analyze and interact with out comprehensive global upstream data set to make faster data-driven commercial decisions. We continue to be encouraged by the early results of Lens, but equally important is the fact that having a new and unique product in the marketplace has really energized our sales teams. This has translated into improving sales of our core research as well as strong growth in our breakout solutions, including subsurface, chemicals and the energy transition practice. Our energy transition practice was previously known as power and renewables and this shift reflects our commitment to helping our clients cope with changes in the energy markets. In our PowerAdvocate business we are experiencing strong growth as we are helping our energy customers use data to more effectively spend their capital and save costs. We see opportunities to leverage the C-suite relationships from Wood Mackenzie to introduce PowerAdvocate at an enterprise-wide level and also to help bring our spend and cost solution. One of my leading indicators of the health of our business is how we are doing with the new disruptive players in our verticals as well as the largest and most established players. We are doing well on both fronts. We continue to win new business with InsurTech as they find value in our full suite of solutions and we continue to see progress in the cross-selling of even more valuable solutions to the established leaders in all three of our verticals. I spent several weeks in Asia recently visiting with client leaders across our verticals from Saudi Arabia to India to Japan. What struck me was how alert the CEOs of the leading companies around the globe are to data analytic innovation and their extreme interest in Verisk solutions. We see this driving an increasing level of inquiry and a growing pipeline of opportunities for our products. I'm also pleased with the progress, we have made with respect to our infrastructure and analytic methods over the past 90 days. We continue to make steady progress in moving our computing infrastructure to the cloud. In the past you've heard me talk about how cloud capacity grows in a linear fashion, whereas on-premise computing gets retired episodically at what I call shelves. Because of the great work of our team, we have now reached the first of those shelves and are seeing the expected efficiencies. We will continue to pursue these infrastructure improvements and savings persistently by product over the next few years. The global expansion of our data science team is coming along nicely and we are delighted with the quality and capacity of our emerging data science team in Kraków. We are now out in the market with industry-standard insurance solutions that incorporate machine-learned methodologies which take the world of regulatory-ready methods to a whole new level. On the strategic acquisition front our focus continues to be on adding valuable data sets within our existing verticals that can be leveraged across our enterprise to drive high returns on capital. Genscape and BuildFax represent opportunities to both extend their businesses and enhance our existing products and relationships. Genscape is a market leader in sensed data for the power, oil and gas and maritime end markets. Genscape uses a network of sensors to gather for -- or near real time. We believe we can create value by combining Genscape's real-time short-term data set with WoodMac's longer-term asset valuation data sets. We plan to develop new analytics solutions based on these combined data sets and ultimately see the data set incorporated into the Lens platform so that it can be seamlessly integrated into customers' workflows. We also see opportunities to cross-sell and expand into new client segments as there is limited customer overlap. Ultimately, we believe that Genscape as a part of WoodMac will bolster our journey as the energy mix shifts toward more of a balance between molecule-based and electron-based. BuildFax is a leading provider of proprietary condition and history data with a blue-chip customer base that is now part of our ISO underwriting business. We are excited to incorporate building property data and analytics solutions and see opportunities to develop new solutions as we partner with our insurance customers to help them drive their underwriting process to become quicker and more precise. We also see real opportunity to expand distribution and cross-sell BuildFax's core products across our customer base. Finally I'd like to take a minute to clarify developments in the imaging space. In connection with the jury verdict and associated injunction related to the Geomni roof report business we have recorded a $125 million legal reserve. We were disappointed in the verdict and plan to appeal once we receive final judgment. With respect to the current operations, the ruling pertains to only some of what we do in our Geomni unit and our roof report business represents about 1% of our annual revenues. We are energetically working to develop a non-infringing alternative method to the current tech adjusting the cost structure over the next few quarters in light of the injunction. To that end, we are taking aggressive steps to minimize the negative impact on profitability and cash flow of the roughly $7 million in lost quarterly revenue and should see sequential progress over the next several quarters. Perhaps the most important thing to note about our imagery business is the asset we have built in our image library and our image capture program. We now have a distinctive data asset on a national scale. We continue to believe strongly that the combination of automated measurement through remote imagery and automated estimation and create great value for our insurance customers for Verisk and for our shareholders and remain committed to and is exciting about these technologies as ever. Having gone through a number of specifics let me give you my overall assessment of where we stand. Our verticals are in great shape with a notable achievement of Energy and Specialized Markets exceeding Insurance's organic growth rate for the first time thus expanding our sticky recurrent subscription revenues. Our technical infrastructure is becoming more efficient in real-time and the technical talent of our team has grown through tapping new talent sources. We've supplemented our data sets with two acquisitions that we can leverage across our enterprise. While we have lost the contribution to revenue growth provided by 1% of our revenue, we exit the quarter stronger than we entered it. And now I'll turn the call over to Mark to provide some insights on our Insurance segment.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. I'm pleased to share with you that we had another strong quarter in Insurance with all businesses looking to growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.7% was fueled by market-leading innovation and enhanced customer engagement. Our retention rates remain very high as we continue to focus on getting close to our customers and delivering a best-in-class customer service experience. During the quarter, underwriting and rating delivered strong organic constant currency revenue growth across both personal and commercial lines underwriting, extreme event modeling, and industry-standard insurance programs. We continue to see great success in market share gains in personal lines due to the strong sales of our LightSpeed Auto suite of products. We're excited about the new sales and growing pipeline for our data-forward LightSpeed platform, extended into small commercial and personal property. In the industry standard insurance programs, we're experiencing growth in customer accounts. We've had success winning engagements with new start-ups and InsurTech. In extreme event modeling, we're experiencing solid demand for our detailed models, driven by signings with new clients as well as expanding relationships with existing clients. We're also seeing increased interest in some of our newer solutions including our global resilience practice which works with governments and NGOs. During the quarter, we hosted several successful seminars for our catastrophe modeling business in Auckland, Sydney, London, and Zurich that touch more than 350 clients and prospects. And in October, we hosted Verisk Velocity, our signature event for underwriting and rating. The event focused on the future of the insurance industry with an eye towards digitization and automation of the insurance process. The conference attendance increased 46% versus last year as we attracted attendees from 130 insurance companies from around the world. Feedback was positive from participants. We're excited about the direction of our new solutions and our thought leadership in the property and casualty insurance industry. The agenda feature presentations and panel discussions by industry-thought leaders and allowed Verisk to showcase our latest pipeline InsurTech solution. In fact, our customers are telling us that they look to Verisk to drive forward the innovation agenda because we not only develop leading solutions, but we can back them up with financial strength in a long and stable operating history. The claims business also delivered solid growth with contributions from claims analytics, repair cost estimating, remote imagery, and our international businesses. As Scott mentioned, we're seeing nice success with our visualized ClaimSearch platform, which is delivering significant growth in usage and positive sentiment in customers. The platform offers customers improvements like real-time analytics, improved security and privacy protection, fast delivery, and is seamlessly integrated into workflows and claim systems. On the international side, we're seeing solid growth from recent acquisitions like Validus in claims subrogation solution and ENI, claims automation, and fraud detection solution. They're now part of organic. A steady stream of first-to-market innovations is one of the four distinctives at Verisk and also a key driver of our growth. In the quarter, we announced several exciting new initiatives including the launch of our Sequel product suite in the U.S. The early feedback from the market is positive and the pipeline of interest from among our specialty commercial customers is robust. We also announced solutions in new partnerships within the life insurance market. These solutions utilize the most advanced data analytic methods including advanced voice analytics, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and will enable Verisk to develop new benchmarking risk-scoring solutions that can help life insurance on direct policies and managed portfolio risk with increased speed and precision. With that, let me now turn it over to Lee to cover the financials.
Lee Shavel: Thanks Mark. First I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. The presentation provides background, data trends, and analysis to support our conversation today. Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 9% to $653 million. In the current quarter, we incurred some significant non-operating expenses including firstly, the $125 million litigation reserve related to our remote imagery business; secondly, $29 million in acquisition-related earnout expenses as many of our acquisitions are on target to achieve payments for exceptional performance; and thirdly, a $6 million loss generated from the sale of our retail analytics solutions business, which was previously part of our Financial Services segment. In light of these expenses, net income and diluted GAAP EPS decreased approximately 80% to $33 million and $0.20 per share respectively. Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for non-operating items including currency fluctuations, acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons, acquisition-related costs including earn-outs, dispositions and non-recurring items including the litigation reserve, remained solid. On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 7.6% in the third quarter of 2019, reflecting organic growth across all three segments and delivering on our long-term target of 7% growth. Of our three segments, Energy and Specialized Markets recorded the fastest growth, while Insurance also delivered solid results. This was offset in part by softer growth within Financial Services. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 7.7% demonstrating organic constant currency margin expansion, while also continuing to invest in future growth opportunities within our business. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 47.4%, flat with the prior year period. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenue and EBITDA. Acquisitions decreased total adjusted EBITDA points in the period. On an organic basis and particularly on the pre-investment organic basis that we've discussed before, we saw a margin expansion demonstrating the exceptional operating leverage at the core of our businesses. On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 7.7% revenue growth, while adjusted EBITDA increased 7.9%. Within our underwriting and rating business, growth was very broad across our solution sets in personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, LightSpeed auto suite of products, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe model solutions revenue. We also had positive contributions from our international business. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance in claims analytics, repair cost estimating solutions, remote imagery solutions and international markets. Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined 25 basis points to 53.1% from 53.3% in the prior year period, reflecting leverage in our core business more than offset by investment in future growth opportunities and acquisitions. Our fastest-growing segment was Energy and Specialized Markets, which delivered revenue growth of 8.7% for the quarter, representing record growth for that segment. Strong growth in market and cost intelligence solutions, as well as noted improvement in our core research and consulting revenues, drove the growth. Despite volatility in the oil price and recent geopolitical events in the quarter, we continue to see a stable macro mat with new and innovative platforms that help our customers more efficiently drive revenue growth and deliver cost savings. Adjusted EBITDA increased 10.9%, reflecting leverage on solid sales balanced with ongoing investments in breakout opportunities like Lens and our chemicals, subsurface and energy transition practice. Total adjusted EBITDA margin grew to 33.3% from 31.7%. Financial Services revenue increased 2.7% in the quarter, led by solid growth in enterprise data management and fraud and credit risk management solutions. This was offset in part by decreases in portfolio management from non-recurring consulting revenues as well as some pushouts of certain projects. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3.5% and total adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 32.8% from 35.5%. We have discussed previously the journey we are on to transition this business from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach, with an emphasis on steady growth. Change at scale is never linear and as we work through this process we will continue to see quarterly fluctuations on revenue and growth, which are higher than in our other business segments. That said, we are confident in the long-term potential of financial services as we set the business up on a stronger foundation. In the third quarter of 2019, the company completed an additional $200 million issuance of our 4.125 percentage senior notes due 2029 at an issuance price of 110.9% for an effective yield of 2.78%, into a fourth amendment to our revolving credit facility which reduced the borrowing capacity to $1 billion from $1.5 billion, extended the maturity date to August 15, 2024 and amended the pricing grid with lower rates and improved economics. Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter down 3.2% from the prior year quarter due to the net repayments of our revolving credit facility. Total reported debt was $2.7 billion at September 30 unchanged from the year-end of 2018. Our leverage at the end of the quarter -- of the third quarter 2019 was 2.4 times. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $312 million at September 30, 2019. Our reported effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter compared to 13.9% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of a lower level of option exercises and nondeductible earnout expenses in the current -- period. We maintain our estimate of our effective tax rate in the full year 2019 to be between 19% and 21%. Adjusted net income was $186 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.12 for the third quarter, up 2.6% and 3.7% respectively. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a decrease in interest expense and lower share count. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter down 5.7% from the prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $780 million year-to-date, up 2.5% from the prior year. Capital expenditures were $61 million for the quarter, up 10.1% from the prior year and CapEx represented 9.3% of total revenue in the quarter. We now expect capital expenditures to come in at the low end of the $220 million to $240 million range, we provided for 2019. Free cash flow was $153 million for the quarter a decrease of 10.8% from the prior year, primarily due to higher income tax payments associated with a lower level of option exercises and timing differences related to the payment of certain expenses. Free cash flow was $627 million year-to-date, an increase of 3.4% from the prior year. During the third quarter we returned -- reserves through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 491,000 shares at a weighted average price of $152.84 for a total cost of $75 million. At September 30, we had $228 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the fourth quarter. And on September 30, we paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. This year, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on December 31, 2019 for shareholders of record on December 13, 2019. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and continue to manage capital prudently through internal investment strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders, being confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. My first question is just broadly around innovation and I guess the existing contribution from those products. You mentioned a lot on the call today. And I think recently you launched the cyber data exchange court side etcetera, etcetera. Is there any way to parse out like how much of the last several years innovation is contributing to the revenue growth today?
Scott Stephenson: It's kind of hard to separate the effects Manav and reason is that, some of the innovation shows us as an entirely unique product with a very discrete revenue stream, but it also shows up as increased penetration of an existing product or price realization related to an existing product. So it actually shows up in several places and an example of that would be the Lens platform which is supportive of – solutions, but also represents a discrete revenue stream in and of itself.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan. Your line is open.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you. Scott, you discussed the impact of the litigation with regard to Geomni. But could you just give us a sense of if you feel the future opportunity is reduced? Or I know you mentioned you're trying to find non-infringing ways to address the roofing opportunity. But are you shifting some focus to the non-roofing opportunities? Or just I guess, how should we think about the future here?
Scott Stephenson: So we've always been interested in remote imagery for a whole variety of reasons and actually those reasons relate to use cases, which are even beyond the insurance vertical and we're -- well. So first of all by way of context what we do is a lot more than just roof reporting. And we remain very interested in the category. We think that imaging remotely and then being able to in a very automated way translate what you've seen with the sensor is just -- that's an important technology for the world going forward, and we're intending to participate in it. We have participated in it and there are a number of ways to monetize the imagery itself. And so, no, I don't think that our opportunity is -- we don't see it any differently than we did.
Toni Kaplan: Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: Welcome. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra. Your line is open.
Ashish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Can you just help size the annualized revenues for the two acquisitions Genscape and BuildFax? And then also just talk about the historic growth and margin profile for these two acquisitions. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yeah. Ashish thanks for the question. We haven't broken out the revenues for those acquisitions separately. It will become organic. We're still closing Genscape and expect that within the next couple of weeks. But I would expect for the organic components incorporated in the fourth quarter results where you begin to get some sense of the scale of that.
Ashish Sabadra: That’s helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas [ph]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, Morning. Just wanted to stick with the Genscape acquisition. I was -- I know you guys gave some good color in your remarks and I appreciate that. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the product set, how it's complementary to your existing business potentially with an example. And then any synergies we can think about in pairing that with the Verisk business as it stands today? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Sure. So first of all just -- I want to make sure everybody understands the breadth of what we do in the energy space. So we work with oil and gas companies on a global basis. We work with those who are producing the alternatives in terms of the renewables and we also work with electric utilities. So I wanted to sell that -- to say that the way that the Genscape business got built was by creating sensors, which actually talk about real-time flows in those ecosystems. So, for example, there are sensors that are literally measuring the amount of current running through the transmission line. There are sensors, which are literally metering the flow of liquefied natural gas for example. And these real-time data sets, we think are very complementary to the data sets we've already got. So in what we do with Wood Mackenzie, we have really good granular operating data, for example, from the wellhead. But it's not as real-time as these other data sets that we're talking about. So now pull those two data sets together and provide even more of a perspective about what's happening commodity by commodity, location by location. And we just know that that's going to be valuable for our customers.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee. Your line is open.
Gary Bisbee: Yeah, thanks good morning. So, Scott you've been talking for a while now probably a couple of years about just the work you're doing with your technology infrastructure moving where appropriate to the cloud. You've also alluded to some efficiencies there and obviously, a lot of discussion of innovation. So can you just take a step back for us and talk about how you see the cloud and where you are in the process number one? Number two, what you see the long-term opportunity? As I'm sure you're aware a number of your information services for have actually proven out meaningful cost saves but also have seen the ability to accelerate their innovation efforts by getting more of their data into the cloud and hooking customers into that. So, are you on that same path? Do you see those same opportunities? And where exactly are you today? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So, we -- yes, I mean so you really had there Gary the two categories of benefit that arise from rotating our infrastructure into the cloud. So, one of them has to do with agility and that has to do with we can compute anywhere around the world literally by going to our say AWS dashboard and turning on new servers. It's that easy and it's that fast. So, the ability to spin up new products I would also say that our customers are increasingly interested in being able to interact with what we provide in a whole variety of ways. To the extent that what they're interested in is the sort of API on demand kind of approach then being already platforms in the cloud just makes it even that easier for them to attach to it. So, you've got all those benefits and then you've got cost benefits. And so we're very much in pursuit of both of those. With respect to where we are in the journey, so you're right. We've been talking about it for a couple of years. It's a lot of heavy lifting and it does play out over time. So, what I said in my remarks earlier is we've reached the first shelf. So, we've seen the first return of efficiency on the investments we've been making in moving to the cloud. There will be several more shelves over the course of the next couple of years. And so we feel very good about where we are. I'll just say that we have a very close relationship with one of the cloud provider -- convenient to sort of dig in, especially with one of them. And they give us a lot of feedback that says that we're actually in advanced implementation of cloud computing at the scale that we're doing it. So, we -- there's a -- we still have a good distance to go. Actually I look forward to the next shelves. But in the meantime, I'm very pleased with the work that our team is doing.
Lee Shavel: And Gary this is Lee. Just to supplement that a bit. And one thing that I want to make certain that everyone understands is that this is a discipline in a process. It's not a monolithic project where you do every -- a hundreds of individual products that need to be the data sets the applications need to be moved to the cloud. The code needs to be optimized for the cloud and so it is an ongoing process. What I can assure you is that the economics are very good both from an OpEx standpoint and from a CapEx standpoint. We are taking this with some kind of key projects that we've demonstrated what we can accomplish and that's guiding us in the future projects ahead. So, we think this will be a very clear uplift for us from a capital efficiency and from a margin perspective that will factor into our ability to further enhance our operating leverage across the business. But I want to make sure that everyone has an appreciation. This is something that you literally have to go product-by-product in order to make sure that you're fully realizing the potential.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler. Your line is open.
Jeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask about Energy and Specialized Markets and just make sure I'm not missing anything but it feels like the phrase solid improvement is underselling how good the numbers look to me. And when you describe it, I hear a lot of positive factors that sound recurring with I guess PowerAdvocate, cross-selling, the improvement in research and consulting and the Lens benefits. So, is there any significant one-time revenue from consulting? Or I don't know if there's PowerAdvocate success fees or anything like that in the quarter. Or just curious on kind of the way you're characterizing the performance of that business. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yes. Thank you Jeff. We're obviously pleased with the results. I think I would try to break it down a bit by saying we saw solid improvement in those WoodMac -- in both the subscription and the consulting revenues at WoodMac. So, there was progress there. And PowerAdvocate is clearly contributing and I would say had -- is having an exceptional 2019 as a result from some very good pipeline build at the end of 2018 and into 2019. And so part of driving through, we are seeing that reflected both in some of the implementation revenue as well as the subscription revenue, but over time we will expect to see a higher percentage of that kind of core subscription and recurring revenue within it. Again, it's still primarily recurring revenue, but we are at the front end of some of their success early in the year in bringing new clients onto their solutions platform.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey: Hi. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. I wonder Mark or Lee, if you could just remind us about the macro exposure and insurance. And I'm thinking about two factors: one, generally a hardening P&C market to the extent we go into that kind of environment, how that might affect the insurance business; and then two, if you could just give us an update on cat modeling. We heard one of your competitors perhaps if the reinsurance market continues to soften. Doesn't seem appearing in your results, but I'm just wondering if you could weigh in sort of at a high level on those items?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So let me try to take those and you already ask them. So first of all, I think the general macro environment has been -- needs to be positive. There is a hardening in the market, especially around some of the commercial lines. Over the years, we have distanced our pricing from the actual premium. So if you have this history, I will tell you we are much more thoughtful about long-term contracts and -- but there is a little bit of a pull associated with more premium and there's more utility of the solutions. So, there's a little more value on pricing that we would gain. But I think the bigger macro trend is as the markets harden everyone is kind of focused on the top line and growing it profitably. So the use of our solutions, I think continues to expand. People look to go into different lines and grow. And purchase is more easily -- it's easier to get through procurement in an environment where growth is happening. So those are kind of the general trends that affect us inside the market. I would also tell you from a macro perspective the industry is very much focused on big data analytics. So we're right in the wheelhouse there. They're focused on automation. They're trying to become more efficient. There's a lot of technology projects in search of automation. That works to our advantage as well. And finally, where we're trying to play more is inside the world of digitization. They're trying to make sure that their digital engagement with their policyholders continues to grow. And we had some solutions that help them. I don't want to make this too long. On the sort of reinsurance side, we do see an opportunity or at least more consolidation among reinsurers. When that happens, it does cause a little bit of a challenge as we kind of renegotiate with the combined entity. But generally, we have seen increased engagement with insurers and reinsurers on the extreme event modeling side of things. There has been kind of a little bit of a turn, where people are coming and moving towards our AR models and that is a broad kind of industry trend that we are very happy with and I think they recognize the power of the Touchstone platform that Scott was referring to earlier. I hope that responds to your question.
Andrew Jeffrey: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of George Tong. Your line is open.
George Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Scott with respect to the EagleView ruling you've indicated that you're working to adjust the cost structure of Geomni. My understanding is that Geomni is running at a loss. Just to confirm are you planning to taper your breakout investment spend in Geomni? Or are you planning to stay the course but redirect your investments elsewhere in aerial imagery?
Lee Shavel: Yeah. So George, thanks for the question. So as we described recognizing that we have this impact on the roof report revenue, our objective is to look for efficiencies that we can achieve in reducing the costs related to that dimension of the business. And again, that's just a part of the business in order to minimize the impact of that revenue -- the revenue loss. At the same time, as Scott described, our commitment to the technology, our investment in the broader application of that business will continue. So we're trying to accomplish both of those, maintaining that commitment exploring the other applications and developing those dimensions, while at the same time offsetting as much as possible on that loss of revenue.
George Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Christopher Campbell. Your line is open.
Christopher Campbell: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Just kind of a follow-up question on the Geomni question before. Is there -- I'm assuming that the margins are lower in the Geomni roof than your legacy P&C business. So with, like, kind of the rightsizing of this business, would that be accretive for Insurance segment margins?
Scott Stephenson: Well, we're not making a forward statement about where the margins are going. But what I will say is, it has been a category of heavy investment on our part. And one of the things I was trying to emphasize in my comments upfront, because we made a lot of investments in image capture. We now have a national image capture capability.
Lee Shavel: And I would confirm your assumption that on some of the non-roof report legacy businesses, that those were positive margin businesses and that the -- in development on the roof report, given the scaling up of those expenses, we're -- as we've indicated before, had a negative impact overall to our margins as we were in investment phase. So I think that observation is accurate.
Christopher Campbell: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi. Your line is open.
Joseph Foresi: Hi. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what the second shelf that you're referring to looks like, either from a margin or cash flow perspective. And what are the puts and takes on the margin side as we head into 2020?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So maybe, Lee, you'd like to conclude and respond to that. But I'll just open by saying that there are really sort of two discrete things that go on as we hit these shelves. So one of them is -- and I'm pretty sure we've talked about this before, there's been a mainframe intensity to the way that we compute at Verisk. That's because of our long legacy as an extremely data-rich company. And when this company first got going the mainframe configuration was very definitely the logical way to try to manage large data sets. But that's not true anymore. There has been change there. So one of the shelf-creating developments is when we retire mainframe capacity and that is an ongoing activity. So that's one. And then, the second is, when we close data centers and that also will contribute shelves at moments in time as we go forward. There are really no trade-offs, actually. I mean, in -- as I've said before, obviously, we build in a linear way the cost associated with cloud computing. But when I say there are no trade-offs I'm really saying two things. One is, the unit economics of computing in the cloud are just superior, period. But the second thing is, actually, and Lee mentioned this when he took on the topic before, we actually are taking this opportunity to think about the very nature of our platforms. Literally, how does the calculation work? And as we move things up into the cloud, we're actually sort of peeling open the applications and reconsidering, you do this, you do this, then you do that, are there ways to be more efficient in capacity. And so, it's actually a very constructive exercise. We just have to continue to be vary in touch with the way that the algorithms tool and the way that the -- the very nature of our data and how we put together our data sets. So there are no trade-offs. Actually, it's constructive microeconomically. It's constructive in terms of responsiveness to customers. And actually, we're just treating it as a journey to tighten up a lot of things about the way that we operate.
Mark Anquillare: And the only thing that maybe I'll use, tiers or shelves, there's a lot of investment that's required to do it right, right? You need to make sure you tune the application, so you use the cloud properly, so you don't overuse the processing time and effort. And as you transition, besides kind of this code rewrite, you're also taking advantage of cheaper database management systems and things like that. So there's a ramp-up of cost before you see the benefit. And some of those are kind of trading off inside of our P&L and CapEx. And I just want to share that perspective with you about the timing of the shelves.
Joseph Foresi: From a quantitative perspective on, what the margins -- what this means for margins, going forward? I would assume that, Geomni kind of continuing to be more and more profitable and the data centers shifts going on. And we're moving towards the second shelf, that the margins would naturally start to improve. But I just don't want to get ahead of myself from a modeling perspective. Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yeah. So let me try to kind of give some context around that. So, I think, what you heard in Scott and Mark's comments are, that yes there certainly is a cost savings in terms of achieving the shelves. But also it is kind of the net effect of taking on the cloud costs, and then also optimizing the business. And so, there is a complicated dimension to this. I want to underscore one thing. There clearly is a margin opportunity for us. But it consists both of greater OpEx efficiency, but also overall improvement in the operating leverage of the business itself in terms of what the applications can do and their ability to integrate other data and expand that. And again adding another layer of complexity, we have a large number of products and businesses that we are moving to the cloud of how applicable cloud is to what they do, and with different time lines. And so, it is impossible to extract what the quantum of that margin improvement is. We're learning as we go with each individual project tackling the biggest ones first. But we will see that positive margin improvement that we manage as part of our overall core objective of increasing margin over time. And then also investing that margin expansion to some level, where we are investing in future growth. So, there is a lot of that. But it is clearly a very strong component of what will allow us to grow our core operating leverage further. And I know it would be great if we could provide some quantification. But it's just too large a project. And too complex for us to pin that to a specific number.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington. Your line is open.
Bill Warmington: Good morning, everyone.
Lee Shavel: Hi, Bill.
Bill Warmington: So a question for you on Financial Services, the -- just wanted to ask about the product push outs, whether those go into Q4 or whether they're going into 2020? Or is it indefinite. And then, sort of along those lines on the EDM transition to more of a subscription model, what inning are we in there?
Lee Shavel: Bill on the push outs I think, we had some of the third quarter revenues. And some of them are longer development products that got pushed out into the fourth quarter. There were some that I think they pushed out into 2020. So I think a combination there. And with regard to EDM, I think it is still a development project for us. We continue to see a very strong response from customers. And we're dealing with really substantiating this as a broader opportunity within the business on a client-by-client basis. So very early stage, but everything that we have seen and continues to keep us enthusiastic about this as a core service, that is additive to our most important and largest clients.
Bill Warmington: Well, thank you very much.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Presenters, you may proceed.
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. Thank you. So, thanks everybody for joining us. Appreciate the questions, and the dialogue will be following up with several of you. And have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-31 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. My name is Charelle, and I would be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Verisk Analytics' Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Ms. Brodbar, you may begin your conference.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Charelle, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide a brief overview of our business. Lisa Hannan, President of Verisk Financial Services, will then provide an update on our Financial Services segment. Lastly, Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer, will join the team for Q&A. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has been attached to an 8-K that has been furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Verisk delivered another strong quarter marked by solid 7.2% organic constant currency revenue growth, which remains the most important measure of the health of our organization. Moreover, our growth was driven by continued broad-based strength in our Insurance segment as well as marked improvement in our Financial Services segment.  At Verisk, it is our people that drive innovation, provide a great customer experience and are critical to delivering our consistent and solid financial results. As such, we are keenly focused on maintaining an environment that attracts and retains the best talent through strong recruitment, leading talent development programs and management training efforts, which ultimately results in highly engaged employees. I'm pleased to share that employee engagement at Verisk is on an upward trend, improving 2 percentage points from 2018. At the same time, we have maintained retention of our top performers at over 92% in each of the last three years in what is a very competitive labor market for our kind of talent. From a recruiting perspective, this summer, we are hosting our largest class of interns ever with 119 interns across all our business units who can serve as a pipeline for permanent hires.  On a training and development front, we are investing in our future by hiring talent earlier in the talent pipeline and training them ourselves instead of competing for experienced talent. As such, we have expanded our global data science excellence program, which is an internal four plus year rotational training program for data scientists with a Masters in Data Science or Data Analytics. We have also extended training programs for talent in key areas, including cloud architecture and artificial intelligence. We have enhanced our management training programs to include offerings for first-line managers as well as experienced leaders and have expanded our online education offerings in data science and analytics in connection with leading universities such as Johns Hopkins and University of Michigan.  Lastly, as part of our global talent optimization strategy, during the second quarter, we opened a new office in Kraków, Poland. This office focuses on data science and analytics talents, and we are seeing early success building out this team and have a strong pipeline of talent interested in joining Verisk. On the client engagement front, in June, we hosted Verisk Vision in London, our client conference tailored to the London and European markets. We hosted approximately 300 attendees for a daylong event that focused on the ongoing transformation in the insurance landscape and covered areas, including risk, claims and InsurTech such as cyber risk, artificial intelligence, antifraud analytics and digital transformation. The event also featured the Verisk innovation lab, which showcased product demos featuring new technologies and industry applications, which incorporate cutting-edge deals such as social media, image forensics, security and surveillance, aerial imagery and entity resolution. The event not only solidifies our position as an InsurTech thought leader, but it also strengthens our position as a key technology and data partner to the London and European insurance companies.  On the innovation front, we're seeing great success in gaining market share in personal lines due to strong sales of our LightSpeed suite of products. LightSpeed helps our insurance customers compete in the digital age as it utilizes innovative data-forward advanced analytics that enable insurers to provide a fully bindable quote on just three simple pieces of information. This addresses our customers' dual needs to both increase the velocity and efficiency of their operations by increasing the precision of their underwriting analytic. The result is more profitable conversion rates for our customers. Personal auto automation has led the way in this growth, quickly followed by personal property and small commercial.  At Wood Mackenzie, we continue to be encouraged by the early results of our data analytic platform called Lens. We have a strong pipeline of interest and continue to sign up new subscriptions with major oil companies, independents and global investment banks. Additionally, we are seeing solid double-digit growth in both visits and unique users to the platform. We continue to work in partnership with our customers to deliver an offering that is unique in the marketplace, one that is scalable, dynamic and integrated into their workflows. We plan to have the next module, global upstream valuations, for the Lens platform by year-end 2019, which we think will be very well received by the market. And in Financial Services, we're seeing great success with our merchant analytics platform, which Lisa will talk to you about in more detail.  Finally, we continue to be engaged on the strategic acquisition front with a focus on finding high return on invested capital transactions that leverage our scale, existing resource and deep domain expertise. We recently announced the acquisition of Keystone Aerial Surveys. Keystone is a leading aerial survey company with operations that cover the entire United States. Keystone will become part of Geomni, and it demonstrates our commitment to becoming a leader in aerial imagery, property analytics and geospatial data solutions. The addition of Keystone will accelerate our nationwide inventory coverage network and improve our refresh rate as we strive to bring our customers the most innovative and technologically superior geospatial solutions.  And now I'll turn the call over to Lisa to provide some insights on our Financial Services segment.
Lisa Hannan: Thank you, Scott. I'm excited to have the opportunity to provide you with an update on Verisk Financial Services, our business unit built through the combination of the legacy Argus platform with acquisitions that added capabilities and expanded our solution sets. Now that I've been in the role of President, Verisk Financial, for just over a year, it's a great time to discuss the progress we've made over the past 12 months, provide an update on our key strategic initiatives and share our vision for the future.  To start, I think it's important to take a step back to better understand where Verisk Financial Services is in our evolution and where we're headed. At the start of 2017, the Financial Services segment of Verisk consisted of the Argus business, which is a data contributory consortia business working with the leading banks and payment companies around the globe, including the top 30 credit card issuers in North America, the U.K. and Australia. Argus offers our customers unique solutions such as tracking and measurement of over $2 trillion worth of consumer spending annually as well as industry benchmarking and portfolio profitability analytics.  Throughout 2017, we made several business acquisitions that aligned from a strategic and financial perspective and added capabilities to our existing services. In early 2018, we dedicated significant attention to integrating the acquired companies from an operating perspective, and we began creating a unified go-to-market presence under the Verisk Financial brand. In May of 2018, the management team went through a comprehensive strategic analysis of each of our solutions within Verisk Financial. We examined critically and dispassionately what Verisk financial was doing very well and where we could improve. Based on this analysis, we developed an integrated strategic plan for the business. The first change, which many of you may recall from our December Investor Day, was to align our go-to-market strategy around four solution sets.  The first of these is portfolio management solutions, our legacy consortia-based products, which provide industry benchmarking and portfolio profitability analysis for credit cards, payments and retail banking customers around the globe. Second is credit risk and fraud management solutions, our portfolio of bankruptcy and merchant acquirer risk solutions and our new suite of fraud solutions for our banking clients. The third is spend analytics and marketing solutions, which encompasses our cards' marketing models, consumer and merchants' insights and media measurement solutions. And finally, enterprise data management solutions, comprised of our global regulatory reporting platform and client-specific data management, MIS, and data advisory solutions.  I'm happy to report that one year in, we're seeing the benefits of this solution-based orientation beginning to pay off. There is momentum in each of our solution sets with particularly strong performance from our media measurement, merchant analytics and portfolio management solutions during the first half of the year. And while enterprise data management is a newer and developing business for Verisk, which tends to have more quarter-to-quarter variability, we are experiencing sequentially improving trends with the introduction of some of our key strategic initiatives in that area.  And in addition to reorienting our business, we've also implemented a number of operational improvements, including strengthening and reorganizing our sales team around the four solution sets for more comprehensive and holistic go-to-market sales strategy and implementing Lean Six Sigma and process automation. These changes have already created significant benefits to our business. For example, our process improvements for portfolio benchmark reporting have led to a 35% reduction in processing time each month. And the automation of report summarization module alone for benchmarking led to a laborsaving of 200 hours from us, allowing us to free up resources for new product development efforts. We believe that the investment in time to improve our operations ultimately creates a better environment for our innovation and growth.  As we brought several smaller businesses together with our Argus platform, we've also made some key strategic decisions. We have rationalized head count and updated our client pricing structure for our enterprise data management offerings based in India. We have reduced our reliance on business opportunities that led to onetime, short-term revenues in favor of longer-term subscription-based growth. And most recently, we sold our Verisk retail loss prevention business as it was no longer fit within our new Verisk financial strategic road map. Collectively, these decisions have led to a stronger, more aligned Verisk Financial Services unit that is better positioned for future growth.  As we look forward, we're ready to embark on the next phase of our business transformation. In addition to our relentless commitment to continuously improving our customer experience and our existing solutions, we are focused on long-term strategic growth, which is underpinned by the key strategic initiatives that we share during our Investor Day. These include introducing our next-generation benchmarking platform, expanding our spend analytics solutions globally, building our fraud solutions beginning with the fraud consortia in Mexico, advancing our cloud migration and developing a global regulatory analytic platform as part of our enterprise data management solutions. All of these initiatives are underway, meeting key milestones and beginning to deliver.  Of particular note, we are getting extremely strong market interest in the Mexico cards fraud consortia, which will deliver our first new consortia data set since 2016 when we launched the Australian card study, and the global regulatory platform as regulators around the globe embrace a data-driven approach to oversight. Our experience working with the OCC, the Fed and the CFPB in the U.S. as well as our work through the Lloyd's syndicates in the U.K. uniquely position us to meet the needs of both regulators and their regulated entities.  In addition to these Verisk financial strategic initiatives, we are also accelerating a cross-Verisk collaboration, working with our colleagues in the Insurance segment. We are currently working with our partners in underwriting and rating on enhancing lead generation and market prospecting as well as working with our colleagues in claims to elaborate on enhanced fraud solution.  In summary, I'm proud of our team and the progress we've made over the past year as we have synthesized a series of acquisitions to create Verisk Financial Services, a single cohesive operating unit. We have made tangible progress choosing long-term vision with near-term operating execution. Our bias is to action with the understanding that a world-class business isn't created overnight, but is instead the sum total of numerous incremental changes and consistent execution over time. We are confident in our long-term growth potential and look forward to sharing additional progress with -- updates with you in the future.  With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Lisa. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Presentation provides background, data trends and analysis to support our conversation today. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and a GAAP basis, revenue grew 8.5% to $653 million. Net income decreased 2% to $150 million while diluted GAAP EPS declined 1.1% to $0.90 per share for the second quarter 2019. As we previewed on last quarter's earnings call, both GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS were negatively impacted by the acceleration of $6 million in stock-based compensation in the quarter.  Let's now focus our quarterly discussion on our organic constant currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons, nonoperating acquisition-related costs, including earnouts, dispositions and nonrecurring items. We believe these are the best measures to evaluate the health of our overall business and are the metrics we use in our own compensation plans.  On an organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 7.2% in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting organic growth across all three segments and delivering on our long-term target of 7% growth. Growth was led by our Insurance segment, and we also delivered improving trends in Financial Services. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.2% and was 7.3% after normalizing for the accelerated expensing of stock-based compensation. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 46.6%, down from the 47.9% in the prior year primarily the result of the acceleration of stock-based compensation which decreased margins by approximately 1%. This total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and inorganic revenue and EBITDA. Acquisitions decreased total adjusted EBITDA margin by approximately 20 basis points in the period. The headwind from the acceleration of stock-based compensation is also reflected in the individual segment results as these costs have been allocated based on revenue contribution to Verisk.  On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 7.8% revenue growth while adjusted EBITDA increased 5.1%. Within our underwriting and rating business, growth was balanced across personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry-standard insurance programs, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions revenue. We're seeing strong uptake of our new innovative solutions, including LightSpeed auto, as our new data-forward products are designed to meet the needs of our Insurance customers for quicker, more efficient and easier to use solutions. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance in claims analytics, repair cost estimating and remote imagery solutions. This was offset in part by modest weakness in workers' compensation claim resolution services.  Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined 140 basis points to 53% from 54.4% in the prior year period. Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 5.5% for the quarter. Strong sales of market and cost intelligence solutions drove the growth. We also had positive contributions from core research and our environmental health and safety business. This was offset in part by softness in our consulting services related to strong performance from last year.  Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7%, reflecting, ongoing investments in breakout opportunities like Lens and our chemicals, subsurface and power and renewables breakouts. Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 29.9% from 31.8%. The largest factor in that margin decline was a nonoperational foreign currency translation loss. Excluding this item, margin in the segment would have been flat. Financial Services revenue increased 6.1% in the quarter led by solid growth in portfolio management and spend-informed marketing solutions revenues. As Lisa mentioned earlier, these improving results reflect the impact of the strategy that we implemented in 2018 to transition Verisk Financial Services from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach with an emphasis on steady growth. We expect that investors will continue to see more clearly the long-term growth potential of this segment over time as we continue to make progress with the transition.  Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.9%, and total adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 31.9% from 30.3%. Strong focus on expense management as well as leverage from the revenue growth drove the margin expansion. Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter, down 4.7% from the prior year quarter due to the net repayments of our revolving credit facility. Total reported debt was $2.5 billion at June 30, 2019, down from $2.7 billion at year-end 2018. And our leverage at the end of the second quarter was 2.1x. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $153 million at June 30, 2019. Our reported effective tax rate was 19.7% for the quarter compared to 17% in the prior year quarter primarily due to a lower level of option exercises. We maintain our estimate of our effective tax rate in the full year 2019 to be between 19% and 21%.  Adjusted net income was $184 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.10 for the second quarter, up 4.1% and 4.8%, respectively. After normalizing for the impact of the incremental stock-based compensation, diluted adjusted EPS would have grown 8.6%. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a decrease in interest expense and lower share count. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate. Net cash provided by operating activities was $200 million for the quarter, down 3.4% from the prior year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $566 million year-to-date, up 6% from the prior year.  Capital expenditures were $47 million for the quarter, down 16.4% from the prior year. CapEx represented 7.2% of total revenue, reflecting the expected decline in capital intensity as the result of reduced capital spending on the Geomni initiative following its initial ramp-up. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $220 million to $240 million for 2019. The free cash flow was $153 million for the quarter, an increase of 1.5% from the prior year. Free cash flow was $474 million year-to-date, an increase of 9.1% from the prior year.  During the second quarter, we returned $91 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 361,000 shares at a weighted average price of $138.32 for a total cost of $50 million. At June 30, 2019, we had $303 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $75 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the third quarter. On June 28, 2019, we paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. And on July 24, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on September 30, 2019, for shareholders of record on September 13, 2019. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and continue to manage capital prudently through internal investment, strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk.  [Operator Instructions]. I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Stacey Brodbar: Operator, we're ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And you do have a question from Toni Kaplan.
Toni Kaplan: Just taking a step back, you've had margin contraction in Insurance for the past 10 quarters, and you've been investing and experiencing an impact from dilutive acquisitions. But at some point, perhaps we could see that reverse. And so just given operating leverage of the business overall, I guess at what point do you think that we could start to see some margin leverage in Insurance specifically?
Lee Shavel: So Toni, thanks for the question. I think we've been focused on those -- on the year-over-year results. And when we look at this quarter's year-over-year performance from a margin standpoint, I think it's important to understand that if you take the timing -- compensation timing impact of about 1%, the margin in the second quarter of 53% would have been 54% versus 54.4% in the prior year period. And so that certainly is I would -- we would describe as flattish. And at the same time, recognizing that we have been making some significant investments in Geomni and telematics that have been accelerated as we've ramped up in particular, Geomni. And so we are making those investments with the expectation that those will be contributing to our margin improvement over time as we reach scale in those businesses. So I think it's the financial dimension, and I'll turn it over to Mark to provide some additional color here.
Mark Anquillare: Sure. I'll echo the investment we're making. I think the thing that I always like to emphasize is that inside the investment, what we have seen is our top line organically growing quicker, which means our bottom line EBITDA cash flow is growing quicker. So I think that's been successful. We have been disciplined in the way we spend and invest. And I think there is scale clearly in the business as we take on pretty big investment in something like aerial imagery and IoT. So I just want to provide a little bit of color that I think we've had quite a bit of success in the growth side of things.
Operator: Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik.
Manav Patnaik: I guess since you have Lisa on the call, maybe I can just ask on the Argus comments. I think there was a comment about updating the pricing structure to more subscription-based revenue, and that might have been specific to the EDM business based in India. So I was wondering if you can just elaborate on that with some context on how much of Argus today is subscription. And are there any other areas there that you could see similar pricing structure updates?
Lisa Hannan: Sure. There were two things. The first is that as we've begun integrating the companies that we acquired, the business that we acquired in India, we did go through a rigorous review of all of their solutions and the pricing for those solutions relative to our investment in those solutions. Based on that, we have updated our pricing structure for solutions-based set of India. Those are primarily subscription-based solutions. In addition, across all of the Argus business, we have also been changing and shifting our mix towards more subscription-based and product-driven solutions as opposed to onetime implementations or initial development revenue up-front and more heavily weighted in the current year. As we implement some of our data analytic solutions, the enterprise data management solutions, we're now orienting those to more of a longer-term subscription base as well. So in all the things that we're doing, we're looking for longer-term subscription-based revenue. Today, the percentage of revenue that's subscription-based is over 65%, close to 70%. We continue to move that up.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim McHugh.
Timothy McHugh: Just wondered on LightSpeed, you highlighted that this quarter. So can you talk about how customers are adopting that? Is that displacing prior methods of kind of underwriting and acquiring customers? Or is it used -- being used as an incremental? And then I think recently, you talked about taking Sequel to the U.S., which I believe is a new initiative. So I guess talk about the plans and how aggressively you're pursuing that.
Mark Anquillare: Great. Thanks, and this is Mark. So let me first talk a little bit about LightSpeed. Inside of the insurance process, there has typically been a two-step process. First, you provide a quote, and then people run what is typically all the reports and gather the information. There's a cost there before they bind the policy. So what we have attempted to do inside of our kind of ecosystem is create a very automated approach so they can flow this business, that's a term of ours, they can be completely automated, more accurate, more efficient. And we're bringing all the data needs up-front. We call it our data-forward strategy. So that represents kind of a different way of going to -- go to market. You can actually provide a quote, bind it all in one. Just an example, you talked about digital engagement. On the personal auto front, on a car insurance, about 33% of all quotes you get online change after people do that work. So very poor experience. And what we've done is we've taken things like motor vehicle reports, loss histories, prior losses, prior coverage, all the things about the driver and brought that up-front. And that has been adopted, well accepted, and we have a nice success on the insurance front. That kind of moves across auto, the homeowners and even into small commercial. That is our theme, and that's where we're headed.  I'm going to now flip over to the question on Sequel. Just to remind everybody, Sequel solution set which is, for the most part, all of the software to a service policy, starting from the up-front, within underwriting on to claims, all of that very much a industry standard inside the London insurance market, primarily around things that what I'll refer to as ISO. And most of Verisk hasn't been as focused on the non-admitted market, meaning the specialty lines, the really complex risks. What we have attempted to do is use some of that technology in some of our products here. But more importantly, what you saw in the press release is for specialty or complex insurance risk, we are going to bring Sequel to the United States. We seem to have quite a bit of interest. We are leveraging the teams in place, both on the claims side and on the ISO side of the underwriting side. And I think we're very optimistic that inside that niche specialty market, we have a solution that can win today. And we're optimistic.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman.
Andrew Steinerman: It's Andrew. Could you give us a sense how your Energy clients are doing as they're increasing spend with Wood Mac, which areas of interest is increasing with those Energy clients? And also, you mentioned cost intelligence with energy. I assume that's around PowerAdvocate. And could you give us a sense of how PowerAdvocate is do -- again evolving within Verisk?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So Scott here. And in reverse order, the PowerAdvocate suite is doing well. The traditional customer set for PowerAdvocate has been utilities. A lot of the motion in the business has been taking the same kind of solution into the oil and gas space, which is one of those places where PowerAdvocate is advantaged by being tied to the business with very substantial footprint we've already got in the oil and gas space. And then over on the traditional Wood Mac side in the oil and gas space, basically, there is a lot of interest in what the Lens platform provides, which is essentially more real time and more integrated into the customer workflows. And so it's essentially doing what we thought it would do, which is positioning our content even more deeply in the customer workflows. And that's the direction of travel. Basically, as the United States has sort of been differentially adding to the global supply curve, the U.S. environment is one where you're making operating decisions all the time as opposed to the traditional offshore decadal kind of investment cycle.  And so the need for real time, the need for more benchmark kinds of data just goes up, and that's exactly what we've been positioning for. So it's -- one of the leading metrics there is the rate of adoption of Lens among the oil and gas companies, both the integrated globals as well as the more pure-play E&P companies. And we're very happy with what's happening there.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Gary Bisbee.
Gary Bisbee: Thanks for the detailed rundown on Financial Services business. It sounds like you're making a lot of progress there. I guess the key question is, how do those changes impact how we should think about the medium- or longer-term growth potential of the business and maybe also profitability? Historically, before the recent couple years of challenges, I think there was clear discussion of this being the fastest growth or growing above the corporate average. Is that a reasonable and sustainable target at some point in the future based on the progress you're doing?
Lee Shavel: Gary, this is Lee. So for all three of our segments, our expectation that all of them have the ability to meet or exceed our long-term targeted 7% organic constant currency growth rate as well as to realize the operating leverage and achieve EBITDA faster than that. And so I think one of the challenges for investors, which we certainly empathize with, is that given some of the large contracts in contract transitions in the business made it difficult to see the underlying growth within the business. And so we wanted to focus on really developing the bottoms up approach to the business that Lisa described in each of the four solutions areas. And I think in those more traditional -- in the kind of the foundational benchmarking areas, those are probably mid-single digits growth elements. And the fraud, bankruptcy, enterprise data management, marketing spend analytics are newer, higher-growth businesses that we think contribute to achieving that 7% growth.  So no change in terms of our expectations of what the Financial Services business can achieve and can contribute to our overall growth rate, but there has been a shift in making sure that we're delivering that on a more sustainable and granular basis and that investors have greater clarity on that growth, which certainly I think within this quarter is a clear step in that direction.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi.
Joseph Foresi: I was wondering if you could talk about Geomni and some of the potential contribution to revenues and the CapEx that you've put in there and what stage that's in.
Mark Anquillare: This is Mark. Let me try to address that. So the opportunity with Geomni is very much focused on, first, ensuring that we have coverage, frequent refresh of those images. And with that, that library of information, our first step was really to address the claims-focused solutions in the insurance space. So literally, by using those advanced pictures and some advanced analytics, we can get measurements and do repair cost estimates for the claims departments from the sky. They then use maybe some desktop adjusting but, for the most part, a majority of that is done in a very automated fashion, saving a very significant cost to the insurers as well it's safer and more accurate. We have opportunities to bring that into underwriting as well as to the world of cat modeling.  But I want to highlight though that as much as our first use case was insurance, there's probably and there is bigger opportunities outside of the insurance space. So we have partnered up with some folks that are doing construction. We're doing work in the solar space. We're doing work across various verticals where that imagery and those exact measurements are very helpful. And Geomni is contributing nicely to that claims category inside of our growth rates for insurance.  So it continues to be investment-oriented. Keystone accelerates that investment for us because it replaces what we have to buy in the form of sensors, meaning big cameras as well as the planes. Keystone has it. They have operations. They have pilots. So this will accelerate our path to strength there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey.
Andrew Jeffrey: Yes. I wonder and I'm thinking about LightSpeed. But broadly across your business, can you talk about the extent to which InsurTech maybe is driving some of your growth and how structural that is? And whether as you look out to the market today, that's a potential growth acceleration driver over the next year or two?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Scott here. It has two effects on our business. So one is, if you think of InsurTech as a category of digitally enabled innovations, this is one of the things that actually our customers and all of our segments are looking for. They themselves are trying to transform their businesses making use of digital methods. And so here we are with our particular solution sets. They are rotating their budgets in the direction of making use of modern methods. So that's just a fundamentally constructive factor across everything we do basically. But in addition to that, when people refer to InsurTech, partly what they're talking about are new companies that are basically using digital methods fundamentally to change the distribution of insurance, the sourcing of insurance, customers presenting the insurance product to the end user.  And so these are some of the companies that get celebrated as startups that are -- sort of kind of present a new face to the insurance-consuming world. We've done very well with those companies as customers. So here they are. They're inventing a new insurance company. And we find that they just -- that they have voted with their feet and basically want to use our industry-standard solutions so that they have the benefit of efficiency, fighting fraud in effective way. One of the big issues you have when you emerge as an insurance company is you don't have a lot of experience. And so how are you going to anticipate where your losses are going to be and at what level? That's one of the things that our solutions just give you right out of the box. So it's really gratifying to see how many of them come our way when they form and then all of a sudden -- and I've had a chance to visit with the CEO -- even recently with the CEOs of some of these highly celebrated, emergent insurance companies. And they just -- they really, really like being a partner with Verisk.
Operator: And your next question comes from Jeff Meuler.
Jeffrey Meuler: Scott, I was just hoping you could extend your earlier comments around kind of human capital and the opening of the Kraków office. You relatively, I guess, acquired Wood Mac. And one of the points from the acquisition was expanding your global office footprint, but I know data nationalism always top of mind. So just roughly, what percentage of your data and analytics and tech head count or innovation head count is in the United States or more expensive labor markets today? Like how big is this long-term opportunity as a margin enhancement for you?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So the first thing that motivates us on this is access to talent. That's the thing that this is really about. So the reason we like Kraków so much is, as we expand our business in Europe, especially Continental Europe, having high-quality, technically deep people who also will get steeped in the verticals that we serve, having them right there to interact more easily with our customers is a really, really nice feature here. And then I'm glad you picked up on the point I was making about talent because that really is the wellspring for our company. And there's no question that everybody -- we have about 9,000 associates at Verisk now. Everybody really counts. There are some of the technical disciplines that are the ones that are particularly in demand. I ticked off a few of those, so being able to make cloud architectures that are secure and really work, sort of data science as in the transformation of the data.  There's also a big data engineering dimension always to what it is we do. And so there's no question that over the last couple of years as we have built those communities of people around Verisk differentially, the additions have been overseas between what we do on -- in Continental Europe, both in Spain and in -- now in Poland, we have added quite a few people in India. And so as a percentage of the additions to the team that we've made, they're coming more not in the United States than in the United States of late. Of course, we're building both sides but relatively, it's even more overseas. And I don't see that changing. But it's -- and it is constructive from a cost point of view as well. But to me, that's just a marker actually of supply and demand. And we're just trying to make sure that we are in as many places as a, we intend to serve; and b, can provide great talent.  And the last thing I'll just emphasize again is the develop ourselves mentality that we have here. We feel very rewarded for having gone in a direction that I think by degree is at least is a little bit different than what some other companies do. Because several years ago, we recognized if we're just going to count on our ability to go into the market and hire already experienced people, we're essentially saying, "We're going to let somebody else solve our challenge, the talent challenge." And we said, "Well, no. We can do better than that." And so we've just gone very early into the talent pipeline. And we have felt very rewarded doing that.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the Bill Warmington.
William Warmington: So the acquisition of Keystone last week brought to the front the question of how much coverage of the U.S. do you have now? And is that enough? Because you've been -- I know you've been talking about going into Japan and Asia. So in that context, I want to see how much is left to go in the U.S. And then as you look out internationally, is this going to be the beginning of a new investment cycle in geospatial for Asia? And how much you think it'll be? And how long do you think it'll take?
Scott Stephenson: So Mark, you may want to add to this, but I'll just kick off. So in the United States, we are approaching what we would consider full coverage now. You have to understand coverage as both the square miles that you are imaging, but also the frequency with which you are imaging them. And so with respect to will we be able to reach all the important corners of the United States, we're very, very close to being there. With respect to the frequency of the refresh, that may always be something of a moving target. These data sets are not commodities. And one of the ways that you make them to have the quality of not being a commodity is the freshness of the data. So we will always be taking account of customer needs and competition in order to determine how frequently are we refreshing the images. So when you think about coverage, you have to think about both of those.  With respect to overseas markets, we actually already do, do some of this work in other places. And basically, the methods that we develop, the ability of the team to automatically interpret the image sets, that works everywhere. So as we build out our franchise generally -- and insurance is one of the killer apps for the -- for remote imagery. As we build out the Insurance franchise globally, I think it's very clear we will want to come in behind with these methods. But it'll -- it's -- we still got plenty of room to run in the United States, and then we will sort of build it I think organically and consistently with the rate that our Insurance franchise grows outside of the United States.
Operator: Your next question comes from George Tong.
George Tong: Historically, enterprise data management and fraud solutions were the two underperforming areas within Financial Services. This quarter, all solution sets within Financial Services saw sequential improvement. Can you elaborate on the relative performance here and specific initiatives you'd call out that should drive continued acceleration in revenue growth in this segment?
Lisa Hannan: So it's true. All the segments saw sequential improvement. The enterprise data management sector is the sector that will continue to be lumpy and have variability on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Those contracts are very long-term contract often delivered through RFPs. And so the sales cycle is very long, and they also -- some of them end. Some of the work that we've done on more of a client-by-client bespoke enterprise data management solutions basis end. So it's really about building a book of business there and getting to a level of sustainability that allows us to meet that level of consistent performance as we see contracts end and new contracts begin within a quarter and quarter-to-quarter.  Continued improvement in that sector, that is a sector that we're looking to grow over the long term. And we'll continue to see lumpiness on a quarterly basis over the short term, but we do hear and continue to feel that the market is receptive to the solutions we're offering. Most particularly, we are hearing good reception to the global regulatory reporting platform. Regulators around the globe are changing the way they do their oversight. They are creating. They are leveraging deep and rich granular data to do that work, and we believe we're uniquely positioned to serve in the financial sector there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ashish Sabadra.
Ashish Sabadra: Just a quick two-part question on the Energy side. Any color on the softness in the consulting services? Is that mostly difficult comps? And then just where are we in terms of investments for the breakout opportunity within Energy? And when can we start to see margin expansion in the segment?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So go ahead, Lee.
Lee Shavel: Again, Ashish, I may just want to get clarity around the second part of the question. I had a little difficult time hearing you. So on the -- in the first element in terms of the consulting revenue, some of it was a function of a very strong second quarter in 2018. We also saw among some of the large national oil companies some political transitions that delayed some of the revenue that we had anticipated in the quarter. We do not think that, that was a revenue at risk but simply a delay of some of that revenue.  And then with regard to margin, if that was the question and the impact of the breakouts on the margin for Energy and Specialized Markets, Ashish, was that the thrust of your question?
Ashish Sabadra: Yes. Yes. Yes. That's it.
Lee Shavel: Yes. So thanks for raising that. Within Energy and Specialized Markets, I think it's important to note that in this second quarter that a large part of the decline in the revenue, in fact, the largest single element was an FX gain adjustment, which reduced margin by approximately 2%. That's a function of the dollar-pound exchange rate and valuation of our net current assets that influenced that. And so that would -- absent that impact, which fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, we would have had a higher margin. In addition, that margin also bears approximately the 1% impact of the timing from a compensation standpoint. So absent those two nonoperational elements, it reflects the operating leverage and the margin expansion that we are experiencing in the core business while at the same time investing in new initiatives like Lens and the breakout areas like subsurface, power and renewables and those elements. And so I think we feel very good. This -- the quarter, the numbers are distorted by that compensation timing issue in the FX. But overall, from a pure operating standpoint, we actually saw margin expansion.  And if I may, I want to emphasize this dynamic to go back to Toni's question around the Insurance side. In each of our businesses, putting aside the FX impact as well as the timing issue, all of our Insurance businesses saw an expansion in their operating margin. And so that's the underlying operating leverage that drives our margin up. And then we are deliberately making decisions from an investment standpoint with the breakouts in terms of how much of that do we want to spend down with an overall objective of increasing that margin over time. And that's -- we think that's a very healthy dynamic. It's important for continuing investment. But it's also important to understand that absent that investment, we are seeing net operating leverage and that margin expansion improve as we grow. It's just that when you look at the net number, there are various nonoperational impacts and investment impacts that are affecting that. Does that -- hopefully, that addresses your question.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Scott Stephenson: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us. We've scheduled a number of follow-ups with you. We look forward to that. Thanks for your interest and talk to you soon. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you all. This does conclude today's conference call. You may all disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-01 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Verisk First Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, you may begin your conference.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Natalia, and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2019 financial results. Today's call will be led by Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, who will provide a brief overview of the business. In an effort to provide the investment community with a broader perspective on our industry verticals and to offer deeper access to our senior operating executives. Neal Anderson, President of Wood Mackenzie, will then provide an update on our Energy and Specialized Markets segment. Lastly, Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer, will highlight some key points about our financial performance. Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer, will join the team for Q&A. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Stacey, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be able to report that 2019 is off to a solid start at Verisk. The first quarter was marked by solid organic constant-currency revenue growth of 6.7%, which remains the most important measure of our vitality as an organization. Moreover, our growth was driven by continued broad-based strength across our Insurance vertical and ongoing improvements in Energy and Specialized Markets segment. This growth was a product of our continued efforts to get closer to our customers, to introduce new innovative solutions and to cross-sell existing solutions to help accelerate value creation for our customers. With regard to innovation and cross-sell, we are beginning to see early success from the integration of some of our more recent acquisitions into the Verisk family. To that end, we are leveraging technologies and capabilities across all of Verisk to deliver new innovation and leveraging client relationships to drive cross-sell. In the Insurance vertical, we are working with a number of clients in the London market to help them achieve an integrated workflow across a suite of Verisk products, helping them to be more responsive to their clients while at the same time improving the quality of their analytics.  As an example, Verisk clients who ensure commercial properties are now able to leverage integrations that we have built between applications from Sequel, AIR and Analyze Re to review exposure accumulations, assess extreme event risk and determine the impact of a policy on the overall portfolio in real time during the quoting process. These integrated products enable insurers to perform such analytics in minutes, where previously it could have taken at least a day. We think this early success with clients can be replicated more broadly within London and the United States.  In Energy and Specialized Markets, PowerAdvocate, our marketing cost intelligence solution, is seeing early success expanding out of their core markets of oil and gas utilities into new end markets, including metals and mining, by leveraging Wood Mackenzie's deep customer relationships. Neal will talk to you about these opportunities in more detail. In the Financial Services vertical, we've integrated LCI's comprehensive bankruptcy data with our proprietary Argus credit card industry consortium data to more accurately predict bankruptcy as much as 6 to 12 months prior to a bankruptcy filing. This should enable our bank customers to significantly reduce bankruptcy losses through the appropriate utilization and credit line management strategies. We had a very active quarter with regard to customer engagement. In fact, in the quarter, we hosted 17 customer events and attendance and engagement were very solid. In February, we hosted our Elevate Conference in Salt Lake City. The attendance included almost 1,000 insurance executive claims adjusters, contractors and vendors from the U.S., Canada and Europe. The event focused on artificial intelligence and automation to enhance the claims process and introduce the many enhanced features and new products offered by our claims team. Insurers clearly understand that disruptive innovation is taking place throughout the industry and they are intent on maintaining a competitive advantage. This is driving increased engagement and focus around increased use of data and analytics as well as digital engagement. The conference featured, first, the use of computer vision such as remote imagery and image interpretation to automate the claims cycle; second, utilizing natural language processing to better respond to policyholders through advanced analytics and chatbots to speed the claims process and better digitally engage with customers; and third, product demos of our enhanced solutions and an innovation lab to showcase our cutting-edge InsurTech. The unprecedented interest in these topics resulted in over 150 requests from customers to meet with our product managers, industry experts and account executives. This level of customer engagement positions us well for future growth. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Neal to provide some additional insights on our Energy and Specialized Markets segment. Welcome, Neal.
Neal Anderson: Thank you, Scott. It's a pleasure to be here this morning to talk to you about our Energy and Specialized Markets business. I will discuss the macro environment in which the energy and specialized vertical operates where the focus on higher businesses are performing. I will also highlight our recent success leveraging the expertise of our PowerAdvocate business and to the extent of Wood Mackenzie energy and mining customer base. And lastly, we'll give you an update on the customer response to Lens, Wood Mackenzie's new data analytic platform. Regarding the macro environment. As you are aware, the oil and gas industry has been through a very challenging time over the last few years due to the falling oil prices. However, the industry in 2019 is in a much better shape than it was prior to the oil price crash in 2015. The oil and gas industry responded with amazing speed and focus to the drop in oil prices, aggressively cutting costs and rebuilding balance sheets, divesting noncore assets, which allowed them to concentrate upon low-cost, long life things. In turn, free cash flow has become the key financial metric. Indeed, in 2018, free cash flow surpassed the previous peak seen in 2012 when oil prices were above $100 a barrel. In summary, our oil and gas customers are in robust health with their focus now returning to new investments. We estimate future capital investment will exceed $200 billion in the next few years. As a result, we believe the majors will deliver stronger production growth in the coming 5 years, are poised to recover stronger growth for 5 years down the pre-oil price crash. Simultaneously, our downstream and finance platforms team continued strong demand, particularly in emerging markets leading to new investment in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Our core energy customers are also grappling with opportunities and challenges presented by climate change and the need for an energy transition to lower carbon energy sources. As you are aware, we have established 2 breakout businesses to specially support and advise our customers in these areas, namely chemicals and power and renewables. The chemicals business continues to deliver strong double-digit growth as customers recognize that the primary driver of oil demand is likely to become chemical demand over the medium and long term. This is a far chemical demand over the medium and long term. This is a far cry from the world we've grown up in, where transportation demand was the key driver. Wood Mackenzie's data across the global energy complex helps our customers navigate this. The power and renewables business is also consistently delivering double-digit growth driven by our traditional renewable developers and operators, complemented by strong demand from Wood Mackenzie's core oil and gas customers as they strive to build material positions outside their core business.  We believe global investment in power and renewables will continue its nascent, rapid expansion as the energy mix moves from the molecule to the electron. As previously mentioned, the 2015 oil price crash drove a focus on cost efficiency to bring down production breakevens. Our PowerAdvocate business is ideally placed to help customers through applying cutting-edge analytical techniques to diverse spend data sets, allied with unique industry cost benchmarks. Wood Mackenzie has been able to expand PowerAdvocate's customer set beyond its traditional U.S. utilities to the major oil and gas customers and more recently, into the mining and metals sector. As a result, deal sizes have increased significantly as have margins. Lastly, I would like to talk about the market reaction to our new data analytics platform, Lens. We launched the first release of Lens late last year, namely the Lower 48 upstream that focuses on exploration and production and continue to work alongside customers to develop a unique offering, which is scalable, secure, mobile, dynamic, timely and integrated along the energy value chain. While we're still very much at the start of the journey, we have already secured 29 paying customers with a strong near-term pipeline of opportunities. But what is truly exciting is the quality of the anchor customers which range from the major oil companies through to the leading independents under both bracket bands. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Neal. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. The presentation provides background, data, trends and analysis to support our conversation today. One change you may notice in our disclosure is that we are no longer reporting the non-GAAP measures organic or organic constant-currency adjusted EBITDA margins. As the differential between our stated and organic margins decreased and given its complexity for investors, we have decided to simplify and just provide a single total adjusted EBITDA margin.  We, of course, will continue to provide organic constant-currency growth metrics for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA as we believe these are the best measures to evaluate the health of our overall business and are the metrics we use in our own compensation plans. Finally, we have adopted the new lease standard, ASC 842, in the first quarter of 2019 and the impact to our income statement was immaterial. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 7.5% to $625 million. Net income increased 1% to $134 million for the quarter. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.81 for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 2.5% compared with the same period in 2018. GAAP net income and diluted GAAP EPS was impacted in the quarter by increased earn-out expense for a number of acquisitions that have been performing well relative to earn-out targets. Let's now focus our quarterly discussion on our organic constant-currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons, nonoperating acquisition-related costs including earnouts and nonrecurring items. On an organic constant-currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 6.7% in the first quarter of 2019, reflecting strong organic growth across the Insurance segment and improving results in Energy and Specialized Markets. While below our long-term target for organic constant-currency revenue growth, the results reflect the impact of some carryover nonrecurring storm and implementation revenue in the prior year period. Organic constant-currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 6.8%, reflecting modest EBITDA margin expansion on an organic basis. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 46.7% was up from 46.4% in the prior year period, reflecting the leverage in our business model and cost discipline. This increase in total adjusted EBITDA margin includes both organic and organic revenue and EBITDA. Acquisitions reduced adjusted EBITDA margin by 27 basis points in the period, demonstrating our ability to absorb acquisitions and still expand margins through organic operating leverage.  Let's turn now to our segment results on an organic constant-currency basis. As you see in the press release, Insurance reported 7.3% revenue growth while adjusted EBITDA increased 6.5%, reflecting the impact of some storm revenue in the prior year period. Within our underwriting and rating business, growth was balanced across personal lines and commercial lines. We saw healthy growth in our industry-standard insurance programs, property-specific underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions revenue. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance in repair cost estimating solutions, claims analytics and remote imagery solutions. This was offset in part by modest weakness in workers' compensation claim resolution services.   Total adjusted EBITDA margin declined 53 basis points to 53.1% from 53.7% in the prior year period. This decline reflects the impact of some higher-margin storm revenue in the prior year period in claims, which reduced current period margin and a negative 30 basis point impact from acquisitions in the quarter offset by an improvement in the underwriting and ratings margin. Our Insurance margins were also negatively affected by increased legacy pension expense related to year-end 2018 market performance. Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 6.7% for the quarter, building on the trend of continuing sequential improvement. Strong growth in marketing cost intelligence solutions and core research revenues drove the growth. We also had positive contributions from our environmental health and safety and global risk analysis business. As Neal mentioned earlier, we are continuing to drive growth opportunities by leveraging our strong customer relationships in the energy industry across all of our energy businesses as we have the data and solutions that can help our customers be more efficient and effective, driving revenue growth and delivering cost savings.   Adjusted EBITDA increased a healthy 14.1% despite ongoing investments in breakout opportunities like Lens and our chemicals, subsurface and power and renewables breakouts. Total adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 29.6% from 26.8% driven by strong leverage on revenue growth with margin expansion at WoodMac and the inclusion of PowerAdvocate in the organic results for Energy and Specialized Markets. Financial Services revenue increased 0.7% in the quarter,  for Energy and Specialized Markets. Financial Services revenue increased 0.7% in the quarter, led by solid growth in spend-informed analytics and portfolio management, but offset by weakness in our developing enterprise data management solutions. We continue to experience some challenging year-over-year comparisons due to some nonrecurring implementation revenues in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 7.6%, and total adjusted EBITDA margin declined to 30.8% from 33.5%, also a result of some nonrecurring, high-margin implementation revenues in the prior year period. As we discussed previously, we have been transitioning Verisk Financial Services from a top-down orientation to a bottoms-up approach with an emphasis on steady growth, and this quarter represents both progress in that exercise and reflects the impact of a productivity and profitability review of individual business lines. We expect that investors will more clearly see the underlying growth and potential of the business over time as we continue with this transition. Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter, down 2.7% from the prior year quarter due to the repayment of our $250 million of 4 7/8% senior notes in January 2019 with borrowings from our revolving credit facility. Total reported debt was $2.6 billion at March 31, 2019, down from $2.7 billion at year-end 2018. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was 2.2x. During the quarter, we successfully issued $400 million of 4.125% 10-year senior notes. The transaction was oversubscribed, reflecting the strong demand for our credit and our ability to easily access the unsecured investment-grade debt capital markets. We used proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $180 million at March 31, 2019. Our reported effective tax rate was 21% for the quarter compared to 18% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to a lower level of option exercises. We maintain our estimate of our effective tax rate in the full year 2019 to be between 19% and 21%. Adjusted net income was $171 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.03 for the first quarter, up approximately 10% from the prior year in both cases. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and lower share count. The benefits were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a higher effective tax rate. Net cash provided by operating activities was $366 million for the quarter, up 12% from the prior year. Capital expenditures were $45 million for the quarter, up 4.6% from the prior year, reflecting primarily increased software development to promote growth in organic businesses and recent acquisitions. CapEx represented 7.2% of total revenue, reflecting the expected decline in capital intensity as the result of reduced capital spending on the Geomni initiative following its initial ramp-up. Free cash flow was $321 million for the quarter, an increase of 13.1% from the prior year. During the first quarter, we returned $116 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased approximately 637,000 shares at a weighted average price of $117.82 for a total cost of $75 million. At March 31, 2019, we had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the second quarter.  On March 29, 2019, we paid our first cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock. And on April 29, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.20 per share -- $0.25 per share of common stock payable on June 28 for shareholders of record on June 14, 2019. Before I conclude and looking ahead to the next quarter, I want to inform you of an accounting impact that will affect our financial results beginning next quarter. Based upon the vesting provisions in our share-based compensation plan, GAAP accounting requires that we expense the full impact of share-based compensation in the period for all employees upon the attainment of age 62 instead of amortizing the expense over the vesting term. Scott Stephenson, our CEO, will turn 62 during the second quarter of 2019. And as a result, we will incur non -- we will incur incremental noncash costs of approximately $6 million related to the expensing of a share-based compensation in the second quarter. That said, we will see a benefit in the remaining quarters of 2019 and into 2020. Also on an ongoing basis, there will be a discernible concentration of compensation expense and impact on margin in the second quarter as new stock awards are granted, but this will be consistent over time and simply reflect a timing impact. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and continue to manage capital prudently through internal investment, strategic acquisitions and the return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk.  [Operator Instructions] I'll ask the operator to open the line now for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America.
Gary Bisbee: Now the question on the energy business and sort of a 2-parter. Obviously, great margin as you're returning the business to growth, but it also looked like costs didn't grow and that was a sharp slowdown relative to the pace throughout 2018. So is that -- was there anything going on or is that sustainable? And the sort of Part B of that is just can you give us any sense how much you're investing in the newer areas and why we wouldn't see cost growing more quickly as you expand those businesses?
Scott Stephenson: Well, let -- this is Scott. Let me just give you a general characterization, then Lee, maybe you want to -- or excuse me, Neal, maybe you want to jump in with any particular comments. But the way that we are operating in that business, it's a very balanced agenda where we are actually investing a lot in the categories that we talked about before, where you've got Lens, you've got subsurface, chemicals, power and renewables. But then where the rest of the business is concerned, there's been a lot of discipline. And so this is back into say, the core of the research activities that we do and you can just see that in the way that the operation is actually moving forward. So no, it's an investment-minded agenda, but we're being selective about where we're spending. Neal, I wonder if you want to add anything to that.
Neal Anderson: No. Certainly, Scott. Also on the Lens side, the big focus of Lens is also to drive internal efficiencies, and we're really pleased to see that margin expansion as we roll out Lens.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Maybe I'll move to another segment on the financial side. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color and maybe help quantify a little bit what the growth of the underlying businesses that are doing well is. And when do you think the EDM piece stops becoming a headwind to the overall growth?
Scott Stephenson: So Lee, do you want to start with just kind of, at the results level and then I can provide a little color on the context?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Sure. So Manav, thanks for the question. We saw solid growth in that, the spend-informed analytics and fraud and credit risk management. So we described that as north of 10% year-over-year growth in that. The portfolio management was in the mid-single-digits range. That obviously is kind of the core of the business. And with regard to Enterprise Data Management, that is where we had a year-over-year decline but recognizing that, that reflects some of the implementation revenue in the first quarter. So that effect is concentrated within that sector. And it also continues to reflect across that business, the ongoing development and some of the greater choppiness associated with a new and developing business segment.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. No, that's, and all I would add to that is that's one of those parts of the business where we've given real attention to try to smooth out some of the cycle that can exist there. But it is inherently a little bit lumpy year just because it's moment in time really helping our customers improve their data analytic environment.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie.
Hamzah Mazari: I was hoping if you could sort of just quantify or give us a sense of how much elevated investment spend do you have going through your P&L and CapEx? So you talked about Cloud Migration, we talked about Geomni. Just trying to gauge longer term, how should we think about a step change in your free cash flow when this elevated investment spend sort of comes down to a more normalized level? Is there a way to think about that at a high level?
Lee Shavel: So Hamzah, thanks for the question. I think there is a way to think about it and it is, it revolves around CapEx. And so a lot of our investment takes the form in, of internally developed software and so that's captured in CapEx. And as we had discussed previously, a lot of the acceleration was associated with the ramp-up of Geomni and the purchase of planes and sensors to build scale in that business. And while we continue to invest in that business, it is at a lower level on, proportionally relative to revenues than it had been in the past. And hopefully, as you saw in this quarter, the capital intensity, in other words, the CapEx as a percentage of revenue, showed a decline relative to that level. And you saw in terms of the absolute growth rate a slower level of growth. And so I think that is one way to think about the level of capital intensity within the business. Beyond that, we have OpEx expenses associated with a number of our breakout initiatives and we expect that to continue to grow as we fund these new breakout initiatives across the business. Some of them are profitable, some of them are at an earlier stage where they may be lower-margin or not profitable yet. But across the board, we would expect that investment to continue to expand at a reasonable pace and scaled against our overall operating margin expansion that we seek to achieve.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Scott Stephenson: Toni, are you there?
Toni Kaplan: Can you hear me?
Scott Stephenson: Yes.
Toni Kaplan: Energy and specialized saw the highest organic growth rate in 3 years and Neal, you talked about how you see stronger growth in the coming 5 years. The data source that I use for industry CapEx trends has been revising down sort of growth rates in the next couple of years. So I wanted to sort of get a sense of, if you have any color on how you're thinking about -- are you outperforming the market because of the products that you're providing? Is your pipeline strong because of your sales process or products? I guess just what's the disparity between maybe some of the data sources and what you're seeing.
Scott Stephenson: Neal, do you want to take that?
Neal Anderson: Yes. No, absolutely, Scott. I think first of all, we see modest growth on investment of our key customers over the next 5 years, Toni. As I mentioned in the introduction, folks are now starting to look more at investment rather than being prudent on the cost side, which is a great operating environment for Wood Mackenzie. And as you know, the traditional strengths of Wood Mackenzie is the credibility with the market, our unique data sets, and then we're adding to that in terms of a really intuitive data analytic platform in Lens. And as I mentioned in the introduction, the launch of that in the fall of last year, we already have 29 paying customers. We continue to see that growth going over the medium term.
Scott Stephenson: Hey, Neal, just a thought or really a question for you at the contextual level, is there also some effect in the Lower 48? Maybe it's not so much about CapEx intensity as it is about kind of operating agility and the ability to rebalance your operations very quickly in the unconventionals. I wonder if there's just a little bit of a mix shift there also. Toni is looking at macro data sources. Maybe a little bit of the rebalance towards Lower 48. Maybe that's in the CapEx number a little bit also?
Neal Anderson: Yes. No, absolutely, Scott. Toni, I was referring to global CapEx. Scott is absolutely right. What we're starting to see is a little bit more discipline coming into the operators' plane in the Lower 48.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair.
TimMcHugh: Just wanted to ask on the insurance side. Maybe can you elaborate a little bit more on the claims side of the business? I noticed -- I guess given the tough comp, it seems like Xactware still grew even despite the comparison. So can you talk a little bit about what's driving the growth there? And I think this is one of the first times you, at least in the presentation, you've highlighted remote aerial or kind of remote imagery solutions. So have you seen a noticeable kind of pickup in adoption of that amongst the client base?
Scott Stephenson: Mark, do you want to take that one?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So I think you've captured many of the themes. So first of all, I will let you know that across all of the businesses, that would be the Xactware business, where the repair cost estimate continues to be very robust and strong. There was a little bit of storm-related revenue back in 1Q of '18. So we kind of grew over that. Our ClaimSearch or claims analytics business continues to be very well penetrated but very nicely growing. We continue to add new customers outside of insurance as well as some of the analytic solutions. We signed a lot of very large contracts last year, which spurred growth. So those are onboard this year and we continue to do well with those customers. And thirdly, inside that category, Geomni is clearly a contributor to growth from an organic perspective, and we continue to do well in taking customers and expanding the breadth of Geomni in the aerial imagery. So strength across the board.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeff Meuler: So as I think about Lens or, I guess, previously WoodMac 2.0 and what was talked about at the time of the acquisition originally, I think part of it, and I think you were referencing this, Neal, was related to the way that data is aggregated and automating that process. So I guess where are you in that journey? Have you largely automated the data aggregation process from the large energy companies that are supplying you with data? And then related to that, are there new fields of data, additional data that you're getting now that the process is aggregated, or is automated?
Scott Stephenson: Neal, your favorite topic. Have a go.
Neal Anderson: Thank you, Scott. Absolutely a big win this year in terms of margin expansion was that automation that you referred to. We began the rollout of Lens, which is a truly end-to-end process of reimagining which data sets we want to secure, how we automate the capture and the transformation of that data and then for our analysts in turn to add their interpretation and produce the products for clients. We started an onshore U.S., Lower 48, exploration and production. And we're currently in the process of rolling that out to the global upstream this year. And the second part of the question, we're always looking for new data sets. But the wonderful thing about this automation and bringing on a new Chief Data Officer, Nabeel Azar, is he is tirelessly looking for new data sets, be them in the public domain, be them through partnerships or indeed, other routes.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: It's Andrew. Lee, Verisk score reported margin expansion in the first quarter and obviously, you're still investing in key growth initiatives. Higher levels of investment spending was accomplished in 2018. Lee, with that in mind, is Verisk placed to have reported margins to be up directionally this year?
Lee Shavel: So Andrew, I appreciate the question. Again, looking for guidance on margin. We are striving every quarter to increase our revenues at a higher rate than EBITDA. We achieved that this quarter despite investments and we'll continue to work to deliver on that. I think certainly as we said, the growth in this quarter was impacted by some tougher year-over-year comparisons, which I think diminish over time and so that certainly creates an opportunity for us to show some improvement ahead if we're successful there.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: The underwriting and ratings revenue piece of the insurance business grew 6.8% in the quarter, which was slightly slower than claims revenue growth and this is pretty typical. Underwriting typically grows at a slower rate than claims. Can you discuss internal initiatives that maybe accelerate the pace of growth for underwriting to the point where it could potentially surpass the claims growth?
Scott Stephenson: Mark, do you want to take that one?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So I first need to highlight the -- what we will refer to as our business focused on the pricing and underwriting and its -- the forms and coverage. That's a business that is kind of the foundation of Verisk for many, many years. It provides a very, very solid base. But at the same time, we're well penetrated and it's difficult for that business to grow all that dramatically. So what we've been trying to do is grow around that, and we have added many new products and tried to go international to accelerate that growth. And in those areas, we are seeing very high double-digit growth to accelerate the overall growth of underwriting and rating. So we're pleased with the investment that's being made. We're very pleased with the progress that's happening. But to answer your question, international is kind of one way we're going to try to extend and expand analytics beyond those core solutions, very important. And as I described, inside this category, in the quarter, cat bonds and the cat bond market was a little slow. But nonetheless, our catastrophe modeling continues to, on a baseline, grow nicely with some of those efforts. So I hope I provided you with a little bit of the portfolio and how we think about it to answer your question.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Drew Kootman: This is Drew Kootman on for Joe. You guys mentioned that the integration, you guys have been having a lot of success on recent acquisitions. I was hoping you could highlight just a couple of those and discuss the pipeline you're seeing moving forward.
Scott Stephenson: So Neal talked about some of the ways that we've been able to get the cost intelligence side of the business and the supply side and demand side of the business all synchronized in the marketplace. So that's kind of the view on the energy front, and we also talked about how we pulled together LCI and Argus data sets in order to work on some of the more fraud and bankruptcy-related topics that you got in Financial Services. Mark, anything you want to -- do you want to talk a little bit more about sort of the trifecta, Sequel, AIR and Analyze Re?
Mark Anquillare: Yes. I mean referenced kind of in a high level. From an international perspective, I think we found some very nice opportunities in the U.K., specifically in the London market. We are seeing customers who kind of see the vision, like the ability that consumer analytic and data in a way they see most comfortable, but know that we are behind the scenes seamlessly integrating it, which has created an opportunity to walk into a customer, talk about a suite of solutions and them coming to us and saying, Geez, don't you also have this product? Wouldn't that fit in? And in a surprisingly and very good way, contracts and opportunities are growing, and I give a lot of credit to the team in the UK and how all of our business have really thought about a way to satisfy our customers. That has been reassuring and it continues to show a lot of promise.
Scott Stephenson: And Mark, we said it but just adding on to this. The Sequel tools which relate to understanding exposures and their accumulations, that is sold almost exclusively in Europe today. Yet the integration that you're talking about ties it in with AIR, where a very strong part of our AIR franchise is in the United States. So there's a real pull together there.
Mark Anquillare: The opportunity is not just the UK
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Oscar Turner with SunTrust.
Oscar Turner: So my question is on Lens. I was wondering, what's the go-to-market for that product? Has the focus been on cross-selling to existing customers? And then can you give some color into what aspects of the product customers have been most excited about?
Scott Stephenson: Neal, do you want to take that one?
Neal Anderson: Yes. No, absolutely. And it's a dual track. We're really excited about Lens both in terms of cross-selling into our existing customer base, and also we've had huge interest from new clients, new logos to Wood Mackenzie. So it's certainly been both. And the feedback that we've got from Lens, and it ranges very much customer by customer, some really love the user experience, how intuitive it is, that they can use it on their laptop, iPhone, iPad. Other folks love the dynamic nature of it. So we have put in various assumptions with our unique data sets. And if they want to change, then they can change that on the fly and recalculate valuations which would have taken minutes before in a matter of seconds. And then other folks really value that true integrated approach along the value chain, which we will continue to build and build and build over time.
Scott Stephenson: Neal, maybe you comment also on just kind of the, it's the same sales force that is taking Lens out to the same customers that is already taking all of our other solutions out to market.
Neal Anderson: Yes. No, absolutely. This is just one other avenue for sales force in terms of how they can support and service our customers.
Scott Stephenson: The point being that there's leverage here.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo Securities.
Bill Warmington: So I wanted to ask about the two motion partnership. Basically, how does having a smartphone telematics platform impact your product capability? And does it let you expand your addressable market? Can you go after segments that you couldn't go after before?
Scott Stephenson: Mark, that's something for you.
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So let me try to, so reminding you, what we have done is we've partnered with a lot of the OEMs, Honda, Hyundai, GM. And from the vehicle, we've harvested data. We're up to 5 million cars, 90 billion miles, and that is helping our insurers do either modeling themselves or use our programs to understand behavior of those drivers so they can get a better price with regard to insurance. There's also some insurance claims use cases where we can help get assistance and actually initiate a claim. What we're trying to do is provide this consortium of all data available around the vehicle to help our customers understand the risk and price it better. So what the mobile devices do is they can provide that same type of information with, by the way, consent from users, so that we have information about distance traveled, information about the quality of the driving, all of that about both the vehicle connected to the driver. In some cases in idea identified ways; in other cases, we know the vehicle. So it is a part of a broader strategy to aggregate as much information about a vehicle and about a driver to help the assessment of that risk. So hopefully, you can understand the expansive nature of what can be involved with telematics from the standpoint of the mobile phone as well as telematics from the vehicle itself, harvesting from OnStar, as an example.
Operator: There are no further questions.
Scott Stephenson: Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. We appreciate the continued interest and support. And as you know, we'll be following up with a number of you. So have a great rest of the day.
Lee Shavel: Thank you.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you all.
Operator: This concludes today's earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-20 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the Verisk Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Result's Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk, Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. Ms. Brodbar, please go ahead.
Stacey Brodbar: Thank you, Grace, and good morning everyone. We appreciate you joining us for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Lee highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today; Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, Stacey and good morning everyone. Apologies for my voice today. As we turn the page on 2018, I want to give you my bottom line view of the year just passed. We did well and see opportunity to improve. The single most important reflection of our vitality is our rate of organic revenue growth and normalizing for the effects of exceptional storm-related revenues and a significant contract signing in Financial Services in 2017. Our organic constant currency revenue growth was 7.2%, ahead of our long-term financial target of 7%. Moreover, our growth was broadly based across our Insurance vertical, along with Wood Mackenzie in the Energy space and our core consortium, data analytics in the Financial Services vertical. The heart of our position in the three verticals is sound and forms the basis for cross-selling new solutions in the future. Looking more deeply into the organic revenue outcomes across the company, I see eight contributing factors. Number one, very high rates of customer retention; two, growth in the number of products consumed by existing customers; three, the introduction and adoption of new innovative solutions; four, positive pricing due to enhanced value in many solutions; five, in those places where we have head-to-head competition, share gains in most categories, including cat modeling, remote imagery, and underwriting decision support; six, affected progress in non-domestic markets, especially the UK; seven, a high rate of capture business with new entrants in the Insurance vertical, including the insure tech companies; and eight, our position as a partner to our customers, who continue to trust Verisk with their data, enabling us to build new solutions in new categories. For example, in Insurance we are working with our customers to repurpose some contributory policy data already used in our underwriting business to develop innovative claims solutions. One such solution will enable carriers to automate the subrogation process quickly and seamlessly. In Energy and Specialized Markets Wood Mackenzie is leveraging the consortium model developed by our Insurance colleagues and bringing it to the energy sector, where we believe it is in a nascent stage. We are currently finalizing an agreement to create an energy data consortium, in one of the key US tight oil plays, and in Financial Services, we are working with our card issuer partners in Mexico to launch a fraud consortium to help combat the transaction based fraud plaguing their system. An important underlying foundation to our growth is the agility of our technical infrastructure, which permits us to bring new solutions to market faster and with greater analytic content. On this front, I was pleased with the following in 2018; our analytics community has grown substantially, through our own program of cultivating data scientists, along with industry hiring, and all of this, supported by the naming of our new Chief Analytics Officer. We saw a doubling of our consumption of public cloud capacity in 2018. We have made progress in advancing our data methods to support widespread tokenization, which contributes to our internal security and presents opportunities to access new datasets from equally security-minded data sources. On the innovation front, we introduced a wide variety of unique and customer-driven solutions across our verticals. In Insurance, we launched programs to address new risk exposure, including cyber and flood. We also successfully introduced a variety of disruptive and award winning innovations to the market, which Mark will talk to you about in more detail. In the Energy and Specialized Market segment, we launched Lens, a cloud-based data and analytics platform, which allows customers to access, analyze, and model data in every major commodity in every market and in our Financial Services sector, we delivered next generation merchant analytics to retailers. As a complement to our innovation agenda, we are very focused on driving operational efficiency. As we shared with you in detail at our Investor Day in December, we worked diligently to advance our operational excellence initiative through Lean Six Sigma. With 3,100 employees trained and 85 active projects underway and more soon to be launched, Verisk is driving a culture of continuous improvement, by measurably improving processes and meeting the critical customer needs of quality and speed. Another leading indicator for me comes from the many conversations I have with the CEOs of our leading customers. Are they thinking of Verisk as a partner? Or as a vendor? A consistent message across 2018 is that we are engaging our customers around some of their highest priority initiatives for the future and they see Verisk as a distinctive and trusted partner in doing so. The result of many of my CEO visits is a request that their teams to be placed in closer proximity to our innovation pipeline. A last comment about the year just passed, regards the planning cycle we went through at the end of the year. I have never seen a higher volume of fresh ideas for new solutions and approaches for engaging our customers. We have the wonderful problem of needing to choose among a wide variety of opportunities. Finally, I'm pleased to announce, as you've seen, that our Board of Directors has approved the initiation of a cash dividend to shareholders. This represents an important milestone in what is the 10th year of our history as a public company, and demonstrates the confidence we have in our ability to drive sustainable profitable growth, generate significant free cash flow, and create long-term shareholder value through careful capital management. I will now turn the call over to Mark to comment specifically on our Insurance business.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. I'm pleased to share with you the 2018 was a strong year in our Insurance businesses. One marked by solid growth across most of our lines of business, fueled by leading innovation and enhanced customer engagement. Excluding the impact of approximately $16 million of storm related revenue in 2017, Insurance revenue, on an organic constant currency basis grew 8.3% in 2018. Our customer retention rates remain very high, and the overall portfolio of new and truly innovative solutions is more robust than ever. As Scott mentioned earlier, we received numerous innovation of the Year Awards for our creative solutions, including one, LightSpeed Auto, our innovative data forward workflow solution that delivers a faster and more efficient experience for underwriting and buying Insurance. A fully bindable online auto quote is delivered after providing only three pieces of key data. We've extended the LightSpeed technology and platform for the rest of the property and small commercial Insurance segments. Several customers have signed contracts and our pipeline of interest for LightSpeed is growing. Two, Verisk Data Exchange. Our IoT data consortium that collects connected car data from our GM, Honda and Hyundai partnerships, on more than 4.7 million vehicles, covering more than 80 billion miles. The Insurance applications range from driving behavioral scores for underwriting to instant notice of loss, solutions for claims. And three, EPIX, our Energy and Power Intelligence Exchange, our Insurance platform that helps energy Insurance professionals' research, assess and underwrite complex risks. This solution addresses a critical possible growth need by combining Verisk's risk scoring and benchmarking Insurance expertise, with WoodMac's unique energy data. A steady stream of first-to-market innovation is one of the four distinctives at Verisk and is also a key driver of our growth. It is also an important force of change within the Insurance industry. On that front, InsurTech is gathering lots of mind share and meaningful capital investment, which we think creates future growth opportunities for Verisk. In my view, InsurTech is growing in two distinct areas. One, startup insurers and Managing General Agents or MGAs, who are underwriting and distributing Insurance. These types of insured tech startups are likely to need data analytics to effectively price and sell Insurance in a competitive market. We believe these startups have the potential to become Verisk customers, and in fact in 2018, we engaged with 67 of these startups on the 182 opportunities and had 79 product wins. Second, other InsurTech startups include service providers, who are trying to improve the Insurance process. These startups may be competitors of ours, but many recognize the value of our services and continue to solicit our data analytics, distribution channel or even possible investment. The threat from InsurTech players is igniting investment by more traditional insurers, who are focused on analytics, digital engagement and automation to compete with InsurTech and deliver a better customer experience for their policyholders. This momentum in insure investment have led to increased opportunities for us. A common description of InsurTech is the use of technology innovations, designed to improve the Insurance process by squeezing out savings and driving efficiency from the current Insurance industry model. With this definition in mind, I view Verisk as the most comprehensive and trusted InsurTech provider. As we've communicated to you over the years, international expansion is an important part of our long-term growth strategy, and in 2018 it was a solid contributor to growth. The United Kingdom provides a playbook for success in future international expansion. Global Insurance market, especially specialty line has hubs world with London as the key gateway to global markets, and an accelerating step on our journey to extend beyond the United States. This vision is becoming a reality in the UK. Our strategy is to provide a comprehensive suite of solutions across the entire Insurance value chain, driving data and automation from broker to underwriter to reinsurer and from to claim settlement. During the quarter, we acquired Rulebook, industry leading provider of business intelligence and software solutions for the London Insurance market. Rulebook in combination with Sequel furthers our goal of providing leading solutions to the global Insurance market, including a comprehensive chain of solutions to specialty insurers for mitigating risks and optimizing total cost of operations. Our customers are recognizing the advantages of these integrated solutions, resulting in new contracts and increased sales opportunities. With a successful 2018 behind us, we are focused on 2019 and are actively meeting with employees and customers. To kick start each year, we held a series of town hall meetings at our major offices to share Verisk's Insurance solutions strategic direction. We also held our Annual Insurance Sales Meeting in Nashville, earlier this month. The first evening of the sales meeting was an award ceremony and a celebration of a strong 2018. The meeting then serves as a form for leadership to communicate our goals for 2019, and for the sales teams to learn about our new innovative solutions. Our 200-person sales team experienced demos from our product experts, and were briefed in our innovation lab, under a cutting edge AI and automation technologies. Several customers joined us and emphasized the importance of our products and thought leadership to their businesses, as well as suggested enhancements to our solutions. The teams left our town hall and sales meetings with a sense of accomplishment, energy and momentum from 2018 and motivated for 2019. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thanks Mark. First, I'd like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. The presentation provides background data trends and analysis to support our conversation today. Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis revenue grew 7.7% to $614 million, as a result of an income tax benefit of $89 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to tax reform, net income decreased 28.5% to $146 million for the quarter. Diluted GAAP earnings per share were $0.87 for the fourth quarter 2018, a decrease of 28.7% compared with the same period in 2017. Equalizing the fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate to that of the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 5.6% and 6.1% respectively. Let's focus our quarterly discussion on our normalized organic constant currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons and non-recurring items, including the impact of the storm related revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. On a normalized organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 6.9% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting strong organic growth across the Insurance and the Energy and Specialized Market segments, offset by weakness in Financial Services. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 47.8% was up from 47.6% on a normalized basis in the prior year period. Please bear in mind that our reported fourth quarter 2017 margin, not adjusted for the storms, includes the benefit of 100% margin on the $8 million in storm-related revenue. For the full year of 2018 normalized for both the storm-related and non-recurring implementation revenues, we achieved 7.2% organic constant currency revenue growth and 7.7% organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 48.5% in 2018, up from 48.3% in 2017. We achieved these results, while also maintaining substantial investment in our business, and sustaining ongoing recovery in our Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services sectors. Let's now turn to our segment results on a normalized organic constant currency basis. As you can see in the press release, Insurance segment revenue grew 8.5% and adjusted EBITDA increased 9.9%, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 53.5%, up from 52.8% in the prior year and inclusive of substantial investments in remote imagery and telematics. Within our underwriting and rating business, we saw solid performance with healthy growth in commercial lines, personal lines and catastrophe modeling services. Within claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance across most of our claims businesses, partially offset by continued softness in our workers' compensation, claim resolution services. Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 5.1% for the quarter, as the Energy industry continues to recover. We experienced growth in both our core research and consulting solutions, as well as strong contribution from our breakout areas, including power and renewables, chemicals and subsurface. We also had positive contributions from environmental health and safety and weather and climate analytics revenues. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.6%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.3% was slightly down from the prior year period of 31.4%, as we continue to invest in WoodMac 2.0 or Lens, as it is branded in the marketplace, and our chemicals subsurface and power renewables breakouts. These areas represent opportunities to leverage Wood Mackenzie's data and industry expertise more broadly and to deliver and develop products more swiftly and efficiently. Financial Services revenue declined 2.2% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA decreased by 12.8%. Solid growth in portfolio management solutions and spend-informed analytics were offset by headwinds from tough comparisons with prior year implementation revenues, as well as some timing differences. As we articulated previously, we continue to make progress on our initiative to reduce the variability of revenues in this segment, particularly around project based items. As we work through this process, we will continue to see quarterly fluctuations on revenue and growth, higher than our other businesses. That said we are encouraged by the long-term growth potential in our Financial Services segment, as we set the business on a stronger foundation for future growth. Reported interest expense was $33 million in the quarter, up 1.6% from the prior year quarter due to the funding of acquisitions over the last 12 months and our share repurchase program. Total reported debt was $2.7 billion at December 31st, 2018, down from $3 billion at December 31st, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the quarter was 2.3 x. We are very pleased to share that on January 30th, Standard & Poor's upgraded Verisk's credit rating to BBB Flat, with a stable outlook from BBB minus with a stable outlook, and assigned a short-term rating of A-2. Our reported effective tax rate was 18.6% for the quarter, this compares to the negative 14.1% we experienced in the prior year quarter, as we recorded a benefit resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities in connection with tax reform. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 16.8%, which was lower than our targeted range due to significant exercises of soon to expire employee stock options, related to our 2009 IPO that produced a favorable tax impact. For 2019, we expect our tax rate to be between 19% and 21%. Though there will be likely some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk stock price and employee personnel decisions. Adjusted net income was $174 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.04 for the fourth quarter, down 21.8% from the prior year. This decrease reflects the impact of a prior year $89 million tax benefit related to the 2017 tax reform. Equalizing the fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate to that of the fourth quarter of 2018, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 5.6% and 6.1% respectively. Further normalizing for the elevated storm revenue in the quarter, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 10% and 10.6% respectively, consistent with our long-term objective for double-digit EPS growth. Net cash provided by operating activities was $173 million for the quarter, up 14.5% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $77 million for the quarter, up 9.8% from the prior year period, reflecting continued investments in future growth opportunities, including remote imagery, telematics and Lens, and software development to support and improve new and existing products across the organization. Total capital expenditures for 2018 were $231 million and represented 9.6% of total revenue. As we've said previously, we expect capital expenditures to decline as a percentage of revenues in 2019, and over the long term, and to be within a range of $220 million to $240 million in 2019. As that translates to depreciation and amortization we expect fixed asset, depreciation and amortization to be within a range of $175 million to $185 million in comparison to the $165 million for 2018, and we expect intangible amortization to be approximately $135 million in 2019 in comparison to $131 million in 2018. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability and future M&A activity. Free cash flow was $97 million for the quarter, an increase of 18.6% from the prior year period. This quarter, we returned $156 million in capital to shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 1.3 million shares at a weighted average price of $119.55. At December 31st 2018 we had $428 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we initiated a new $75 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the first quarter of 2019. Of course, the big news on the capital front was the initiation of a cash dividend of $0.25 per share this quarter. We are very pleased to reach this milestone in our 10th year as a public company, and to deliver another source of value to our investors. This dividend underscores the stability of our business, profitability and cash flow, as well as a diversification of our capital return discipline, balancing share repurchases and dividends. We further expect that the dividend will open new groups of potential shareholders to Verisk. It's important to note that the dividend initiation does not reflect any diminution in our growth prospects or the opportunities to invest our capital. We will continue to have sufficient capital to support our long-term growth objectives, which remain unchanged. We remain excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us. We ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Shavel. Our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni Kaplan: Hi, good morning. Scott, you mentioned that you've been meeting with CEOs of your customers, could you just call out what seems maybe on their minds that might be different than last year, or just give us a sense of the most important priorities that they're focused on?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Thanks Toni. Two things immediately come to mind. One is I would say almost every Insurance company CEO believes and expects that they can find ways to make their company grow faster than their competitors, faster than the industry. And I think that's really significant because it means that what they are leaning into is improved methodologies. They're not just trying to sort of hunker down and play a cost game, they are looking to grow their businesses and they realize that the world around them really has changed and continues to change because of technology. So I would say that that's really the first and the most important thing that's going on. I would say a second thing that is also pretty obviously true, I would say, especially for the mid and larger companies, is they are really persuaded of the importance of accessing partnerships and supply from outside of their own companies. In other words, they realize that there are ways that their businesses can be benefited by tying in with others, and so I see a lot more partnering, I see a lot more venture investing, as they try to get closer to technology, and I just see a lot more outreach to a company like ourselves that is recognized as being sort of distinctively able to help across multiple fronts. So these are very constructive meetings, they are partnership meetings.
Toni Kaplan: Terrific. And then for my follow-up. I wanted to ask about margins. So in Insurance, I think we've seen investment impacting margins, seen with first quarter in Energy last year, I guess should we view 2019 as maybe a little bit - a continuation of investing maybe a little bit less so than 2018 or how should we directionally sort of think about it and then outside of scale, are there any margin initiatives across the business like efficiencies that you're looking to drive this year? Thanks
Lee Shavel: Thanks Toni. This is Lee. So I think it's - I would start off by saying, certainly all our businesses, we think have superb operational and operating leverage. And so, as you know, across the organization, our expectation is that each of the businesses will demonstrate improvement in margin. I think it's a fair observation that in 2018, there was a high level of investment in a variety of initiatives, Geomni, Lens, IoT and telematics, where we chose to make those investments and that - those obviously had a negative impact on margin. But notwithstanding that, I want to reiterate as I mentioned in my comments that both - for the fourth quarter and for the year as a whole, when you normalize for the storm activity, we had margin expansion on the year-over-year periods. And so from our perspective, recognizing that storm revenue and the implementation revenue for TSYS was 100% margin, and so that certainly skewed that year-over-year comparison. We believe that we delivered margin expansion, as well as substantial investment in the businesses for that period. In 2019, we won't have that storm comparison and as Scott indicated, we still see very attractive opportunities to invest. But I think it's fair to say that probably in 2018, from a scale standpoint, particularly around Geomni, it was a higher level, consistent with our CapEx guidance that was acceleration. We expect to see that absolute level of investment decline as a percentage of revenue. So we feel good about the opportunity to strive towards our goal of margin expansion.
Operator: Our second question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. Just on the Financial Services segment, maybe you could just touch on how you plan to reduce variability of revenues in that vertical, and maybe just timing of that initiative?
Lee Shavel: Sure. Hamzah, this is Lee. Thanks for that question. So the process is essentially in recognizing in project related revenues. I think the tendency in the past had been to recognize more of that revenue upfront. I think as we have the flexibility in structuring those relationships as new business comes on, we are - and this is not perspective, this is already occurring, we are structuring the relationship, so that revenue is realized over time, so that we don't have these large chunks of revenue that create that variability. So that is part of the objective. That's a structural initiative as we work with clients. But also I think fundamentally, as we think about developing the growth of the business, our focus is on building the sustainable growth component off of the four constituent businesses that we've described before. So that it is more incremental growth across that base. I think both of those will contribute to more stable, less variable revenue and profitability over time.
Hamzah Mazari: Great. And just for my follow-up question, on the international business, what sort of next milestones should we be looking at in that business? I know you talked about products essentially needing to be more customized locally. So just any color on long-term international Insurance strategy? Thank you.
Mark Anquillare: Yes, thank you. This is Mark. Just to kind of follow up on the question. So I think what we've seen is, it's a bit of a build and buy scenario. So what we are now doing, which is become a very powerful in front of customers is, we've taken many of our solutions and we started to integrate them in a more holistic way. So walking into a customer as opposed to buying all these point solutions, there is an attractiveness of knowing that your data is going to flow from the beginning of a process that starts at maybe a quote or an underwriting decision on through the process, so you can see it from a portfolio perspective in some of our catastrophe modeling solutions, and all of that is information that's embodied in the solution at Sequel. The concept and the construct here is, I can do it more effectively, I can do it more efficiently and I can do it more accurately. And on top of that backbone, we've added some of, I will refer to it the ISO and some of the other analytics that has been so powerful here in the States. So that continues to evolve. I think we'll be able to do more and more with customers as we gain access to more data, and maybe just to take your question one step further, to maybe highlight that - I think we see London as being kind of a gateway into the international community, especially with the specialty lines. So as we win these contracts, we're doing work, not just in the UK, but with companies who are located in UK, but are underwriting business throughout the world. So our next step into other geographies is that much easier.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Togut: Thank you. Good morning. I'd like to ask about the Financial Services business, which was really weak for the second year in a row. I'm wondering if this business has the same distinctives that really characterizing both your Insurance and your Energy and Specialized Markets businesses, especially since competition here seems to be increasing with a number of well capitalized competitors like MasterCard offering more and more analytics to a credit card issuer. So my question really is, does this business really still fit within Verisk, especially given the broader capital allocation framework that you've rolled out today, which seems to focus more on capital return?
Scott Stephenson: David, it's Scott here. Yes, the business does that. I think that many of the folks on the call today are familiar with, what we call our four distinctives, which we talk about a lot, which is just to remind everybody, our unique data assets, deep domain expertise, first mover advantage and deep embedment and customer workflows; and what we do in Financial Services has all four of those qualities. So as Lee previously talked about some of the things that have sort of moved through the business of late, we talked about the sort of the lumpy quality of the way that some of the revenues have been recognized in the past. What I would go back to is, that the heart of the business is built on consortium data, which is absolutely unique and unlike the data, which is available to anyone else, including the players you just mentioned, on top of which then, we have very deep relationships with our customers and really a large data platform, which is really remarkable for a company of that size. So all of the conditions are there and then I would also say, again echoing what Lee said, the strength of portfolio analytics, plus the spend analytics that we do, are the leading parts of the business and they're actually healthy. So we expect that as these other effects sort of washed through you'll get sort of a more clear view of those things built upon the distinctives, which really will power the business going forward.
David Togut: Thanks for that, as a quick follow-up. I'd just like to ask about dividend policy. The math shows that the LTM payout ratio is about 28%. How do you think about the payout ratio that you're using to set the dividend and do you expect the dividend to grow in line with earnings or faster than earnings going forward?
Lee Shavel: Thanks David, it's Lee, let me take that. So we - in setting that level, we looked at the payout ratio, really also what proportion of capital are we allocating to the dividend and an eye on kind of yield and where yields are out there. We recognize that investors will expect and reward growth in the dividend over time, and we certainly believe that our ongoing earnings growth will provide a very strong consideration for these decisions by our Board in the future. We also expect to weigh capital investment and return opportunities in the allocation decisions ahead. So all of those I think factor into it, but there clearly is recognition that there will be an expectation, given our overall growth that there - that the dividend should grow as well. And that's what we will balance looking ahead in advises with the Board on these decisions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you. Good morning. Scott, I think at the beginning of the call, you talked about the repurposing of 7B Insurance Consortium data, and I was wondering if you can just expand on that, maybe taking a step back and letting us know how much of the data do you have access now to play around and innovate with, and if this is a new or ongoing opportunity?
Scott Stephenson: So let me start and Mark you may want to amplify some of this. But when we think about data and the Insurance vertical, it's really a combination of looking for opportunities to tease additional meaning out of existing data sets and generating new datasets. So upfront, I mentioned for example, subrogation. Subrogation is essentially bound up in the claims resolution process, and as I think most folks know, we have a lot of claims data. So finding a way to point that at the subrogation case and to think about affiliated things like clearing payment between counterparts is just interesting and it's really a process that hasn't really been transformed yet in the Insurance industry. So that would be an example of repurposing. But then there are other places where we're trying to generate original datasets. And one thing I would just comment on here is that, on the one hand we are very alert to opportunities to position data to where it can be repurposed. On the other hand, we are very diligent about the reasons why our customers made the data available to us in the first place. And so we're going to always be striking a balance between the - what's possible and what our customer contributors would like to see us do. But there's plenty of room in there for innovation. And then there are a variety of new data sets where we're making original calls for data. And you know, actually, even that takes a couple of forms. One is, we have existing platforms like PCS where we started to call data related to cyber incidents, and we didn't used to do that. So that's original data, but around an existing platform. We are always trying to enrich the data that comes into a platform like claims search, and then we're trying to find yet new forms of claims data that we don't receive today, for example, commercial claims histories are not as developed as personal claims histories. Mark, anything you want to add to all that?
Mark Anquillare: I think that was well said. I think it goes back to the earlier comment I made about partnerships in conversations with CEOs. In the world of data, obviously, our customers and many people feel their data is valuable. So we need to provide them with valuable use cases back to their businesses, in order for them to let us use the data. So having the great partnerships and relationships is very important. We continue to be a trusted intermediary for that data, and we feel that it's a privileged position.
Manav Patnaik: Got it and just for the follow-up. Lee, Just on the Energy and Specialized side I think last year you guys called out, I think it was a bank and then a merger related kind of headwind to the business. Have we lapped those comps and does that mean next year, your number should start looking better?
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Manav. We will lap that in the first quarter of 2019. So we were still experiencing that headwind in the fourth quarter, but that will go away in the first quarter of 2019.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Steinerman: Hi, it's Andrew. I wanted to ask about WoodMac 2.0 Lens. What are some milestone and rollouts that we should be looking for, and will WoodMac 2.0 help margins and revenues or just one of them and particularly make a comment for 2019?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, so let me take it at a general level. Andrew, maybe Lee, if you want to add anything. It's constructive on both the revenue and the margin side, because part of what Lens is getting after, is the very nature of our data aggregation, and it becomes more efficient on this platform that we've built. But equally, there's more functionality there for customers and so we think it will be constructive in both ways. I don't - I wouldn't point you so much to milestones, or at least not those that will be called out in the overall performance of the business. What I'm trying - and I'm not making a comment about the future profile of the financial performance of the business. I'm simply saying, the revenue streams are all sort of - think of it as a bowl of spaghetti, and Lens works its way through things that we already do, in addition to representing modules, new modules that we can license to customers. But I've called out specifics. Basically it will be - we do business with so many companies already, this will really enhance cross-selling into existing relationships. But in terms of visibility to the outside I'm not - I wouldn't call out any particular milestone, just the general progress of the business certainly. Lee, anything you want to add that?
Lee Shavel: No, I think Scott covered it. I would just make the comment that Lens really represents the platform that enables us to continue the evolution of a very good research and consulting business into increasingly a data analytics business that can serve a broader customer base, can develop and integrate data products more effectively, which is beneficial both from a revenue growth standpoint, as well as from a margin perspective. And I would just finally add that the team there continues to work on operational efficiencies, to improve the margin as well.
Andrew Steinerman: But Lee, might there be a time like maybe this year where you're running two infrastructures for WoodMac and it might be a drag to margins?
Scott Stephenson: Well, I mean, yes, but no. So you observe something, yes. But the implication, I don't think is right. So yes we need to be running things in parallel and we have been investing as Lee has referenced several times, to build the platform. But the actual operation of the platform, I mean one of the things that's so constructive inside of our business, is that we enjoy the gift of Moore's Law every day. And so actually, the cost of compiling data or even processing data inside of the platform that you have built, the incremental cost is not really all that great. I'm not saying that it's zero. So you're correct about what we will do operationally. But I think the implication you are trying to reach in terms of operating expense going forward is not so accurate.
Lee Shavel: Yes, and I would go more broadly. And I think that definitely has some relevance with regard to our transition to cloud, where we are making investments and see opportunities to find greater efficiencies, where we still have legacy costs. I think that is - would be a valid observation, not so much in this context. So thank you for the questions.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company. Your line is now open.
Tim McHugh: Yes, hello. First, I wanted to ask on the Energy side of the business. In the prepared remarks, you talked about being close designing to signing a consortium deal. Can you talk more about that and the nature of the data, I guess and the product, I guess that would flow out of it?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So those of you, who have followed us, know that the majority, in fact, a large majority of the data that we've had up until today, has been mostly about the commercial dimensions of the oil and gas business. So observations about productivity and the cost factors associated with the assets that produce either the raw materials or the refined materials. So those are the datasets that have typically traditionally been a part of what we do. The datasets we are adding are what we call the sub-surface datasets, and these are the ones that take into account the actual real-time operations, even in the oilfield, in combination with the nature of the rock and the nature of the fluids and the nature of the fields. So that we can complement everything we've already done - always done, with basically much more real-time optimization of the operations of our customers' assets. And this is something that we haven't done as much of, in fact very little of, up till now. So the datasets relate to that; real-time operational optimization.
Tim McHugh: And did you say it was for specifics region or sub-sector of companies you would start with.
Scott Stephenson: Well, yes. So whenever we talk about the consortium dataset, you're always you're always talking about specific customers and generally specific product sets or specific places. So that does apply and, excuse me, in what we're doing in building these new datasets the subsurface data sets, and our focus right now, predominantly is the lower 48 in the United States, where the need the situation in the United States is different than the situation in most other parts of the world. And because of the United States. What the operators are doing is basically saying that particular rig should I move 2000 feet and I can move it and four days later, have one thousand foot well that's producing, and so that, that's the speed with which strategy quote unquote is being set and operations are being rebalanced in the United States.
Tim McHugh: Hey, great. Thank you. And then on the insurance side the aerial imagery product set. Can you and I think you mentioned is one of the growth drivers, I guess, but can you give us more color on adoption kind of competition for that product at this point. How scaling, maybe relative to what the initial plan was 18 months ago or 12 months ago when you can of made a more aggressive push into this space.
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So this is Mark. I think your question is directed insurance and at the same time, we have been extended beyond that. So first of all, we've been very pleased with the takeaway we've had in the market, our market share is growing. We've won significant customers and many of them that is clearly contributed to some of the organic growth that we've talked about here beyond what is our fair to it as market share. We've also continued to add products. So remember in the world of I view as a complete automated solution. If I was to take use imagery in combination with some of the scoping and what we reverted image the scope, which is the exact activate tool behind our in front of all this imagery we can really automate and become more accurate and more cost effective for those claims adjusters. Literally, we think we can double the productivity of the claims adjuster field forces that our customer saving them hundreds of millions of dollars, so we're seeing that. What I also like to highlight though is that growth is extending beyond what is traditional insurance. As you think about world of contractors, if you think about the world of, I would reduce mapping and construction, as well as roofing companies, all of those found use cases in some slowing down or innovative way we view some of the technology. So that is contributing to the growth across the board. Even outside of insurance.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Bill Warmington: Good morning, everyone. So you mentioned the UK model and gateway for international expansion. So culturally there are a lot of similarities in the use at US and the UK. I guess Weinstein Churchill will call them two nations divided by a common language. But as you go, as you look to prioritize your other geographies for international expansion, what are the ones where you are going to be focusing first?
Scott Stephenson: So, Bill I am going to assumes that is a continuation of the conversation we had on insurance. So we think there's a lot more to do in the UK. So we'll continue to push there. I think what we've identified is looking at like markets. Looking at places that have a more mature insurance marketplace. And a gross premium and a growing gross premium. We have really identified Europe but more specifically Germany and France is kind of the next couple of places that are of interest. Down the road, I think everyone thinks about kind of emerging markets and emerging insurance markets like China and India. We aren't turning our back on that. We're keeping an eye on it, but we kind of think to your point, trying to stay close to the markets that are little more mature in Europe is probably the best next step for us.
Bill Warmington: Got it. Then for my follow up, your thoughts on FX impact to revenue in 2019.
Lee Shavel: Yes. So, Bill, I know the reason we try to focus on organic constant currency numbers is that we can't predict what's going to happen from an FX standpoint. So we're focusing on results excluding the FX range. I do think generally given the very strong US orientation of our business. Generally, the fact that that Wood Mack has a mix of US and international revenues, we think overall the exposure is relatively low. So I'd say proportionally we don't think it will have a big impact, but our focus is always to try to eliminate that factor which we can't completely control.
Operator: Thank you. We have our next question from Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is now open.
Jeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. As you productize the subsurface consortium data as you were just kind of explaining, are you inventing new categories of solutions to sell to customers? And I don't mean new relative to various coming new relative to the market or certain another way, do you have to displace solutions from the leading incumbents that have subsurface data already. Are these I guess Greenfield opportunities.
Scott Stephenson: It's a combination of the two. And it really hinges upon how much analytic content we get into what we do. So there are players today that will provide observations about a number of this sort of individual parameters that apply when you're trying to understand the productivity of real-time operations. So from one place you can get data as it relates to, for example, the completion strategies that have been taken for the individual. Well, there are other sources, where you can make sure that you have completely identified the leasing --the lease holding an ownership structure of whatever patch of land, you're talking about and then other places you can go for the heavy size technology work and on and on and on like that. So part of what we will do is to increasingly make those kinds of those kinds of data available to our customers. But then, over and above that, what doesn't exist so much in the marketplace today is the - is really the AI machine learned expression of all of that data in quantity across heterogeneous situations. So that in an automated fashion, you can really make predictions and drive decisioning, and there we expect, because we're Verisk, we will be distinguished. How much those kinds of solutions generate completely original revenue streams versus how much they displace, for example, some of these bespoke datasets. I would say that remains to be seen. The primary point here is, there is the opportunity for differentiation.
Jeff Meuler: That's helpful. And then on the Insurance business, there's been some underlying acceleration and there is a couple of years where maybe it was growing below trend a few years ago and you called out some various moment in time factors at that point. But I guess Scott, as you list out the eight factors that are driving it, they sound largely sustainable. So just how are you thinking about Insurance growth at this point. Like has bookings growth also accelerated, is bookings growth outpacing revenue growth? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Yes, so, you definitely understood what I was saying upfront. All eight of those trends apply broadly across our company, but specifically in the Insurance vertical. I mean if you just step back and you say okay, this environment - this Insurance environment, what characterizes it? The customer set is relatively stable. There are occasionally some large merger transactions and there are some segments like global reinsurance brokers, where there has been some of that seasonally. But by and large, the customer demography is steady. Regulation really doesn't change that much. Energy - excuse me, technology is a constructive factor, as it relates to a company like us, because back to the top, every - virtually every one of our customers believes they can grow faster than their competitors. And so everybody is trying to behave innovatively, and so that's, that's just inherently constructive for folks like us. And then if you think about all of the - the many references that we've made this morning, they are just new things that we're doing and bringing to the market that don't exist. And so it's a constructive environment. I mean, the United States Property and Casualty Insurance industry, our home market is the granddaddy of large-scale contributory data analytics. I mean it was invented that way practically. And so we really have this wonderful privilege of being who we are inside of that very constructive environment.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Jeff. I think we have time for two more questions. Operator Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
George Tong: Hi, thanks, good morning. I'd like to drill deeper into the Financial Services business; you touched on plans to reduce the variability of revenues through the restructuring of contracts. Can you elaborate on the initiatives you have to improve the overall growth of the segment? Because in the quarter, even after normalizing for the year-ago implementation revenues associated with TSYS, organic growth would have been pretty muted, any color there would be helpful?
Lee Shavel: Sure. So George, this is Lee, and I'm going to refer back to the kind of description in the organization that Lisa gave at Investor Day. And so, I think it's helpful if you think about it in the four components. The foundation of this business is the benchmarking solutions business. And as we indicated, the growth in that part of the business remains very stable. In addition, the spend-informed analytics component remains solid. The two areas where in the fourth quarter and I think represent our opportunity to make progress is in the enterprise data management component, and that really is an emerging space, it is one where we are finding opportunities to develop new data management solutions for our customers. Given our scale, given our expertise, and that's something that we certainly think, based upon feedback from clients is very positive. But that is something that we will develop over time. We're encouraged by the initial responses. And the other element is the fraud component, and that's an area, similarly where we - I feel very good about the contributions from our acquisition of LCI and G2, we are in the process of developing some of the infrastructure, some of the product sets around that, and we think that over time, that area will also be a stronger contributor to the growth overall. So that would be the way I would kind of organize thinking around where we see or where we have an immediate focus on improving the growth rate for that business.
George Tong: Very helpful. As a follow-up. I'd like to switch over to the Energy business, you saw an incremental step down in organic constant currency growth there, can you talk about trends in your non-recurring revenue streams in Energy and how annualized contract value growth is progressing, and in light of some of the declines we've seen in oil prices?
Lee Shavel: Sure. So I think in that - that's principally the consulting - consulting component business that was - it was still growing and growing at a higher rate than our subscription business. But the third quarter was particularly strong, and so I think that contributed at one level to a slight - and I would just view it as kind of a slight slowdown relative to the third quarter level. But overall, I think we see progress in this - continued progress in the subscription component of the business, particularly as it relates to the new breakout initiatives that are generating strong subscription growth within that segment.
Scott Stephenson: I would just add the recent movement in the commodity is within a range that we don't consider it material to the performance of our business.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Jeff Silber: Thanks for sneaking me in. I'll be quick. Just a quick numbers questions, Lee, what should we be modeling for interest expense this year, and also the tax rate guidance that you gave us for 2019, is that something we should view as longer term? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: Yes, so on tax, I think based upon what we see right now, obviously, any changes in tax legislation. I think that 19% to 21% range is a good basis. On interest expense, it's not something that we give formal guidance, we - obviously that's going to flex based upon what happens within the business and our capital allocation decisions. So I think kind of starting with the point of just stability in overall debt levels and looking at the average rates is probably a middle of the way road to go. But I wouldn't give you any specific guidance beyond that, because that will adjust based upon our capital allocation decisions over time, I would expect that we remain within this - within this leverage range, absent any other material changes.
Scott Stephenson: Okay. Well thank you all very much for your continued interest in Verisk, and we look forward to following up with a number of you, as well as those who are taking a new look at Verisk, based upon our new capital policy, including the dividend. So look forward to our continuing conversations with you. Thanks, thanks for this morning and your attention.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Verisk Analytics Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Stacey Brodbar. Ma'am, you may begin.
Stacey Jill Brodbar - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Regina, and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2018 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Lee Shavel, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark, and Lee, highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. It's good to be reporting another quarter where we can see strength in organic growth of our business across all our verticals. Excluding exceptional events in the third quarter of 2017 in the Insurance segment due to extreme weather and in the Financial Services segment due to a contract signing, the organic growth of our company was 7.5% in the quarter, consistent with our long-term model, and the profile of our growth is also reflecting our long-term model, in that it is balanced across all the verticals. I thought I would take a few minutes this morning to comment on the environment in which we do our work and the factors which interact with our results. Fundamentally, we are aligned with one of the most powerful movements in the economy, which is companies harnessing data analytics with even greater focus and investment. There is a new level of digitization of business operations that has become a necessity for companies in all the verticals we serve. While the notion of data as an asset has been around for a while, companies now are compelled to change the way they interact with their customers by becoming faster, more automated, more visual, and easier to use. These changes at the front-end of the business model require companies to rewire most everything behind the front-end as well. As businesses become more digital, they accumulate more data in real-time, and this causes them to become more analytic, given the decreased cost of ingesting and storing the data combined with improving data science. Against this backdrop, our ability to help our customers on the digitization journey, in combination with our unique datasets and deep domain knowledge, give us expanding opportunities to add value for our customers. The search for efficiency and insight from data analytics will only increase for our customers. As long as we remain close to our customers, hearing their emerging needs and responding with timely useful solutions that leverage our scale across industry participants, our value to our customers will grow. It is a positive thing for us that our customers are becoming more data analytic and hiring more data scientists. This increases their propensity to value the things we do. We are always alert to three risks. Is the regulatory environment changing? Is the structure of the verticals we serve changing? And, is the environment causing changes in the cost of doing business? On the one hand, the regulatory front has seen some change, but on the other hand there have been few changes that have materially impacted our business. One noteworthy move of the last several years has been more scrutiny in the banking sector, but the only effect has been our need to make some of our products more ready for reporting requirements, and that shift has already occurred. At the societal level, there has been movement toward more concern about data privacy, with approaches such as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in Europe. The primary effect of this is to reinforce the diligence we've always brought to keeping our data assets secure. Although data analytics, innovation, and technology continue to evolve and increase in importance, the structure of our industry verticals is not changing to any material degree. In Insurance, the global reinsurers and brokers have seen some consolidation as they work to adjust to a world in which risk can be borne directly by the capital markets. But the bulk of our work is with primary insurers, and the reinsurers are being affected in modifying their businesses. And more generally, the effect of digitization is to reduce distribution advantages and fixed costs, both of which will lessen the incentive to combine companies for cost advantage. The environment carries two trends, which push our costs in opposite directions. On the people front, we are increasing the mix of our team, which comes from the hard core data science world. These folks are highly sought-after and paid accordingly. On the technical infrastructure front, the move toward cloud computing and away from premise computing will reduce our computing and storage costs. We are in the early stage of seeing these benefits. So our overall perspective is that the basic conditions of our environment remain constructive. What it's down to, therefore, is the depth of our relationship with our customers, and the capability of our team to innovate solutions and make them work for our customers. In the past 30 days, I've visited with four CEOs of our leading customers. In every case, I came away with an enhanced sense of opportunity. As they take their businesses forward in a digitizing environment, their expressed preference is for a relatively short list of partners who can make sense of all the technical innovations and relate them to existing workflows. In such an environment, a trusted and tested partner like Verisk stands taller. As long as we continue to invest to keep our customers at the leading edge of innovation and do so with efficiency, we will realize value. On the talent front, I just received the results of our most recent employee engagement survey. We have once again qualified as a certified Great Place to Work. Additionally, Forbes has named Verisk to its World's Best Employers list and its America's Best Employers for Women list in 2018. This is supportive of our business, because our talent is what drives our customer depth and innovation agendas. We are expanding our business footprint globally. And in line with this, we are making moves to have centers of excellence in multiple geographies, with special focus on India and Eastern Europe. Lastly, our progress in the UK market remains encouraging with recent contract signings with market leaders. We are viewing our approach there as a template we will use as we target other specific markets in Europe and Asia. So with that, let me turn the call over to Mark.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. In our Insurance business, we had another strong quarter, with all insurance-facing businesses, Underwriting & rating, as well as Claims, contributing to growth. Let me highlight a few areas that drove top line growth and update you on several initiatives that better position us for the future. During the quarter, Underwriting & rating delivered another strong quarter of organic growth across personal lines underwriting, extreme event modeling, and industry-standard insurance program, through a combination of cross-sell of the existing solutions to new customers and the sale of new innovative solutions. Our Risk and Analytics Summit recently took place in Jersey City, focusing on our underwriting and pricing solutions. We covered a wide range of topics, including industry disruption, talent drain in the insurance industry, and cutting-edge technology, in combination with demonstrations of some of our newer solutions. The conference attracted about 150 insurance companies from around the world and featured a list of more senior level attendees this year. Feedback was very positive, with participants excited by the direction of our solutions and complimentary of the diverse and thought-provoking sessions. The engagement with customers was strong, further cementing the type of relationship that has led to our high customer retention rates and Verisk demonstrating the thought leadership in the property and casualty insurance industry that clients expect. In our extreme event modeling business, growth in AIR solutions remains strong. During the quarter, AIR Worldwide released Touchstone Re, a new catastrophe modeling application designed for estimating the loss potential of reinsurance contracts and portfolios, industry loss warranties, and insurance-linked securities. Touchstone Re is a major upgrade from CATRADER that enables companies to model and price complex reinsurance structures, understand where their exposures are concentrated around the globe, and summarize their portfolios and aggregate their overall risk. As you may recall, 2017 was marked by exceptional storms globally, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in the United States. In fact, 2017 was a record-setting year with catastrophe losses of more than $130 billion across the industry, which compares to an average loss of about $55 billion over the 10 years prior to 2017. Our Claims business benefited from the severe weather in third quarter 2017, which resulted in a revenue surge of approximately $8 million. After normalizing revenue from severe weather, our Claims business unit experienced another very strong quarter, with organic growth across all business units. Let me provide some color on these successes. The foundation of our Claims business unit consists of two core solutions, ClaimSearch, our industry fraud prevention solution; and Xactware, our repair cost estimating in workflow tools. These solutions are well-penetrated and deeply embedded in the workflows of U.S. insurers. From this strong position, we have been successful growing the business through a couple of avenues. The first path for growth is the sale of these core solutions to new segments. We continue to extend the consortium data and the use cases for our claim solutions, including new lines of insurance, such as health and disability. During the second half of 2017 and into 2018, we extended beyond insurance companies and have signed several contracts with service providers to help them manage their workflow and better serve their insurance customers. In addition, we continue to gain market share in the repair cost estimating market by signing new contracts during 2008 (sic) [2018] (00:11:49) that have contributed to the growth. The second avenue of growth is the development of new analytic solutions, leveraging our underlying core solutions. A few examples of success include ClaimDirector, our expert claim scoring systems that helps customers distinguish between suspicious and meritorious claims. This proactive fraud-fighting tool provides scores based on the analysis of each claim's attribute and the broader industry data from ClaimSearch. In addition, ClaimXperience, a digital engagement platform that provides insurance companies with important tools to help claims representatives work more effectively with policyholders. This workflow tool leverages the underlying Xactware solutions and helps insurers engage with their policyholders in their supply chain. Finally, Geomni, our business unit that aggregates an image library of commercial and residential structures and leverages advanced analytics to extract measurements and data. Although applicable in many markets, Geomni's early success has been in the insurance claims adjusting market due to the tight integration with our Xactware repair cost estimating tools. This has resulted in noteworthy efficiencies for insurers and strong growth at Geomni, where we have signed several new contracts and have gained market share. Across all businesses, from both a customer and financial perspective, we're very pleased with the performance of the Insurance business. With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank, Mark. First, I'd like everybody to know that we posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. The presentation provides some background data trends and analysis to support our conversation today. So moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and a GAAP basis, revenue grew 9% to $599 million. Net income was up 37.5% to $166 million for the quarter. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.99 for the third quarter of 2018, an increase of 37.5% compared with the same period in 2017. Before I begin discussing the financial results in more detail, I would like to call your attention to three exceptional items in the quarter that impact year-over-year comparisons. Number one, Insurance segment organic constant currency revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth were impacted by $8 million in exceptional storm-related revenue in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2017. This was the result, as Mark described, of exceptional client activity related to hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017. Two, Financial Services segment organic constant currency revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth were impacted by $6 million in nonrecurring TSYS project revenues in the third quarter of 2017, as we described in our last earnings call. These revenues were the result of the initiation and implementation of our partnership with TSYS and do not reoccur. We do anticipate over time revenues from the joint marketing of our analytics products to TSYS customers. And three, in August 2018, the subordinated promissory note associated with the sale of our healthcare business in 2016 was settled in full for cash proceeds of $121 million. As a result, we reported a gain of $12 million in the third quarter of 2018. The interest income associated with this note was approximately $1 million per month or $3 million per quarter. Given the settlement timing, we recorded interest income of $2 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to $3 million in the prior-year's quarter. The related gain and interest income from the note settlement were excluded from all adjusted EBITDA calculations. Please note that, historically, this interest income was included in adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, our ongoing adjusted EBITDA will be reduced by $3 million per quarter, mostly in the Insurance segment. With those items covered, let's focus on our organic constant currency results for all year-over-year growth rates and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations, recent acquisitions for which we don't have a full year-over-year comparison and nonrecurring items. Acquired revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic results were $32 million and $9 million, respectively. On a reported organic constant currency basis, Verisk delivered revenue growth of 4.7% and adjusted EBITDA expense growth of 7.9% for adjusted EBITDA growth of 1.6% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 48.5%. The revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth rates reflect the impact of the exceptional storm activity and the nonrecurring TSYS revenue in the third quarter of the prior year. Normalizing for these events, revenue growth would have been 7.5% and adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 7.1%, reflecting organic growth across all our industry segments. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 48.5% was down slightly from 48.7% on a normalized basis in the prior period. Now, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you'll see in table 2 in the press release, Insurance reported 5.5% revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA growth of 2.5%, reflecting the inclusion of exceptional storm revenue in the prior period. Excluding these events in the prior year, Insurance revenue would have grown 7.7% and adjusted EBITDA would have grown 6.4%, reflecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 54.3%, down from 55% in the prior year on a normalized basis due to continued investment in Geomni and other breakout opportunities, as well as higher commissions related to the strong sales and higher salary and benefit expenses to support growth opportunities. Within our Underwriting & rating business, we saw solid performance, with healthy growth in both personal and commercial lines. Within Claims, the strong growth was driven by solid performance across most of our claims businesses, partially offset by a modest decline in our workers' compensation claim resolution services. Energy and Specialized Markets delivered revenue growth of 6.3% in the quarter, up from 5% in the prior quarter, as the energy industry continues to recover. Growth improved in both our consulting and research solutions, and we also had a positive contribution from environmental health and safety revenues. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9.1%, also an improvement from 0.9% growth in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.8% was up from the prior year period of 31%, despite the ongoing investments in WoodMac 2.0 and our chemicals, subsurface, and power and renewables breakouts that increased head count and associated compensation expense. These areas represent opportunities to leverage Wood Mackenzie's data and industry expertise more broadly and to deliver and develop products more swiftly and efficiently. Financial Services revenue declined 9.2% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA decreased by 28.6%, reflecting the impact of the nonrecurring TSYS revenue of $6 million in the prior-year period. On a normalized basis, revenue would have grown 9.1% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA would have grown 15.2%, reflecting growth in portfolio management solutions, which includes our foundational benchmarking analytics, and spend and marketing solutions, where we are leveraging our data and expertise in consumer spending to support both financial and non-bank clients. In addition, expense control contributed to the strong adjusted EBITDA growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.7% in the period compares to 32.8% in the prior year on a normalized basis. We continue to be encouraged by the progress in our Financial Services segment and certainly are pleased by the strong normalized results in this quarter, demonstrating the core growth potential of the business. It's important to keep in mind that we are working to reduce the variability of revenue in the business, particularly around project-based items. As we continue to work through this process, the Financial Services segment will continue to have a higher level of quarterly fluctuations on revenues and growth than our other segments. Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter, up 6.6% from the prior year quarter due to the funding of acquisitions in 2017. Total reported debt was $2.6 billion at September 30, 2018, down from $3 billion at December 31, 2017. We used the proceeds of $121 million from the repayment of the subordinated promissory note to pay down debt and our leverage at the end of the third quarter was 2.2 times. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $152 million at September 30, 2018. Our reported effective tax rate was 13.9% for the quarter, compared to 33.2% in the prior year quarter as the result of recent tax reform. Our effective tax rate was lower than our targeted range due to significant exercises of soon-to-expire employee stock options related to our 2009 IPO that produced a favorable tax rate impact. We are maintaining our estimate of our effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 16% and 18%. However, the timing and impact of employee stock option exercises depends in part on the Verisk stock price and personal decisions. We expect the impact from employee stock option exercises will be less pronounced in 2019, and thus we will revert to a higher effective tax rate. Adjusted net income was $182 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.08 for the third quarter, up approximately 30% from the prior year. This increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, and the impact of 2017 tax reform. Equalizing the third quarter of 2017 effective tax rate to that of third quarter 2018, adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 3.7% and 3.8%, respectively. Further normalizing for the elevated storm and TSYS project-related revenues in the quarter, net income and diluted adjusted EPS would have increased 9.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $227 million for the quarter, up 39.7% from the prior year. Capital expenditures were $55 million for the quarter, up 33.7% from the prior year, reflecting primarily increased investment in Geomni and software development for recent acquisitions. As we've discussed previously, 2018 will be the peak year of capital expenditure for Geomni. Free cash flow was $172 million for the quarter, an increase of 41.8% for the prior year. We returned $102 million in capital to shareholders through the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares in the quarter at a weighted average price of $117.97. At September 30, we had $584 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And in addition, we initiated a new $50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the fourth quarter. In conclusion, I want to add an additional perspective. As you know, we are very focused in these calls on the results for the quarter. However, given the three items that impacted the quarter as we approach year end, I think it's useful to step back and look at our year-to-date results for the Insurance segment and Verisk as a whole. For the year-to-date period, on an organic constant currency basis, and not – I repeat – not normalized for the exceptional storm activity, revenues were up 7.5% and adjusted EBITDA was up 7.6%, demonstrating margin improvement. On the same basis, and not normalized, Verisk revenues were up 6.3% and adjusted EBITDA was up 5.8%, reflecting a slight overall margin decline from 49% to 48.8%, despite very high margins from the storm and nonrecurring project revenue in the third quarter of last year. These overall results, of course, reflected weaker performance of our non-Insurance segments earlier in the year and tough comparisons in the third quarter. However, in the third quarter, we demonstrated continued progress in operating revenues and margins for both segments. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on the long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, and we look forward to seeing as many of you as possible at our upcoming Investor Day on December 6 in New York City or welcome your participation through our webcast. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us today, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Our first will come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Scott, my first question was just tied to your opening comments around digitization and the opportunity there. And, I guess, more specifically, just in terms of the decision analytic side of Insurance, like how do you think that will perform if we do enter a tough period here in the next couple of years?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I just want to clarify your question. A tough period meaning the performance of the insurance – the state of the insurance industry?
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Well, yeah. Just if we do hit a recession broadly in just the Insurance offers, like how do you think the analytics piece of your Insurance business...
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I got it.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I understand. Yeah, thank you. Well, the best answer to that, I think, is actually found in our own historical performance. There was a consecutive five-year period where premiums were down year-over-year and our business performed very well during that period, and the reason is that what the insurance companies need to do, whether they're in particularly strong moments of the cycle or weaker moments of the cycle, is to continue to upgrade their ability to ingest information, translate it into insight, and then reflect that in a way they price their products, structure their products, adjust claims around their products, et cetera. That is the work of the insurance companies, and that's what we're fundamentally a part of. So, we're very comfortable with how our Insurance business will do, almost regardless of the cycle. I'm saying that very strongly. Obviously, sort of extreme events in the moment can have an effect, but we've actually been through this and our business held up very well.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And, Mark, maybe just in terms of some of the new products and so forth you were calling out, I guess, maybe the one area maybe you can just update us on is the telematics initiative. It sounds like all the insurance companies are, obviously, talking a lot more about it on their calls, but just curious how we should think about when your exchange starts driving some contributions.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, thank you, good question. I think we are very pleased with the position we're in, where we've these really exclusive arrangements with some of the larger OEMs and that has cemented us. So now it's every day we have more cars, more miles, and better data on that exchange. The early returns are really focused on two things. One, there's approach on the claims side to be easier and helpful to those driving your automobile. So think of an accident occurring, first of all, is there some safety or public safety you need, ambulance, could we get you a ride, tow truck? Also, let us quickly through a hot and warm transfer notify the insurance carrier that there's a claim. So this is a first notice, all automated that is very attractive to all parties involved, and that seems to be probably the place we lead. Secondly, we have found that a lot of carriers are taking the data and the information that is coming off, we call it model-ready data, but basically they're using the data to model, and they're finding great lift in pricing policies using that industry or data exchange. So, early days, I think it will continue to grow. I would say that we all think that IoT is happening, but probably at a slower pace than what we've seen in Europe and elsewhere. We remain optimistic and we love the position we're in.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: First, I wanted to ask about the Insurance EBITDA. I think, Lee, you mentioned that there's going to be sort of $3 million lower in the future quarters in Insurance EBITDA because of the interest expense recorded from that promissory note. I wanted to just make sure I had that right. And so, basically this quarter you adjusted out that, as well as the gain, so it would really be as if this quarter didn't have it, but prior quarters did. I just want to make sure I understood that right.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, thank you, Toni. I appreciate the opportunity just to go into a little bit more detail on that. And so, you referred to it as the interest expense, just to be clear on the note, it was an asset that we hold. We were receiving approximately $3 million of interest income on that note. And the reason that it's in EBITDA is that under the SEC definition of EBITDA, you take net income and you add back interest expense, not net interest expense, so it's included in that calculation. And so since this was an acquisition-related activity and we want to certainly separate out the gain and the impact of the interest income for comparability, the gain has been excluded. And then to the extent that there is any interest income in the period, we have excluded from the third quarter of 2017 $3 million of that interest income from our EBITDA and in the third quarter of 2018, $2 million of the interest income that we realized before its redemption. And so the thing that we want for all of the analysts to understand is that going forward that that $3 million, which is in all of the segments, but the bulk of it is in Insurance, I would think of it at a corporate level of $3 million of EBITDA that comes out of our future quarterly results. Does that clarify things?
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It does. Thank you. And then my follow-up, I wanted to ask about energy, really good, strong organic growth quarter there. Just if you could give us a little bit more detail. I know you mentioned the markets recovering, but just what are you hearing from clients? What are sort of some of the – is it sort of driven by the consulting strength, and basically do you think that the positive trends should continue in the fourth quarter as well as into next year? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, so maybe starting at the end of that, Toni. The performance of that segment is really pretty broadly based, and what I mean by that is that it spans the kinds of solutions that we have traditionally provided, so sort of the core look at the supply chain of the oil and gas space, but also includes the upstream subsurface kinds of analytics, which are relatively newer for us, analytics related to the renewable forms of energy. And then kind of over-the-top on all of that, the digitizing trend that I talked about probably is differentially being felt more strongly in the energy space than it is in the others, because energy actually has started further behind. So we talked a lot about WoodMac 2.0 and essentially sort of changing our own technical infrastructure, which allows us to interact with our customers differently. That's a constructive movement in the business, because our customers themselves are also changing their digital methods on the commercial side of their businesses. So it's really very broadly based. If you were to think of it in terms of sort of what it is that's getting delivered and looking at where we have been in 2018 and where we're going in the future, we're always encouraged when we see consulting do well, because it tends to be a leading indicator of the propensity of our customers to be thinking into the future. And that has been strong, so that's an encouraging signal for us. But as those of you who are familiar with our story know, most of the revenue is related to subscriptions. And over the course of 2018, subscriptions have advanced nicely also across several of those thematic categories that I talked about. So it's not really any one thing. It's really broadly based.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. It's Andrew. I wanted to talk about two things around Argus. I know it's a smaller business for you. The first one, Scott, you said something about – your prepared remarks about kind of changing products to, I think, adjust to regs. And I was wondering if that's an Argus-related comment? Because I remember in the second quarter you talked about some regs about targeting within Argus that needed changes for the customers. And my question is, have those changes been made? And have customers moved forward? And the second question is, the contracts that were announced at Analyst Day, have those ramped up?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, so to your question about the models, that comment in my remarks was related to Financial Services and Argus specifically. And what's going on there, just to sort of reprieve that real quick is, that in the face of mounting regulation, the amount of documentation that is required on some of your models, if you're a bank or you're a credit card issuer, have really, really ramped up. And so we have created some offerings that were pretty popular with our customers. And that summarized a lot into what we call a wallet-share model. And so if you're going to use sort of a wallet-share model, what the regulators have said is you cannot sort of operate that as a black box. You're going to have to show us what's inside of your black box. And so sort of the burden for our customers of opening up the black box really got sort of pretty large. And so in the face of that, what we've done is we have essentially disaggregated some of those models and sort of essentially taken the attributes which build up into the overall view, and that's what we're now making available to our customers. So I just want everybody to understand that's the movement. So the insight is still useful, but the way it gets presented has had to change. And then to your question, so in the third quarter of 2018, the net effect of moving – some of our customers moving away from the wallet-share models and moving into the attributes was essentially a drag on the revenue line in the third quarter. So the transition is not yet complete. What that means is actually that there is upside for us going forward. We're feeling – we have felt, over the last couple of quarters, the burden of that transition. And as we go forward that's going to eventually even out or even move in the right direction.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And, Scott, I asked about the eight contracts from Analyst Day.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Right.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Michael, let me take that one. So the answer is from – over this period, there has been a portion of those contracts that we have executed and have begun generating revenue, and there have been a portion that has fallen out. I appreciate your assiduousness in tracking that. It's not something that we are tracking on a regular basis. We're, obviously, looking at kind of the current portfolio. But we have realized some of those contracts and some of those we did not get to execution on. And I can try to give you more detail on that once we've kind of researched and tracked those specific items as we have in the past. But I don't have those numbers in front of me.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Much appreciated. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. My question is just around pricing. Just given inflation in the system, but more importantly, given your investment in new datasets, are you guys thinking about pricing differently than when you were owned by the insurance companies versus even just before you had Geomni? Just any sense on pricing philosophy and how that has changed and what we should think about going forward.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, our pricing philosophy is the same as it's always been, which is that we price to value. So we're very focused on the utility of our solutions for our customers. And it's on that basis that we set the prices for the solutions that we provide. And as has always been the case, our preference and the heart of our model is recurring subscriptions, and we find that that's good for our customers. They like knowing with some certainty what they're going to be paying for our solutions. And it's good for us, because of the visibility and the recurrence. So we normally try to – that's where we try to set our pricing model. There are some occasions where with newer solutions particularly, the customers would prefer that we start out transaction priced, because (00:40:03) exactly how much of it they're going to consume as they begin using it. And so we're perfectly happy to do that when that's what the customers want. But we generally find with time that they would like us to transition to subscriptions. And then the last thing I'll add is, as a part of our pricing philosophy, that we generally attempt to achieve multiyear subscriptions with price inflators on an annual basis, which reflects the fact that most of what we do is so basic to what our customers do, it's so embedded in their workflows, that there's just sort of a mutual understanding that this is the way business is going to get done. And so our customers are comfortable with signing multiyear agreements. And of course, for us that just represents an even higher level of recurrence. So everything I just said has been a part of our approach since October of 2009 when you first saw us as a public company. And I'm very certain will remain our go-to-market approach.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And just a follow-up question. I know you touched on healthcare a bit around insurance. Maybe just remind us, how much of your business today is not P&C insurance? Specifically auto, home, you touched on healthcare. And then maybe, do you see any changes in terms of autonomous cars, connected homes impacting that business just from a technology standpoint? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, Lee, in a minute, I'll let you just talk about the split of our revenues. But, yeah, autonomous cars and Internet of Things, data coming from vehicles and from homes, very definitely a part of what we're doing. Those are constructive trends inside of our business and will only continue to be more important, especially for insurance companies. So that's just sort of established inside of what it is we're doing. Lee, do you want to just talk about the split of our business?
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, let me – and, Hamzah, I think first, just to kind of start off at a high level. Just from the overall insurance perspective, for year-to-date 2018, the Insurance segment represents 71% of our total revenue and 81% of our EBITDA. I think you were asking for color around what portion of our revenues or our business composition is not P&C, and so let me clarify. The vast majority of our Insurance revenues are P&C-related. Auto and home are what we do there is P&C, property and casualty related. So you may want some context around what portion is home-related or auto-related, and perhaps Mark can give you some perspective around that. I don't know that we have that breakout, because it's embedded in, for instance, our ISO and our Claims business together, but perhaps we can talk around that. Is that the sort of information that you were looking for?
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yes, exactly.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So maybe that's something we can come back to you with to try to give you the breakout on some of those other components, but we don't have those – a sense of that right now.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Yeah, we can do it offline. Thank you.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, guys.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Scott, your high-level industry comments are always much appreciated for perspective. And one of the things, I think you said – you touched a little bit on the insurance industry consolidation and, obviously, you have seen that flow-through your business for the last few years, and then I think you made some comments on perhaps reinsurance. I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit in terms of how the industry is changing via consolidation and what specifically you think that means to your business maybe shorter term or intermediate term. I assume longer-term it's not as big an impact, but I just wonder if you could maybe be a little more granular.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, sure. So all the way to the top, just talking about what the demography of the industry looks like. At the top-end of the market, there are a certain number of consolidations each year. My emphasis here would be on the fact that it's really not a very large number. But also bear in mind that there are new entrants into the insurance space on a consistent basis and several of these are what get referred to as the insur-techs. Sometimes they're innovating based upon the way that they segment the market. You have some innovation in terms of, say, peer-to-peer forms of insurance, which are kind of interesting, but they haven't expressed themselves yet as particularly big trends. But think of it as an industry where, yes, there is some consolidation at one end of the market, but there is also entry at the other end of the market. We have done very well with the new entrants. They find it really helpful to be able to make use of our methods as they get started. They're efficient. It helps them get into business quickly. It's actually a credibility point for them as they do their business, et cetera. So, as we talk about sort of the evolution – and this is very real-time what I'm describing here, these new companies come into the market, we find that they're very inclined to work with us. When consolidations occur – and again, my emphasis here would be how relatively few of them happen, but when they do occur, it's very situation-specific in terms of what it does to our business. There may be some cases where the two companies coming together, they're very overlapping in their use of Verisk solutions. And in that case, they very reasonably expect that like-on-like there might be some reduction in the total invoiced amount for the solution that the two companies were using and now the one are using. But there are frequently offsets to that also, because it's also the case that one company may be using our solutions and the other company is not. And in those cases, actually, there's a very nice cross-sell opportunity within that same account. And so when we go through these transitions with our customers where two become one, we dig in very deeply and talk to them about everything that they're using that comes from us, and the things that they're not. And there can be an effect maybe in year one, although, not particularly large, and then on an ongoing basis generally, the profile of the account going forward, the growth profile is, I think – Mark, check me on this, but I think is generally about the same as it was before two companies became one. So we note consolidation, and as I say, it's very situation-specific, but it's not a major effect on our business. Anything you want to add to that?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think the only thing I'll – I think you were trying to get a little feel for it. I think we feel that 2017 on the primary side of things, it was kind of business as normal. I think there were some reinsurance mergers that may have a little bit of a headwind as it relates to more of our cat modeling business. That would be my high-level, short-term view of things, if that helps.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: There might be a few more situations, like where AXA and XL Catlin came together, and that's an interesting one, because I think that one actually represents a fair amount of opportunity for us. But I mentioned that one, because that has sort of a global geographic markets dimension and it's also reinsurance sort of being layered more directly on top of insurance inside of one specific company. So I think you may see some of that, but that's actually the most constructive kind of consolidation I can imagine.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: For us, constructive for us.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: That's really helpful. Thank you. And, Scott, I think you also made a comment – maybe, Mark, it was in your comments, about Geomni share gains. I wonder if you could just talk about from whom Geomni is taking share.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, there's only a few competitors in the market, and I think we've been fortunate to deliver value and provide a particularly integrated solution that is appealing to several insurers and service providers. So, we continue to see some opportunities, a good pipeline, as well as close sales. So that's contributing to the growth you're seeing in 2018 and should continue into the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Please go ahead.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on, there was an earlier question about Wood Mackenzie and energy, I guess, more broadly, and I understood the kind of broad comments, I guess. But can you help us drill down into how we should think about the growth trend within the subscription piece, the high level number in the earnings release about subscription revenue, the percentage of revenue from subscription would suggest it was very strongly driven to growth in that segment by the consulting piece. And I understand there is a comparison with the loss of one contract, there'll be some noise there. Can you give more color to help us understand the progress or how much progress, I guess, is being made on growing subscription revenue for that business?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, actually, quite a bit of progress is being made on subscriptions. And again, I think you do need to look beyond one quarter to say the year or even multiple years. But since we really called the turn on the business, which would have been – just referencing my notes here – oh, I guess, about 10 months ago or so, the progression of the subscriptions from then has looked very much like what we would expect and is very supportive of our view that this is a business which can perform above the rate of organic growth of all of Verisk actually. So in the quarter, it happened that the transaction revenues were particularly strong. And, yes, we are working our way through one substantial subscription agreement that went off the books in 2018. We've talked about that. But I think that over intermediate and long periods of time, subscription revenue growth will be equal to or probably even exceed the rate of consulting – or just kind of they will both be very strong contributors, but what we're focused on is subscription revenue growth. That's the heart of our business.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Scott, maybe I could add perspective. I think, Tim, that when we think about the subscription growth and kind of the core subscriptions, kind of putting aside some of the breakouts, and the breakouts are also largely subscription-oriented and research-oriented, and we have seen steady progress in the growth rate and new subscriptions in kind of the mid-single digits category before we factor in the breakouts. And then we look at the breakouts and those have been very strong growth as we penetrated those new areas, and so that gives us confidence that moves us more into kind of the higher single digits range. And then on top of that, we have the consulting revenue, which, as you point out, was strong. Now, consulting revenue and the growth that we saw this experience was clearly a significant contributor to the overall growth. But we certainly see continued progress in that strength and in that improvement in subscription growth, supplemented by the breakout subscription growths, which are at a high level. So that maybe gives you some context on relative growth rates to complement Scott's perspective.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I guess, a last point I would make is that a lot of the subscription renewals occur in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So to a degree it's not really quite surprising that the third quarter would be relatively a little quieter with respect to subscriptions.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, Lee, just a follow-up to that. Are those growth when you say mid-single digits in the core and high single including the breakout, are you excluding the loss of the – the impact of this customer that you lost?
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. What I'm referring to are kind of what we're experiencing currently, and so that reflects the impact of that loss of that large global investment bank. And so, I think as we've talked about in the past, that's kind of roughly 1 percentage point drag from a growth standpoint.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you. A couple segment-level margin questions. So, first, on Insurance, I know that there's other factors in here, like that come from the year ago and the interest income effect. But just on the aerial imagery investments, I guess, can you just maybe talk about where you're at in that investment cycle? What you're investing in in terms of product? Because I understand the planes and sensor investments, but I think that would flow through CapEx. So just on the margin impact, I guess, where you're at on the aerial imagery product and what you're investing in currently?
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure. So Jeff, let me approach it this way. So, yes, there is – certainly, the bulk of the investment from a capital standpoint is going into purchasing planes and sensors and operations, and so that's something that we've talked about before that will peak in 2018. We expect that that will come down. Further, as we are ramping up the pilots and the personnel in order to drive that, that that is effectively an additional investment as we are gathering and expanding the scope and the breadth of data, and so that is factored in and you see that in the P&L. To kind of give you some context, when we look at that impact across Verisk as a whole, that contributes about 1% roughly of our expense growth, so that gives you some context for the scale of that impact. It has a lesser impact currently on revenue, but we, obviously, are growing at a high rate, and so that translates into a slightly also smaller impact on EBITDA. So that kind of gives you kind of a sense of the scale of that investment. Mark, did you have something you wanted to add to that?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: All I was going to say is, once you get those planes and those sensors, you now need to put them in the sky, so we're looking to drive coverage as far as both nationwide and frequency so we can see changes in properties. So that causes us to have to put pilots in the plane, there's cost to operate, there's maintenance on the planes. Clearly, then we take all of the imagery, we process it, we're trying to kind of use it for different use cases, and we're extending the analytic capabilities of the team to provide underwriting use cases, extending the claims, and cat exposure. So I want to just emphasize, there's an OpEx piece as we continue to do a lot of advanced analytics, along with build out coverage and kind of capability. So (00:57:01).
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And I think one thing to bear in mind is, I think as Mark was describing, the benefits of the use of this data spans across multiple of our businesses, and so it will have revenue impacts and EBITDA impacts positively as we try to leverage that data across the business.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the Energy and Specialized Markets margins, they've been quite good. I feel like a couple quarters ago, you were calling out investments there with WoodMac 2.0 and the breakout initiatives. And I don't know if you were more describing why when you started presenting segment margins they were lower than investors might have expected, but I just – I guess I wanted to confirm that there wasn't some delay in those investments. They're progressing as planned and the good margin we're seeing on a year-over-year basis in that segment is even with that investment. Thank you.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, certainly, there has been a level of investment that we've been making in WoodMac 2.0, as well as in the breakout opportunities that we have been investing in that have an impact. Those are proceeding as we expect. WoodMac 2.0 will be an investment cycle that certainly existed in 2018 and will persist through 2019 as we expand that platform. And that we are already beginning to see some benefits of that within the business, but there will be continued CapEx investment, continued OpEx investment in that through 2019, and so that's embedded in those margin numbers. And I think one of the benefits that we saw is that we had good cost control. Headcount growth was, I think, a little lower this quarter, having brought on some of the development folks that we needed on that front, and so that contributed to the clear improvement in margin that we saw in the third quarter.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, first question, just a clarification on the storm contribution adjustment. I know that last year was a major year for storms and outsized gains from that, but there also were severe storms in third quarter of 2018. And so when you make that adjustment, how much storm revenue – was the storm revenue contribution from the third quarter of 2018 also backed out? I just want to understand the mechanics of that adjustment.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, Bill, I guess our view is that 2017 was truly an exceptional year. There's always going to be severe weather. 2018 is going to be, in our mind, something really strange happened. Towards the latter part of the year is just going to be a normal year of severe weather. So I don't think we see anything adjusting or any adjustments to normalization in 2018. We've been focused on 2017 because of the exceptional aspect. Let me just remind everybody, the way many of our contracts, specifically the Xactware or repair cost estimating contracts, work is that we provide access to the solution for a number of claims. And then when you eclipse a threshold, you then get charged per claim at excess rate. It takes quite a substantial threshold or number of volume – lot of volume to get above that threshold. I don't think we're going to see much of that in 2018. 2017 was noteworthy.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And then for my follow-up, Nielsen has been talking about how the GDPR regulation has been negatively impacting their marketing effectiveness business, and I know that they're a big user of the Argus data. And the Argus organic revenue growth showed a nice rebound in the third quarter. So I wanted to ask, is that rebound taking place despite – or even with that GDPR headwind, is that something that you're seeing that you're able to overcome?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So, GDPR is a contextual factor for us, but not one that I would say is really interacting with our results near-term. And as long as we protect our data assets, the way that we have and I expect we will, I do not believe it will be a material impact going forward. So I can't comment on somebody else's construal of the effect of the regulations, but where our business is concerned. The primary effect of it, as we interface with our customers, is we have an extended discussion about contracts, because we need to now talk about the assignment of liability, at a higher level we always have had to talk about it, but we talk about it more than we used to. That's really the only effect that I see. And it's not material, it's not material.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. Well, thank you very much, and Happy Halloween.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning. So, I guess, the first question, when I look back to the beginning of 2017, pretty clearly you've had a significant investment cycle here, 20-some acquisitions and a meaningful internal step-up, things like Geomni, the new WoodMac platform, et cetera. Can you just frame for us how you think about the returns to the business that this investment cycle will deliver going forward? And, I guess, I'm wondering things like should we think of this as incremental to revenue growth or really just bolstering the business so it can continue to deliver. How do we think about the step-down in margins and how that may trend over time? And anything about how you're thinking about the return on this. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Right. Good. So I'll ask Lee to talk about margins in a moment, but with respect to the investments that we've made, very substantially they go in the direction of putting us into new categories of solution sets that we otherwise either haven't provided or we provided in ways that haven't fully expressed what it is we can do for customers. So, for example, the acquisition of PowerAdvocate puts us in a category of spend analytics for the energy vertical that we weren't doing before. The Sequel acquisition puts us in a position to serve the London market, particularly with respect to complex commercial risks, in a way that we weren't able to serve it before. And then all the investments that we've done in Geomni, we were in the category of interpreting remote imagery into datasets, into analytics for our customers. The issue that we had was we didn't have enough high-quality raw material. And so a lot of the investment, as you heard Mark saying, on the Geomni side was basically to put ourselves in a position to have a lot of great raw material. So, again, that is very much aimed at putting us into a new and different position for enhanced revenue growth on the top line. And then other internal investments, the same. WoodMac 2.0 will carry with it some efficiency gains, but it also makes us more capable in front of our customers. So very much it is about contributing to incremental growth of our business. It's not about the maintenance of things that we already do. And that is also really part of our feeling about the likely returns of these investments that we're making, which, as you would imagine, revenue ramps, most everything we do is scalable, so as these investments mature and the revenues grow, I would expect to see it be constructive with respect to margin. And also, even if you look at more than just say a quarter – and maybe, Lee, you want to pick up here a little bit – yeah, we still see constructive progression in the organic EBITDAs inside of our business relative to the organic revenue growth rates. So...
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. I would just quickly add in addition to what Mark described to develop new sources of revenue growth or enhance the revenue growth that we're generating off of our data, we are also making investments, for instance, in cloud modernization that we think will yield overall improved returns on capital and improved margins for us. So we are making those types of investments as well. And we look at each of those investments on the basis of what type of return are we generating, whether it's through savings or through incremental profitability. So, thanks, Gary.
Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. And then just the follow-up for me, so you've lapped three of the four chunkier, larger acquisitions from 2017 during this quarter. I know you don't like to talk about forward margin trends. But is there anything you'd call out that would lead us from believing the reasonable pathway here is having lapped a lot of that drag that there's been in your profitability goes away at this point or soon? I realize you got a tough comp in Q4 with the Insurance comparison. But anything else you'd call out? Or is it reasonable, having lapped a lot of that, things look better from here? Thank you.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So, Gary, I think it's important to understand your frame of reference, because what we do try to accomplish with our organic constant currency margins is to look at the business on an apples-to-apples basis, so that the business isn't influenced by those trends. You will see in the difference between our reported and our organic margin that delta reflecting the impact of some of the acquisitions before we have a year-over-year comparison. And those also include some transition costs associated with those businesses. So I think perhaps what you're seeing is a narrowing of the difference between that reported and the organic margin numbers, which I think reflects what you're describing, is effectively the business is now absorbing that. We still have – I think in the fourth quarter, we still have PowerAdvocate that is outside of that. So there still will be some adjustments for that, but we are narrowing that gap.
Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. I was wondering to what extent do you think you could provide – and I don't want to take anything away from the Analyst Day, but a medium- or longer-term outlook for the growth rates for the segments.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So, Joe, thanks for that. We do provide, as we described before, our target revenue and EBITDA growth rates. And what we've said is that over the long term we expect all of our businesses to deliver on those growth targets. So beyond that, we don't provide separate for that. I kind of think implied by that, obviously, the Insurance business is going to be expected to deliver on those growth rates. And we certainly expect over time – or, I should say, based on historical performance, have seen both the Financial Services and, we believe, Wood Mackenzie have delivered on higher growth rates than that. And we certainly believe that that's an opportunity ahead of us in something that we are working towards. But those we are focused on our overall Verisk growth rates. And each of the businesses are expected to meet those objectives.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it. So essentially those are kind of unchanged as of right now, just to be clear. And then the second question is, without being sort of on the inside of the business, maybe you could give us the top two or three drivers of margins at this particular juncture. And any area where you think there might be some volatility on the margin targets going forward. Thanks.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So from an overall standpoint, the important driver of margin improvement is our ability to leverage our cost base in our businesses, our data businesses, across a broader customer set. And so that's – the fundamental driver of that, an additional subscription of our existing dataset, however broadly we define that, is going to have a very high margin and one that is in all likelihood higher than our overall margin. And that's the fundamental dynamic that drives our confidence in our operating leverage and our ability to achieve that. I'd say beyond that, we are always looking for ways to become more efficient with the resources that we have. And so, Mark has been driving an initiative on looking at how we can be more efficient by leveraging our scale internationally within the business. And so given that personnel costs represent about 70% of our cost base, we're always looking for how we can improve productivity from that base, which is something that Scott emphasizes highly in our discussions with the business. So I think that's another dimension to what we do. And then from a technological standpoint, as I talked about, investment in cloud technology is something that we think has the opportunity to improve our margins, not just by reducing our technology costs, but by facilitating our development of products and our clients' interactions with data that kind of further extend kind of the initial dynamic that I talked about. So those, I think, would be three of kind of the things that drive our margins.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Morning.
George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I wanted to ask about organic EBITDA margin performance. You had cited elevated investments in Geomni, breakout opportunities, and commission performance as drivers of the contraction, even on a normalized basis on a year-over-year basis. So looking forward, can you talk about how you expect these investments to evolve? And your general philosophy around organic EBITDA margin performance, if you're targeting expansion over the near-to-intermediate term?
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure. So, George, let me take a crack at that. I think that there are a couple dynamics that we think about from organic margin performance. The first is starting with, at the highest scale level, are the growth of our business where we expect revenue growth to exceed expense growth. And that drives an overall expansion of that organic margin. Offsetting that in the near-term are investments that we make in new initiatives that are going to be – at the outset going to be lower margins, but we believe that those margins will ramp up quickly and be additive overall to the business. And so that has a near-term impact. And then, as you described, the impact of acquisitions that may have a lower margin initially. And some of them may have a lower margin permanently, which may be dilutive to the impact. But each of them we expect in the businesses that we look at have a high degree of operating leverage. And we have an ability to improve their operating leverage over time, improving margins for the business as a whole. But recognizing that we have businesses with exceptional margins, what we focus on in addition to overall driving margin growth for the business as a whole and in aggregate and consistent with our long-term targets of growing EBITDA faster than revenue, we also look at our returns on capital for those investments in new businesses. So, core growth in the business is the fundamental driver. We are making investments near-term that will diminish near-term margin, that's a function of the investment, but hopefully, expand our growth and improve margins over time. And then the impact of acquisitions, some of which we think have higher margin, all of them we expect to have higher margin over time, but they may – as a function of their impact in the business, may be lower margin, but represent higher growth opportunities and higher return opportunities. So, hopefully, that gives you kind of the perspective on the dynamics for that margin.
George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. That's helpful. And then turning to your Insurance business, if you look at the organic constant currency growth rate normalizing for weather from last year, it did still step-down from second quarter growth rate. Can you talk about any unusual drivers in the quarter that might have contributed to a normalized deceleration in Insurance constant currency organic growth and maybe the momentum of the business over the course of the quarter and exiting the quarter?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So maybe I'll try to take that. This is Mark. I think if you were to actually look back on 2017, I think the answer really lies there. We had probably a little bit of a slower start to the year 2017, and we had kind of a stronger growth at the second half, so I think we referenced this maybe a little tougher comps in the third and fourth quarter just because of the nice pickup we had, some of it catch-up with first half of 2017. What I'd just like to emphasize, and I think Lee did a nice job of it, is year-to-date we have had a very strong year from Insurance. We feel good about the direction of the business. We feel great about the relationship and the level of engagement we have with customers, and I do believe that the number of and breadth of new solutions we have provides an exciting year forward. So, I hope that emphasizes and answers your question.
George Tong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: I'll now turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Appreciate your interest and we look forward to seeing many, hopefully all of you, at Investor Day in just a few weeks. And between now and then, I'm sure we'll be in touch with a lot of you just for your follow-up questions. Thanks for your continuing interest. See you soon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's CFO, Mr. Lee Shavel. Mr. Shavel, please go ahead.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Kyle. And good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2018 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and myself highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.  Before we do that, I’d like to take the opportunity to introduce our new Head of Investor Relations, Stacey Brodbar. I am personally delighted as you all can imagine to have Stacey join us. Although as I reflected on it last night, you all maybe even more excited than I am to have Stacey with us. She comes to us with 20-years of broad experience from the buy-side, sell-side and investment banking. Most recently she spent 11 years at AllianceBernstein, where she served as a Senior Vice President and Senior Equity Analyst covering the consumer discretionary sector. Prior to that, she spent 7 years as a sell-side equity analyst at Credit Suisse analyzing the restaurant selector. She holds an MBA from Columbia Business School; and a Bachelor of Arts in History from Duke University. I know that she is looking forward to engaging with all of you in this new role and we will appreciate the same patience that you’ve shown to me as Stacey comes up the learning curve with the businesses at Verisk. Fortunately she comes into the job with the benefit and knowledge of having been an investor in the company previously. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. And we have also posted our Investor Presentation for the second quarter on our website at verisk.com. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks Lee. Good morning, everybody. I'm pleased overall with the second quarter results we are reporting today and with the progress occurring across our business. I recently had two weeks in Europe with some of our largest customers and our leadership teams and come away encouraged about our situation and forward opportunities. Let me summarize some of what I saw and heard. On the insurance front, we are a different company in the London and U.K. markets than we were just one year ago. Across many meetings it became clear that our customers see and understand the logic of the new solutions we have brought to market through a combination of organic developments and acquisition. On several occasions I heard customers comment on the unique position we've achieved in the U.K. along with their anticipation of newly integrated offerings from Verisk. I hear customers referring to Verisk as a partner more frequently than in the past. They are asking for deeper dives into our solution sets and pipeline of new developments. Virtually every conversation with customers was forward-looking in nature which is a good sign for our future. I also met with the senior leadership of some of Europe's largest energy businesses. I heard continuing affirmation of the must-have quality of the data and analytics we provide. Equally encouraging were discussions around the need to transform commercial decision-making in the oil and gas industry through the application of modern data analytic methods. This point is deeply felt by the energy companies who are awash in technical data but have yet to realize the promise of optimized commercial decision-making. A goal of our energy business customers is planning cycles measured in weeks rather than years which can only be achieved with the level of cost and productivity benchmarking which is previously been unseen. Our customers in Europe and indeed everywhere see us as a natural partner in helping them achieve this transformation. I spent an enjoyable afternoon in the offices of one of Argus's leading U.K. customers. It was great to spend time not only with our customers, but also our several person team who set in the customer's offices representing a wonderful level of intimacy After reviewing the considerable value attached to our current solutions, the conversation with our executive sponsor then moved to future opportunities to harness machine learning to amplify their analytics. Again, the conversation was primarily about the future and how our two companies can partner. A consistent message across customer meetings is that some of the most important work being done by our customers is harnessing data analytics to improve their business results and I see Verisk as a unique partner in doing so. With that, let me hand it over to Mark for some comments on the insurance vertical.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. In our insurance business we had another strong quarter in all insurance facing businesses. Underwriting and rating, as well as claims contributing to growth. Let me highlight a few areas that drove topline growth and update you on several initiatives that better position us for the future. To remind everyone of our new reporting segments, underwriting and rating consists of one, our ISO business unit which provides industry-standard insurance programs, property specific underwriting and rating information, and our personal lines underwriting solutions. Two, our AIR business unit which provides extreme event models; and three Sequel, our business unit which provide insurance software solutions. During the quarter underwriting and rating delivered strong organic growth across personal lines underwriting, extreme event modeling, and industry standard insurance programs through a combination of cross-sell of existing solutions to new customers and the sale of new innovative solutions. Our legacy ISO business continues to maintain high customer retention rates while increasing its prominence as a thought leader in the property-casualty industry. We have a series of new programs in product extension's fueling growth including cyber warning, our new program to address the growing cyber threat which represents a significant avenue of growth for insurers. Two, [indiscernible] insurance where we launched both personal and commercial lines coverage to satisfy the underinsured and uninsured problem in the U.S. as evidenced during Hurricane, Harvey with two-thirds of flood losses occurred outside of FEMA's 100 year flood claims. These ISO programs put all areas in the contiguous United States regardless of the FEMA flood zone. Three, LightSpeed our suite of underwriting data and analytics focused on personalized risks primarily personal auto and homeowners' risk. And for risk analyzer, our deeply analytic in highly segmented suite of tools providing fine pricing detail on specific risks. We continue to extend our risk analyzer suite and recently introduced a physical damage module for commercial auto. In June we held our Verisk London Risk Symposium, an event highlighting our InsurTech capabilities across underwriting and rating and claims with a focus on key insurance and global risk issues. The number of follow-up opportunities was impressive as U.K. insurers and Lloyd syndicates are beginning be to fully understand the scope and power of Verisk offerings. After a week together in London, our leadership team was energized by the meetings with customers developing strategy across our European businesses and prioritizing opportunities brought by these collaborative efforts. Our claims businesses include one, claims analytics our fraud prevention solutions featuring ClaimSearch. Xactware, our suite of solutions focused on loss quantification and repair cost estimating; and three, Geomni, our cutting-edge remote imagery business. Claims experienced an exceptional quarter, with organic growth across all business units through a combination of cross-sell and sale of new solutions. During the quarter, we acquired Validus, a leading provider of claims management solutions and developer of the leading subrogation portal in the U.K. Subrogation occurs when an insurer pays an insured roll-off caused by a third-party. Insurance companies then subrogate or steps into the shoes of the insurer to interact with the third party to recoup the loss suffered by the insured. With the addition of a well-established subrogation platform to its existing claim solutions set Verisk is uniquely positioned to support U.K. insurance market at every stage in the life of the claim. As I highlighted during our prior earnings call, we are focused on helping our customers automate the claims process to drive towards right touch claims handling. We are less complex and smaller dollar claims are handled with limited manual intervention. The subrogation process and coordination of benefits for bodily injury claims are areas where we can vastly improve the claims process, and create efficiencies for our customers. Geomni, our business that harnesses remote sensing and machine learning technologies to provide information about residential and commercial structures, has advanced its massive library of high-resolution imagery and data for substantially all properties in the United States. The aerial imagery and property data including measurements of dimensions for commercial and residential property are seamlessly integrated through Verisk platforms for claims, underwriting and catastrophe modeling. The image library, advanced analytics and tight integration with our repair cost estimating tools have resulted in exceptional efficiencies for insurers and strong growth added Geomni, as well as Xactware. Across all businesses from both a customer and financial perspective, we are very pleased with the performance of the insurance businesses. With that, let me turn it over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thanks Mark. First, I’d like to bring everyone's attention to the fact that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. The presentation provides background data and trends and analysis to support our conversation today. Moving to the financial results for the quarter, on a consolidated and GAAP basis revenue grew 14.9% to $601 million, net income increased 26.9% to $154 million for the quarter, diluted GAAP EPS was $0.91 for the second quarter 2018, an increase of 26.4% compared with the same period in 2017. Having presented our summary GAAP results, I will now shift to focus on our organic constant currency results for all year-over-year growth rates consistent with our financial targets and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations and recent acquisitions for which we don't have a full year-over-year comparison. Acquired revenue and adjusted EBITDA on the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic results were $36 million and $9 million respectively. Please note that nonrecurring acquisition related transaction expenses are included in these EBITDA amounts. Verisk demonstrated very solid growth performance and momentum in the second quarter. Revenue growth of 7.4% was ahead of our 7% long-term target and it was our fourth consecutive quarter at or above that target. Adjusted EBITDA expense grew 5.9% enabling EBITDA growth up 8.9% and demonstrating the benefit of our operating leverage. The EBITDA growth differential to revenue growth of 1.5% is also ahead of our long-term target of a minimum 1% differential. These results also produced an improved adjusted EBITDA margin of 49.6% up from 48.9% in the prior year reflecting the benefits of our skill and inclusive of continued investment across the business. Let's now turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. As you will see in table 2 in the press release, insurance had a strong quarter with 8.4% revenue growth with underwriting and rating contributing 6.2% and claims contributing 13.2% growth. Adjusted EBITDA for insurance grew 10.5% reflecting in increased adjusted EBITDA margin of 56.6% up from 55.5% in the prior year. Within our underwriting and rating business, we saw solid performance across our product lines. We also continued to invest in our breakout opportunities including telematics, LightSpeed data hosting, energy and global property with exceptional growth despite the relatively small-scale at this point. Within claims the continued strong growth was a function of strong product growth in most of our claims businesses, offset by a slight decline in our employment screening business. In addition, Geomni continues to generate strong growth as they expand and improve data quality for clients. Energy and specialized markets delivered improved revenue growth of 5.0% for the quarter up from 3.1% in the prior quarter as the energy industry continues to recover as many of you may have noticed with the recent reported results from the energy companies. Adjusted EBITDA increased 0.9%, also an improvement from a 5.9% decline in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.1% was down slightly from the prior year period 31.3% due to ongoing investments in the WoodMac 2.0 initiative and our chemicals subsurface, power and renewables and analytics breakout initiatives that increased headcount and associated compensation expense. These areas represent opportunities to leverage Wood Mackenzie's data and industry expertise more broadly and to deliver and develop products more swiftly and efficiently. Overall growth was supported by research growth at Wood Mackenzie and strong growth in consulting with our 3E revenues. This improvement was achieved despite the ongoing 2018 revenue headwind from a global investment banking client that has substantially reduced their presence in the industry. The energy and specialized markets segment continues to enjoy core operating leverage and growth opportunities as demand for data analytics in its constituent markets continues to expand and has been demonstrated in the growth of our breakout revenues in the early new contract wins at PowerAdvocate. Financial services also delivered improved revenue growth of 4.4% in the quarter up from 1.5% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 4.5% down from 5.1% in the prior quarter and the adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.1% unchanged from the prior year. These results are below our long-term expectations of the business but we believe the growth potential of the segment remains strong. The organic revenue growth was supported by growth in portfolio management solutions which include our foundational benchmarking analytics and strong growth in enterprise data management solutions where we are leveraging our data management skills and expertise to support our clients. Looking ahead to next quarter's financial services revenue results, we want to take the opportunity to remind everyone that consistent with our typical partnership revenue model, we expect to have a high level of nonrecurring license and implementation revenue in the early stage of our partnerships followed by the development of recurring subscription revenues over time. In this regard, the third quarter of 2018 will represent the one-year anniversary of the formation of our thesis partnership which generated significant initial revenues in the third quarter of 2017 of 6 million with lesser amounts in the subsequent two quarters. Consequently, our growth rates next quarter will reflect the burden of those nonrecurring revenues in the prior year. As we've discussed previously, the launch of our products through the partnerships had been delayed due to data integration challenges but we expect to commence marketing with clients this quarter with the development of the ongoing subscription revenue opportunity to follow. Consolidated depreciation and amortization was $74 million in the quarter up 32.1% from the prior year quarter reflecting the impact of acquisitions and increased capital expenditures in both periods. Reported interest income was $32 million in the quarter up 12.1% from the prior year quarter due to the funding of acquisitions in 2017. Total reported debt was $2.8 billion at June 30, 2018 down from $3.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the second quarter was 2.4 times on the basis of our credit facility calculation. Our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were about $135.8 million at June 30, 2018. Our reported effective tax rate was 17% for the quarter compared to 28.8% in the prior year quarter as a result of recent tax reform. Our effective tax rate was lower than our targeted range due to significant exercises of outstanding employee stock options that produced a favorable tax rate impact. We are maintaining our estimate of our effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 16% and 18%. However the timing and impact of employee stock option exercises depends in part on the Verisk stock price and personal decisions. We expect that this impact will be more pronounced in 2018 and that we will revert to a higher effective tax rate in 2019. Adjusted net income was $179 million up 29.1% from $139 million in the prior-year quarter. Diluted adjusted EPS was $1.06 for the second quarter also up 29.3% from $0.82 in the prior year quarter. The increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and the impact of 2017 tax reform. Equalizing the second-quarter of 2017 effective tax rate to that of second-quarter of 2018 both adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS were up 11.6%. Net cash provided by operating activities was $207 million for the quarter up 85% from the prior year, capital expenditures were $56 million for the quarter up 36% from the prior year reflecting primarily increased investment in Geomni and software development for recent acquisitions. As we've discussed previously, 2018 will be the peak year of capital expenditure for Geomni. Free cash flow was $151 million for the quarter, an increase of 114.3% from the prior year. We returned $141 million in capital to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.3 million shares in the quarter at a weighted average price of $105.78. At June 30, 2018 we had $686 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization including a $500 million authorization approved in May 2018. In addition, we initiated a 50 million accelerated share repurchase to be executed in the third quarter to accelerate the impact of share repurchases and execute repurchases at a discount of WACC over the period. We have the ability to repurchase additional shares during the quarter so the 50 million ASR should not be viewed as our total repurchases for the quarter. The average diluted share count was 169 million shares in the quarter and on June 30, 2018 our diluted share count was 168 million shares. Overall the results for the quarter represented one organic constant currency revenue growth of 7.4% and EBITDA growth of 8.9%, both ahead of our targets. Two, improved organic constant currency margins. Three, continued investment in attractive internal opportunities, and four substantial return of capital to shareholders. Insurance performance remains consistently strong in both underwriting and rating and claims. Our energy and financial services continue to make progress towards their growth objectives. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we want everyone to be mindful of the $8 million in storm-related revenue and $6 million in initial nonrecurring revenue from the thesis partnership in the third quarter of 2017 that will affect the third quarter 2018 year-over-year reported growth rates but don't represent a change in our underlying long-term growth expectations. We also don't know what the 2018 storm season will hold for us. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us. We ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. With that, I’ll ask the Operator Kyle to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari. Your line is open.
Hamzah Mazari: You touched on what some of your European clients are saying on the insurance offering. Maybe if you could touch on, do you still think you can double the insurance business internationally in five years I think you had highlighted that. And maybe some of the challenges and sort of headwinds to that goal. Just maybe update us how much bigger can that international business be and why you feel confident?
Scott Stephenson: When we think about the international opportunity as it relates to the insurance vertical, first of all it's not just about the London and U.K. markets. We’re actually pushing out in a number of European and Asian markets. I was highlighting London and U.K. partly because that's where I just was with the customers, but also partly because that is the largest part of our non-North American footprint today. I don't really see a lot of headwinds, I can tell you what the work consists of. The work consists of taking the methods that we’ve developed in the United States tailoring - tuning them - not tailoring them, tuning them to the local markets. And then infusing them with a lot of good local data, we know how to do that that is in fact what we’re presenting in these overseas markets today. So it's organic, it feels very natural and what we need and what we have our great people on the ground in these markets that understand the local customers and local conditions and can just cause our solutions to be there most relevant and make clear the customers the value that they represent. But it's not - it’s mostly white space for us, I mean Verisk as you know it's about order of magnitude 25% non-U.S. today and it's a big world out there. So this is a long sustained march for us but I don't think of it in terms of headwinds. I think of it in terms of great people on the ground locally taking what we’re already good at and making it relevant.
Hamzah Mazari: And just a follow-up I'll turn it over maybe for Lee. Lee I know you spend a lot of time on capital allocation and in terms of your analyst days investor outreach maybe just frame for us how you're thinking about that going forward, have you guys thought about a dividend. Are they going to be more acquisitions, are you going to add a third leg to the portfolio just broadly speaking I know the history has been a little different where you had a healthcare business than we bought energy now you're sort of focusing in on the core. Maybe just give us some feedback after your outreach program and how you're thinking about broadly capital allocation going forward?
Lee Shavel: So the way - what I would emphasize is at this stage what we’re focusing on is starting with understanding capital generation where we’re generating it, how we’re generating it obviously optimizing that. And then looking at the returns on capital within each of the businesses and most importantly on an incremental basis how we’re investing the capital that we have effectively to improve those returns and to support the growth initiatives across the business. And that's where it's a combination of looking not just at acquisitions, but looking at our internal investment through CapEx, through investments in our breakout initiatives. And really just enhancing that as a discipline across the organization as a whole with the objective of trying to identify as many attractive opportunities to invest capital. And I really think at the core that's what's most exciting about Verisk. The opportunities that we have across the business and to put capital into growth businesses in the analytics and the data management sector. Once we are doing that effectively I think the next step is thinking about how we manage capital and at this stage we think about all of our opportunities to return capital. We as you saw in the second quarter, we’re very focused on repurchasing shares, and so you see a focus there that is determined on a quarterly basis based upon where we see opportunities, but longer term we are certainly going to evaluate all opportunities. But we’re really at the preliminary stage of just thinking about how are we generating capital and how are we deploying it within the business. The final thing that I will say I think that you have heard Scott and Mark in several cases talk about what we see on as the opportunities and the strength of our three verticals, insurance, energy and specialized markets and financial services. While we are always evaluating M&A opportunities that can create growth, we are very comfortable with the opportunities that exist within those three verticals. There is not an expectation at this point that there's any additional vertical that we’re pursuing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm: Just I think Lee you ended your prepared remarks on kind of like reminding us of the second half outlook and the strong storms. I guess stepping back a little bit I think you highlighted that that's for quarter’s growth with over 7%, but really if you back out the claims which has been really strong I think was more like 5ish or so. So more holistically I mean claims growth is great but I think there is a question about sustainability, how do you feel this can continue to grow in the kind of like teens and how could that weigh on your growth rate going forward. I'm not just thinking the next couple quarters but more, holistically longer term?
Mark Anquillare: This is Mark I’ll maybe try to address it. Clearly the claims area benefits from the severe storm activities occurred back in last year third or fourth quarter. I think what we’ve seen is as a result of some of that storm activity. We’ve had a little bit of a continuation of services to be continued and provided to some contractors. And we’ve also seen insurers the most part by more. So I don't attribute first quarter, second quarter results to storm activity. I see the underlying business is continuing to be strong. I see the investment that we’ve made over the last several years in new products and new services and the extension into - all the parts of the insurance value chain to be working. And I just wanted to highlight that I think we have a lot of good things going in claims and personally I wouldn’t back it out in the way you just did. So I hope that provides at least a little context and maybe a little comfort on kind of the underlying solvency and strength of the business.
Alex Kramm: And then Lee just, secondly maybe on the cost side and I know to talk a lot about the margin and obviously organic versus non-organic, but stepping back I think you've been there for - I think almost nine months or so. Are you spending a lot of time on the how the cost base of Verisk looks holistically, I mean and I guess I'm asking because at your prior shop - the company was very well known for being very good on margin, very tight, very cost conscious. Have you looked at how may be processes at Verisk on if they are improvements just generally speaking not just from integration of acquisitions?
Lee Shavel: Yes, thank you, Alex. And so first off I feel obligated to say that I think Verisk starts with a very good discipline around cost management and you wouldn't see, I think the margins of this strength without that discipline throughout the organization. And so that isn’t to say that there aren’t always opportunities to improve and as I learned from my prior shop, cost management is a beast that you have to fight every day. And in that regard, I have been spending time focusing on the cost structure one area in particular that has gotten a lot of focus and that we've been proceeding against has been against the broader migration mainframe to cloud migration which I think represents opportunities for us from a cost and from a capital standpoint. And so that's one dimension of it, but interesting you raised it on the call we actually have also been evaluating a shift in our procurement strategy in which heretofore has been a very process oriented procurement strategy. And we are going to be shifting with some changes in leadership to a focus on the cost structure elements. And where we can attack data costs other technology costs and find other efficiencies across the business in order to improve the overall cost structure. So it is something that has received focus there a number of initiatives that are underway, I'm focusing on that on that opportunity and we hope with a reorientation of our procurement and strategic sourcing function to make further headway against that.
Alex Kramm: Very good thank you, I’m sorry…
Scott Stephenson: It’s Scott here, I'll just add that - kind of sort of the deep deepdrum beat where the cost side of our business is concerned, really hinges on a couple things. One is, as Lee was saying the nature of the computing infrastructure inside of our company is going to change. And we think productively. It only cost you about $40,000 to source a rock headed by our storage capacity in the cloud today. Only $40,000, tell me this is remarkable. And so as we move from on prem to not on prem, I think we are going to naturally see productivity there. Another opportunity for us that it is at work now and I think we will make somewhat more use of it in the future will be to diversify where our talent comes from. There are talented people all around the globe and at the moment at least there are asymmetries in terms of what highly confident professional gets paid, we made less use of that than we might have. And then two other things real quick, one is just sort of the strong and consistent drive towards effective operations, which we summarize thinking about Lean Six Sigma kinds of methodologies, which is really a quiet revolution that's going on inside of our company. And the last thing is, the ability to change the very nature of knowledge work by harnessing machine learning. Today, most of that has been applied to making our solutions for our customers better, but the longer tails to the machine learning AI revolution is to actually change the way cognitive works gets done, and we have a lot of knowledge workers around here and I believe that we can really make them more productive by harnessing the machine more. So bunch of things that underlie - these are all productive and they are not just quarter-to-quarter this is year-to-year. Some of them are probably decade-to-decade kinds of developments.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik: My first question is on Argus. So, the $6 million one-time benefit in last year's third quarter, I guess is new disclosure for us so maybe me at least. And so it implies that the third quarter probably is not going to have a good number and so what I'm trying to understand is seven quarters of - we are under performing what we used to see from Argus, maybe I don't quite understand what's really going on there, like, what the issues are and I guess, even the margins took ahead of this quarter. So I just hoping you could may be just flush out again like what's going wrong there.
Scott Stephenson: Well, first of all, I don't at all think that things are going wrong at Argus. It’s a great business, which is founded on proprietary content just like most of what we do at Verisk. So it's actually a great business and if you were to ask me which of our three verticals over the next five years is going to turn in the highest rate of growth, I think there is a very good case to be made that it could be Verisk financial services. I actually find it hard to handicap the three of them. I think they are all going to do well. So, it's a great business of which we and I are very proud and provides wonderful levels of value to our customers so all of that. Thinking about the last couple of years, as we have discussed in the past 2017, there were a couple of major relationships that cycled out. One part of that was the Federal Government consolidated its use of what it is that we provide and the other was a very large plan in the financial services were it had essentially been bulked buying some of what we do on behalf lot of the banks and they stepped out of their relationship and so underneath that we have been filling in with relationships with the banks individually, but that was a one-time effect over and done. In 2018, you have to look across the difference segments of the business and one of things that is at work right now is and we did call this out last quarter also is the on the median effectiveness side, I'm going to summarize a lot here in just a few words, but basically the regulatory burden on banks includes really, really requiring a tremendous amount of disclosure around methodologies, which allow the discrimination of risk on an individual customer basis. The size of the report you have to write to justify methods that you're using is really kind of astonishing. The banks want to do this differentiating and they find our method as valuable as it ever was, but consuming our methods in the form that we have traditionally provided them has just become backbreaking from a regulatory point of view. So, we're in the middle of rotating right now, the way we present that underlying intellectual property to our customers. And so it's a moment where that shift is occurring. And then lastly, as Lee pointed out again, in 2018, not only did he note the grow over point with respect to the implementation that we've talked about, the couple of quarter delay in terms of actually getting it productive. Normally -- well, I mean -- and this a truth of the business. When we establish a new relationship, there's a big surge of activity for data integration purposes, and then there's very nice annuity stream kicks in thereafter. The annuity stream is kicking in a couple quarters later than we expected because of the integration issues. So, that's what's going on inside the business. But our outlook on this business is over intermediate and longer periods of time, is completely unchanged.
Lee Shavel: And Manav, just to add, I think -- as Scott was describing, certainly it's an understandable question. And we understand the frustration from a growth standpoint. I do think it is important kind of starting at that level to step back and look at what the elements are that are driving it. It has been a chunky and a noisy business. We have been in the process of focusing on how from a revenue structuring standpoint we can make this more sustainable growth business. I think part of the story is that early on several years ago, there were a number of large opportunities that naturally we were compelled to pursue. And that's created some of the large component noise. Where we are now, is looking at each of these businesses across the portfolio management solutions, enterprise data management solutions, and the spend in marketing solutions, and focusing on how we deliver sustainable growth across those. And when you eliminate the one time elements, and in this case, we certainly don't feel, we want to apologize about the upfront revenues. But I think it's important to understand that those are licensing and implementation revenues with the value of the subscriptions accruing over time that that's the underlying dynamic that I think we see as both underlying growth and ongoing potential, given the extraordinary dataset and the relationships that we have with our clients, and the opportunity to use that data to just broaden their applications. I know all of that is looking ahead, but we believe that that opportunity remains undiminished despite the noise that we've experienced here over the past couple of years.
Manav Patnaik: My second question, Scott, maybe just to step back on the investments you're making in the WoodMac 2.0 platform. I recall, like, the year after you made the acquisition, at one of the investor days you talked about how there's already been investments made in a lot of new products, platforms rolled out. So, my question was more like, is this 2.0 initiative sort of driven by customer feedback or is this some sort of new gen you feel like it will help down in the future. Just wanted to get some more perspective there?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, it's both. And let me give you one other contextual point also, which is, the -- of the three verticals we serve. And I'm talking about customers now, I'm not talking about us. Of the three verticals we serve, the energy vertical is the one that is least transformed yet by large scale data analytics for commercial decision making. The companies are awash in technical data. So it's not that they don't know big data, but they haven't harnessed it the way that insurance companies and banks have, to drive their commercial decision making. And we knew that at the time that we -- in fact that's one of the reasons why we were so excited to get into business with WoodMac. And then of course the double tsunami hit in terms of the commodity price and to brag that with hard on a U.K. based Pound denominated sort of a company. So in the middle of these storms, we basically turn the sales and pull the boat into port. Now, the sky is clear, we're back out on the seas for sale. So, I just want -- if folks haven't followed our story over longer periods of time, I just wanted to make that point. Because there's a degree to which WoodMac 2.0 was what we intended from the beginning. And it's -- we just know that it's productive to have a very nicely digitally based platform for all of your data, because you can build the next generation and then the next generation after that of products if your platform done that way. And I think that the WoodMac that came in the Verisk in 2015, reflected their customers basically. In other words, sort of the volume and the speed of the data sets on the commercial side, were just not, it just was not the way that environment had been behaving. It's not that WoodMac was behind. I think they were reflective of the environment they were in. But then the other part of it is, yes, it is responsive to customers because their worlds have changed. Essentially what's going on in the oil and gas energy space is that, you used to have these years under unto decades planning cycles, where you would have these bespoke offshore multi $100s of millions of developments and essentially every project kind of was on to its own. And so you planned in that context. What's happened is that half of all the incremental supply has been added in North America. And in North America, the business behaves very differently. You can be drilling a well in location "X" and you could say, I want to move that, 1500 yards over there, and three days later you can have a 1500 foot well. And so planning cycles have reduced to weeks, and days, and that's actually exciting. The other thing that has happened is, it's not so bespoke, there are lot of people in the Permian, there are lot of people in the back and your position is next-door to somebody else's position. And so the intensity of desire to sort of benchmark and use that to tune up operations and planning is much greater than it was. So, in other words, to be effective you have to be bigger data, faster. And that's the conversion that's going on right now. So you can also pick up with WoodMac 2.0 as being not only the tuning up of our own environment, but it's actually creating this capability to serve the customers on these faster cycles with a greater amount of benchmarking against like activities. I mean that's fundamentally what's going on, and that is customer driven.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh. Your line is open.
Tim McHugh: Could I just follow up on the insurance growth rate, was there any contribution done in this quarter that you would attribute to the storm activity? And can you help us understand at all the contribution from aerial imagery at this point to the gross rate? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Question one was really around severe storm and impact in this quarter. There was no explicit benefit. I mean, I think what we've seen is contractors who purchased the solutions back during the storm seasons, some have extended that license, that has been good. It seems like that will continue. But there is nothing with around storms. Let me now jump over to Geomni. Similarly, storm activity helped us during third quarter with the storms last year. I think what you're seeing now inside Geomni, is a very strong bit of growth driven by really customer adoption, where we're taking share. We had a very tightly integrated solution that for the most part brings in the imagery, turns it to data, and with that data we're populating the repair cost estimates. At the very heart of what we're trying to do is, we're trying to increase dramatically the productivity of those claims adjustors at our customers. And by doing it in an automated way, whether that's from afar or having most of the information prepared into bands of visiting location, it creates tremendous opportunity and efficiency in that process. We are more accurate, and I think we have really started to change the way those insurance companies are kind of automating their processes. And the Geomni organically is helping the overall growth rate of insurance, that is very true.
Tim McHugh: Can you help us effect that the growth of the research business versus the consulting side of Wood Mackenzie? And my impression with consulting was leading the growth rate versus the research side?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, Tim, that's absolutely true. The consulting side is the portion that responds the most immediately to the increasing investment levels on the energy side. And so I would describe the growth areas as strong growth. On the subscription side, that growth, there has been growth there. I would say it's more modest growth but clearly the consulting side, which represents about 20% of the revenues has been benefiting earlier from that upside. But we are seeing a steady improvement in our overall research subscription levels as the cycle continues to improve for the energy sector.
Operator: Your next comes from the line of Arash Soleimani. Your line is open.
Arash Soleimani: Quick question on Geomni, the $200 million total adjustable market there within insurance, is that on the claims side only or does that include both claims and underwriting?
A – Lee Shavel: So, as it relates to insurance, we have -- we've talked about both the claims business and the underwriting business. We were very specific in these cases when we provided that estimate. That is in the context of, what we refer to as, property characteristics on the underwriting side, helping to better understand the physical attributes of the buildings and the residential homes, and on the claims side as we described. So, it is a combination of the two with a kind of known use case for insurance.
Arash Soleimani: Thanks, and aside from Geomni, can you talk about increasing automation within the insurance industry and to what extent that presents an opportunity for Verisk?
A – Scott Stephenson: Sure, let me do that. I think we are…
A – Lee Shavel: That's going to take about an hour and half.
A – Scott Stephenson: I will be quick. I think everyone in the insurance industry both on the claims side as well as the underwriting side, understand two things. One, they need to automate to get a lot of out -- to rid themselves of operational friction. The way they're doing that is to make an investment in technology and they're changing the way they go about processing. What that also helps to address, to say, graying of the talent population inside the insurance industry, where there are most experienced claims handlers, need to be on the more difficult claims or the very difficult underwriting risk. That's where the experience needs to be. So, they're trying to create expert systems to handle about 80%, this is a little bit -- our estimate 80% of claims in a no touch low-touch way. So that everything else flows on the underwriting side, 80% of those claims even on commercial, like personal, to be handled at point-of-sale with all the information so you can properly understand, assess, and price the risk. And that transition whether its back office, policy men, claim systems, or in the world of data analytics, everyone is pushing in that direction with one overarching theme, digital engagement. They're trying to make sure they don't lose customers and they can stay close. So, hopefully I was efficient and quick. But InsurTech, and all that that we're doing really is kind of making people expand and change the way they're doing business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is [Jude] on for Andrew. I just wanted to circle back on Argus. You guys gave some helpful color on some of the holdbacks to growth last year, and what's been going on this year. I wanted to ask about, outside of TSYS, you had mentioned eight large multiyear contracts at Investor Day, you had mentioned bookings that were as $30 million higher, at Jan 1, 2018 versus the year prior. So, I was wondering how the rest of those contracts were going if you are seeing any sort of implementation delays with those or is that something that we could see coming on the horizon? Thank you.
A – Lee Shavel: Jude, thanks for the question. The last time we [indiscernible] our sense is that slightly over half of that contract had been worked into our revenue, with the balance expected over the remainder of the year. So I'll give an update on that, but that was kind of where we were previously. I suspect we've made some progress and so more of that has come in. But probably the majority has been realized, kind of year-to-date, and there will probably be some carryover in the second half, but probably not a material impact on revenue growth.
Unidentified Analyst: One quick follow up on Argus. Scott, had mentioned the heavy filing burden that is weighing on some of your bank customers. Maybe I missed this point, but is any of this specifically related to GDPR, and similar types of regulations? One of your peers mentioned those regulations, those events as weighing, as being a headwind to some of their growth, that's similar to your marketing effectiveness. So, I was wondering if that's at play here?
A – Lee Shavel: No. This is specific to banking regulation in the United States, particularly. So, no. It's not.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington. Your line is open.
Q – Bill Warmington: First question on WoodMac, the last quarter you guys had talked about a couple of gem cancellations. How the renewals been trending in general this quarter? And specifically how the trends been on a like-for-like pricing basis?
A – Scott Stephenson: Bill, I got to correct your facts there. So, last quarter we didn't talk about gem cancellation. We talked about two things going on in the business, when customers consolidate, that can have an effect on the combined entity revenues for us. And we did note that there was one of those. And then the other, and Lee talked about in his remarks, was, one investment bank is just sort of rethought their position with respect to the energy vertical, and it's not that gem has gone away, it's just that they scale back their relationship with us. So, I just want to make sure I fact base is established.
A – Scott Stephenson: Carl, do you want to move to the -- I think we may have lost Bill. Can we move to the next question?
Operator: All right, I'll move to the line of Jeff Meuler. Your line is open.
Q – Jeff Meuler: I guess I had a different take on insurance on that prior question. But it seems to me that the underlying insurance growth next to hurricane benefits is faster than it was a couple of years ago. How much of this is moving beyond the headwinds from the end market consolidation versus what other factors are at play? Like, is there generally an improved selling environment in the vertical? It sounds broad based in terms of product, but are there any specific big product needle movers or any cohorts from that perspective? Thank you.
A – Lee Shavel: So, thanks Jeff. Maybe I can start, Mark, please jump in. But -- first of all, I really appreciate the way you asked the question. Because there is no doubt that extreme events is -- the fact that there are extreme events is a productive factor as it relates to the rate of growth of our business, but it is a very long term sort of an effect, underlying our results over very long periods of time. You can probably add a few 10s of basis points that are there, because there are extreme events. Sometimes they peak, sometimes it's much more modest, though but if you look over long cycles. There is something there but it doesn't really explain what's going on in our business. So, thank you for the way you characterized the question, first of all. The only thing I would really call out as a point specific thing, actually is the movement in to remote inventory. That's news. And that's been productive for us. Otherwise I do think of it as broadly based and really it is, it's fundamentally about how innovative can we be. Our customers are trying to revolutionize their businesses with data analytics. And so it's really on us to be relevant and fast. And that's what determines the rate at which we grow our insurance capabilities, footprint, customer list, are all stronger than they were a couple of years ago. So, to your point fundamentally, and I think it's very broadly based. Remote imagery would be the one call out, Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.
A – Mark Anquillare: I think you highlighted the good products. I think we highlighted a few in here, but internationally I think it's just some kind of headline, some of the growth and I think the way you opened was strong. I mean I think we've always had great positions but with some industry consolidations that does run a bit to our negative and just kind of move beyond that point-of-sale. Good product development, good growth internationally, limited headwinds, helping us along the way.
Q – Jeff Meuler: And then Lee, just to follow up on your answer to Judah's question. That wasn't clear. Were you saying the percentage of revenue that's worked its way -- the percentage of bookings that have worked its way in the revenue from the thesis contractor or we’re you saying the other large multiyear contracts and basically signals are all coming in according to plan and this is all just the thesis delay and media effectiveness into banks? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: With regard to the broader group of contracts that I think was referred to at Investor Day at the time. And so my last sense is that and that kind of separate from the thesis relationship and those opportunities and so far what we have worked into or have realized of that pool. And I don't have a current update because we don't track those as a group individually but our sense was that those were coming in according to plan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan. Your line is open.
Toni Kaplan: You’ve highlighted across the years just the importance of cross-selling as a key growth driver. And in the past I think in insurance you’ve sometimes mentioned the average number of products that your customers have bought. And how that's been trending, but basically I was wondering if there are some metrics may be that you could give us that would be helpful for us to understand just your progress with regard to cross-selling. Any sort of color will be helpful?
Mark Anquillare: So Toni I appreciate you remembering the slide which I’ve used it every year. We actually started to prepare for this day and this Investor Day I think we’ve had similar positive results. I think what we've done as you recall we kind of grouped the number of products we have into about 25 to 30 categories. And our sales team have this - kind of this checkerboard approach where we’re looking to do project - account planning across all the different products. And we have a little bit of - we call the competitive chalkboard we’re trying to win business every day and we have realigned our sales force in such a way that we have a team that’s focused outside of North America that’s progressing. We have teams that are organized like our customer’s personal lines and commercial lines and being able to sell a suite of solutions to the personal lines or commercial lines has been winning. And I think it gives them a broader perspective on what customer needs, a broader understanding of products themselves and those are the type of things that we focus on. We focus on customer retention, we focus on revenue from our new products or billings from our new products and a combination of pipeline and closed sales. And we look at it basically monthly with a deep dive every quarter. So that process those metrics continue to be positive.
Toni Kaplan: And Lee I wanted to ask my follow-up on capital allocation again. And so you have 2.5 times gross leverage target, I'd say that's currently in line with the average of peers. Your business is very highly recurring, so one could argue that you could sustain a higher level but on the other hand may be in certain environments, you don’t want to be higher or lower. So what are your thoughts around two times and is that a dynamic target is that the right target just wanted to hear your thoughts on it? Thanks.
Lee Shavel: And Toni very briefly, I think we are managing leverage generally within the 2.5 to three times range. I think that’s what we believe is consistent with our run rate expectations for our ratings category. So I would think about it as kind of being within that, it may be towards the lower end or towards the higher end but that kind of is our target range?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong. Your line is open.
Allison Chou: This is Allison Chou on for George thanks for taking my question. Can you comment on the progression of integrating the various acquisitions you've made and more specifically how we can expect the process of integrating those deals to narrow the gap between organic and reported margins?
Mark Anquillare: Well you’re actually asking two questions there so Lee may be would take on the second one in a momentum which is just the interplay between inorganic than becoming organic. I'm really happy with the integration of the companies that we brought in 2017 which fall into three primary categories. One as we stitched together a set of regional imaging companies into one national capability, very happy with the progress that we've made there. Secondly, we acquired Sequel over in the London market that has been a textbook integration, and we already presenting the customers the integrated product opportunities that come from that. And then lastly as PowerAdvocate, as we've noted for folks PowerAdvocate has already made sales based upon relatedness to other things we do on the energy side. And I would actually say that one flows in both directions because PowerAdvocate is I'll use a funny word very invasive where our customers are concerned and it gets right into their systems and draws data out of our customer systems. And is so good at managing large amounts of data that it actually facilitate other opportunities to help energy companies digitally transform. So it's just all green lights with respect to integration. Lee, just inorganic to organic crossover I don’t if you want to comment on that.
Lee Shavel: So I’m going to touch on that. There is really three components we wanted to provide the organic so that the analysts and investors could see that a like-for-like comparison without the influence of an acquisition before you have hit in both periods. But I think as you think about that delta, I think there are three components. One is going to be, we do have upfront costs associated with the deal that are nonrecurring. And so that will impact on those near-term reported margins with the expectation relative to dealers those pass on that will improve the margin. Secondly, as we integrate the margin of the business into our overall, that may have a positive or negative impact on the blended margins generally at the scale of the acquisitions that’s not going to have a material impact. But the most important component is what - with each of our acquisitions we hope to do by improving the operating leverage of the business, extending the distribution and improving the productivity. And so that's something that we expect - well the historical margins are going to trend towards that reported margin. What’s not captured is over time our expectation with each of these acquisitions that we will see margin improvement through their natural operating leverage as they grow plus the additional benefits that we can bring either on the cost or on the revenue side. So that's the way I think about the trend of that about organic relative to the reported margin in a given period.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you very much. In the interest of time so I think there were two questions there we’re going to move to the next question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi. Your line is open.
Mike Reid: This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Was just thinking about the energy business and kind of mid single-digit growth we’re seeing now. Just a good way to look at it going forward or could this potentially improve if CapEx turning improves with better oil prices and without the headwind from the large investment banking client when that rolls off?
Mark Anquillare: Yes, I mean two things one is as I said earlier we've got three verticals and it's hard to handicap which will be the fastest growing in the coming five years. I think energy has a lot of promise, we talked about the fundamental factors that work there. And those of you who have followed us for a while know that a lot of what we do in energy is based on multiyear agreements. And so we've been cycling through those agreements as we pulled out of the commodity down cycle. And essentially we just think that with time, these effects - the constructive effects will continue to be seen in what we do. So we have a very positive outlook.
Mike Reid: And then I think you noticed previously this year price increases may be minimized, but would you still be looking to take advantage of pricing opportunities next year?
Mark Anquillare: Are you on the energy vertical.
Mike Reid: No, no I was talking insurance.
Mark Anquillare: Price is always a factor inside of what we do. Our products don't come back year-over-year the same and the customers know that. So there is naturally price progression in almost everything we do. Mark I think most of the multiyear agreements we write in insurance has year-over-year price escalation associated with them. So that's a persistent effect in our business. I don't see it as becoming more or less meaningful than it has been in the past.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line off Andrew Jeffrey. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey: Quickly I wondered if you could articulate a little bit your Internet-of-Things strategy how you see that playing out, how it functionally affects your solutions and so forth?
Scott Stephenson: Sure. So I think you probably seen the announcements we are trying to aggregate a lot of information not just from telematics and from cars, but even things around buildings and homes. Two primary focus, let me start with the side of claims we feel that we can very much effectively and more efficiently handle the first notice of loss process as it kind of starts inside the car. We've put up relationships between what we have in the OEMs and the car manufacturers in combination insurers so that we can speed and claim process both the notification and the payment thereof. So that is a good news item helps policyholders, it helps claims department and saves money. And on the underwriting side, it’s about pricing. The information is available from connected cars from mobile devices can tell you about how fast and how good and the behavior of the driver and that information is effective in pricing your insurance policy. So we are taking steps to bring that information into both kind of personal and commercial lines pricing. So that our insurance customers can be better and more active in assessing that risk and pricing it.
Scott Stephenson: And I think we have one final question here Carl.
Operator: The final question will be coming from the line of David Ridley-Lane. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: Within the energy segment, I'm hoping to understand how far the cyclical rebound and core research of WoodMac revenue has proceeded. And where are we relative to prior peak revenue or client counts in that core WoodMac area? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: So client retention is very high. So and in fact we have more customers than we used to have. And as I noted before, the sort of the progression related to research it’s really a function of multiyear agreements rolling off, new multiyear agreements being signed. That has been - since you could really call the turn of the commodity which is within the last year, we've seen that effective work. It will continue to be at work as we go forward. Basically the condition of the commodity is no longer an issue. We consider this a normalized environment that we’re in now. So it’s constructive and productive for the work we’re selling today and the work we hope to able to sell in the future.
Scott Stephenson: All right everybody, thank you. We appreciate your interest and I'm sure we’ll be talking to a lot of you in immediate follow-ups and no later than next quarters. So thanks very much. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics First Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Lee Shavel. Mr. Shavel, please go ahead.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Chris. And good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter of 2018 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and myself, highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open the call for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. We also filed an 8-K on April 26, 2018, with a description of our business segment recasting. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, Lee. Good morning, everybody. The first quarter was another example of our team achieving a high level of organic revenue growth, which remains the most important measure of our vitality as an organization. This growth was a product of our traditional multilevel growth plan including, first, the development of new customers for existing solutions, such as was seen in our claims analytics platform; secondly, the cross-selling of our existing solutions to existing customers as seen in our imagery solutions and upstream oil and gas analytics; and thirdly, new products including insurance data hosting. Over the last 90 days, I was particularly impressed by the quality of our engagement with many large leading customers resulting in real-time business wins and opportunities into the future. We continue to enjoy visits from the most senior leaders at some of our biggest customers who are looking to get closer to our pipeline of innovations. We held the largest gathering in our history for customers of our catastrophe analytics solutions and we're impressed again with the level of engagement and input from our clients. Our results in the Energy vertical in terms of renewals exceeded our expectations. I'm pleased to have welcomed Lisa Hannan into leadership of our Verisk Financial Services vertical. Lisa has been making a difference at Argus for over eight years, having led many of the different departments over time. Her background in the cards industry having held senior positions at Chase and Citi gives her deep domain knowledge and high standing among our customers. I'm really excited about teaming with Lisa to take Verisk Financial to new heights. The integration of our 2017 acquisitions continues apace. I was with the Sequel team a few weeks ago including executives from both London headquarters as well as the development team in Málaga, Spain. Sequel is well seeded into Verisk and already demonstrating new software capabilities, form through integration with other parts of Verisk Insurance. PowerAdvocate is also well grounded in Verisk and there is a growing pipeline of cross-sell opportunities being actively pursued with WoodMac. Mark will comment at length about the Insurance vertical, so I want to take a moment now on the Energy and Financial Services verticals. In Energy, a generally positive set of near-term subscription renewals was dragged on by developments at one large customer, an investment bank, that has fundamentally rethought their participation in the Energy vertical. This development is entirely about their business, not ours. In general, we are in investment mode as has seen on the cost line in our reported segment results. The Energy space for all of its scale has not yet been transformed by the kind of data aggregation and modern analytic methods that characterize the other markets we serve, and the need has mounted since much of the recent news in the space has been around unconventional plays which have much shorter planning and execution cycles. This is a unique moment in which Verisk is aspiring to an even greater leadership position in the space through our WoodMac 2.0 project, which is about transforming our data assets by more thoroughly integrating our existing data along with access to data sets we don't use today. By the end of 2019, WoodMac will be fundamentally more capable at a dramatically higher level, in part by leveraging methods and resources from Verisk including our cloud-first tools. This major step forward in our capabilities will strengthen an already improving picture, as the end market continues to firm up and large customer relationships are yielding good results on renewal. We continue to expect that the Energy vertical will contribute meaningfully to achieving our corporate growth targets. In Financial Services, we continue to view three parts of the mix as carrying a lot of our future growth, those being media effectiveness, data hosting, and regulatory solutions. There were several positive signs in Q1, first on the list being 14% growth in media effectiveness solutions. This category continues to carry a great deal of promise since there are many ways to repurpose our proprietary consortium data. On the other fronts, in the quarter, there were a few factors that moderated growth, one being the TSYS relationship we previously reported. The relationship is good, but the implementation leading to additional new sales will be completed one to two quarters later in 2018 than originally expected. On the regulatory solutions front, banks are facing increased scrutiny of the models behind their compliance and so model governance processes have moved to require more productized solutions and we are quickly responding to this trend. In general, Financial Services presents attractive growth opportunities. In addition to always looking for new opportunities to grow revenues in the business, we are also constantly evaluating ways to improve the company. To that end, you will have noticed recently two significant changes. First, as investors have seen in our proxy, this past quarter was our first under a new program of compensation for our senior executives. We have tightened the metrics used to set award levels to more directly track our key measures of organic revenue growth and organic EBITDA growth and have tied equity awards more closely to our achievement of shareholder returns over a multi-year period. These modifications are a further expression of our commitment to generating shareholder value. Second, this is our first quarter reporting our results in a fully vertical mode. Our presentation represents current view of how we think about the business and I appreciate the work Lee and his team have done to get us to this point. In general, we believe in the long-term potential of all three vertical markets to yield growth at or above our corporate target. Over the last five years ending in 2017, Insurance has grown at the corporate target, Financial Services has grown materially above the target, and Energy has been about 150 basis points below the corporate target in light of an historic cyclical downturn combined with the Brexit. Over the same five years, our competitive position have strengthened. The essence of what we do every day has helped companies harness data and analytics to improve their operations, decisions, and performance. This is one of the major themes of what is going on in the global economy and, in our view, will continue into the foreseeable future. We are swimming with a strong tide. And so as long as we remain close to our customers, add to the talent of our team and keep pushing to bring new value into the world, our business will continue to expand. I saw good evidence on all these fronts in the past quarter. I will now hand it over to Mark for a few comments on the Insurance business.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. In our Insurance business, we had another very strong quarter with all insurance-facing businesses, underwriting, rating and claims contributing to growth. Let me highlight a few areas that drove top line growth and update you on several initiatives that better position us for future growth. Underwriting and rating consists of, one, our ISO business unit, including industry standard insurance programs, property-specific underwriting and rating information, and our personal lines underwriting solutions; two, our extreme event models from AIR; and three, our insurance software solutions from Sequel. During the quarter, underwriting and rating delivered strong organic growth across extreme event modeling, personal lines underwriting and industry standard insurance programs through a combination of cross-sell of existing solutions to new customers and the sale of new innovative solutions. The insurance industry is driving towards automation. And the key to these efforts is high quality data and predictive analytics move forward to the point of sale in the process. We are leading the way in helping insurers achieve this goal of flow business in personal and increasingly commercial lines. This industry change has translated to growth in our personal and commercial underwriting solutions as well as our growing reputation as a thought leader in the industry. Our announcement of SmartSource prefill to streamline property insurance quoting is an example of high-quality data and analytics at the point of sale, leading the industry towards a more automated future. This type of solution improves the initial quote for an agent or consumer when they solicit an insurance quote online. ISO also announced the addition of Hyundai to the Verisk Data Exchange, our growing data lake of telematics and IoT or Internet of Things data. The proprietary telematics database now includes General Motors, Honda and Hyundai, representing 32% of the U.S. auto market. Again, the future of underwriting will be dependent on access to information on driving behavior and detailed ratings variable such as miles driven that can automate the insurance quote. This telematics data can also drive automation in the claims adjudication process. AIR continues to extend its solution set beyond property catastrophe modeling to a broader set of extreme events. During the quarter, AIR announced our collaboration with RenaissanceRe to develop the first probabilistic model for extreme liability risks. In addition, our fund designation solution was selected by Hudson Crop to help manage and optimize the risk in their crop portfolio. Finally, the strong collaboration across ISO and AIR continues to expand our cyber solutions to a commercial cyber liability insurance market that we estimate will exceed $6 billion by 2020. Our cyber extreme event models are gaining traction in the industry, while our industry standard insurance programs for cyber are now filed and implemented in 42 states. These new solutions allow our customers to grow and underwrite new risk in the fast-growing cyber insurance market. I'm pleased with the synergy opportunities that have been generated from our acquisition of Sequel. At the recent AIR customer conference, we showcased our seamless integration between Touchstone and Sequel, demonstrating the power of combining the solutions and providing interesting cross-sell potential. In addition, Sequel has provided a great asset to illustrate the power of ISO data to the London Market syndicates. In fact, Sequel's business intelligence tool has provided powerful data visualization of the ISO data and analytics for UK syndicates who have been plagued with suboptimal information about their portfolio of risks. Our international ambitions will be more easily achieved by the exceptional solutions and London Market expertise of Sequel. Our claims businesses include claims analytics, one; our fraud prevention solutions featuring ClaimSearch; two, Xactware, our suite of solutions focused on loss quantification and repair cost estimating; and three, Geomni, our cutting-edge remote imagery business. Claims experienced an exceptional quarter, with organic growth across all business units through a combination of cross-sell and the sale of new solutions. Like underwriting and rating, the insurance industry is focused on automating the claims process to drive towards right touch claims handling where less complex and smaller dollar claims are handled with limited manual intervention. Our claims business is on the forefront of this evolution. We have been successful expanding our insurance fraud prevention business, claims analytics, by broadening our use cases and licensing our anti-fraud analytic tools to automate our customers' claims processes. As an example, Nationwide Insurance licensed and implemented ClaimsDirector (sic) [ClaimDirector], our advanced fraud scoring tool that provides fraud indicators at the first notice of loss for each incoming claim and provides subsequent updates as new information is gathered. Tool also features an interactive business intelligence dashboard that provides key claims information to claims adjustors and managers. Xactware, our repair cost estimating solutions, continued to deliver strong organic growth, driven by new sales as well as continuing tailwinds from the extreme weather in 2017. Our repair cost estimating tools have always driven automation in the claims workflow, and our ClaimsXperience (sic) [ClaimXperience] solution takes automation and digital engagement to the next level. During the quarter, Hanover Insurance adopted ClaimsXperience (sic) [ClaimXperience], a suite of online and mobile solutions that helps our insurers customers interact remotely with their policyholders to more efficiently settle claims. During the quarter, Geomni, our business that harnesses remote sensing and machine learning technologies to provide information about residential and commercial structures, launched a new mobile app for ground imagery and drone inspections. The new app enables users to collect ground imagery and other data directly from their mobile devices or to conduct complete inspections. These images and resulting data packages seamlessly integrate with other Verisk offerings across claims, underwriting and catastrophe modeling. We are winning customers and making strong progress because we deliver unparalleled image quality, improved accuracy and automation in a safer and cost-effective process. The exciting part of this mission is that these advanced analytics are applicable to larger markets beyond insurance. Across the board, both from a market and financial perspective, we're very pleased with the performance of the Insurance business. With that, let me turn it over to Lee to cover the financial results.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. First, I'd like to bring to everyone's attention that we have introduced a quarterly earnings presentation that is available at our website. The presentation provides some background data, trends and analysis to support our conversation today, and I will refer to it throughout my comments. Secondly, we announced on April 26 a business segment recasting and provided historical revenue, EBITDA growth and margin information on the new segmentation basis. We have recast our prior two business segments of, one, Decision Analytics; and two, Risk Assessment into a more industry vertical-oriented segmentation of, one, Insurance; two, Energy and Specialized Markets; and three, Financial Services. Further within Insurance, we will provide revenue detail for underwriting and rating, and claims. On page 3 of our business segment recast announcement, you will find a mapping of the primary businesses included in each business segment and the Insurance businesses within the underwriting and rating, and claims categories, which is also included in our earnings presentation. I want to note that we have provided growth and margin information on the reported organic and organic constant currency basis for the past eight quarters and prior three full years. This provides a substantial historical context for the performance of the segments and goes beyond what is required from an SEC reporting standpoint. Consequently, with ample historical data on a comparable basis, we will not be providing individual segment growth or margin targets, but will rely on our previously communicated consolidated long-term financial targets of organic constant currency growth of 7% on average over time and organic constant currency EBITDA growth above revenue growth, reflecting EBITDA expansion – EBITDA margin expansion. Moving to the financial results for the quarter and referring to page 4 of the earnings presentation, on a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 16% to $581 million. We had adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, in first quarter 2018 and the impact was immaterial to our results. Net income increased 22% to $133 million for the quarter. And diluted GAAP EPS was $0.79 for the first quarter 2018, an increase of 23% compared with the same period in 2017. Having presented our summary GAAP results, I will now shift to a focus on our organic constant currency results for the next few minutes for all year-over-year revenue and EBITDA growth rates consistent with our financial targets and to eliminate the impact of currency fluctuations and recent acquisitions, for which we don't have full year-over-year comparisons. Acquired revenue and EBITDA in the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic results were $37 million and $2 million respectively. As shown on page 5 of the earnings presentation, Verisk demonstrated very solid growth performance and momentum in the first quarter. Revenue growth of 7% was consistent with our long-term targets and was our third consecutive quarter at 7% or higher. We also continue to remain disciplined in our expenditures, as EBITDA expenses grew 6.7%, below our revenue growth. Consequently, EBITDA grew 7.4% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis and reflected stable organic EBITDA margin of 49% in the first quarter including continued investment in several internal opportunities including Geomni most notably. Excluding just Geomni as one of our significant breakout investment opportunities, EBITDA grew 7.9%, demonstrating the operating leverage at Verisk before the impact of significant internal investments. Let me now turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis as we've described. As you will see on page 11 of the earnings presentation, Insurance had a strong quarter with 8.7% revenue growth with underwriting and rating contributing 6.9% growth and claims contributing 12.6% growth. The positive financial impact of severe weather on our business in the fourth quarter spilled over into the first quarter and contributed about $2.1 million in repair cost estimating revenue. EBITDA for Insurance grew 9.7%, reflecting an increased organic EBITDA margin of 56.3%, up from 55.8% in the prior year. As shown on page 13 of the earnings presentation, Energy and Specialized Markets produced revenue growth of 3.1% for the quarter, as the Energy business continues to recover. Revenue growth represented stable research activity, continued strength in consulting, regulatory products at 3E and momentum in our breakout initiatives. EBITDA was down 5.9% due to investments we are making in the WoodMac 2.0 initiative and our chemicals, subsurface, power and renewables, and analytics breakout initiative that increased head count and associated compensation expense. These areas represent opportunities to leverage Wood Mackenzie's data and industry expertise more broadly and deliver and develop products more swiftly and efficiently. As I've come up the learning curve on the company and have listened to questions from investors on WoodMac, I've analyzed the current margin of the Energy and Specialized Markets segment of 27% relative to what I understand from investors was a reported pre-acquisition margin for WoodMac of approximately 47%. There are several components that drive this current differential that I will identify and try to quantify. Starting with the reported Energy and Specialized Market (sic) [Markets] of 27% for the first quarter, there was a nonoperational FX impact of approximately 3%, an impact of non-WoodMac businesses of approximately 3% included in that segment, and a first quarter timing impact for revenue and expense recognition relative to the full year of 2%, that would bring the fully allocated and normalized WoodMac margin to 35%. Eliminating the allocation of Verisk overhead to WoodMac would add another approximately 3% to 38%. At acquisition, the accounting change from IFRS to GAAP added approximately 3% of EBITDA expenses from new treatments of CapEx and contractor expenses, and normalization of compensation and insurance expenses added approximately 2%, bringing us to 43%. Finally, the remaining 4% was primarily due to investments in the breakouts as we've described in acquisitions since the acquisition of WoodMac in 2015. In summary, we see nonoperational impacts of 14% that include the FX, the non-WoodMac business components, the Verisk overhead allocation, accounting adjustments and the Q1 timing impact and 6% operational, which represent the breakouts, acquisitions made as well as the normalization of compensation and insurance expenses. The Energy and Specialized Markets segment continues to enjoy core operating leverage and growth opportunities, as demand for data analytics in its constituent markets continues to expand and has been demonstrated in the growth of our breakout revenues and the early new contract wins at PowerAdvocate. In addition, we are also investing in WoodMac's product development and distribution platform to improve its operating leverage through our WoodMac 2.0 initiative and continue its development as a data analytics business. Turning to page 15 of the earnings presentation, Financial Services contributed revenue growth of 1.5% in the quarter, a slight improvement from essentially unchanged year-over-year revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing continued recovery from the contract transitions in 2017. Revenue results reflected continued strength in media effectiveness, offset by softness in regulatory and fraud products. EBITDA increased by 5.1%, reflecting an improved organic EBITDA margin of 36.1%, up from 35.5% in the prior year. Shifting briefly from organic constant currency results to reported results, I want to call out a specific nonrecurring expense associated with a final earn-out expense for Fintellix of approximately $3.5 million that reduced the reported first quarter EBITDA growth rates and reported EBITDA margin. Now returning to the GAAP numbers below EBITDA, depreciation and amortization was $74 million in the quarter, up 31.4% from the prior year, reflecting the impact of acquisitions and increased capital expenditures in both periods. Interest expense was $33 million in the quarter, up 15.4% from the prior year quarter due to the funding of acquisitions in 2017. Total debt was $2.8 billion at March 31, down from $3 billion at December 31, and our leverage at the end of the first quarter was 2.47 times. Our cash and cash equivalents were about $154 million at the end of the quarter. Our reported effective tax rate was 18% for the quarter compared to 32% in the prior-year quarter, primarily as the result of recent tax reform. Our effective tax rate was lower than our targeted range due to significant exercises of outstanding employee stock options that produced a favorable tax rate impact. As a result of recent and anticipated exercises and the current price of our stock, we are reducing our estimate of our effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 16% and 18%. However, the timing and impact of employee stock option exercises depends in part on the Verisk stock price and personal decisions. We expect that this impact will be more pronounced in 2018 and that we will revert to a higher effective tax rate in 2019. Adjusted net income was $159 million, up 27% from $125 million in the prior-year quarter. Diluted adjusted EPS was $0.94 for the first quarter, also up 27% from $0.74 in the prior-year quarter. The increase reflects organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, the impact of 2017 tax reform and lower share count. Equalizing the first quarter 2017 effective tax rate to that of the first quarter 2018, both adjusted net income and diluted adjusted EPS were up 6.8%. We repurchased 383,000 shares year-to-date for a total return of capital to shareholders of $40 million at a weighted average price of $104.22. At March 31, we had $326 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, and the average diluted share count was 169 million shares in the quarter. As of March 31, our diluted share count was also 169 million shares. As shown on page 17 of the earnings presentation, net cash provided by operating activities was $327 million year-to-date, up 2.9% from $318 million in the prior year. Capital expenditures were $43 million year-to-date, up 38.9% from $31 million in the prior year, reflecting primarily increased investment in Geomni and software development for recent acquisitions. Free cash flow was $284 million year-to-date, a slight decrease of 1% from the prior year due to the timing of collections. And our free cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA was 106% for the quarter compared to 117% a year ago. And I would note that the first quarter is typically a seasonally high level for free cash flow as a percentage of EBITDA. We continue to evaluate uses of capital across all internal and external investment opportunities as well as capital return alternatives on the basis of potential returns on capital and value creation. The first quarter consolidated results represented organic constant currency revenue and EBITDA growth consistent with our financial targets and stable organic EBITDA margins despite substantial investments in growth initiatives. Insurance performance remains consistently strong in both underwriting and ratings, and claims. And our Energy and Financial Services business continue to make progress towards their growth objectives. We are excited about the opportunities to invest in our business and remain focused on long-term profitable growth and solid returns on capital, and we remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk as well as your patience today. We know that we had more to cover than we typically do. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. This is Andrew. I just wanted to focus in on something Lee said at the beginning of the call that your team continues to target 7% organic revenue growth over time. I thought the target was more officially 7% to 8% as mentioned at Analyst Day in the five-year – or multi-year plan and discussed on the fourth quarter conference call. So my question is, is the company still talking about 7% to 8% for the medium-term and are you within that range this year?
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, so, Andrew, I think it's just we're saying over 7%. Obviously, 8% is over 7%. No change in the guidance. I think we just are looking at that 7% threshold. We certainly see the potential to be above that and to be at 8%. So there's no change in that. That is our long-term target. We aren't making – providing any guidance in terms of 2018. We would ask investors to look at the trends in the business, the momentum that we have in the various segments, and come to their own conclusions but our long-term targets remain consistent with what we've expressed in the past.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie. Your line is open.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just on the margin gap between overall organic and reported margin. It's clearly gotten – the gap's gotten a lot larger. I realize there's acquisitions coming in at a lower margin, but there's also potentially investment spend. Could you maybe just break that down for us in terms of investment – how much investment spend is diluting the margin versus some of these acquisitions?
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, Hamzah, thanks. So the investments that we are making are included in the organic margins that we've reported. So in terms of thinking about those margins, you should assume that the organic margins reflect all of the investments that we are making, for instance, in Geomni, subsurface, power and renewables, all of those breakouts. And then the difference between that organic margin and the reported margin is the impact of those acquisitions that we have made, but for which we don't have a year-over-year comparison. And this is kind of consistent with how we report the organic revenue growth and the EBITDA growth. Now, I'll make one qualification. In this first quarter impact, as you will see, there was a $3.5 million earn-out expense associated with our Fintellix acquisition that would have impacted that reported margin. So, that contributed to that. In addition, if you will note in my comments the EBITDA from the reported acquisitions that are excluded from organic also include some nonrecurring deal expenses. And so, that is another contributor that I would describe as kind of a nonorganic component of that differential. So hopefully, that gives you some context for the differential between the reported margin and the organic margin. Investments are included in that organic, and then the differential from a reported also includes some one-time deal expenses and earn-out payments that take that below what we would expect as kind of the normal operating margins for those businesses.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up question. You've added significant new data sets over time through acquisitions as well as investments. You talked about WoodMac 2.0. Have you given any thought as to how you're thinking about pricing for your subscriptions and new data sets? And maybe how much pricing contributes to that 7%-plus organic growth metric target? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, so we're always thinking about how to present our products to our customers and in general you should understand our pricing to be value-based pricing. So we're trying to understand the ROIs that customers generate based on using our solutions and then essentially determine what fraction of that we can sustainably hold onto in terms of how we price into the customers. And so really it's a function of how much value the next data set, the next software solution is generating, and it's on that basis that we put the price out there. There's always a price effect in everything that we do. It's seen across all the verticals and anything which is a multiyear subscription, it's generally the case that those contracts will have price escalation year-over-year. So pricing is a part of our overall organic rate of revenue growth. It's not the greatest part. It's a contributor. But it's well below 50% of what's going on in terms of our organic revenue growth.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW. Your line is open.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Wanted to know, to what extent do you find that some of your customers such as insurance brokers, to what extent are they getting into data analytics themselves where they actually end up having some overlap with you in terms of serving insurance carriers?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, so – and Mark, please feel free to jump in if you have any additional thoughts. I'm going to broaden out your question just a little bit. It's true across essentially all of our customers that one of the options that they have, of course, and they usually take advantage of the opportunity, to build their own data analytics teams. And we are not in competition with those teams and we never have been. And so the advent of companies trying to improve what they do with data analytics is constructive for our business overall and we want to be best friends of the person who is the rocket scientist inside of any of our customer sets. So you were referencing specifically brokers. Brokers are kind of doing the same thing that they've always done. I mean, some of the brokers have had some form of catastrophe models for a very long period of time. They always try to harness some element of the data that they've got. But there's just a fundamental difference between what we do and what the brokers do. The data that we have is so much more comprehensive and it's so much more granular that we just really don't end up overlapping what brokers do. So I think your question was specifically about the influence of brokers. That's not new business. There's nothing that's really all that different there. The reinsurance broker community has changed demographically somewhat just because of changes in the reinsurance business. But in terms of kind of the value that they add and the value that we add, I don't really see very much change there at all.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And maybe the only thing I will add – this is Mark – is clearly the brokers like everybody is trying to do more data analytics especially as brokering fees become a little bit squeezed. Their target market continues to be into corporates. We do some, but very little with corporates. We work and provide those analytics to insurers and the folks that are more in the insurance side of transaction.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And I guess my second question is what would you say the minimum level of organic growth you need to achieve organic margin expansion?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: It has to be – I don't know – mid-single digits probably, 5-ish, 5-ish to 6-ish.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just following up on the comment about WoodMac 2.0 project, I guess can you talk to us about the – a little more on, I guess, the outcome of that? And is it an improved product that you hope drives growth or does it have a significantly different cost structure afterwards that impacts the margins as well as where are we in terms of the – if you will, the peak investment necessary to drive that project? I mean does it go up from here or are we already absorbing that cost? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, so maybe in reverse order, Tim. We're kind of right in the middle of it right now, so I think that we're sort of at the investment level that is required. It has both effects that you were talking about. So first of all, there's a – as you would image, a massive amount of data that's part of what Wood Mackenzie does. But one of the things that a modern data analytic company can do is actually more highly automate data extraction, data cleansing and then data integration so that all of the data sets come together in a way that they're easily presented to the analytic layer and you can build new products. And so there is an efficiency effect there which we expect to enjoy as we move through this 2.0 migration. But then the other part of it is that – and I'm now alluding back to what I said in my comments, one of the big things that's happened in the energy space is that everything has sped up. If what you're trying to do is to harness competitive intelligence and make your investments and run your operations, everything has just sped up and that's largely the effect of the United States. Basically, sort of the old form was an offshore big development which would have hundreds of millions of dollars of investment and 5- to 10-year planning and execution cycles to get into business. Now in the unconventionals and the Lower 48, you can basically move a rig and three days later have a 1,500-foot well. And so planning cycles in a world like that are measured in weeks. And so one of the things that is necessary in that world, if you're going to stay on top of competitive intelligence and have really fresh and relevant solutions, is you've just got to speed up. And that will be one of the major effects of WoodMac 2.0. The other one is actually interacting even more deeply with customers' own decisioning platforms; more melding of their data with our data with other forms of data that we don't even use today. And so the – kind of the overall point, which is to help our customers make better decisions faster, that's always been the point and will continue to be the point. But by degrees, what we put out there will actually look different and be more valuable because of data integration, plus the deeper connectivity between our data sets and the customers' data sets.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. And just – the follow-up on, the Insurance vertical, the growth rate, I guess, this quarter in particular because the boost from the hurricane activity wasn't really the dominant factor there. Can you – is something different about the environment in the last couple of quarters? I know you talked broadly about very specific items that impacted the business. But given how much the growth has improved, are we just at a point in time where you've had a lot of new products come to market or has the spending environment changed in your view? Can you kind of at a higher level talk about how you're viewing the growth there lately?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure, Tim. This is Mark. I just want to make sure – we've been kind of reiterating the same that we feel that we're well positioned. We have a better set of assets and new products than we ever have, and those are coming to fruition. The other thing we've been trying to emphasize over the last several quarters, back probably the earlier 2017, was there were several industry consolidations both on the reinsurance side and the insurance side, and when that happens, sometimes that put pressure on us. There was this underlying headwind that we've been a little bit free from. So there's a combination of good elements that are contributing and I think that I would be remiss if I didn't mention we're doing a very good job from a sales perspective of cross-selling and we're seeing good activity, good integration and good engagement with customers.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Lee, you mentioned the 7% EBITDA growth target that you had also called out at Investor Day. Should we assume that really any incremental leverage that you get from growth in the business is reinvested over that level or could you basically allow that to have margins expand? And this is more of a long-term philosophy question than just a 2018 one.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, thank you, Toni. I think – so, first of all, reiterating that our expectation is to grow organic revenue above 7% and that we would expect organic EBITDA margin to grow – I'm sorry, organic EBITDA to grow at a faster level than that. And so your question goes to, to what degree are we reinvesting that growth in the business. And the way I would approach that is to say we are looking at individual investment opportunities in each of the breakouts on their merits in terms of the growth potential and the return on capital for each of those and we would expect that each of those individually would demonstrate the operating leverage that we expect for Verisk as a whole and to contribute to that stronger EBITDA growth relative to our revenue growth. And so in terms of the timing impacts of that, it depends upon those opportunities and when we put capital into them. Overall, over that long-term objective, we are going to expect to see operating EBITDA growth in excess, implying that margin expansion and that operating leverage. And so I think the variances around that will have more to do with the timing of specific projects and I'll tie that to a specific example. Geomni, for instance, is clearly an opportunity that we have been investing heavily in from a CapEx and from a compensation standpoint. That clearly has an impact, as I indicated today in my remarks, on our EBITDA growth. We are expecting 2018 to be the peak level of investment as we've said before on that and so that will moderate over time, and so that should demonstrate more expanded margin as that tails off. Now there may be other investments that we're making beyond that, but overall we are expecting that margin to express itself and we will try to provide some context between how the investment levels are impacting that growth. Hopefully, that gives you a little bit of clarity in terms of how we think about it.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Then my follow-up is on Argus. Not sure if Lisa's there or not, but just any sort of changes made to how Lisa will run the business versus how Nana was running it, how basically the plan to maybe kick start growth up again. Scott mentioned in the beginning of the call the isolated example of the TSYS relationship and basically being one to two quarters later than expected. So should we start to see the growth again maybe in the back half of the year? Because I know you mentioned that the subscription base was up pretty significantly at the Investor Day. So just wanted to get a sense of how confident we are in Financial Services growth in the next couple of quarters and if there's a change in strategy. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Right. So, Lisa is not here, but I feel comfortable answering on her behalf. We, as you would imagine, spend a lot of time together talking about all this. The path to growth is going to be the same as it has been. I called out in my remarks that three of the streams – revenue streams at Argus that will be particularly meaningful are media effectiveness, regulatory solutions, and data hosting, and so to really be a function of each of those streams finding their mark. At this point, 25 of the top 25 credit card issuers in the English-speaking world are in our data consortium and customers for our solutions. And so just the building of the consortium now – it's really down to additional countries, I guess is the way that I would put it, and we're having some success there. But there had been moments over the course of the last five years where a pretty good contributor to growth was more issuers coming into the consortium. At this point, that's a little more established. So, that part of the revenue stack can grow, but it won't grow quite as fast. And so those are the three components, and that's not really a change from where we've been. So we're really down to execution, and I referenced a timing effect as it related to the first quarter of 2018. But as I mentioned, the long-term view is that this is a business which for five years through 2017 grew in the low- to mid-teens. The depth and the power of our data asset is greater in 2018 than it was in 2012 at the beginning of that time period. The customer demography has not really changed, so we see a lot of opportunity for this business to grow.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, guys. My first question is around the Energy investments and opportunity. I mean you've called out, I guess breakout is the word you've used a lot of times for the opportunities and why you're investing there. We appreciate the bridge you had on the margins, but I guess the question is I'm still surprised that you still have another two years of investments to go before a lot of this is done. And maybe just a little bit more color on how these breakout opportunities are going to phase in? Like, do we have to wait two years for these margins to start getting better? I think that's the big question on my mind here.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, so there are actually two things here, Manav, and you kind of put them together a little bit. So let me pull them apart for you. WoodMac 2.0 and the breakout solutions are not the same thing. Breakout solutions are things that we're presenting to customers that they find valuable, which operate in their environments and help them to run their businesses and make progress, and Lee referenced those at some length. Those are relatively large categories of spending. The good news is that each of those, whether it's subsurface or it's power and renewables, we actually find good growth associated with those. We're very happy. Having sort of launched these things and given where they are in their progress, the margins will improve as they grow. The margins are not as high as the other things that we do today, and so you have both of those effects at work. WoodMac 2.0 is something different. That's about capabilities. That's about WoodMac being a 21st century, fully-equipped modern data analytic machine. And the data analytic work that WoodMac has done historically has been very unique and the content has been very unique, but the actual data analytic methods have not really been as strong or as advanced as those and other parts of Verisk. So our thesis, even when we got started and here we are now, is that the rest of Verisk could apply methods and help make progress. It's taking a while, and I referenced that 2019 would be sort of a moment of milestones with regard to all of that, but that will be the ongoing work. So you just need to separate those two forms of investment.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. And, Manav, I want to add one thing to Scott's comments just to contextualize this for you. The breakout opportunities in the Energy and Specialized Markets are entities that are EBITDA positive. They are generating EBITDA. They are generating real revenues and revenue growth, and so it isn't a situation where we're investing and hoping the revenues and the profitability will come. We've already demonstrated product viability, client acceptance and we're now in the face of driving to a scale level where we can see that substantial EBITDA growth given the operating leverage grow. Now that varies from investment to investment, but I want to give – your question goes to the level of maturity of these investments and our timing, and I would – I just want to make the point that these are generating EBITDA profitability and we are generating attractive revenue growth in the businesses. So they are established and probably at a more mature level than perhaps kind of your initial impressions were.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Actually, there's one other point I want to make around profitability levels at WoodMac and that is you can actually see our philosophy at Verisk at work if you look at WoodMac over the last several years. And what I mean by that is there was a remarkable discontinuity in the end market in the energy space, remarkable. The industry globally – meaning our customers shed hundreds of – about 350,000 jobs globally. The choice that we made was that we're in this for the long haul. So we didn't slash head counts. We didn't penalize our people by saying, okay, there was this downturn, but you're just going to get paid a lot less because we're groping for a near-term margin impact. And I think we've been rewarded for that. Our performance relative to referenced competitors in the space with respect to growth has been considerably better. But this is our philosophy at Verisk. As much as our business runs on intellectual capital and it does, a lot of that is tied to our people and the greatest part of our cost structure is our people. And we're going to manage for the long term and that is absolutely what we've done as we've moved through with WoodMac. And so you can see that in terms of the choices that we've made in light of a very difficult external environment. We thought long term and we remained investment-minded and that's what we'll always do at Verisk.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Manav.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful. Maybe just one, the follow-up is just on the – I think, Lee, you made a comment that you're not giving guidance for 2018, but last quarter I think, Scott, you had said that you would do 7% to 8% organic growth in the year. So are you backing away from that because of the slower start to Financial Services and Energy or am I just reading that wrong?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think you're just reading that wrong. We just – at the start of the year, I think we want to give a sense as to where things look contextually. Nothing has changed in that outlook. We just are not providing a specific estimate for 2018. We are working towards our targets. You can see that we successfully achieved that in the first quarter. We've done that consistently over the past few quarters and we think that should be the basis for investor and analyst perspective on 2018.
Operator: And your next question...
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Operator? Go ahead.
Operator: Yeah, your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Wanted to come back to – I think, Mark, you just made a comment a couple questions ago on M&A and how that has weighed on growth in the past. And I think you brought this up proactively on the last call too. So just looking for a little bit more color. You said you were through that, but at the same time I think so far this year we are on pace as the highest M&A year in the insurance end markets. So maybe you can contrast that and how you think about that outlook. And then maybe more specifically, if you could give us a little bit of a history lesson, I think a couple of years ago when the ACE/Chubb deal was going on, I think some people noted that maybe that cost you a couple of percent of growth. So maybe just be a little bit more specific what you're seeing and how that could impact your outlook there.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, obviously, some acquisitions and consolidation in the industry could or could not affect us. It really gets to what models as an example use AR (00:56:21), if there's two reinsurers that are combining the acquiring company, what models they use could drive a better or worse outcome for us. And what happened as I described over kind of 2016 into early 2017 was some of that merger activity worked against us. Your referenced ACE/Chubb. Those are both large users of ISO services. We worked in agreement with them that I think made both customers and Verisk happy, but there obviously, in those type of things, does come some negotiations. So I can't really get all that more specific. All that I can tell you is the headwinds that we experienced are behind us. (00:57:25) things that have been announced or pending don't seem to have that big of implication on us going forward. So I think we're in a better space – place we are today than we were a year ago.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And, Mark, maybe just picking up on the point, maybe you and I could dialog about two things real quick. So one is, in the ACE/Chubb situation is it fair to say that actually we're now looking at cross-sell opportunities that could probably actually cause the combined account to be bigger than it was, maybe even materially bigger than it was before the time when they were separate entities? Is that fair?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think one of the benefits we've of kind of taking our insurance businesses and being holistic is we've had these more senior-level discussions as Scott highlighted, and these outcomes are positive in the sense that we think we have bigger growth opportunities to cross-sell products and get Verisk more integrated and more product into those bigger customers. So we'll continue to look forward for the future, but I think there could be a very positive outcome.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And maybe get your view on one other thing which is the announced AXA, XL Catlin put together. Kind of my view is I think that that's probably actually good news for us because AXA, a more global company, has made relatively less use of what we do to-date. XL Catlin has been a very strong, well-established customer. I think there will be flow from – or there could be flow from XL Catlin into AXA. What do you see?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: That was my specific reference when I said the acquisitions that are pending on the horizon probably are more positive to us and we don't see a concern.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, yes, agreed.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: Thank you. Your last question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Everyone. So, first question on the telematics Data Exchange. Scott, in the past when you've described building these contributory databases as three yards and a cloud of dust, so you announced your first contributor, GM, back in September 2015. Then there was nothing for a couple of years and now you've announced Honda in January and Hyundai in April. So are we at an inflection point? And how should we think about the size and the timing of the revenue opportunity for the Verisk Data Exchange?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, so – and, Mark, let me invite your comments. I think the answer to inflection point is, I think more in terms of curves than steps when we – as we sort of build all of this. So I do think that the Data Exchange becomes just that much more inevitable as it grows. So you do have that effect. On the other hand, you've got – sort of every OEM seems to be its own special case and the rate at which they look at these opportunities and what they think they're going to get out of vehicle telemetry just seems to vary from OEM to OEM. So I think it's something short of kind of a – sort of a herd movement. But I do think that sort of the next contributor is that much closer to hand because of having reached roughly one-third of the market, as Mark has described. And the revenue side of it will look like a curve also because as the data deepens, it'll just be that much more compelling to an increasingly larger number of insurers to want to access the data and build their process around these data. So I would encourage you to think in terms of curves rather than step changes, but it is very encouraging, and I compliment our team for having gotten this far. I mean we are clearly the leader in this category, hands down. I don't really actually think anybody else is really in this category. Seems to (01:01:37).
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And then a quick follow-up on the $3.5 million Fintellix earn-out. Just wanted to check, why is that running through the income statement and not through the cash flow statement as an earn-out? And then just to be clear, the $3.5 million – is the $3.5 million included in the expenses in reported and then excluded from the expenses in organic EBITDA? I just want to make sure I was clear on that.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. Thank you, Bill. This is Lee. So the answer is that this earn-out structure was tied to ongoing employment agreements with the employees, and under the accounting rules that has to be reflected as an expense when that's paid. So, that's the technical answer. And it is included in the reported results, but it is excluded from the organic results that we have reported.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. So, operator, I think that concludes our session for today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. Well, I just wanted to say before we sign off, thank you, everybody, for your interest and for the questions today. I hope and I believe that the expanded presentation that we're providing you is giving you a deeper look into the company. We're very happy for you to have that deeper look because we're actually very confident in where our business sits and where it's going, and so we want everybody to kind of appreciate the dynamics of our business. And so I imagine that our conversations going forward will just be enriched by the greater disclosures. So, thanks for your interest, and we'll talk to many of you in the coming days and weeks and look forward to it.
Lee M. Shavel - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Bye for now.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Lee Shavel. Mr. Shavel, you may go ahead.
Lee Shavel: Thank you, Heidi, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our fourth quarter 2017 financial results. With me on this call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and myself highlighting some key points about our financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.  Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. All discussions of EBITDA reflect adjusted EBITDA, for which you can find a reconciliation in our press release. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC.  A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect the future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings.  Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, and good morning. It's a real pleasure to welcome Lee to his first earnings call as Verisk's new CFO. Lee's experience and insight from his time as NASDAQ CFO are already contributing to developments at Verisk. One of the first jobs he and I agreed on was for him to do a listening tour of some of our major institutional shareholders to hear your candid feedback about your likes and dislikes for owning Verisk is concerned. This has been the healthy exercise we expected, and we believe your feedback will be expressed in our evolving policies and communication practices in the coming quarters. Lee has already been able to complete an annual budget cycle with us, and so he has quickly become grounded in the rudiments of our business.  As we described in our recent Investor Day, Verisk advances by achieving strong levels of organic revenue growth, and the primary driver of high-quality organic revenue is the sale of multiyear subscriptions. A multiyear subscription is the best demonstration that our solutions have moved from nice to have to must-have. Over the last 90 days, there have been several encouraging developments, to name three, First, Argus acquired a large multiyear subscription agreement along with the associated data rights with the only major credit card issuer in the English-speaking world that was not a customer. Second, WoodMac saw good progress in the number and value of subscription agreement signed. And third, in the insurance vertical, against a backdrop of many contract signings, we had 3 companies choose to focus exclusively on our catastrophe models and saw 2 other companies make an exclusive commitment to our Geomni program of imagery capture and analysis. But perhaps most important of all, we have the chance to see the value of our industry standard solutions tested in the context of the merger of 2 carriers and are very pleased with the degree to which our value and subscription price points stood the test as we finalized that new agreement.  Subscriptions, of course, can cut both ways. When they are lost, it takes even more sales success to compensate and grow. In 2017, we had such conditions at work at Argus, where 2 government and 1 legacy subscription agreement rolled off with a reduction of about $11 million in annual revenue. As we assess our business into 2018, we observed the following across our several thousand customers, we see no material risk at this time of a lost customer relationship in the insurance and financial services verticals. And in energy, two accounts that produced subscription revenue in '17 will be combined into one as a result of a merger with relatively immaterial impacts. The substantial majority of our customer relationships are showing year-over-year increases in revenue related primarily to the adoption of more of our product suite. We are aware of only two accounts, one in financial services and one in energy, where we expect year-over-year revenues to be down materially in 2018. In the financial services example, this is due to the phenomenon we have previously described, where first year revenue spike due to implementation, thereafter followed by a steady but lower level of high-quality subscription revenue. In the case of energy, the customer no longer exists due to merger.  Our industry-standard solutions will show growth in 2018, but at a slightly lower rate than in '17. Because of general softness in the insurance environment and to preserve our cross-sell opportunities, we deliberately moderated growth for '18 to a modest degree. However, we see hardening in the market, and we expect that in '19 we will be at or above the growth rate of '17.  WoodMac growth continues to move to the positive. In '18, the growth will primarily relate to cross-selling and expansion of exciting product sets, including subsurface analytics, renewable energy sources and chemicals. We are still minimizing price increases in '18 in support of cross-selling opportunities, but expect the '19 and beyond to make more use of pricing in our overall growth mix.  One of the best leading indicators of our organic revenue growth is the number and quality of meetings we had with senior decision makers at our customers, in which we explore new opportunities for value creation. In that context, it is encouraging that in the last 90 days, we, on 3 occasions, had company CEOs asked to bring themselves and their senior teams to our offices to observe Verisk's InsureTech and jointly develop new or bespoke solutions.  Another leading indicator that has meaning for me is our success in winning business with the newer entrants into the markets we serve. For example, the world is alive with interest in the InsureTech space. Of the 8 leading InsureTech firms founded in '16 and '17 that operate as risk-bearing or risk-managing entities, 6 of them are currently customers of Verisk. I take that as evidence of the freshness of our value proposition.  We're busy at work integrating the companies we acquired in 2017. The work of integration have 3 different flavors at this moment, first, we acquired seven regional image capture companies with the intent to merge them into one integrated national entity. Success in this endeavor is really entirely a function of integration since this is core to the value proposition. I'm pleased with our progress here. At the end of last year, with all the extreme weather events, the flexibility and integration of our operations was tested. And I was pleased to see that the quality and responsiveness of our image capture, which is driven by the integration of our platform, permitted us to image Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria with such speed and precision that we unlocked business with mortgage lenders who were not previously customers. At the other end of the spectrum, PowerAdvocate and Sequel are relatively mature organizations, where, in addition to financial and HR integration, the primary work is to link their platforms to those elsewhere in Verisk. Specifically, PowerAdvocate to WoodMac oil and gas analytics and Sequel to AIR's Touchstone modeling platform. Teams are well underway on this work. In fact, we've recently signed a major contract with one of the world's largest national oil companies, which involves deliverables on the part of both PowerAdvocate and WoodMac. Both teams report this sale would not have happened had the 2 companies not come together.  The third category is a series of smaller product organizations, most of them in insurance, where the immediate work is to harness the Verisk distribution channel to increase sales. We are well underway with this work.  At our recent Investor Day, I described the 5 qualities that make our company a moated business, which can produce strong organic revenue growth on a sustained basis, those being, one, vertical market expertise; two, unique datasets, ideally contributed by our customers; three, deep integration with customer workflows; four, global reach leading to an expanding customer account; and five, synergies arising from the sharing of methods and capabilities across our enterprise. I see progress on all fronts. And over the last 90 days, I'm particularly struck by our growing effectiveness in overseas markets, particularly the U.K. As a result, our organic revenue growth in the quarter was 7.6%, consistent with our longer-term goals. Our rate of organic EBITDA growth in the quarter was about 5%, lower than revenue growth and a function, particularly, of the significant investment we made in Geomni as we continue to ramp up that operation. In 2018, I expect that relationship to be reversed, meaning enterprise organic EBITDA growth greater than organic revenue growth.  I'd like to comment on the corporate tax reform that was enacted at the end of 2017. Lee will take you through the specific implications for Verisk as regards our tax rate and the after-tax cash flow and accounting implications. From a strategic perspective, we are treating this as an opportunity to reinvest in our people. And so we have taken the decision to double our training budgets in most categories and to materially increase our contributions to long-term wealth for our people in the form of greater 401(k) matching and expanded employee stock purchase programs. We have built all of these investments into our 2018 budget and still expect a strong bottom line this year. After the additional free cash, we intend to be disciplined with our investor's money, looking for the highest-return investment opportunities and looking favorably on opportunities to return capital to shareholders.  With that, I'll hand it over to Mark for some comments on the insurance business.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. In our insurance business, we had another strong quarter, with all insurance-facing businesses, industry standard programs, catastrophe modeling, repair cost estimating, planes analytics and remote imagery contributing to the growth.  Let me highlight a few areas that drove top line growth and update you on several initiatives to aggregate new sources of data to better position us for growth in the future. Our claims businesses, repair cost estimating and claims analytics experienced a nice uptick in growth in the second half of 2017. We have been successful expanding our insurance fraud prevention business, claims analytics, by broadening our use cases, aggregating additional information, licensing our antifraud analytic tools and extending beyond our traditional insurance customers to entities such as self-insured companies and third-party administrators. In most cases, these opportunities take the form of multiyear contracts, but in some instances, start as a paid proof of concept. We're optimistic about these extensions of our business.  We've also experienced a surge in opportunities in our workers' compensation solutions business, bringing on several major new accounts during 2017. Over the past couple of years, we've invested to provide increased automation and enhanced [indiscernible] to our customers. This investment has proven successful as we implement new customers and attract a growing sales pipeline.  During the fourth quarter, Geomni, our business that harnesses remote sensing and machine learning technologies to provide information about residential and commercial structures, deployed one of its regional hubs to proactively capture aerial imagery in response to the Southern California fires. Imagery collected helps document the areas affected, provide operational efficiencies and accelerate the damage estimation and restoration process for homes and commercial buildings, helping insurers protect people and property. As Scott mentioned in his earlier comments, we have made significant progress at Geomni, signing new customers, advancing the analytics and building geographic coverage.  We were thrilled to sign an exclusive agreement with Honda to join the Verisk Data Exchange in the quarter. Honda will provide Verisk with driving data from consenting owners of Honda's connected cars. Honda customers can access the Verisk Driving Score, a simple metric that rates the driving behavior. Insurers can use the data from the Verisk Data Exchange with their usage-based insurance programs, typically designed to reward safe drivers or use Verisk driver behavior scores that are filed and approved for use today in 43 states. With the addition of Honda, the total market share of automakers participating in the Verisk Data Exchange increased to 27% of vehicles sold in the United States. The exchange now has close to 3 million cars, with 30 billion miles of driving data. And it's growing at more than 150,000 vehicles each month. This telematics information is a key component of our broader mission to aggregate remote sensing information and find insights to help our customers. This remote sensing data includes information from mobile devices, connected homes, connected buildings. For example, with connected homes, our research using IoT data has shown opportunities for Lyft or improved underwriting results for our customers writing homeowners' insurance.  International expansion is an important part of our long-term growth plan. AIR continues to lead our international expansion efforts as PICC Reinsurance Company Limited, a leading Chinese reinsurance company, has collaborated with AIR to better assess and manage its growing portfolio of catastrophe risk reinsurance business. Another positive on the international front was our introduction of a new inland flood model for Japan, along with enhancements to our Japan typhoon model. The integration of our new international acquisitions has progressed smoothly. The newly acquired businesses have gained immediate benefit by leveraging Verisk's technology infrastructure and cloud capabilities. Specific to Sequel, we work conjointly with clients to enable seamless data transfer from Sequel's business intelligence tools to AIR's Touchstone Solutions. In the longer term, our goal is to integrate Sequel's front-end exposure management and visualization platform with ISO's underwriting information and portfolio assessment and modeling features of AIR. This modular approach will allow product cross-sell with Sequel customers as well as existing Verisk customers. Our integration efforts at Sequel are also working in 2 directions, as evidenced by an opportunity for our claims analytics business to leverage some existing Sequel software to serve our U.S. claims analytics customers.  All in all, both qualitatively and quantitatively, we are pleased with the performance of the insurance business.  With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results.
Lee Shavel: Thanks, Mark. Let me start by saying what an honor it is for me to be here and to have the opportunity to serve this great company and its shareholders and work with Scott and his management team. As Scott mentioned, I've had the opportunity in the past 2 months to meet or speak directly with 18 of our top 25 active investors, representing 50% of the active voting interest of our shareholders. We spoke about a wide variety of topics, and I've received many thoughtful perspectives, but 2 areas came up consistently, one, a desire to better understand our capital management discipline; and two, improve transparency and communication of our financial and operating performance. In both areas, I'm confident that we'll demonstrate improvements in 2018. And to that end, we'll be implementing a quarterly earnings presentation for the first quarter of 2018 that will provide a consistent structure for reviewing the company's performance across our business lines, and we are considering other enhancements based on the feedback I've received.  Moving to the financial results for the quarter. I'd like to start by focusing at a high level on the two key financial metrics that we discussed at Investor Day, organic revenue growth and organic EBITDA growth. Verisk demonstrated very solid growth performance and momentum in the fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth of 7.6%, 7.4% on a constant-currency basis, was consistent with our long-term guidance and was an increase in the comparable third quarter 2017 year-over-year growth of 6.5% or 7% on a constant-currency basis. Average quarterly organic growth on a constant-currency basis in the second half of 2017 of 7.2% compared to 3.3% for the first half, substantiating the expectation we had of acceleration in the second half.  I would note total acquired revenue in the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic was $26 million and revenue from the 3 August acquisitions, G2, Sequel and LCI, contributed $16 million in the quarter, with combined margins of around 36%, as expected.  For the full year, Verisk delivered organic revenue growth of 4.5% and 5.3% on a constant-currency basis, below our targeted level as the result of industry headwinds at WoodMac and the contract expirations at Argus that reduced revenues from 2016, particularly in the first half.  A quick side note on revenue accounting and as required, the company will be adopting the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, in the first quarter of 2018. We expect the impact to be immaterial to our financial results.  So breaking down the organic revenue growth. As you will see in Table 2 in the press release, Decision Analytics and, particularly, Decision Analytics insurance was the primary contributor to this organic growth at 12.9%, with strong growth in repair cost estimating and claims analytics solutions, with good growth in underwriting solutions also. The positive financial impact of severe weather on our business in the third quarter spilled over into the fourth quarter and contributed about $8 million in repair cost estimating and imagery-based solution revenue. Even excluding this revenue, organic insurance revenue growth was 8.2%.  Decision Analytics energy demonstrated an improvement to 5.2% organic growth in the fourth quarter, up from 0.2% in the third quarter. Given the currency impact for energy, principally WoodMac, I would note that, on a constant-currency basis, energy revenue growth was 4.7% and has increased for each of the prior 3 quarters. We are pleased to see the trends in our subscription business continuing to be positive, complemented by good consulting revenue number, which is typically a leading market indicator.  At Decision Analytics financial services, they delivered growth of 0.4% in the fourth quarter, which represented a reversal from the prior 3 quarters of year-over-year decreases as a result of contract expirations. Organic growth was driven by strength in analytical data warehousing products, share of wallet model algorithms and media effectiveness solutions. We continue to win significant new business with clients, as Scott described, in media effectiveness, analytical solutions, competitive benchmarking, decisioning algorithms and regulatory solutions. G2 and LCI continue to integrate well, with joint product roadshows underway, which have been well received by clients. Fintellix has also contributed by driving new products in the insurance sector. We believe that financial services demonstrated clear progress in the fourth quarter, and we remain confident that it will contribute to organic growth in 2018.  Risk Assessment generated 5.3% year-over-year growth for the period, also up from 4.9% in the third quarter and having steadily increased over each of the 4 quarters in 2017. Organic growth was driven by the annual effective growth in 2017 invoices as well as new solutions in industry-standard insurance programs and an increase in underwriting solutions subscription revenue.  Organic EBITDA growth was 4.9% for the quarter on a year-over-year basis compared to organic revenue growth of 7.6% and reflected organic cost of revenue and SG&A expense growth of 9.7% as the result of continued investment in several internal opportunities, including Geomni most notably. For the year, EBITDA growth was 4% over 2016 compared to organic revenue growth of 4.5% as the result of 5.2% full year growth in the cost of revenue and SG&A, also reflecting continued internal investment in several growth opportunities and organic revenue growth below targets at Argus and WoodMac relative to expense growth.  Excluding the impact of expense related to internal investment initiatives, organic EBITDA grew at a higher rate than the organic revenue growth in 2017.  Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations margin was 49% for 2017, down slightly from 50% in 2016, primarily of -- as the result of the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, EBITDA margin was essentially unchanged.  Depreciation and amortization was $64 million in the quarter, up 25 -- I'm sorry, up 28% from the prior year quarter and $237 million for 2017, up 12% from 2016, reflecting the impact of acquisitions and increased capital expenditures in both periods. We expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $150 million to $160 million and amortization of intangible assets of about $130 million in 2018.  Interest expense was $32 million in the quarter, up 13% from the prior year quarter, and $119 million for 2017, down 1% from 2016.  Total debt was $3 billion at December 31, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.7x, and we expect to bring our leverage back to our reference level of 2.5x over time. Our cash and cash equivalents were about $142 million at the end of 2017.  Our reported effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 14.1% and a positive 19.7% for the full year of 2017. These effective rates reflect an $89 million benefit from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities resulting from recently enacted tax legislation. We estimate our effective tax rate in 2018 to be between 21% and 23%.  Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.34 for the fourth quarter, up from $0.80 in the prior year quarter and $3.74 for 2017, up from $3.11 in 2016. The increase in both periods primarily reflects, naturally, the impact of 2017 tax reform. Excluding the tax reform benefit of $0.53 per share in the fourth quarter, diluted adjusted EPS was $0.81 for the quarter, up 1% from the prior year, and $3.21 for 2017, up 3% from 2016. The average diluted share count was 168.3 million shares for the quarter, and our diluted share count at the end of 2017 was 168.7 million shares.  Moving to cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $744 million for 2017, up 34% from $556 million in 2016. Capital expenditures from continuing operations were $184 million in 2017, up 26% from $146 million in 2016, reflecting primarily increased investment in Geomni. We anticipate capital expenditures to be between $220 million and $230 million in 2018, including the continued investments in our aerial imagery solutions at Geomni that will peak in 2018. Subsequently, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenues to steadily decline.  Free cash flow was $560 million for 2017, an increase of 9.8% after excluding $100 million of taxes paid related to the sale of the health care business in 2016. We repurchased 3.4 million shares in 2017 for a total return of capital to shareholders of $270 million at a weighted average price of $80.39. At December 31, 2017, we had $366 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, and we expect to continue share repurchases in 2018.  So in summary, the results for 2017 reflected some growth challenges in the first part of the year at Wood Mackenzie, resulting from the cyclical decline in the energy sector along with FX headwinds and from certain contract expirations at Argus. Both businesses demonstrated revenue progress in the second half, with strong performance in our insurance business, helped in part by revenue generated by an exceptional level of severe weather in the third quarter. We returned to our targeted organic revenue growth in the second half of 2017. We remain confident in our long-term organic growth targets, particularly if growth continues to improve at both WoodMac and Argus as we saw in the second half. We are pleased with our 2018 plan. We're excited about the opportunities to invest, looking to drive long-term profitable growth. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long term.  We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair & Company.
Timothy McHugh: Can I ask about the comment, first, related to industry standard programs? I guess, one, just elaborate on why, I guess, take a little bit more cautious approach to, it sounded like, pricing, essentially. Because I think in the past you've talked about kind of the -- your pricing capability being somewhat separate from the kind of the environment for the insurance industry. So maybe just elaborate on what drove that. And anything about how significant that might be in terms of the [indiscernible] program?
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, Tim. Let me start with the end. It's not a particularly significant effect, but of course, folks will be watching our year-over-year progression as we go through 2018. So we have visibility into this, so we just wanted to note it. It's not a very material effect. We're talking about basis points. And the reason that we did it was that we've just in the round have accounted for where our insurance customers were as they exited '17, there -- the state of their own businesses. And the most important thing in the growth of our insurance business by far, and I hope that's evident to everybody, is the cross-selling of our total suite of solutions. And so, essentially, we made a decision about where we're going to take our gains in 2018. And at the margin, we're leaning a little bit more towards the other parts of the suite facing our insurance customers. So we just wanted to note it for you. It's not a big effect at all. We wanted to call it out just because it's a line item that we report, but it's not highly material.
Timothy McHugh: Okay. And just to be clear, that's driven by -- just that you were talking about industry standard, not the broader insurance kind of including Decision Analytics and so forth?
Scott Stephenson: That's correct. I was only talking about our industry standard line item within the overall insurance suite. The -- we feel very good about the overall insurance business.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.
Jeffrey Meuler: So just on the comment about organic EBITDA margins expanding in 2018, I guess, just two related questions. So is that before the reinvestment of some of the tax savings? And if so, can you just help size up roughly the magnitude of the reinvestment? And then can you also just give us any sense of the acquisition effect on 2018 margins? There's a lot of moving pieces with acquired/deferred revenue headwinds and some prior acquisitions being anniversaried in that regard in 2017 transaction expenses. So I guess the first question is, on the organic revenue -- or organic margin outlook, does it include the reinvestment? And then if you can help us size up those two pieces, please.
Scott Stephenson: Right, thanks, Jeff. I'll start, then I'll bump it over to Lee. So with respect to the statement about the projection of organic EBITDA exceeding that of organic revenue, that is before any tax effects whatsoever. So that is net of all the investing that we're doing in the business in total. And so hopefully, that's responsive to your question. With respect to some of the detail underneath, Lee, do you want to add anything to all that?
Lee Shavel: Yes. Jeff, so I think part of the question is prior to the reinvestment of the tax benefits. And so I think our expectation for the organic EBITDA growth reflects kind of the core business as we are looking at the investment in the growth initiatives. We expect that, that will contribute to margin expansion over time as we reach the fruition on those investments. But as I indicated in my comments, when you exclude those investments, we saw, in 2017, actually an expansion of organic EBITDA margin. And that's where we're really focused currently is, one, what does the -- how is the core performance? How is the core business performing? Secondly, how are the investments performing? And then with regard to acquisitions, what we had provided is the impact of acquisitions in the fourth quarter. It's difficult to predict the overall impact of the acquisitions on the margin over time. We'd like to focus on that organic EBITDA margin because that's really what we're managing to. Naturally, as we make acquisitions, as you've seen from some of the disclosures, at their level of EBITDA margin, initially, that will have a dilutive impact, but what we're really focused on is that year-over-year improvement that we will see once those businesses come into the organic fold. So hopefully, that gives you some color on the organic EBITDA margin question.
Jeffrey Meuler: That's helpful. And then on the Argus -- or financial services organic outlook, I think there was a moment at the Investor Day where there's a question about should 2018 be an outsized growth year. And I think, Scott, you said it was your expectation, that Nana was nodding his head yes. And then there was a comment today about, I think, a grow-over effect from the onetime revenue in '17 as in -- a large new client comes online. So is the expectation, even including that 2018 Argus, has an outsized organic growth year?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, it is.
Operator: Yes, your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: The first question, just broadly on, I guess, organic revenue growth in '18. Scott, you answered a lot of, I guess, moving pieces and comments. And I think, in insurance, you said 2019 would be bigger than '17. I was wondering if I heard that correctly. Just in the context, Lee, you also walked through -- obviously, second half in line with the long-term organic growth, a range that you'd set out. So I guess, just trying to put those all moving pieces you laid out in front of the call, how should we think of '18 exactly?
Scott Stephenson: Right. So again, this was Tim's question as well. My comment about moderating price increases related only to one part of what we do insurance, and that's industry-standard insurance programs. And I called it out only because it's a line item that we report separately. So you get to see it. It's a relatively immaterial impact. So hopefully, everybody is clear on that. With respect to the sum of everything that we do in insurance, which is both that as well as all the things that we do in DA insurance, we see '18 as a very positive year. And so the only thing you should add to that, with respect to my '19 comment, is there will be even a little more wind in our sails in '19 with respect to the industry standard insurance programs because of the hardening that is taking place in the premium environment in insurance. So we see '18 as a good extension of what you saw in the latter half of '17. And in '19, there's one macro factor that will actually be positive as we go forward from '18.
Lee Shavel: So Manav, just to address some of the comments that I was making, first, the targets that we have set out of 7% to 8% organic revenue growth and the EBITDA expansion beyond that, I think, if you look at the fourth quarter, I think the summary that we offered is that we've achieved those targets even though we continue to have progress to be made at both WoodMac and at Argus. And so that is something that we feel positive about the -- our ability to continue to deliver on those expectations in 2018. And clearly, there is continued upside for us factoring in all of the elements that we discussed.
Manav Patnaik: Got it. And then my second question is just more on these organic investments you are making and sort of the time of phasing in which we should expect some of the results. So obviously, Geomni sounds like you've already seen some of the fruition with the extreme weather activity. But when do we see telematics, connected home, all these other things you talk about, start giving you that return you're expecting?
Scott Stephenson: Right. So let me start here. And Mark, if you care to add anything. Because -- and something that I'd like to just highlight here is that Geomni and telematics both represent a very important theme inside of our business, and that is new types of data that can be pulled in for new forms of decisioning. And one of the things I want to say from the outset is that both of those data types have application in the insurance vertical. They also have application outside of the insurance vertical. So as you think about how we're going to monetize the investments that we're making, I believe what you'll see is -- I believe what we will see is that they will first express themselves mostly in the insurance vertical, but then as we go forward, they will both expand inside of that vertical, but also find ways to grow in other marketplaces. So that's kind of the general story here. So now back to your question then. Yes, we're seeing the fruits of the Geomni investments write down very exciting developments. And so that's really very realtime. We're encouraged by what we see on the IoT front, but it's going to be more of a progressive build in terms of the absolute amount of revenue dollars which are generated by IoT. There are reasons for that, I'll highlight one, Mark, maybe, you'd like to add some others. So we talked about the connected car movement. I feel very, very pleased with the leadership that we're showing in that category. We are the leader in that category. But the rate at the which connected cars grow as a percentage of the total population of cars in the United States, that is a longer-term trend. It will take a while for all of the automakers to essentially have turned over their existing fleets and for all cars to be natively connected. So that's kind of a long -- a big wave, but it's a slow wave or steady wave that is moving through the auto world. The effect of IoT in the home, in some ways, may be a little bit faster, but in some ways a little bit slower because of the value associated with the signal that you take off of a car is, in some ways, may be greater than the value of the signal that you take off of a washing machine or a toaster. And so I think IoT -- we are seeing IoT today. It's building, but I think it's kind of a long -- it will be a longer-term sort of a build. Anything you want to add to that, Mark?
Mark Anquillare: I think it's well said. I mean, I think the vision is that the rating paradigm will shift as to how automobiles and more importantly people are underwritten in the premiums determined. And we hope to have all that information for every vehicle and every person. At the same time, today, it's a little bit about claims, and so it's a little bit about bespoke modeling to help insurers kind of perfect their own internal behavioral scores.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital.
Hamzah Mazari: My first question is just broadly on pricing. I know you mentioned the insurance piece, and it's not significant. But you also mentioned minimizing price increases on cross-selling in WoodMac with some potential in 2019 on pricing. So just broadly speaking, do you guys view pricing as an underappreciated lever for the business as we look long term? Or is it just you have very high market share and pricing is not a huge lever here because of cross-sell?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So let me state this in two ways. Pricing is a part of the progression of our revenue every year, including in 2018. I noted the relative degree to which we're making use of the price mechanism in 2018 in one part of what we do in insurance and in energy. But even in that part of insurance and in energy, our pricing is up year-over-year. So please be sure to note that. And then all I would add to that is, in 2019, I believe that there will be, relative to 2018, yet more opportunity where price is concerned for the reasons that I stated. The insurance environment generally hardening on the one hand and Wood Mackenzie's customers continuing to cycle to evermore strength as the commodity cycle has improved. So '18, there is a price effect. It's relatively in line with what was there in '17. I noted the differences. And in '19, I believe the price effect will be even stronger than it was in '18 -- it will be in '18.
Hamzah Mazari: Very helpful. And just a follow-up question, maybe for Lee on tax reform. Could you remind us -- I know you gave the book tax rate, 21% to 23%. Could you remind us what the cash tax savings impact is in 2018 from tax reform? And in relation to that, you guys are going through a heavy CapEx cycle and that comes down in 2020 or 2022, I guess. Do you pull forward CapEx because of tax reform rules? Just give us a little more detail on tax reform.
Lee Shavel: Sure. Thank you, Hamzah. So the answer to your question on the tax rate, so we would anticipate that the drop in our U.S. tax rate resulting from tax reform will generate approximately an incremental $90 million of additional cash flow in 2018. And with regard to whether that has any impact on our CapEx timing, I think the answer is no, that we view each of those projects as pursuing their natural life and our expectations of investing in them from a business standpoint. So no anticipated change on that front.
Operator: And the next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.
George Tong: You had indicated your overall insurance growth in 2018 should run at a similar pace as the second half of 2017 organically. Given some of the strength in the second half of '17 came from weather-related catastrophe modeling, is the expectation that you'll see incremental strengthening from other areas within insurance?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, that's right. And Mark, I don't know if you want to expand on that.
Mark Anquillare: I think we feel pretty good across all of our businesses. Clearly, we did benefit from the severe weather. It's tough to predict severe weather in the future, so I note your point. But I think we feel like both contract signings, which were strong at the end of 2017. And most of our businesses are deeply engaged with customers and that ultimately pays benefit.
Scott Stephenson: You'll remember that Mark started his comments commenting on the claims side of our business. So for example, there's a lot that is in that, that actually is not related to severe weather impacts. And so as we look at the portfolio of solutions across everything we do in insurance, yes, we do see broad performance on to the rate of organic revenue growth and insurance that you've seen in the second half of '17.
George Tong: Got it. Very helpful. And then secondly, you've obviously made a number of acquisitions in 2017. Can you elaborate on your overall progress in integrating these acquisitions, particularly as it relates to realizing synergies? And when you might expect these acquisitions to be margin-neutral to the company?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, so you're actually asking -- yes. And you're asking two very different questions. So one of them is the integrations are well in hand. You'll remember I commented on sort of the three different categories. So there's the category of integration as it relates to image capture, where we needed to create a national capability out of a set of regional businesses. That is substantially achieved. And I was earlier recounting some of the success we had in the fourth quarter of 2017 in using that capability where it was really put to the test because we had -- third and fourth quarter, where we had to move -- we had to keep our feet moving really quickly to keep up with events. And so I think we've demonstrated that, that integration has really been achieved. At this point, the margin progression of what we do at Geomni is a function of just growing the business. It is -- it's not entirely a fixed-cost business, but substantially a fixed-cost business. So as we grow it, the margins will naturally ripen. The other question that you were asking was about the likely intermediate and longer-term progression of margins at the acquired businesses. With the more mature businesses, for example, Sequel and PowerAdvocate that we talked about before, their margin profiles are already good. They're not at the level of the rest of Verisk, but we would expect, as they grow, they will tend to move in that direction. And then there's a handful of smaller acquisitions that were more in the nature of product organizations, and we don't necessarily hold those to the test that their margins have to reach the absolute level of the rest of what we do across Verisk. But incrementally, the growth in the EBITDAs will be positive.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William Warmington: So a question for you on underwriters and automation. There are a number of tech start-ups looking to accelerate automation in underwriting. They have some catchy names, like Pie Insurance and Lemonade. And how does Verisk interact with these start-ups? Do they collaborate, compete, wait and see?
Lee Shavel: So I'm happy to start there. I think, first of all, you should understand with a lot of these start-ups, from an InsureTech's perspective, there's two types, right. There's some that are risk-bearing entities. And I will tell you, in many cases, as Scott highlighted, they are customers. There's a couple instances where the amount they spend on us was actually more than they actually wrote in premiums. So those are good relationships, and they're very dependent upon us as they want to become very analytic. I think your other question is really around the InsureTech world that is kind of very blossoming now. And we talk frequently, most of the ones that have started to get a little bit of lift or actually have a customer or two are usually at our door. And I think we are very well in tune with that environment and that world. The other thing I'd like to highlight, I think a lot of our customers, and I think we believe ourselves to be kind of, in many cases, the ultimate InsureTech. We do a lot of this. We spend a lot of time on R&D. We have a lot of cutting-edge analytic methods, some in search of application, some with ideas around application, and we share that with customers. And I think that thought leadership is something that is well respected.
William Warmington: So for my second question, congratulations on the Honda win. You have 27% share. I guess, my question is, when do you hit the tipping point for more accelerated adoption?
Lee Shavel: So I'll do that again. Let me try to highlight. I think we have, for the most part, most insurers now focusing on us as a source of that information. What we need to do, and the industry is going to transition over time, is that not all cars -- as a matter of fact, smaller fraction of cars are connected today. So the way we get information about the car and the vehicle and the driving behavior is a combination of the connected car, which I think is going to be very relevant over the next 5 to 10 years, but also through devices. Your phone has a lot of pertinent information. You opt in. This is all obviously opt-in type of service. And with that information, today, insurers are looking to fine-tune and build models to underwrite. But ultimately, I believe that every pricing decision will tap a database of some form, I hope it to be ours, to understand what that driving behavior was over the past 6 months, and rates and pricing and premiums will change. I think that's the way the rating paradigm will shift for insurance, and we think we're well positioned.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.
Alex Kramm: I want to come back to the margin outlook because, quite frankly, I'm still a little bit confused with all the moving pieces. So, Lee, I guess, when you put it all together, the organic expansion, but also kind of the impact of investments and the acquisitions, I mean, where roughly should we be shaking out for the margins? I mean, it sounds like margins should be down overall a little bit. Is it really just a Decision Analytics story? Or is the Risk Assessment also margin decline? So any incremental comment you can give about the magnitude would be helpful.
Lee Shavel: Sure. Thanks, Alex. So the way I would summarize it, Alex, and building off of Scott's comments, is that we expect, in 2018, that, on an organic basis, our EBITDA margins should expand. And that is a combination of kind of the total organic business, meaning the core business and the growth initiatives at Geomni and the chemicals and the subsurface at WoodMac and the others that we've described. And so the function of continuing to target the 7% to 8% organic revenue growth and continued improvement in WoodMac and Argus, we believe, will enable us to achieve that EBITDA growth in excess of overall revenue growth.  As it relates to the acquisition impact, obviously, that's a variable that is more difficult to anticipate, and the overall net effect will end up being a balancing of what we can achieve from an organic standpoint in terms of margin expansion, offset to some extent by the impact of the acquisitions that are coming on. And so we are trying to give more focus around that organic EBITDA margin, so that you can see meaningfully the progression that we're making in the core business. And then over time, what I would emphasize is that all of the acquisitions that we look at, similar to our business, have great operating leverage. And so that we expect that they will contribute to overall EBITDA growth in those businesses in excess of their organic revenue growth. So hopefully, that answers it. I know that probably what you're looking for is what is the net impact on the acquisitions to the whole, but that becomes that net impact between the 2. The important thing that we feel we want folks to focus on is that organic EBITDA margin, which we feel confident, will expand in 2018.
Scott Stephenson: Right. And maybe just to add to that, I write upfront and then Lee also emphasized that we have benefited from the listening tour that Lee has engaged with our investors. And one of the messages that was very clear was that our investors, in general, would like to hear us talk with increased emphasis about organic results, organic revenue growth and organic EBITDA progression. And so you're going to hear that more as a part of our presentation. But we're very excited about the acquisitions also, which are contributing in 2018 to the overall top and bottom line of the company. And we're excited about the contributions they'll make this year and the contributions they'll make in the future. But you're hearing an emphasis on organic because that's what our investors have told us they like us to have.
Lee Shavel: And let me add one thing just to allay any concerns. It's not because we don't want to be focused on the financial returns or the acquisitions in -- as I've talked about with a lot of investors, the focus there has to be, "Are we generating good returns on capital for that component of the business?" Clearly, it has a financial impact overall, but I want to make certain that we build on the disclosure that we provided at Investor Day around the performance of those entities from a capital standpoint in addition to the financial performance. And so I think that will be something that you'll see in 2018, where we'll be working to enhance disclosure around those components. So just wanted to add that point.
Alex Kramm: All right. Looking forward to more disclosures then, I guess. And then secondly, maybe just shifting to WoodMac for a second. I think you gave some commentary at the beginning, Scott, but I think the fourth quarter -- and I think you highlighted it at Investor Day, again, was kind of like the last renewal cycle post kind of cyclical challenges in the energy market. So I think you said it was good renewals. But can you maybe just add a little bit more color if the worse is now behind us, how that last renewal went? And then looking forward, it tells to me like 2018 is still going to be a transition year, but 2019, maybe, we'll get to the point where this can be the fastest-growing business? Or do how you feel about WoodMac, generally speaking?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, thank you. And you got me substantially correctly in terms of the message at Investor Day. Let me tune it for you just a little bit. So there are -- it's typically the case with WoodMac that there are a lot of renewals in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So the quarter we just went through and the quarter we're going through right now always carry a fair amount of meaning in terms of the progression of the subscriptions year-over-year. So you've heard the report about the fourth quarter, which was a positive quarter overall. And we're in the middle of the first quarter, which feels, I would say, substantially the same. There are some larger customers whose renewals are being negotiated right now. So we're moving through that. But you got me substantially correct from Investor Day in terms of as we round out 2017 and into 2018. And I want to emphasize that there are a lot of positive signals at Wood Mackenzie. Lee referenced one that we watch a lot, which is the progression of consulting revenues, which tend to be a leading indicator of our customers' appetite for everything that we can do. And then yes, you also heard me. I think that '19 will be even more removed from the effects of the commodity cycle that we saw in '14, '15, '16 and even into '17. '19 will just be just 1 more year removed from that. And therefore, I do believe that, in addition to all of the new product opportunities and the cross-sell opportunities, I believe that the price mechanism in '19 will be more available to us than it was certainly in the '15, '16, '17 time frame. And we're choosing to be thoughtful about how we use the price mechanism in '18 as well because we want to get these new products sold. We want to enhance the cross-sells.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: I wanted to know what percentage of Verisk insurance revenues are related to reinsurance clients? And how is that segment of insurance revenues doing?
Scott Stephenson: Mark, you want to take that one on?
Mark Anquillare: Yes. So first of all, I think what we did experience, and we highlighted a few times in 2017, the reinsurance premiums, it was a very soft market, meaning reinsurers were under pressure. It was difficult for our customers. What that led to was some industry consolidation against -- across a couple of those more major reinsurers. And when 2 become 1, especially on our cat modeling side of the world, that did lose -- it did cause us to lose some revenue as a result of those mergers. So I'm not sure I have an exact answer for you. I would say that in the ISO, or industry-standard programs, insurers, as well as reinsurers, use it, the reinsurer piece rather modest. So I wouldn't call that material at all. But inside of our cat modeling business, that probably represents a rather substantial minority of the revenue, and that's where we experienced a little of that headwind back in 2011.
Scott Stephenson: When you said -- can I just add, Mark? When you said it's less than 10% of everything we do across insurance.
Mark Anquillare: Across everything, absolutely. I was trying to be a little specific.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
David Ridley-Lane: Sure. Just following up on some of the comments around WoodMac. I wondering if you could give us an update on the annual contract value trends that you saw in the fourth quarter.
Scott Stephenson: And thanks for the question, and that really was our comment before about the progression of the business overall. There is a cumulative effect of contract signings. As you know, WoodMac signs multi-year agreements, but you're seeing the progression in the annual contract values in the reported fourth quarter result, which, as Lee pointed out, is substantially greater than the effect -- the overall outcome for all of 2017. So it has got progression over the course of 2017, and that is because of the effect of the renewals that we're signing in '17. So it's been a positive trend.
David Ridley-Lane: And then at Investor Day, you mentioned, I believe, 8 multi-year agreements signed in the Financial Services segment. You, obviously, had another win -- a credit card win in the fourth quarter. Wondering if those contracts had started to yield revenue in the fourth quarter or if that is all to come in 2018.
Scott Stephenson: Mostly to come in '18.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW.
Arash Soleimani: Just first question is, when you look at improvements in the resolution of satellite imagery, to what extent could that challenge Geomni's aerial imagery offering?
Scott Stephenson: Right. We don't see any material risk of substitution at any intermediate period of time, and it's actually likely that it will never be a substitute. And the reason is that you are able to get a degree of precision in your image when you're imaging an object on the face of the earth from, say, 2,000 feet up as opposed to miles and miles up. Two of the major differences, one is geometric. So what you need to be able to do is to be able to observe three-dimensional structure in 3 dimensions. And to be able to do that, you have to image it both oblique -- orthogonally, but also obliquely. When you're miles and miles and miles away, it is very difficult to get an oblique view of anything. So that's the first point. And the second point has to deal with radiometry. Basically, any signal that you capture, which is a function of looking through the atmosphere, is going to have different properties than if you're not looking through miles and miles and miles of the atmosphere. So now satellites do have one benefit and that is that potentially you can image the same spot on the face of the earth a couple of times a day potentially with satellites. Now it's not as easy as that because you have to actually -- you actually have to change the commands for the satellite to cause it to image something specific, if it wasn't otherwise going to do that, and that's not necessarily inexpensive, but you do have the potential benefit of frequency. So we think there is a role for satellites, in that they can sort of help you with comprehensive global kinds of general laying the foundation of a set of observations. But in terms of the precision that we need to give the answers that we're giving to our customers, we don't see satellites as a substitute.
Mark Anquillare: And maybe just a friendly addition, our solution set includes satellite, aerial, drone, and I'll call it, ground truth, your phones and other type of images. So we are comprehensive in solution.
Arash Soleimani: Okay. Great. And just quick numbers question. I know you mentioned the 21% to 23% tax rate. Should we still be using something slightly different for amortization?
Lee Shavel: I would recommend that you use the 21% for the amortization of intangibles.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: I want to ask the margin question again in a different way. So you mentioned doubling the training budgets and rewarding employees with the tax savings. That sounds to me like it rolls into OpEx, and so that would impact EBITDA. So just want to confirm that organic EBITDA includes these -- this extra spending.
Scott Stephenson: That is correct. It does include those -- these extra categories of spending.
Toni Kaplan: Okay. Great. And then I think, when you answered Hamzah's question earlier, the $90 million of savings, is that all going to be spent on this? Or are there other areas as well?
Scott Stephenson: I'm sorry. What was it?
Lee Shavel: Your question is whether the full $90 million is being spent on the educational opportunities?
Scott Stephenson: No. The way I would put it to you, Toni, is that the very vast majority of the tax benefit is available to our shareholders.
Toni Kaplan: In the form of buybacks?
Scott Stephenson: Well, we'll determine how we're going to deploy capital, but it is free cash flow that is available to invest on behalf of our shareholders, whether it's buybacks or M&A activity.
Lee Shavel: It will be deployed in the same process that we use for the capital we generate internally within the business, which is where do we see the best returns on -- returns for that capital across the range of internal investments, external investments and share repurchases.
Scott Stephenson: Let me try to summarize. I realize everybody is trying to put it all together really quickly. Let me try again. Lee, keep me honest. Our rate of organic revenue growth in the second half of '17 overall was 7-plus percent. We're happy to compete with that as our benchmark for 2018 overall. Full stop. The second statement is, we expect -- and that's an organic revenue statement, that's the first statement. The second statement is, we expect our rate of organic EBITDA growth to exceed our rate of organic revenue growth, and that is with all of those educational and wealth opportunities for our employees built into what we're talking about.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Joseph Foresi: I guess what we're wondering is what do you expect the reported margins to be in 2018, up, down or flat? And it sounded like, by your comments, I guess we're wondering how to start our model and maybe any order of magnitude around those. It sounded like, by your comments, that acquisitions could depend on -- or could determine where they end up. Are we really wondering about the reported margin.
Lee Shavel: Yes. So Joseph, as we've indicated, we are focused on the organic margin. We expect that to expand. The impact of acquisitions is difficult to predict. We aren't making a prediction or a forward-looking statement as to what the reported impact is. We wouldn't anticipate that, that is going to have a material impact on our overall margins, but it's something that we aren't providing any expectations for 2019 on at this point.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. And then you talked a little bit about some contracts that are moving around, and maybe some slowness in FS and energy in the beginning. I'm wondering, could you talk about the cadence of revenues and margins throughout 2018? And do you expect it to be linear? Anything that we should be aware of from contracts rolling on and off? Anything around that nature?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, let me come back to what I said upfront. We have thousands and thousands of subscription agreements, many of them multi-year. The report that I was providing upfront was that, as we look across all of those, virtually 100% of those relationships are remaining intact in 2018, and the vast majority of those relationships are showing year-over-year progression in growth and value. That's what's happening in our business in 2018.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.
David Togut: You've highlighted capital management discipline as the number one point of feedback from your top investors post your listening tour. Could you expand upon that a little bit in terms of how you expect capital allocation priorities to change going forward? Historically, they've been very focused on buyback and acquisitions. Are you going to toggle more toward buyback going forward?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So thank you for noting what has been our practice, which is we've always been very comfortable with return -- and we lean into returning capital to shareholders, and we've also found the program of acquisition to be very productive over time. Hopefully, everybody had a chance to see our presentation at the most recent Investor Day, where you saw that, for both the largest deals that we've done over a 10-plus-year time period but also the small and medium ones that we've done, the rate of return on both of those has been in double digits, somewhat higher for, actually, the larger deals. But that whole program has been very productive for our shareholders. So we remain alert to the opportunities. At any given moment, we're going to take account of what are the conditions in the market. What is there that when you put it together with Verisk you actually get something special, which is different? Hopefully, you caught the reference in my remarks earlier to the fact that you put PowerAdvocate together with Wood Mackenzie, and you have a significant sale that would not have happened if we had not put those two companies together. So that's the logic behind the M&A program. But of course, we're also going to reference what are prices in the market. And we're going to be thoughtful about ultimately what is the rate of return that we expect for the capital that we invest? And so it's not -- so I think what you can expect from Verisk over long periods of time is a balanced approach, where I believe that it will be the case that it will make sense to return capital and it will make sense to deploy capital thoughtfully in the M&A program. And at any given moment, the balance will be a function of the real-time conditions. I -- hopefully, you've heard Lee say that we definitely expect to be returning capital to shareholders in 2018.
David Togut: Understood. As a follow-up, could you update us on your joint venture with Total System Services, Argus and TSYS? And any extent and more broadly of Argus' business in the card issuer processing market in terms of joint ventures in particular?
Scott Stephenson: Right. So first of all, we're very pleased with where the TSYS relationship stand, and it is fully on course, exactly what we expected when the relationship was put together last year. And you're right. There are other processors out there in the world. And as you would imagine, we're in dialogue with them. And actually, we have not sort of named all the folks with whom we work even today. So that is a -- there are several companies in that category. We talked about TSYS because it was a large event. They're not the only company with whom we work today in that category. And we are definitely in pursuit of additional relationships in that category.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC.
Gary Bisbee: Let me -- I hate to do this, but I need to go back to the margins. So I think we all appreciate the focus on organic, but of course, we model to all-in, including the deals. And I guess I struggle to understand why it's so difficult to project the acquisition. So if we look at the Decision Analytics, nearly 300 basis point margin decline in 2017 and a lot larger decline in Q4, specifically. Can you break out for us, looking backwards, how much of that was deal costs and short-term integration payments that maybe somewhat less likely to recur versus just dilution from bringing on revenue that had an initial lower margin attached to it that will likely persist until you annualize these? And a second part of the question is, how material -- maybe the answer is it's not, but the actual integration spending that you're doing, as you've discussed, a key to a lot of these deals is linking them into your existing systems and offering.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Thank you for the question. Let me take the second part of that and then bump it over to Lee. Integration costs are really not material. And this is an enduring statement about Verisk. And the reason is, if you think about the nature of the integration that needs to be achieved, back to kind of the three buckets that I gave you upfront, when you're talking about product organizations, companies that have unique products that are now a part of Verisk, there are two ways that we link them to us. One of them is getting them on our sales platform, and that integration cost is about nothing. And then the other form of integration is, if and when we integrate the solution, so we have a preexisting encoded solution and the acquired company has an encoded solution, and now you're going to find a way to blend code in order to present a new integrated solution into the marketplace. And those are moment in time. Generally, those will be accomplished relatively quickly. And in many ways, you're leveraging the development budgets you've all ready got. It's now you're just thinking a different set of developments because you've now got this bigger code base and you have to bring it all together. So the literal integration is not so great. There's a different part of your question, and here now, I'll turn it over to Lee for his comment, but yes, there are deal costs, for sure. And so when you do deals in the moment, there's all the lawyers and et cetera that have to get paid in order to bring the thing together. So there are definitely deal costs, but the literal tying together of Verisk and the company that we just bought, in an operational sense, generally is not material.
Lee Shavel: And so Gary, I think the thing that factors into this is all of the integration upfront costs that we're dealing with that tend to be onetime in nature are an element of this, but there are also two other elements. One is, generally, these are earlier-stage companies, and so they have ability to predict immediately in the near term that -- their immediate performance as we're going through that integration as well as across the number of acquisitions that we have. I think it creates noise that we would suggest is not as relevant to our overall organic performance. And we'd like to focus on that as opposed to trying to predict what that relatively small impact is of those acquisitions. We -- as I indicated, we think that the overall focus should be on the capital efficiency and the returns from that business, and then what they will be able to ultimately contribute on an organic basis when they get folded into the business. So happy to talk more about that with you separately.
Gary Bisbee: Yes, I mean, I think the issue, as you probably heard in your tour, is you have a business that's so heavily subscription, people believe you should have extreme visibility relative to a lot of other companies. And the reality of it is, it's been extremely difficult to predict your quarter-to-quarter financial performance. This kind of inability to really be helpful on the forward-looking numbers, I think, it's a big reason why. But I'm sure you've heard that, and I'm sure you're thinking about ways to improve it. So I appreciate the color.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Silber: I know it's late. I've got one quick question. What should we be modeling for interest expense in 2018?
Lee Shavel: Yes. So Jeff, we've specifically not provided guidance around that. I don't think it's going to move materially. But as we're thinking about debt levels and our target aside, I just didn't want to set a specific expectation. I think you can look at the balances and at the rate historically, I don't think it will vary significantly.
Jeffrey Silber: And I guess, the lever from the PowerAdvocate acquisition, that's really -- is that on the balance sheet at the end of the year? Or is that not been on the balance sheet yet?
Lee Shavel: No, it is on the balance sheet. We funded that substantially with debt.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey: You've talked about a lot of newer, I would say, growth drivers relative to Verisk's historical businesses. I haven't heard a mention of cyber. And I wonder how you think about cyber risk? And whether there are some organic opportunities to grow in cyber or whether M&A is something you're looking at?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Thanks for the question, and I'll start -- and Mark, if you want to jump in. Cyber is very definitely a part of what we do today. Those of you who are familiar with the P&C insurance industry may be aware that sort of, interestingly, the cyber line -- for all the talk about cyber risk, et cetera, in the world, the cyber line is actually not that highly expressed so far. It's actually -- it's a relatively modest line of insurance. It gets a lot more discussion than it actually gets premium dollars at the moment. We expect cyber will continue to grow as a line, and we already provide modeling of the cyber line, and we have customers for those models. So we're engaged. We're already in that. The 2 interesting questions for us, and Mark, maybe, please feel free to jump in here. Interesting question number one is, how rapidly will the cyber line grow as an insurance offering? But then number two, all the other things that we could potentially do to help operating companies with cyber exposures even beyond helping to manage the insurance policies. So I don't know. Mark, do you want to add anything to that?
Mark Anquillare: So we have been kind of the industry standard as it relates to the coverage language in those policies. And I think we have a lot of customers we highlighted at the Investor Day, where I think the more promising future growth is going to be is inside of the models. As people try to grow, and for the most part, underwrite some of that cyber, some of the models, which we historically called cat models, are now being used for, what I'll refer to as, more of the liability side. And cyber is very prominent there. We've made some great progress in working inside of the folks in the London market as well inside of the United States insurers. And that will be a growth driver for us. I would tell you that it's probably more marginal in '18, but it will and should kick up in the future years.
Scott Stephenson: Okay. Well, I think we're at the end of the questions. Thank you all very much for enjoying us -- joining us. And we've enjoyed the conversation, look forward to being with you again to report out the next quarter. And Lee will be doing a lot of follow-up with many, many of you. So let's continue to have a dialogue, and thank you very much for your time today.
Lee Shavel: Thank you very much.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's EVP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.
David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Ivy, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for discussion of our third quarter 2017 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures, which we will reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, David. Good morning, all. Reported revenue grew 10% for the quarter, organic constant currency growth was 7%. We're pleased to have delivered faster organic growth in the third quarter than we saw in the first half of the year as expected. We remain on track for an acceleration in the second half versus the first half. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of almost 50%. We're excited about the addressable markets we serve, our initiatives to create new solutions, and the opportunities to help our customers with decision-making. Combined insurance organic growth was 9% and excluding the demand due to extreme weather was about 7%. The team continues to do an outstanding job serving our customers and driving growth. Mark will talk about some of the extraordinary effort by our teams to support our customers in responding to the recent hurricanes. At WoodMac, revenue growth continues to improve as the end market has stabilized. The team there is also doing an excellent job, evidenced in part by the 5% plus growth in subscription ACV year-to-date. WoodMac is expanding their addressable markets and we will demo some of their newer products at our upcoming Investor Day. We're very pleased to report a new Argus partnership with TSYS as announced by their CEO on their recent investor call. This partnership will allow us to bring a new range of data management and analytical solutions to new banks and markets that are incremental to our core base. This initiative, as well as other positive developments at Argus, position it to return to solid organic growth in Q4 as expected and continue to contribute good and accelerating organic growth in 2018. On the capital allocation front, we have been active in M&A throughout 2017 and especially in the third quarter. Many of the acquisitions are companies we have been tracking for years, and the timing is mostly a function of the availability of the targets. While the timing has been brisk, the integrations have been smooth and quick, given the nature of our purchases. Our acquisitions in 2017 fall into three groups. The first group consists of small product sets with promising characteristics that fall into our existing verticals. The names here are Arium, ENI, Healix, Fintellix and MAKE. Collectively we paid $94 million for these product sets with run rate revenue at the time of the acquisitions of around $23 million. Arium provides liability loss modeling that runs parallel to AIR's property loss modeling. ENI helps insurers determine damage amounts to automobiles for quick claim settlements and Helix is the leading provider of travel insurance analytics in Europe. Fintellix is a global leader in compliance solutions for banks and seamlessly relates to our transaction-level data integration at Argus, while bringing new functionality to our client banks and MAKE is the global leader in wind generation analytics, integrating seamlessly with our solar generation analytics. In all cases, we have quickly brought these products into our existing channels of distribution with the expectation that all of these product sets will grow at double-digits for an extended time and with ramping margins. When we add such products to our platform they immediately gain profile and credibility in the market. The second group was our acquisition of seven regional remote imaging companies in the United States. We paid $31 million for these companies whose 2016 revenues were $15 million as we noted last quarter. Integration of these companies has been smooth and straightforward, led by our Geomni team which includes experts who have operated image capture operations for decades. Their expertise brought real value to customers in the latest storm season. Lastly, we bought three larger companies in the third quarter, all leaders in their categories. We purchased Sequel, which provides solutions related to complex commercial insurance with a particular focus on the Lloyd's London market as well as LCI and G2 Web Services, both of which provide distinct solutions for the retail banking world and both of which leverage Argus' distribution as well as enhancing products through overlapping capabilities. Collectively we paid $583 million for these businesses, whose run rate revenue at the time of the acquisitions was about $78 million. Mark will say more about them in a moment but in all three cases we expect them to bring strong double-digit growth with ramping margins. We will provide further detail on these businesses including their solutions, markets, and economics at our upcoming Investor Day in December. While M&A remains our priority for use of free cash, we also repurchased our shares in the quarter through our longstanding program. Year-to-date through September 30, we have repurchased $270 million worth of stock including $10 million in the third quarter. At September 30, 2017, we had $366 million remaining under our share purchase reauthorization (sic) [share repurchase authorization] (06:49). Our strong cash generating capability will bring down our leverage even assuming further capital deployment. We remain confident in the strategy built on the Verisk distinctives of one, unique data assets, two, deep domain expertise, three, first to market innovations and four, deep integration into our customer workflows. As you know, with the distinctives come network effects, scale economies and a large percentage of subscription revenue. From this foundation we are focused on executing on our plans which include ongoing innovation and serving our customers. As we look ahead we have a constructive view for all of our businesses. And with that I'll turn it over to Mark for some additional comments.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Following up on Scott's comments regarding the three August acquisitions, Sequel is a leading insurance and reinsurance software specialist serving the London market. The acquisition further expands our comprehensive insurance offerings to the global complex commercial and specialty insurance industry with worldwide premiums larger than the U.S. regulated market we primarily serve today. Sequel is a pioneer in complex commercial and specialty insurance software innovation with a diverse customer base that includes some of the world's largest specialty insurance players. LCI is an industry-leading provider of risk insight, prediction and bankruptcy management solutions for banks and creditors. We're also confident that the LCI solutions are applicable beyond the banks to other companies that need to monitor consumer bankruptcy processes. The combination of Argus and LCI will allow us to introduce new and exciting range of insights, proprietary decisioning algorithms, and state-of-the-art risk management work flow solution aimed at addressing a growing need among our banking clients. G2 is an industry-leading provider of merchant risk intelligence solutions for acquirers, commercial banks and other payment system providers. G2 extends Argus' capabilities to mapping bad-actor networks, predicting payment risks and providing clients with the best opportunity to reduce losses and fines due to merchant and business fraud and compliance violations. Fighting fraud is an important theme for Verisk as you know, and G2 complements our existing capabilities nicely. Growth in insurance continued to improve, primarily on the strength of our solutions in customer relationships with some help from the weather. Engagement with our customers is a strong and ongoing focus across our insurance-facing businesses. Last month, for example, we had our now annual U.S. Risk and Analytics Summit. We saw record attendance in terms of companies represented and number of attendees. We also had demonstrations of some of our newer and cutting edge solutions. Feedback was very encouraging with attendees citing engaging and well-informed speakers, the examples of benefits from forward-looking companies and thought provoking panels. As you know, after an unusually long period of relative calm we have seen a surge in catastrophes over the past few months. Our property claims services or PCS business is the industry standard for catastrophe event designation and insured loss estimation in the U.S., Canada and Turkey. In one of the most active periods on record, PCS has designated 50 events so far across three risk areas with insured loss estimates still developing but likely to exceed $70 billion. In addition to the major hurricanes in the United States, PCS provided insured loss estimates on two cyber risk loss events following the launch of PCS Global Cyber in September. Cyber is the latest addition to the growing PCS Global specialty lines loss reporting platform following the PCS Global Marine and Energy launch earlier this year. Our catastrophe modeling business which serves insurers, reinsurers and insurance brokers has proactively provided more than 30 loss estimates since September 1 and real-time alerts for customers on 13 catastrophes happening around the world. With particular note to the hurricanes, AIR clients use the information we provided to assess the potential losses as the events were unfolding and in some cases to proactively deploy claims adjusters or to notify policy holders. As a reminder, since the customers subscribe to AIR solutions there isn't a real-time revenue benefit. Client feedback has been positive as our teams have worked in some cases around the clock to give these reports to the market on a timely basis. We continue to speak with clients on their actual loss experience and plan to continue these dialogues over the coming months as the claims unfold. In our repair cost estimating imagery business, volumes increased meaningfully as a result of catastrophes. At Xactware, volumes were nearly double for the quarter versus the prior-year period. As a reminder, many of our contracts are based on minimum volumes, so this volume increase isn't a direct proxy for revenue growth, it does highlight deep more full (11:50) integration and the value we provide to our customers. One of our newer solutions, Claim Experience, proved to be a very helpful tool for our customers as they served their insurance. Claim Experience allows our customers' customers to capture images and information from which we are able to generate repair cost estimates. As the industry focus on customer service and response times, this new solution is generating a lot of incremental interest. Geomni, our remote imagery business, which we took to a new level of capability in the second quarter, was able to assist our customers with our cutting edge technology. We were flying and capturing images 48 hours after Harvey in Texas and as soon as the FAA lifted flight restrictions in Florida. These images, in combination with our computer vision algorithms, automate the repair cost estimate processing, allowing, for example, one of the largest insurers in the United States to start paying out claims before their customers could even get back into their homes. We are proud of having been able to help our customers deliver such outstanding service and speed of response at such a critical time for homeowners. With that, let me turn it over to Eva, to cover our financial results in more detail.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. In the third quarter we again grew revenue and EBITDA while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Growth improved again, consistent with our comments on the last two earnings calls. Revenue in the quarter grew 10.2%; organic constant currency revenue grew 7%. The press release again has a table to help you see the acquisition and currency effect for each of our revenue lines. As a reminder, organic constant currency growth excludes the contribution from recent acquisitions and reflects current period exchange rates applied to prior period revenue. Currency helped revenue results in the quarter by about $2 million. And total acquired revenue in the quarter from all deals that haven't moved into organic was $19 million, including partial period contributions from G2, Sequel and LCI. Revenue from the three August acquisitions contributed $7.6 million in the quarter. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue increased 12.2%. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 8.2%. Decision Analytics insurance revenue increased 16.9% in the third quarter and organic constant currency revenue growth was 13.7%. Growth was led by very strong performance in loss quantification and remote imagery with good growth in underwriting, catastrophe modeling solutions and claims analytics. The hurricane- related repair cost estimating and imagery-based solution contributed about $8 million in the quarter for Decision Analytics insurance. Energy and specialized markets revenue increased 2.1%. Organic constant currency revenue increased 2.2%. On an organic constant currency basis, Wood Mackenzie revenue grew about 3.3%. We are pleased to see the trends in our subscription business continuing to be positive, complemented by good consulting revenue. The customer environment remains stable and while we continue to finalize certain renewals in 2017 and early 2018, we see an encouraging business trajectory. Financial Services revenue increased 20.2%. Organic constant currency revenue declined 2% in the quarter. As we've discussed on prior calls, we had several contracts conclude last year which contributed about $11 million in 2016. We continue to expect to see organic revenue growth in fourth quarter. Risk Assessment revenue grew 6.9% including contributions from our recent acquisitions which are expanding the baseline for future growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 4.9%, reflecting our 2017 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions. Total EBITDA increased 7.5% to $272 million. The combined cost of revenue and SG&A increased 4.9% for the quarter and 3.5% year-to-date on an organic basis as we continue to focus on efficiency in our existing businesses and re-purposing that spend to fund innovation. Acquisitions added to the expenses in the quarter and for the year. EBITDA margins as reported were 49.6%. Margins were reduced by about 230 basis points due to acquisitions and the related fees, an effect that we expect to continue through the year. The acquisitions we are making are close to the core with well-defined paths to top line growth and margin expansion. Reported interest expense was $30 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.9 billion at September 30, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 2.9 times. Our strong capital structure is an asset as we continue to explore opportunities to drive growth. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.2%. Our tax provision in the quarter of $60 million represented an increase of 34% over 3Q 2016 where the tax rate included some one-time benefits. This was a meaningful reason for the adjusted net income growth to be down 2.3% to $141 million and adjusted EPS to be unchanged from the prior period at $0.84. Normalizing for the $2.4 million of tax, based on applying the third quarter 2017 tax rate to 2016, adjusted EPS growth would have been about 9%. Average diluted share count was 168 million in the quarter. We bought about 100,000 shares at an average price of $81.85. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. On September 30, 2017, our diluted share count was 167.8 million shares. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $592 million for the nine months ended September 30, an increase of 22.2% versus 2016. Capital expenditures were $114 million for the nine-month period ended September 30 and CapEx was 7.2% of revenue year-to-date including investments supporting our remote imagery business. Free cash flow increased 27.5% to $478 million for the nine month period ended September. Free cash flow was 61.9% of EBITDA year-to-date. Across the three August acquisitions, in U.S. dollars and reflecting purchase accounting revenue haircut at Sequel, revenue in the fourth quarter should be around $17 million and EBITDA should be about $5 million. As you think about your models for 2017, we expect CapEx of about $185 million. CapEx will normalize to about 6% of revenue by 2021 after the initial remote imagery investments in 2017 and 2018, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of $135 million and amortization of intangibles of about $105 million. Based on our current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to be around $119 million for the year. This includes non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. We expect the full-year tax rate to be around 33% or possibly a little bit higher. You will note that this implies a higher tax rate in the fourth quarter as we assume a retroactive UK tax law change will take effect. In the adjusted net income calculation we will continue to use 26% for the tax effect on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 168 million to 169 million shares. We're pleased with the continuing overall improvement in revenue growth we have discussed all year. We think the opportunities for revenue growth, free cash flow generation, and prudent capital deployment remain as strong as ever. We have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. First, just wanted to ask on the insurance vertical, excluding the hurricanes, the 7% growth. Is that – can you talk about what I guess, drove the acceleration in that underlying growth versus kind of 5%, 6% we had been seeing? And is that sustainable? I know you also mentioned some cyber events, I don't know if that drove kind of short-term revenue, but just talk a little bit about the sustainability of that pace of growth in insurance.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes, so in reverse order, Tim, cyber didn't really contribute a lot. Think of it as a new extension of a product set that we've always had. Cyber insurance is a real thing. On the other hand, it's a fairly small line relative to the others. And most of what we do, pricing – or our revenue is going to relate to the premiums, and the premium in cyber insurance remains fairly small. I think the way to interpret the third quarter relative to, say, the earlier part of the year is the anomaly was more the early part of the year, where you'll remember we described some one-time effects with respect to nonrecurring revenue in 2016 that didn't recur in 2017, for example. So I think what you're seeing now is more kind of our normal expectation for the insurance vertical. And other than the effects of the catastrophes, there's really not anything to point at that would sort of stand out as a unique factor in the quarter that was contributing to the revenue, so we kind of feel like what we're seeing here is over time the kind of insurance-facing business that we've got.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And on the catastrophes, does any of that carry over into the fourth quarter in terms of impact on claims and kind of a short-term boost?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, not a lot. Basically, as you would imagine, our customers are very motivated to deal with catastrophe-oriented claims very quickly and so they do actually tend to get dealt with within days of when the events actually occur, so no, not very much of that.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. On Argus, can you just help us understand, obviously there's a big improvement in the trend there in the second half. As these new customers come online or the new partnerships come online, is there a meaningful one-time revenue contribution to the second half or is this more an increase in the subscription base?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: It's both. So I think we've described for you before, that there's an interesting quality to the nature of the business related to taking all of the spend analytics we've got and pointing them towards new use cases, for example, looking at media effectiveness. And that is that there is a one-time bit of work that needs to be done to essentially integrate our platform with our customer or partner's platform and there is revenue associated with that integration. We get paid for that, but then what happens thereafter is a sustaining set of subscription revenues. So it's really at both ends. So yes, there will be moment in time effects associated with bringing on a substantial new customer and many of the customers we bring on are substantial, but at the same time, there is an enduring and meaningful tail of subscription revenue.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: But I guess the question I'm trying to get at is, is the on boarding revenue going to create grow-over effects for 2018 that result in Argus growing below trend or is – I mean, you're not quantifying it or calling it out on the call. Is it there but not material enough to have a big impact?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: It's not – I mean, it is there and it's a dynamic business where we are adding customers, so there will be an effect in there, but relative to the overall performance of the business I would say not particularly material. And definitely, we need the business to continue to grow but there will be something in there but not...
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. And then if I could just sneak one more in. On the M&A program, obviously you continue to lean into it and see it as a source of potential value add for your shareholders. I think there's some more skepticism from some of your shareholders on the M&A program. Can you just maybe talk about how the board assesses capital allocation in terms of their review of management and your compensation programs? Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. I think you actually asked two questions in there, so we bring the program of acquisitions to the board. We go in depth through every opportunity. The effect of the board discussions is not always to affirm what it is that management has been working on, so the board is exercising discretion. With respect to, I think you were then trying to relate that to how the board interacts with us, maybe particularly me, and compensation, and the board pays me according to their view of our performance and their primary view of our performance is how do we do for our shareholders?
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Scott.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify, Scott, to the first question I think that it was the $8 million hurricane impact that you were referring to that does not repeat beyond the quarter and I was hoping of that $8 million, I guess how much would you attribute to the remote imagery aspect of it and just curious why that wasn't an inorganic number just because I understand that it was all the assets that you acquired that allowed you to go do that post hurricane activity?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. So, first of all, yes. You heard me correctly. The $8 million is not particularly bleeding into the fourth quarter, so period, end of sentence. Most of that $8 million is related to solution sets that we've had for some time and not the remote imagery activity, and it's very straightforward on the classification of the revenues. The businesses that we acquired did not do anything in the insurance vertical. We acquired infrastructure. But in terms of actually causing business in the insurance vertical, that was entirely Verisk and existing Verisk.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just on WoodMac, I mean, it sounded like there was some positive developments, new products you're going to show at the Investor Day and so forth, I guess, my question is more tied to two-and-a-half years in, I was hoping you'd give us some commentary on how the sort of revenue synergies between WoodMac and insurance and so forth might be tracking?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. One of the things that you'll see at Investor Day is a synthesis of our energy data analytics and our insurance data analytics, a very exciting new product. It's really kind of in the early stages, so it's not material, where the revenue is concerned right now, but we are really, really excited about it. It's called EPICS (28:46), and you'll get a chance to see that.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot, guys.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just on pricing. Could you give us a sense or just an update on whether there's an opportunity to price your book of business? I know you were owned by the insurance companies and it seems like pricing is still pretty low relative to your market share and maybe just give us some color how you think about that.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. Well, the pricing for us is really a proxy for the distinctiveness of our solutions and the amount of value that we're bringing to our customers. Across everything that we do, there would be a pricing effect which relates to the strength of what it is that we do. There are some parts of our business where the pricing effect is a little bit stronger; for example, our very long-standing industry standard insurance programs. And then, other parts where it would probably be a little bit less strong, because we're more on a transaction basis in our pricing. But there is a price effect everywhere, and that's really no different than it's ever been. I would only – with respect to price, I would just add that we're in it for the long haul. We are making grounded decisions about how to price our solutions, because we really care about our relationships with our customers and we want them to endure and a lot of our growth opportunity is to bring new solutions, new value to our existing customers. So we feel a great burden to be responsible with how we price our products.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And just a follow-up question. Outside of the P&C insurance universe, maybe just give us a flavor of what your exposure is to auto and personal insurance and whether you see any headwinds in that business, either from autonomous homes or vehicles. Just any sense of how you think about the world outside of P&C and whether that's a growth avenue for you or not really. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, as I think most folks know, we principally serve three vertical markets, which would be P&C insurance, retail banking and its extensions, including into retail and media effectiveness analytics, and then the whole energy complex and natural resources. And the other two parts of the business, meaning the non-P&C parts, we're very excited about them going forward. We believe both of them have sustained very strong revenue growth opportunities. I think you were trying to ask also about the effect of kind of like personal lines and the way that automobiles are changing and with autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles, et cetera. We actually see that as an opportunity. We actually, we believe, are the leaders in the United States in harvesting data off of connected cars. We've announced partnerships and we'll have more to announce in the future. And so it's new data basically that we can pull into our analytic methods, so we view it as an opportunity.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW. Your line is open.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to know if you could provide some more detail on the aerial imagery opportunities outside of insurance. I know you mentioned insurance was a $200 million addressable market and perhaps how large the addressable market is outside the insurance sector?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes, the TAM for all of the applications outside of the insurance vertical are about an order of magnitude bigger than the insurance vertical. So we talk about the insurance vertical as something, (32:58) that's sort of our home base, that's where we started from but actually, extensions into other vertical markets are going to be important to us (33:11). There is a lot of background noise. Maybe somebody's phone is unmuted (33:15).
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: The second question (33:20) I had was, could you just provide a bit more detail about what Sequel does and does that get rolled up into Decision Analytics?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes, hi. This is Mark. Let me just provide you a little bit of insight. One, the suite of solutions that Sequel provides is really behind the scenes of all of the major carriers in London, so a little bit of a nuanced market in London and they have a captured march (33:47) there to do everything from what would be the analytics upfront from an underwriting perspective, to policy admin (33:54), to claims, even inside the reinsurance world and they have a wonderful tool that provides visual representation and a good VI to versus (34:07). So there's an analytic aspect as well (34:08). What we are going to do is we're going to invest in the VA (34:11) insurance side of things, and we think there's great opportunities to use some of those solutions to bring to maybe some of our U.S. customers on the analytic back end, which would be that visual geographic approach to things as well as the front end which is the underwriting. We also hope we can kind of supercharge some of their analytics insights inside the (34:36) solution set. So we're very excited by it. Customers are very pleased and we've gotten some very good feedback from the market in general. So we're optimistic about what we can do with Sequel.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Yes. Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC: Thanks. Good morning. Could you comment a bit on Argus' new contract with TSYS? This looks very intriguing and in particular, I'm wondering if there's any exclusivity here that might preclude you from working with other large card issuer processors like a First Data, a Fiserv, an FIS?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No exclusivity, and in fact one of the reasons why folks like TSYS like to partner with us is because of the richness and depth of our ecosystem which creates a data asset that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world and actually, as the next partner comes in, the ecosystem gets better, so the network effect is there and the last one to come in knows that and the next one to come in knows that. So no, there's no exclusivity and it basically is a way of extending – first of all as I say, it improves the data asset but in addition to that, it actually creates yet more reach into specific banks that would be a part of TSYS's ecosystem. We're very pleased by the partnership, very excited about it.
David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC: And just as a quick follow-up, is there any way to dimension the size of this contract with TSYS and potentially the size of this new market opportunity for Argus?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, we don't really put out the numbers around individual customer relationships. If you wanted to sort of do some work on that, you could sort of figure out what is TSYS's share of the processing world and try to relate that to the size of the business we are already.
David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC: Understood. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee from RBC. Your line is open.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yes. Thanks. Just wanted to add another question on the Sequel purchase. My sense of your foray into the UK is that you bought a bunch of interesting but yet somewhat disparate assets in the past and haven't really completely integrated it all. I wonder, given the relationships there, is this an opportunity to go to market with a more consolidated or integrated approach and solution? And then as part of that, what's the opportunity to take analytics and things you offer here, layer that in, and drive a more meaningful revenue base from the existing customers that that business has? Or is that not really an opportunity for some reason? Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, let me start with your last question, then Mark, maybe you'd like to talk a little bit more about Sequel. I just want to interact with the premise of your question, which is the smaller acquisitions earlier in 2017 not being integrated, that's just not accurate. So just to set the record straight on that. But yeah, with respect to how we see the business growing globally, you can create your data analytics method pretty much anywhere. What you need to do is to make it relevant for the local market, first, by having local data sets, and second, doing whatever customization you have to do to speak into that market in exactly the way that it wants to be spoken to. So that is our view of how to grow our business, and yes, there are things that we do at Verisk today that will complement Sequel nicely. I'll mention, for example, our Touchstone platform on the catastrophe modeling side, and then you've got these accumulation tools on the Sequel side, and they really play together very nicely. So that work is already underway. But, Mark, do you want to kind of pick it up from there?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, I think the other thing I'd like to highlight is there are some acquisitions, but I think this program of looking to go global is a combination of build and buy. We've been spending a lot of time and energy putting a management team in place, putting business development/sales resources that cover the world, and specifically in kind of the UK, we've done quite a bit of work with Lloyd's, we've done a lot of work with a lot of syndicates. We are building up some actual expertise. So we are trying to take a lot of the things we do here in the United States maybe around property, around actuarial (39:25) work, bring it to the UK. And maybe an example of this is one of the earlier acquisitions was in Ireland. It provided some underwriting information. Today, we have significantly grown and brought that to market a fuller-blown, I'll call it ISO-type of loss costs beyond just traditional rating variables. So we've kind of put the Verisk way into Ireland. We're trying to move that type of thinking, that type of approach, augmenting acquisitions along the way to build a platform that's substantial in the UK and beyond into Europe. So that's clearly our strategy, and I think you'll see more of that as we progress in the coming years.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Great. And then the follow-up, there were a series of articles after the hurricanes about insurers using their own drones to go take pictures and assess damage and reduce the dependence on people in the adjuster role. I guess is that just a good story that was easy to tell coming out of that, or is there some potential risk to, whether it's your aerial imagery or some of the other solutions from insurers beginning to do some of this stuff a bit more on their own? Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, so the way that the imagery ecosystem works is first of all, you need to avail yourself as an insurer or an independent adjuster or an insured, of the ability to understand the asset and how it's changed. So one of the things that matters is your understanding of the asset before the event, before the damage, and so one of the things that is necessary is sort of a view of truth, which is what is there before the damage occurs? And that has to be developed both precisely in terms of the quality of the images, but also efficiently for cost reasons. You cannot do that with a drone. And actually, you can't do that with a satellite either. What you need is aerial imagery. That is the way to create the single view of truth in terms of what is on the ground. And that we do not see changing. So that is fundamental and foundational. What you do hear from some of the carriers is that in the wake of an event, if an adjuster can get to the building, because remember, the radius in which you can fly a drone is very limited, then one of the ways that you can assess the property in addition to visually inspecting it as a human being, is to operate a drone. And some of the companies have begun to do that. So they literally would have some of their adjusters driving around with a small drone in their trunk. It's really kind of a technical augmentation of what an adjuster has always done, which is to try to get close to the property and understand what happened to it. It really does not represent very much change. The adjusters may find that using the drone, they can do their work a little bit faster, they can maybe be a little bit more precise, they can drive better images and we're all for it actually. We are able to provide a turnkey drone solution to our customers as well and actually, one where the homeowner is actually sort of operating – if they have access to a drone, they can actually direct and capture the images and get those back to us. So that development is a good one. It's not an overwhelming one. It hasn't really changed the nature of the claims process, maybe into the future it will have somewhat more effect, but the fundamental point is if you're going to do these analytics at scale, you're not going to do them with drones.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thank you. That's helpful.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Morning, Bill.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Morning.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So a question for you on the EBITDA margins. The guidance had been that the second half margins were going to be flat with Q2 and Q3 had come in 100 basis points ahead of that. I understand we've had the extreme weather benefit. I just wanted to ask how we should think about margins heading into Q4 and into 2018.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. Thanks, Bill. Well, I think you hit the nail on the head when you talked about the margin in the quarter and certainly one of the benefits of our business model is we have nice incremental margins and certainly, we saw some of that in terms of the storm benefit. We also had the impact on our margins that we've discussed which is around the acquisitions. So those will be a little bit of a pulldown on the margins as we think about sort of the fourth quarter. We have brought in the new acquisitions. We gave you some very specific numbers around how much those will contribute in the fourth quarter, that's sort of call it roughly a 30% margin based on what we've said. Those margins will scale over time, but I think as you kind of put that all together, I would say that we did have an outperformance versus expectation in margins in the third quarter because of some of the storm benefit. So I would – as you think about your model for the fourth quarter, I would put those other factors back in and certainly we look to drive margins, but there will be probably more of a pulldown, than a pullup in fourth quarter.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And a quick follow up if I may. A housekeeping question on the revenue impact from the extreme weather. You mentioned the $8 million and having it giving a couple point benefit to the insurance piece. I just want to make sure my math is right. If the constant currency organic for the third quarter was 7.0%, it looked like 160 basis points coming from that, the extreme weather benefit, so that would mean about 5.4% versus the 4.1% in Q2. Is that about right?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You are spot on, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: All right. And then the context there is should we think that – should we expect Q4 to be – the organic growth to be higher versus that 5.4% normalized level?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. So as you know, Bill, we don't get into specific quarterly guidance throughout the year, we do express (46:16) in terms of our growth rates and I think you've seen that so far.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Well excellent. Thank you very much.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Bill.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. I wanted to jump back into aerial imaging revenues in the organic for DA insurance. If it wasn't for the hurricane effect, would aerial imaging be moving the revenue needle in the third quarter and then because I thought it's still kind of nascent business? And then the second part of my question is you indicated aerial imaging acquisitions added $15 million of revenues. Could you give us a sense of how big your Geomni revenues in total are right now including your prior internally-built base?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think both those questions are aimed at the same point, Andrew, and I'll just say that the Geomni business in the insurance vertical is growing and would have grown even absent the effect of the extreme weather, and growing very, very nicely. So there was a boost in the quarter as I said before of that $8 million, most of it was not attributable to Geomni, but pre-existing Verisk solutions. So Geomni is growing nicely. It's sort of getting to a scale where we can almost begin to not call it nascent anymore, even though we're still early in the journey. But it is growing, and would have grown, and would have grown nicely in the third quarter even absent the extreme weather effect.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Maybe this actually relates to the prior question, and I've asked this before, but when I look at your Q and the disclosures there about subscription and non-subscription, in Decision Analytics it continues to stand out that the non-subscription line is growing really rapidly. I think it was like 38% year over year if I back into that right or $27 million. So I guess the question is one, what is driving that non-subscription growth? Is it all aerial imagery for example? And then secondly, can you give an organic subscription number for the quarter in Decision Analytics? Because that continues to look a little bit anemic.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. So the reason that the growth shows that we're – or let me make a more general point as we sort of get into this topic, which is that customers often have a preference for how they buy solutions, particularly new solutions, which is that they prefer to get into it in a transaction mode rather than in a subscription mode, because they don't exactly know how much of it they're going to need. And we're happy to do business that way as we're moving into a category which is either new for them or it's at least new for us with respect to serving them. So we don't consider transaction-based revenues to be low quality revenues, because they very frequently mature, they ripen into subscription agreements. So for example, in the Geomni world – and I'm just taking that as an example, today we're transaction-priced. One of the plans that we have worked on at length has been as our offerings begin to mature, one of the ways that we can offer them to customers would be in more of a subscription mode, where you would essentially sort of be kind of buying the aerial imagery platform I guess is the way I would say it, without respect to any individual property that you want to look at. So that would be an example of there would be a progressive movement of what today is booked as transaction revenue into what tomorrow or down the road would be booked as subscription revenue. And that's kind of a normal effect inside of a data analytics business. It's very common for the customers to want to start out in a transaction mode.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, and, Alex, I was just going to add to that. I think, when you look at the growth rates, certainly the transactional growth rates were higher than the subscription growth rates in the third quarter and actually, in the second quarter as well. But if you actually look at the progression in that growth, you would see the subscription – the relativity subscription growth has accelerated quite a bit as well as has transactional. And remember, because we are 80% subscription, the dollars associated with that acceleration of subscription growth are really what's meaningfully driving the growth. I don't have the organic numbers in front of me, but I would say that generally some of the businesses that we're bringing in are a lot more transactional in terms of that. So I think if you were to parse that out of your transactional growth rate but down to organic, I think you would see a bit more balance. Although nonetheless, we have storm activity and so transactions, as Scott said, is good revenue. So we'll take that.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: That's very helpful color. Thank you very much. Just secondly real quick, you mentioned the hurricane or weather impact will bleed into the fourth quarter, which is good, but how should I be thinking about this more longer term? Because this was, I think, a more extreme event than we've seen in years. Like where could there be incremental demand longer term? For example, maybe you will see some premium acceleration in some parts of the business, should that drive more, or better end market? Will you see more subscription on aerial? Or maybe some models that change and people have to purchase. What's the longer-term discussions with customers potentially coming out of this, kind of like very extreme time?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: There are three things to keep in your mind. I'll touch on the first two and Mark will pick up on the third. First of all, we said that the third quarter extreme events don't bleed into the fourth quarter with respect to revenue, so just hopefully everybody heard that and heard that clearly. The second thing to just sort of know about our business and obviously, we're talking here about insurance. We are very excited about where we're going in financial services and in the energy complex and I just want to continue to put that out there. But in the insurance space, the anomaly has been the amount of time that has passed since the last major event, so you can basically go back and say you have Sandy in 2011 and then you had Katrina and the unusual thing is sort of the spacing in there, actually. So when you think about Verisk, one of the things that you should think about is that part of what we do for our customers is provide a whole suite of solutions which help them to be hardened against major events. Major events happen. They happen not every year. We've actually been in an extended period where they didn't really happen with any frequency but that's the anomaly and so it is a part of our business. It won't show up every year. We'll see what the pattern is – and by the way, extreme event does not necessarily mean a hurricane, so there's also a sensitivity to for example, things like major flooding events in the United States, but they may not be atmospherically driven in the same way that a hurricane is, so you've got all that. But now having said those two things, I think what we also want you to just understand is sort of the very balanced way in which our insurance-facing business is growing. It's related to a lot of things, claims and new software platforms and so Mark if you want to just talk about that a little bit?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Just, I think to your question a couple things that typically help us a little bit in the future (54:36) is an event like these our insurer and reinsurer customers take some additional thoughts around how and what they're going to do with regard to cat modeling, so there could be opportunities for AIR down the road, to the extent that someone (54:50) wants a second model and maybe a more comprehensive suite of solutions whether it's across different perils, or different geographies, that's an opportunity. What we've also talked about sometimes with catastrophes is that it does help pricing in the industry. From a primary perspective I don't think we're going to see a big upsurge in pricing. From a rate perspective reinsurance, it should bolster maybe reinsurance a little bit. That helps our customers' customers who are growing have more of an appetite to buy things. So that's maybe just another tertiary benefit to us, but just wanted to share those other observations. I think that's what maybe you were searching for as well.
Alex Kramm - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. Exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking our questions. We just thought with some of the production capacity going offline for a little bit from the storms, could you see that having any impact to energy CapEx spending at all in 2018 and if that would have any effect on the business?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No. No, the nature of the business in the south central United States is a very engineering-intense way of extracting hydrocarbons from the ground and basically in the unconventional space for example, you can get your well established within three to five days, so it's a blip.
Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. Got it. And with all the acquisitions, the leverage ratio going up a little bit. Do you have a ceiling with how high you would go with the leverage ratio to complete the more necessary acquisitions?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So yes, so we have stated curbs and Eva maybe you just want to describe those?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes, I mean we've talked about our reference point being 2.5 times debt to EBITDA but we'll go above that for the opportunities. We've done that in the past. The way we really think about it is we don't really – we have covenants, those aren't really a constraint for us. So for us, the measure is really how long does it take us to de-lever and I think if you look at our business, especially in Q1, we generate a lot of free cash flow. So I would expect that that ratio would come down relatively quickly absent spending that cash on any other opportunities. So we feel very comfortable we've got a lot of flexibility.
Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: All right. Thanks, guys.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is open.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning. It's Henry Chien on for Jeff. I just had a follow-up on the aerial imagery product, or products, I should say. In terms of the time line of the rollout to customers, I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of that, and when we can see at least a meaningful impact on growth in the insurance segment or business line.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: It's in the market now and impacting our growth rate now.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And in terms of the acquisition multiples, could you give us a sense on what those levels are for the aerial imagery acquisitions?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I don't think we really – the aerial imagery acquisitions? I mean, I think, Eva, remind me, but I think we actually talked about 2-ish million dollars of acquired EBITDA at the time that we bought the seven smallish regional imaging companies.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And in terms of the multiples? How have they trended so far?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So we paid $30 million...
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: $31 million.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Pardon me?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: $31 million.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: $31 million for those businesses.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Hey, just post the Equifax breach, are you seeing any step-up in demand around kind of authorization and kind of pre-approval as it relates to Argus?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Authorization and pre-approval of Argus. I'm not quite sure what you're asking.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Scott, in terms of trying to manage fraud, fraud detection early, kind of in a pre-approval process or at the point of authorization, are you seeing any potential step-up in demand from clients?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, the demand factors for Argus are very good, but that's not – if I'm understanding your question, that's not really what Argus does.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right, but is – I guess, so let me ask, is that a potential area that you could potentially get into?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You mean to help companies – help banks, for example, with their cybersecurity?
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: That is potentially something that we could do at Verisk. That is not something that we do today. We do work on cyber insurance, so we help insurers think about how to manage their insurance products, but actually hardening companies, including banks, against cyber-attack is not something that we do today, though potentially something that we could consider doing in the future.
Kevin McVeigh - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in, and appreciate all the color on the natural disasters and other events and so forth. My question is a little more granular on the acquisition strategy, particularly when I look at G2 and Lundquist (01:00:42). I think a little bit about what the bureaus are doing for banks and perhaps TransUnion in particular, and I just wonder if you can comment on whether or not you think your business is sort of moving into adjacencies to what has been a traditional bureau offering, or how you think about differentiating your financial services offerings generally.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes, I think that – let me take it in reverse order. So Argus is a beautiful business that is founded on a data set that is utterly unique. And the data set is unique because of the granularity of the data that is being contributed by a wide – a large, wide and growing number of companies that participate in this consortium where they're contributing data. We do our analysis and decision support and provide it back to them. And so that whole ecosystem is growing and strengthening, and that is the fundamental foundation of the growth of Argus. And we are finding our ways into new use cases related to that content. So for example, when you think about G2, a lot of what G2 does is to diligence merchants. To date, most of the application of the data set has been more about diligencing consumers, the borrower and then to – and observe what they're doing in terms of their spending, using their credit card product for example, or their debit products. But one of the things that you can do when your data set is as comprehensive as ours is, is you can also then sort of pivot and start to try to observe the activities of the merchants where these payment products are being used. That's kind of new business for us relatively, and G2 is already there and so that's where the synergy occurs on that side. Then with respect to looking more at sort of LCI, another thing that you can do when you have comprehensive transaction data, is you can try to understand patterns of fraud, which is a really great theme for us, one that's very important for us in the insurance world for example. That's something that we have already done inside of Argus. It's a small part of what we do at Argus today but it's available and LCI helps supercharge that. When you move more towards the sort of the merchant analytics, there can be a degree of overlap with players out there including the bureaus and when you move towards trying to root out fraud, there's kind of a different set of solution providers out there that you might end up overlapping a little bit but we believe that, back to the most important point, we believe we come very equipped for these new categories because of the depth of what we've already got. And so we feel advantaged in trying to bring new value to the market with respect to categories like merchants and fraud.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. And then Eva, I just missed it, a housekeeping standpoint. What was the intangible amortization comment for this year?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: The intangible amortization for this year is $105 million.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Nicholas Verhein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. This is Nick Verhein on for Anj. Thanks for taking my question. Could you maybe just give us a sense of what the WoodMac contribution was to your energy and specialized markets revenue growth in the quarter?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think we put that out there. It was 3.3%.
Nicholas Verhein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Oh, okay, I must have just missed that. Can you just maybe then provide an update on maybe some of the customer conversations or maybe some sentiment, what it's sort of trending like and any updated thoughts on what sort of growth the business can aspire to in the sort of stable to low oil price environment?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Well, first of all, just to observe on the environment, I think maybe you noticed that Brent closed at $61-something yesterday, so there's been actually fair progression in terms of the price of the commodity. We said for some time we just need the environment to be stable for our customers to feel good and to lean into growing their businesses and doing so by doing business with us and we feel like we're now in that environment, so we're actually very pleased about that. Customer conversations are very good. I mean, it's a large global dynamic space and probably every customer of ours in that space has their own story in terms of where they are on their journey towards growth and profitability and part of the reason why we're both a meaningful partner for them, and also we feel like we have really terrific opportunities, is that we have these intimate relationships with essentially all of them and so we're able to turn corners with them specifically. Where are they trying to get to? And just like everything else we do, our business there also has a motive quality because we have data assets that are absolutely unique, so we feel very strongly about this business and are very excited about where it's going. I said at the time we bought it, and I still say, that over intermediate and long periods of time I'm looking for Wood Mackenzie to grow faster than the average of Verisk and we believe that's very possible, probable.
Nicholas Verhein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America. Your line is open.
David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Thank you for the ACV commentary on WoodMac. Did want to ask about how renewal rates have trended? And then also, did you offer any price concessions to clients during the downturn? As you are doing your planning around next year, are you planning for price increases on those products?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. We've actually talked about this effect before, so just to sort of reprise what we said before, WoodMac does a – at WoodMac we do a mix of one, two and three-year subscriptions. So part of what gets reported right at this moment is actually what was set in motion a couple years ago. And there were contracts that were being written and renewed kind of in the depth of sort of the pressure on the category. So when we report the 5-plus percent ACV progression year-to-date, it actually takes a little while for that to work its way into the reported results. And so as you're watching Wood Mackenzie step up, and we've talked about this for several quarters now, it's because these good things that are happening, they just take a while to get expressed into the overall result. So you're seeing WoodMac elevate. I think, 2018 looks very interesting for WoodMac.
David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And then on acquisitions, I understand they are a 230 basis points drag to your EBITDA margins in the quarter. In terms of thinking about a time line to narrow that gap, is a two-year period too aggressive? Could you do it faster or slower? What's a rule of thumb to use? Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, if you were to look at for example, the three acquisitions we did in Q3, which are 75% of the spend that we've done in 2017, I think that you would definitely expect them within 12 to 18 months to essentially be sort of looking like they will look like at their run rates. And in all cases, I think you're then talking about a difference to the corporate margin level, which is much, much lower than that 230 basis point effect that we were – that we've talked. The 230 basis points, Eva was trying to help you understand Q4 of 2017 but these are highly profitable businesses.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, I would also add, there are some one-time effects when we acquire businesses. There's some fees associated with that. There's some accounting associated with certain revenue. So that's going to be more of a near-term weight on those businesses as well. So I think as Scott said, we're positive in terms of those ramping up.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: All three of those businesses have the same quality as the rest of Verisk, which is to say, a high degree of fixed costs and so incremental margins in all of those businesses are really good.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. Seeing no other questioners on the screen there, I'll just say thank you very much for your time and your interest today. We look forward to seeing you. Hope you can all join us at our Investor Day in December. And as I mentioned right up front, we'll spend even more time on some of these newer parts of the company so that you have a very, very deep understanding of what they are, and how they behave in the market and how they behave economically. So hope you can join us then. Thanks for your time today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's EVP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.
David Cohen: Thank you, Patrick, and good day to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for discussion of our second quarter 2017 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures which we will reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail, in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Reported revenue grew 5% for the quarter. Organic constant currency growth was 4.1%. As expected we are seeing the performance progression we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins of around 49% and diluted adjusted EPS increased about 12%. When I look at the organic initiatives and recent acquisitions, I'm very encouraged by our people, our assets and the outlook. Our teams are working hard on all the new solutions in which we are investing. The long-term opportunities remain robust and we are seeing real progress in terms of market demand in our customer interactions. While M&A remains our priority for use of free cash, we were pleased to continue repurchasing our shares in the quarter through our longstanding program. We bought two million shares for a total return of capital to shareholders of $156 million in the quarter. At June 30, 2017 we have $376 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. We have capacity to make strategically relevant acquisitions as well as additional repurchases. During the quarter we spent $48 million on acquisitions including MAKE which is the leading expert in wind energy data analytics. MAKE is an important complement to Greentech, the solar data analytics business we acquired last year as we round out our capabilities in the renewable energy space. Additionally, as you've seen in the press release yesterday afternoon during the quarter we acquired seven leading aerial imagery companies for a total consideration of around $31 million to support our remote imagery solutions which are provided as part of our Geomni business. The acquisitions position us as a leader in remote sensing and enhance our analytics solutions for the property casualty insurance industry. The acquisitions bring us a talented group of professionals as well as aircraft and sensors, we have put together a great team and a great network of geographic coverage which is critically important to serving our customers. Our geospatial imagery database serves as the foundation for analytics solutions addressing the needs of property casualty insurers as well as photogrammetry, surveying and mapping companies known as PSM, and other end markets. Additional applications will serve energy, banking, architecture, engineering, emergency response and urban planning. The new companies combined with our expertise in computer vision based imagery processing and large-scale data management accelerate our efforts to meet the needs of our property casualty insurance customers with the required frequency resolution and U.S. coverage. You may recall that we explored a higher cost option in 2014 which would have accelerated us into the space. We have come up with an even better solution which provides us with greater intellectual property at a significantly lower investment. By building the capability ourselves with control over the aircraft sensor technology in flight plans we are able to create what we need at a much lower total spend. Including the $31 million purchase price of the acquisitions we will be investing up to $100 million in a remote sensing platform initiative across 2017 and 2018. These investments will enable Geomni to address an annual opportunity of over $200 million in the insurance space at an aggregate level of investment lower than previously possible. Additionally, with this valuable imagery dataset we expect to be able to access other addressable markets with multi-billion dollars of current spend. Even in the context of the near-term increase in capital expenditures to support this initiative we expect CapEx to normalize to about 6% of revenue by the year 2021. This moderation in CapEx reflects the maturation of the re-platforming and investment opportunities we've been discussing with you. Finally, last week we announced the signing of an acquisition agreement for G2 Web Services. We expect to close the transaction this quarter and are excited about the opportunity to integrate its fraud fighting solutions into our unique Argus platform. We remain confident in the strategy built on the various distinctives of one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first to market innovations; and four, deep integration into our customer workflows. As you know, with the distinctive come network effects, scaled economies and a large percentage of subscription revenue. From this foundation we are focused on executing on our plans which include ongoing innovation and serving our customers. As we look at the rest of 2017 we continue to have a constructive view for the insurance business with the second half performance better than the first half and we expect Wood Mac [ph] to make progress inside of a stabilized end market. I'd like to put our expectations for financial services for this year in a broader context. Argus became a part of Verisk five years ago; over that time period it has averaged 17% organic growth. That growth has come from new logos, new solutions, new international markets and modest pricing effects. We've seen a 67% increase in U.S. clients and an 80% increase in international clients over that time period. 2017 is clearly an outlier since the acquisition in 2012. Since we came together, Argus's addressable market has expanded materially. In 2012 much of our TAM related to credit card issuance, now we serve banks with respect to fraud fighting, compliance and data management, as well as serving a growing list of leading non-bank entities. With these has come a changed profile of revenue acquisition. While our bank consortia products provide recurrence just the same as other parts of Verisk; the newer products bring with them large upfront engagements followed by recurrent streams at somewhat lower levels. So we create grow over facts as the business grows but overall, our growth over the past five years was against a smaller TAM and we are optimistic about the future. At the moment as you know, we have several non-core contracts which ended in 2016 whose $11 million represented about 9% of revenue, these are one-time events that will not recur. Our current assessment is that several important new contracts will come online in 2017 but later in the year than anticipated. The core business remains in excellent shape and underlying growth remained solid with very good growth in the spending and media analytics part of the business. More important, our data sets are continuing to grow and remain unique allowing us to create solutions for our customers that no one else can offer. At Argus we have four strategic growth pillars including; one, core banking solutions; two, data management solutions; three, decisioning algorithms; and four, spend in media analytics. The core banking solutions are the Argus Foundation. We continue to lead with our core banking solutions and are expanding these to new international markets. Data management solutions follow from our leading capabilities around aggregating, standardizing and structuring data for analysis often more efficiently than our customers could do themselves. We have expanded our capabilities in the space with the acquisition of Fintellix and particular related to global regulatory compliance. The decisioning algorithms include established solutions like Wallet Share models and new ones such as fighting first-party fraud including through the pending acquisition of G2. Primary to this pillar are the sophisticated data science skills and methods we apply to our proprietary datasets. The fourth area of spend in media analytics reflects the opportunities we have been speaking with you about in recent years where we are working with consortium partners including companies with insights into traditional and new media presentation and measurement. All of this adds up to addressable end markets of over $2 billion. As we pursue market leading growth rates overtime we do expect new solutions initially to show more variability relative to our heritage solutions. This is especially evident in financial services and while revenue declined in the quarter, when we review the quality of our data assets and capabilities, the levels of customer engagement, the run rate business contracts and the future opportunity; we are very confident that our solutions are positioned to win in the long-term. So with that let me turn it over to Mark for some additional comments.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. First, as you saw in the release growth in insurance picked back up as we expected. As we expand our business which serves the property and casualty insurance industry we have several key themes including vertical Big Data, industry automation and digital engagement. The good example of industry automation introduced recently is underwriters advantage, a single source solution providing detailed underwriting data and accurate rebuild cost estimates for U.K. residential and commercial underwriters and brokers. We've taken our well established U.S. expertise and broadened it to the U.K. through the recently acquired geo-information group acquisition. We're actively working to pursue other international markets as well. More broadly, the solution highlights the process we're making in the U.K. in area which we are excited to continue invest. Progress in the U.K. is also underscored by the success of our annual risk symposium which had record attendance in June. Cyber is another important growth area within the insurance space which we are addressing at the IR and at ISL. As you may recall, we've launched ARC or Analytics of Risk from Cyber which allows insurers to evaluate any commercial policy, measure and monitor aggregations of cyber risk within a portfolio and estimate potential insured cyber losses for portfolios. More recently, ISO launched a cyber-insurance program with enhanced rating variables and coverage options designed to help insurer respond to the rapidly changing world of cyber risk. Building on the work we have done ISO recently launched a process to aggregate cyber data from the industry, a classic application of the vertical Big Data concept. AIIR had a good quarter including nice wins in the cat-modeling space as Touchstone continues its success in the marketplace. In addition, we are seeing growing interest in the solutions we have introduced from analyzere [ph] in the area of acquisitions. While small, we see a long runway for portfolio optimization in casualty event risk management. Finally, AIIR continues to be the leader in the cat bond market which was particularly strong in this quarter providing models for much of the new issuance this year-to-date. Finally, another example of automation is the ongoing rollout of ISO claim search integrations which allows our customers to receive instant access to Central Plains Analytics and insights directly in their claims management systems. This is part of a larger opportunity driven by the availability of the next generation of claim search which provides a platform for an ongoing in steady stream of new analytics enhancements, existing users with the investigation and adjustment of claims but providing real-time alerts and actionable intelligence using state-of-the-art data visualization techniques, response from customers has been very positive. With that let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail.
Eva Huston : Thank you, Mark. In the second quarter we grew revenue and EBITDA while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Our growth in the quarter picked up consistent with our comments on the last earnings call. As we move through the year, we remained confident that revenue growth will continue to improve. Revenue in the quarter grew 5% and organic constant currency revenue grew 4.1%. The press release again has a table to help him in FX or fax acquisition. As a reminder constant currency growth rate excludes the contribution from recent acquisition and reflects current period exchange rate to prior period revenue. Currency hurt revenue results in the quarter by about $7.2 million. And total acquired revenue in the quarter was $12 million including the contributions from our aerial imagery acquisitions and MAKE in the renewable space. Within the decision analytics segment revenue increased 4.2%, organic constant currency revenue growth was 4%. This quarter insurance was the fastest growing vertical and also the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Decision analytics insurance revenue increased 8.8% in the second quarter and organic constant currency revenue growth was 8.4%. Growth was led by strong performance in underwriting and cash remodelling solutions claims analytics growth was good and last on occasion solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. Energy and specialized markets category revenue declined 0.7% in the quarter a quarter and on an organic constant currency basis of revenue increases point six percent and on an organic constant currency basis revenue increased 0.6%. On an organic constant currency basis with MAC grew in the quarter while the British pound impacted revenue in the quarter we're pleased to see continued improvement in customer demand inside a stabilized energy market. As expected as you know the benefit will be over time given the multi-year subscription nature of the majority of that business. The category revenue growth was affected by decline and environmental health and safety solutions due to lower demand following the late 2015. now in the late two thousand and fifteen completion of V.H.S. standards related implementation. Financial services revenue decline 4.3% in the quarter, organic constant currency revenue declined 9.3% in the quarter. As Scott said, strong growth in media effectiveness and good growth in core banking solutions were more than offset by the contracts which concluded last year. We noted last quarter that those contracts contributed about $11 million in 2016. We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the business and building on what is a great dataset and analytic capability. The impact of the non-core contrasts are roughly even across the full year. Underlying growth excluding the 2016 non-core non-renewals is good, media effectiveness growth remains strong. We were anticipating additional revenue from non-bank companies in the payment space in 2017. The dynamics of the sales cycle with those companies varies from those with the banks but the long-term value proposition for this customer segment is compelling. As we bring in new data assets and capabilities to our financial services solutions such as Fintellix and G2, we reinforce the path to long-term sustainable growth as we move into 2018. Risk assessment revenue grew 6.4% in the quarter including contributions from our recent acquisitions which are expanding the baseline for future growth. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 4.4% reflecting our 2017 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions. While still early, we are encouraged by the strong efforts to drive new product development in this part of the business. The organic investments and acquisitions reflect our ambition, particularly in international markets to build on our strong foundation. Total EBITDA increased 3.7% in the quarter to $254 million. We continue to invest with a focus on revenue we see in the pipelines and opportunities for this year and into the future. The combined constant revenue and SG&A increased 7.3% or $19 million in the quarter. However, the increase was just 2.4% on an organic basis as we continue to focus on efficiency in our existing businesses and repurposing that spend to farm innovation. EBITDA margins as reported were 48.6%. Margins were reduced by about 120 basis points due to acquisitions and the fact that we expect to continue through the year. Total acquired EBITDA on the quarter was about $1 million excluding acquisition associated expenses. The acquisitions we were doing are close to the core with well-defined path to topline growth and margin expansion. We expect the temporary pressure on margins from acquisitions as well as investment opportunities to continue through 2017. While full year margins are likely to be consistent with the second quarter we are constructive over the long-term. As we've said previously, we review our leading margin level as a gauge of the strength of our solutions. Reported interest expense was $29 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.4 billion at June 30, 2017 and our leverage at the end of the second quarter was about 2.5 times our strong capital structures and asset as we continue to explore opportunities to drive growth. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 28.8%. The tax rate benefited primarily from the ASU 2016 09 [ph]. Adjusted net income in 2Q increased 11.5% to $139 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.82 in the quarter, an increase of 12.3%. Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased because of organic growth in the business and lower interest expense, provisions for income taxes and share account. The increase in the adjusted EPS was partially offset by higher fixed asset depreciation. The average diluted share count was $168.3 million in the quarter and we bought about two million shares in the quarter at an average price of $79.73. Our repurchase program has been successful today generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. On June 30, 2017 our diluted share account was 167.9 million shares. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $430 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of 11.6% versus 2016. Capital expenditures were $73 million for the six months period ended June 30 and CapEx was 7.1% of revenue year-to-date. Free cash flow increased 14.5% to $357 million for the six month period ended June 30, and free cash flow was 71.5% of EBITDA. Growth in free cash flow is driven by positive operating results and this is an important metric for the measurement of driving enterprise and therefore shareholder value. In the second quarter as Scott noted, the new additions to our aerial imagery capabilities contributed to our revenue of about $700,000. In 2016 these companies generated about $15 million in revenue and about $2 million in EBITDA. They will be included in the decision analytics insurance line for reporting purposes and will be treated as acquired until the third quarter of 2018. As Scott mentioned, including the purchase prices of about $31 million we expect to invest upto $100 million across 2017 and 2018. The additional investments will largely be in the form of CapEx to further expand data gathering capabilities through planes and remote imagery sensors. The five-year plan when looking at the investments and operating costs relative to our revenue forecast and the resulting free cash flow we expect to generate is compelling. As you've seen in yesterday's press release, insurance related market opportunity is over $200 million annually, and we also see opportunities in broader bottom markets. As you think about your models for 2017, currency will continue to be a headwind moderating a bit as we move into the second half. To help you look at the FX impact, the following 2016 total revenues are restated as of June 30, 2017 rates. If rates were unchanged from June 30 these would be the base for organic constant currency revenue growth. Most of the impact falls within the energy and specialized market segment and decision analytics. For 3Q 2016 it would be $496 million versus the reported $498 million, and for the fourth quarter 2016 it would be $508 million versus the reported $506 million. In addition, we expect CapEx of about $185 million, an increase versus the prior amount to reflect the remote imagery investments. As Scott noted we expect CapEx to normalize to about 6% by 2021. Fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be almost $140 million for the year, and the amortization of intangibles about $95 million. Based on our current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million for the year; this includes non-cash amortization of debt issuance cost. We still estimate the full year tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33% and the adjusted net income calculation we continue to use 26% for the tax effective on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of 169 million to 170 million shares. We look forward to continue the overall improvement as we move through 2017 and beyond. We are excited about the opportunities to invest as we work to drive long-term free cash flow. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk, given the large number of analysts we have covering us we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tim McHugh, William Blair & Company.
Timothy McHugh: Thanks. I guess to start off with maybe a two part question on just insurance; how meaningful is the strengthening capacity bonds to the growth that you saw in decision analytics insurance? And secondly, I guess elaborate just why now are you ready to pull the trigger on going more aggressively after aerial imagery?
Mark Anquillare: This is Mark, let me start out Tim. Obviously, the cap on market was robust in the quarter, we continue to be the model choice and as a result that did help us a little bit. But I just want to make sure I don't -- we don't overemphasize how much revenue we get from the cap on market, it's certainly an indicator of kind of the strength of our AIR brand but at the same time we're talking a couple of million dollars over something overly dramatic.
Eva Huston: Yes. And Tim, I would just add that if we have not seen any growth in the cap online there, we still would have seen acceleration in the DA insurance growth.
Scott Stephenson: And to your question Tim about aerial imagery, we've really been on this topic for some time now and much of what we've given attention to over the last couple of years have been our analytic methods. And so our machine learned methods for interpreting image sets I think are the best in the world and we've been working on those for a few years. What we concluded was that in order to assume the position that we want to, where this market is concerned we had to complement that excellence with equal distinctiveness with respect to the image sets that are available to us. To-date we've been working with third-parties and so this we see as really the final step in order to be fully prepared to serve this marketplace. And so it's not that we haven't been here, it's that this was sort of the final piece.
Timothy McHugh: Okay, thanks. And then just one quick follow-up. I guess Eva, I think you said insurance you expect faster growth in the second half, is that relative to 2Q and -- or is that first half? Just kind of I guess clarifying what you were saying?
Eva Huston: We're just only looking at first half versus second half, Tim.
Timothy McHugh: Okay.
Eva Huston: And you know, we prefer to talk about it from an annual basis but that's the way we think about it.
Timothy McHugh: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeff Meuler: Thanks. On the aerial imagery, the investment that you're talking about is that all incremental on top of the level that you've already been investing in aerial imagery including the amount that you've been spending to source the images from third-parties?
Scott Stephenson: No. So our own efforts at image capture will substitute for, what we have had to spend with third-parties in order to capture images to-date. Now there is a bit of an overlap period here where -- even today we're still being supplied by the third-parties that we put together but in a short period of time basically it will all be our own image capture and therefore these costs associated with the third-parties will go away.
Jeff Meuler: Can you give us any rough order of size in terms of how much is incremental?
Eva Huston: Well, I think the way to think about Jeff is, when we're talking about the $100 million investment, that's the -- the M&A of about $31 million plus CapEx, and I think as we're talking about third-parties, that's more on the OpEx side; so I think it's a little bit of apples and oranges. But I think fundamentally as Scott was saying, I mean this is a better way to do it, overall, it's going to be less expensive and we're going to have more control and better imagery.
Jeff Meuler: Okay. And then just going back to the Argus performance and the outlook commentary; I think there were the comments somewhere in Scott's prepared remarks about run rate business contracts, so is this more contracts that are signed and the question is when they go live and you start to recognize revenue or is this pipeline that has not yet contracted in terms of what seems to be more delayed than your previous expectations?
Scott Stephenson: It's a combination of both Jeff. So we can see the cumulative effect of what has already been put in place and also anticipating new contracts, particularly in these new segments that I was talking about before; so it's both.
Jeff Meuler: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie.
Hamzah Mazari: Good morning, thank you. Just a clarification around CapEx; is it fair to say that Verisk is in a multi-year elevated CapEx cycle? You guys pointed to $100 million spread over two years but then you threw out the 2021 figure of 6% of CapEx. So just maybe a little more color after 2018, is it still elevated that CapEx spend and it just goes down in 2021 or any color would be great there.
Eva Huston: Well, so there are a couple of layers in there. Thank you for the question. I think maybe I'll start by saying sort of prior to the discussion of the $100 million investment in aerial imagery of which remember 30% of that is M&A, $31 million and the remainder is CapEx, so we're talking about that across 2017 and 2018, that's -- before that what you know is we've been re-platforming our business and we were already starting to work our CapEx percentages letting it down. This is something that will sort of elevated for '17 and '18 but our expectation is that we will continue on that downward trajectory, this is just a layer on top of the path that we already discussed.
Hamzah Mazari: Great, that's very helpful. And then just a longer term question, maybe if you could frame for us what catalysts investors should look for the company to have greater penetration internationally outside of energy? Is it simply that data analytics markets need to develop more overseas or is there anything else that you are hearing from your customer base that could be relevant? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: No, I mean it's -- there is no single effect but the rest of the world is the same as the United States in the sense that data analytics is what companies are doing, you know, companies inside of our vertical markets are working on today; so it's really just a matter of us being present and presenting credentials and we're very encouraged by the engagements that we've been able to generate in 2017 with names that didn't used to be on our customer list. And it's just that it's steady march that will get us there but there is nothing fundamentally different about the rest of the world; I mean there may be some differences in terms of regulatory structure and that can have some effect on market structure but overall, it's really -- it's the same thing. No, it's not a matter of catalysts, it's a matter of us being present, bringing our great intellectual property into these markets and finding our place.
Hamzah Mazari: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: Thank you, good morning. First question just to clarify a couple of things on the aerial imagery investment; so in terms of the revenue opportunity -- you've been working on this since 2014, you talked about $200 million TAM on the insurance side I guess. I was wondering if you could just have us frame what that revenue penetration looks like for you guys today? And just to clarify, the $70 million is '17 and '18 but after that what should the run rate look like in terms of spend there?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, so we've accessed less than 5% of that TAM today. So we're -- this is the opening minutes of the first quarter. We've been working on our methods for a long time as I responded to Tim's question but we feel like we've put the final piece in place here. But we've accessed 5% or less actually of that TAM, so very, very early days. With respect to the CapEx profile, there will be a sustained tail of CapEx because essentially the infrastructure necessary to generate these image sets always has to be refreshed but as Eva was mentioning before with respect to CapEx, '17 and '18 are kind of this bubble and then we come down to substantially lower sustained levels to essentially keep this network in the United States operating in perpetuity.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And maybe just one question to Eva, last quarter you guys talked about 7% to 8% as your target for financial plus insurance, clearly it sounds like that's not going to be meet because of financial; would you be willing to give us what that range would look like now?
Eva Huston: Yes, you're right. Because of the discussion we've had around financial which -- we're still very encouraged by the business overall but I think in 2017 it's not going to show the type of growth that we would need to get to that target that we had talked about earlier. So I think as we've talked about insurance we expect that to continue to accelerate in the second half, we feel very good about it. So that's kind of where we set.
Scott Stephenson: 7% to 8% is still the reference benchmark for us, nothing has changed, we're simply talking about quarters here.
Operator: And your next question comes from Jeff Silber, BMO.
Henry Sou Chien: Thanks, good morning, it's Henry Chien. I just had a question, it's a follow-up question on the aerial imagery space; is this -- in terms of how you're building up your aerial imagery business, is the focus still on the insurance end market where you also position being the data and the services to other end markets and just any thoughts on how you plan to position this future aerial business?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, so I think couple of questions in there. This capability will serve more than the insurance market but the insurance market is a primary consideration for us simply because of the nature of the business that we do but in fact there are marketplaces today consuming the analyzed output of aerial imagery which are larger than the insurance used cases and we intend to tap those markets as well; so it's really -- it's genuinely at both end and the way we think that we're going to win, the way that we are making progress today is basically a combination of great data which is what this announcement about the aerial imagery capture program is about combined with leading analytic methods, and you also have to build great workflows so that the customers can easily ingest the data in the analysis, we've got all that and we are actively presenting credentials in the market today and very encouraged by what we're saying.
Henry Sou Chien: Okay, that's great. And just a follow-up question; on the gross margins, it looks like it's been trending downwards, is there anything that's been driving that?
Eva Huston: I mean I think you're probably seeing some impact of some of the acquisitions in that.
Henry Sou Chien: Okay, alright. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, it's Oscar [ph] for Andrew. So I was just wondering can you provide any color on the competitive environment in Argus, has anything changed there?
Scott Stephenson: No, nothing has changed there. No, we still have a very unique position inside of the banking ecosystem with respect to the data asset that we have, nothing has changed.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thanks. And then just as a follow up, we've seen an uptick in the pace of M&A recently though it has been somewhat smaller deals; how should we think about your M&A strategy going forward in terms of size, vertical and geography?
Scott Stephenson: So we -- our history at Verisk has been, we have created a lot of value for our shareholders through the program of M&A and the reason that it has created values is that it is tightly linked to our strategy; so we start from within the customer markets that we serve with a deep understanding of what they need and what their emerging needs look like, and from that we derive our strategy and from that we ask questions about should we build it or should we buy it, that's the way we've always done and that's the way we will continue to do it. We're not doctrinaire [ph] about the amount that we spend on M&A, we're not doctrinaire about the size of the deals, what we're looking for are things which fit our strategy. The strategy is tightly yoked to two things; one is the vertical markets we're serving, and the other is the four distinctive that we always talk about, and those are really the criteria that we use at those and financial metrics to look at potential acquisitions. So we're on the same course that we were always on, and so with respect to expectations going forward we will continue to lean into the M&A agenda, we will continue to lean into the share repurchase program; and the amount of transactions at any given moment will be a function of mostly kind of availability and we do a lot of cultivation and things take time but I think you can look to us for a very steady stream of acquisitions into the future.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, that's helpful, thanks.
Operator: And your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William Warmington: Good morning everyone. So first question for you on Wood Mac, you had pointed out that the growth -- on an organic basis constant currency up about 0.6% but it's actually little better than that because EHS was negative against it. So I wanted to ask whether you were seeing -- what you were seeing on the renewables, whether you're seeing on the dollar value, were you seeing price improvements, expansion; what's driving the growth there?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, it's -- we're very encouraged by what's happening with the subscription revenues, that's real-time business and that is as with the way that we face-off with our customers and all vertical markets, when we come to a renewal moment it isn't just a sort of a raw question of price increase on what they were using previously; first of all, our products are always sort of dynamically changing but in addition to that we sort of bring bundles. So when we look at -- what we're paying attention to Bill is the subscription amounts associated with existing customers and obviously with new customers as well. And there has been very nice progression in terms of those subscription revenues. As Eva pointed out because we signed multi-year agreements it will take a little while for the full effect of what's happening right now to show up on the revenue line but it's progressing nicely. And as I said, just to be clear about this; you know, inside of the resource and energy world we don't need the commodity to be -- for example, if we're talking about the oil commodity we don't need it to be at the record highs, it was at a few years ago, we just need our customers to be stable and looking to the future which is actually kind of where we are now. There has been a tremendous reduction in breakeven inside the industry and so it's -- we just need stability and essentially there is stability at this point; so we're enjoying what's happening in that business.
William Warmington: Okay. And then a clarification on the 7% to 8% constant currency organic target for the total insurance including and plus financial services. When we talked about this in early May, at that point it looked like about two-thirds of that target was under contract and about one-third was coming from new sales; and I just wanted to check whether we were still on-track for that for the year and I wanted to also -- I mean, back at the envelope it looked like that combined organic constant currency was somewhere in the 4% to 5% range for the second quarter, that's my math and I know your math is better than mine; so I just wanted to check that.
Eva Huston: All right, there were like seven questions in that.
William Warmington: Sorry about that.
Eva Huston: So I'll start with the last one first, organic constant currency and buying insurance and financial in the quarter was 5.1% and that compared to 4.9% last quarter so there was a progression there. Going back maybe to the top, a clarifying point was the one-third, two-thirds comment you made, that was the comment we made specifically around insurance last quarter and maybe after I get two more of your questions I'll have Mark make a comment on how we're progressing on that. With regards to the combined targets for financial and insurance, you know, going back to the comments that Scott and I made, financial in 2017 because of some of the dynamics we talked about [indiscernible] level we had expected for -- so I would say that when we look at that combined target that we talked about that is not something that we're looking at because of the financial performance that we're now expecting in 2017. So let me comment on how we're progressing on the insurance side.
Mark Anquillare: As we demonstrated in the second quarter, we feel like there is a ramp inside of insurance and we were just kind of reinforce second half versus the first half. One of the metrics I think we tried to provide during the first quarter call was the element of how much of the contracts or how many additional growth was relative to committed contracts and things that will be happening because of a commitment and signed contract versus go get your pipeline; and I think you feel good about the progress we've made over the course of quarter and that number is even more positive today. So I'm comfortable with at least the progress we're making.
William Warmington: Got it. So I understand we were saying now on the 7% to 8% target; did you want to give us a revised target for that combined segment for 2017?
Eva Huston: I think Scott's described well the dynamic and financial and for insurance that we've talked about acceleration into the second half.
Scott Stephenson: Yes, and we expect progress as the year goes on and the target remains the target and it's just a question of timing.
William Warmington: Got it. All right, well thank you very much and I appreciate your patience through all the questions.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, Bill.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: Good morning. Eva, EBITDA margins were down year-over-year in the first half for the year in 2017; might we see EBITDA margins down in the same or more in the second half of the year, year-over-year and when should we get back to margin expansion?
Eva Huston: Andrew, thanks for the question. If you were to look at what we -- what I found on the call with regard to margins, I think if you look at second quarter and think about the year I mean that's kind of where we are, we've got a couple of things going on there. Obviously, we've talked about the beginning of the year some of the investments that we're making in the business, we continue to make those; we're excited about those. We now have brought in some acquisitions, you know, I did mention for you some of the revenue in EBITDA and those acquisitions, those are smaller margins of our existing business and so that was over the call for this year. But as -- you know, I've said before, we continue to be constructive on margins over the long-term.
Andrew Steinerman: Okay.
Operator: And our next question is from Arash Soleimani with KBW.
Arash Soleimani: Thanks, good morning. So one question you mentioned in your prepared remarks a bit about cyber; I was just wondering, obviously cyber is still a relatively young insurance market are you seeing pretty large appetite from your insurance carrier clients to grow that line?
Mark Anquillare: This is Mark. I think one of the things that every insurer is looking to do is grow and cyber offers that opportunity in a world where premiums and rates have been relatively soft, cyber offers that opportunity. The challenge is it's tough to quantify that risk, actually understand what you're underwriting and how big it could be especially with all the cyber-attacks and the exposure that's out there. So there is -- you know, I call an under -- uninsured opportunity here and everyone's looking to try to seize on that. We have done several things that I think are responding to that need. We have typically focused on insurance and are sure of customers or reinsurers and you kind of heard some of the things from CAT [ph] models to actually programs and coverage forms that -- were aggregating data to better improve the last cost, we're going to try to put out what we refer to as like -- we typically have these building underwriting [indiscernible] kind of have a similar type of report or businesses. The theory is that both from a risk by risk and a portfolio perspective we can provide a lot of solutions to our customers that need support in writing this risk. Last comment, this is the type of risk if we do it right has the ability to kind of lag outside of insurance and into the corporate market. So it provides even a bigger TAM and bigger opportunity if we do it right; so we are excited about the opportunities here and we're working hard to be the first or at least first to market.
Arash Soleimani: Thanks, that's helpful. And the other question is, was there anything unusual in the tax rate this quarter; it seemed a bit lower than usual?
Eva Huston: As I mentioned, remember we have this new approach from an accounting perspective to how we have to write for the benefit for stock option. So you're going to see a bit more variability across the quarter and that's what you saw in this quarter for the tax rate that we still think for the year we're going to be looking at 32% to 33%.
Arash Soleimani: All right, great, thanks for the answers.
Eva Huston: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tony Kathleen [ph] with Morgan Stanley.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. You've talked a lot about financials so far but I'm not sure I have a great idea of the growth expectation in the second half for this segment, you're facing sort of mid 20's comps organically but you do have the large contracts in the pipeline that you're expecting to come on later in the year. So basically I'm just trying to understand how much of these large contracts contribute to growth and just facing the tough comps, I'm just trying to get a sensed directionally of how we should be thinking about financial?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, so we expect it to grow in the fourth quarter, more in Q4 than Q3.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And basically should Q3 be -- should we be thinking positive organically or how should we be thinking about that?
Scott Stephenson: I mean that's kind of where I'm going to leave it with you Tony [ph], it's just -- it's progressing from where it was in the second quarter and the second half will net out to growth and it will be more Q4 than Q3.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then Mark I think talks about the changed profile of revenue in Argus; I'm just trying to understand are there different types of products that customers are demanding or have you just changed the structure of the contracts for the existing products. Just any examples of maybe changes in purchasing behavior if there are or just what's going on? Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: Yes, so there were a couple of -- this is Scott, there were a couple of comments that we made on that. So as we've expanded the products that we've also moved to a new set of customers, so actually you have both effects going on at the same time and the new solutions take on somewhat -- some of the new solutions taking on somewhat different shape and profile than say the consortium based products which were the ones that really -- you first got to look at, that was most of what you were seeing when you were looking at Argus 2012-2013, they have the same kind of recurrent quality as many, many of the things we do around Verisk but as we moved into new solution sets, for example, media effectiveness; the nature of the engagement with the customer which is a different customer takes on a different profile where there is sort of an intense engagement as you get started because we have to integrate datasets with datasets in order to be able to create the analysis that we're looking to do which then you come off that high somewhat as you move into then a recurrent relationship. And so that shape is different than the shape of what the Argus business began with inside of the consortium model. So as we move to new solutions we also move to new customers and those new solutions that's for those new customers do have a somewhat different profile but extremely good business; the difference that we can make, the value that can be added is substantial.
Unidentified Analyst: Perfect, thanks Scott.
Operator: And your next question comes from Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Mike Creed [ph] on for Joe, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go quick back to what the long-term margin opportunity was and would that come from less acquisitions and lowered investments or are there other leverage there?
Eva Huston: I think as you think about our business model it all comes from the top line growth and as we're investing, we're working to enhance that top line growth and I think you'll see that scalability. I think similarly with our acquisition and you've seen the acquisitions we're bringing in, they are not all at our margins today but they also are growth opportunities, and so as we start to scale that I think you'll just see that naturally fall to the bottom line as you have historically.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then -- you think there would be any seasonality margin-wise between Q3 and Q4, probably not much?
Eva Huston: I don't think that's a typical period in which we see seasonality. I mean there is always variability but I don't think there is anything specific I'd call out.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks.
Eva Huston: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Alex Care [ph] with UBS.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning. I hope this question is not too detail but I wanted to just ask about subscription growth in the quarter. Now when I look at your subscription disclosures in the 10-Q and I backed into the implied growth, the 2Q had less than 1% subscription revenue growth in decision analytics and I think all the growth came basically for non-subscription growth; I think it's about 16% by my calculation and I think subscription was as flat in the first quarter too. So I know there is a lot of moving pieces, effects, acquisitions, the different business but I guess if I just step back and look at this more holistically, it looks a little bit more like the business is becoming much more dependent on one one-time sales and maybe the subscription would have stalled. So again, a lot of moving pieces but maybe you can elaborate how you would look at that?
Eva Huston: Yes, I mean -- I think if you -- you kind of have to unbundle it and I think there is a reasonable impact from the comments we've made around Argus. Those long-term contracts that did not renew at the end of last year as expected, those were subscription on long-term contracts; so I think part of the impact we're seeing relates to that. I can circle back with a little more detail later on but I would consider that in your analysis.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. So still very comfortable, obviously, that the subscription core is positioned for steady growth.
Eva Huston: Absolutely.
Scott Stephenson: That is -- those are own beat inside of our company.
Unidentified Analyst: All right, good. And then but secondly, and maybe related to the same data. I think Eva, you kind of rushed a little bit for the cap-ons [ph] answer there when somebody asked early and you said, a couple of million, again, by just backing into the non-subscription goals, I think I get to $11 million, I guess it is adjusted as well but where is that $11 million coming from if it's not the cap-ons [ph] strength, what other kind of like non-subscription items contribute at this quarter that you may want to cause?
Eva Huston: Sorry, I'm not sure I know your $11 million reference but let me go back to what Marc said about cap-on from what I said, I think Mark said he didn't want to overstate the size of the business, it's millions of dollars, not tens of millions of dollars. And the comment that I made I think in response to Tim's question was that even if we were to assume that, so cap-ons obviously grew nicely in the quarter but even if we were to assume that we've got no dollar growth in cap-ons this quarter, you still would have seen an acceleration in decision analytics insurance growth. So the comment I was making was really just trying to -- I mean we're excited about it, we love to get cap-on revenue, it's great but I just wanted to make the point that the strength of the business was not solely related to the cap-on market. Hopefully that helps.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, there is always a first time. Thank you.
Eva Huston: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Anjaneya Singh with Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst: Good morning, this is Nick Ryan [ph] on for Anjaneya, thanks for taking my questions. Now that you've kind of made the last step if you will, on aerial imagery, can you maybe just update us on what the competitive landscape looks like for you guys, now that's a sort of bigger focus and maybe any sort of estimates on the margins today and/or where they could go overtime?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. This is Scott. There is -- in the insurance marketplace there is one primary competitor and outside of the insurance marketplace it's actually a fairly unconcentrated sort of long list of companies that provide that are small-ish that provide a fraction of the services that we're interested in. So that's really sort of the nature of where it says and one of the things about being in the insurance vertical is that the analyzed output from remote imagery needs to get put into platforms where the customers then make decisions based upon the remote imagery derived analysis and a lot of other inputs as well. We are the provider of most -- we are the leading provider of many, if not most of those platforms and so it's one of the reasons why we feel that we have a winning proposition that is going to take its place.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great, thank you. And maybe just any commentary around where you estimate the margins are today and maybe where they are expecting to go?
Scott Stephenson: Well, this is like most of the things that we do. We'll show a lot of scale as it grows, you have the semi-fixed cost of creating your datasets and you have the semi-fixed cost of the tech stack that you build to do the analysis. And so as this business grows we expect the margin characteristics to materially improve.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great, thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Gary [ph] with RBC.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks, good morning. First question, just on the margins; Eva, did I hear you right that the margin for the full year approximates the second quarter? And if so, it -- given the margins were stronger second half versus first half a year ago, it seems to imply quite a bit larger contraction in the next few quarters, is that just the impact of the recent M&A or is there some other stepped up investment elsewhere you're expecting?
Eva Huston: Yes, we haven't shifted our investment plan for the year so I would say that a lot of that impact you're seeing really relates to M&A. And maybe just kind of moving back to the question before; on the inorganic side on aerial imagery, I gave you the data points in a script that the companies that we acquired in 2016 had about $15 million, about $2 million of EBITDA, so I'm kind of doing the math on that, even that will have some impact in the short-term.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. And then the follow-up; just on the longer term 7% to 8% organic revenue framework that you've discussed, how are you thinking today about the energy business long-term potential; at the time of the deal it was definitely above that. I think you've indicated tempering that and I guess relevant to what's going on now, how do you think about financial services against that that long-term framework? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: So first of all, we haven't tempered that view with respect to the resources and energy business. So we remain in the same place, we actually have a wonderful franchise and many different ways that we can grow it; so we actually haven't tempered that franchise. And you asked about financial services, you know, our believe is that it has the potential to exceed the corporate average as well.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh, Deutsche Bank.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. I wonder if you could train or just the longer term frame, what the potential opportunity could be around fraud as you make those investments within [indiscernible], you know, what type of growth driver that could be for the business?
Scott Stephenson: Yes, so fraud is one of those persistent issues that never goes away, it's actually a topic that we like and it's one that I think you all know we give a great deal of attention to in the insurance vertical. And so what you're basically counting are many basis points against very, very large transaction volumes. And then what modifies that view of TAM a little bit is the degree to which our customers consider fraud a cost of doing business versus an opportunity to get after. In the insurance vertical, it's pretty well established that fraud is a category to go after. And our view is that in the financial services vertical it is increasingly viewed the same way and what's really needed are precise tools that create great confidence that you're actually getting after something and that the gains that you get will persist. And so we believe it's a very large marketplace and it's a very small part of what it is that we do in financial services today; so it's a very good theme for us.
Kevin McVeigh: Is that tied in Scott with kind of the cyber or those kind of -- do you do them jointly or are those independent?
Scott Stephenson: So Mark, if you want to talk about cyber again -- although Mark's comments about cyber; first pass relate to the insurance vertical but there is -- if you want to call it kind of a cyber-dimension, so for example, G2 web services, if you take the opportunity to look into that a little bit more, this is basically about diligencing online merchants and I won't sort of go into the specifics today but it is about trying to find sort of bad actors and maybe you wouldn't call it fraud exactly but it is about trying to find bad actors. And then Mark, do you want to add anything with respect to cyber?
Mark Anquillare: Well, I mean -- let me hit the cyber as well as the other things we do; I think there is a general theme that we've always found there is high correlation to the extent that you have bad guys that operate across a lot of spaces, we have the opportunity to find more fraud to the extent that we have a broader set of databases; so the extent that you think about all the insurance claims that are inside of our database we've brought in healthcare which is kind of improved through the accuracy and the ability to fight fraud. Cyber is another dimension and to the extent that we can gather some information with all the proper approvals around some of the credit card fraud that happens, I think we would be more effective at finding fraud across these different communities of interest; so that's a general thing we have and I think it's a positive one.
Scott Stephenson: No, that's a good point. Thanks.
Kevin McVeigh: Great, thank you.
Operator: And management, I'd now like to turn it back over to you for closing remarks.
Scott Stephenson: Okay, well thanks everybody for your time today and for your interest and I know we'll be talking to many of you in the days and weeks following this; and we look forward to bringing you our third quarter in a few months. And -- so again, thanks for your time today.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics First Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's EVP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.
David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Teresa, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for discussion of our first quarter 2017 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities, the financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures, which we'll reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail, in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, David. Good morning, everybody. Yesterday, we reported an unusual quarter with a number of items that we don't expect to recur that affected us at a moment in time. We are comfortable that growth will be better the rest of the year and into 2018. For the full-year of 2017, we continue to expect combined insurance and financial services revenue to grow about in line within historical trend. Reported revenue grew 2% for the quarter. Organic constant-currency growth was 2.5%. Profitability remained strong, with total EBITDA margins around 49%. We chose to grow expenses at a measured pace in the quarter to support future growth. Diluted adjusted EPS declined about 1% as a result of unusual conditions influencing revenue growth. In spite of this, free cash flow in the quarter was up about 12%. Revenue growth was muted because of one-time true up revenue in Decision Analytics in 2016, several contract completions at Argus and the cycling through of WoodMac contracts that were signed in the depth of the oil commodity down cycle. Looking ahead, our confidence is based on new contracts and new solutions layered on top of the stability our subscription revenue provides. Specifically, we expect new sources of insurance revenue growth, several new Argus contracts where the signing slipped out of the first quarter and moderating effects of the commodity and currency headwinds as we move through 2017. We were pleased that in our resource businesses in the quarter, we saw a healthy and encouraging growth in contract signings for subscription products. Our teams are working hard on all the new solutions in which we are investing and long-term opportunities remain robust. We are focusing on both acquiring talent and shaping our workforce, so that it reflects the right mix of capabilities to run our business. We are also investing in our new solution opportunities, because we're confident in the near and the long-term revenue outlooks, continuing to invest in our people and innovation as the prudent course of action. We were pleased to continue repurchasing our shares through our long-standing program, an indication of our enduring confidence in our business. We bought 1.3 million shares for a total return of capital of $104 million in the quarter. At March 31, 2017, we had $532 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. With leverage below our 2.5 times reference level, we have plenty of capacity to make strategically relevant acquisitions as well as additional repurchases. During the quarter, we spent $76 million on acquisitions, bringing trailing four-quarter total acquisition spend to $150 million. Since last quarter's earnings call, we closed the acquisition of Fintellix, further extending Argus' international end markets and enhancing our capabilities and global bank regulatory compliance. The acquisition of Fintellix positions Argus to expand our data hosting and regulatory platforms and better address the increasingly complex needs of our clients. We will continue to focus on M&A that helps drive our strategy and embodies the Verisk distinctives. At Investor Day in December, we began telling you about 20 internal investment opportunities we are funding to drive valuable solutions for our customers and growth for our company. These are promising new solutions, some of which have the potential to contribute significantly over a five-year time horizon. These major initiatives have their own project champions, at least one anchor customer and dedicated teams. They involve machine learning, telematics, the Internet of Things, high-resolution imagery, predictive fraud modeling, claims automation, digital marketing and alternative energy analytics. While the revenues in most cases will be slower to ramp up, the investments are already underway. We have identified these opportunities, which cross all our key vertical end markets as likely to generate attractive returns over the five-year planning horizon. We intend to move with speed and focus on these compelling innovation opportunities. We're running our game plan of innovation driving organic revenue, which will result in the delivery of free cash flow growth. Our businesses are strongly aligned with the Verisk distinctives of: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into our customer workflows. With these come network effects, scale economies and a large percentage of subscription revenue. From this enduring foundation of strength, we are highly confident in the ability of our people to execute our strategy and plans, which ultimately relate to serving and adding value for our customers. You should expect our results to ramp as we move through this year and we are even more encouraged as we look to 2018 and beyond. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over now to Mark for some additional comments.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses, we serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have several key themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. While the headline growth across our insurance businesses is a bit below trend during the quarter, both the underlying performance and outlook for the rest of the year and beyond is encouraging. First, growth in the quarter was reduced by last year's true up revenue, which did not recur in 2017. Second and most important, the pricing environment and the competitive landscape remain consistent with the past. Third, as we look at the core solutions in each of our businesses, they're growing well. For example, in our catastrophe modeling business, the dynamics in the reinsurance industry continue to be challenging. That has affected the cap on and consulting businesses. However, as we look at the majority of what we do there, extreme event modeling, we are growing in the high single digits as we continue to take market share. Big data message, integrated into our platform, are very compelling to the industry. Looking at our claims businesses, our two largest solutions related to repair cost estimate continue to grow in the mid to high single-digits. This is a good example of continuing industry automation. And of course, fraud is evergreen, helping our anti-fraud related solutions continue to grow nicely. As a final example, in our personal lines underwriting business, where our solutions are well-established, but still newer to the market than some of our competitors, we're making good progress in innovating and gaining market share. We're applying big data methods, which we expect will be a key differentiator even as we help our customers digitally engage more effectively with their customers. Finally, in our important heritage ISO business, our normal course price increases went into effect in January and we're pleased with the uptake of our newer solutions. While many of you may think of the ISO solutions business as a steady, stable grower, which it is, we're really excited with the addition of new people who are helping us push forward with innovative solutions. These are allowing us to address parts of the end market where we haven't historically served, but where we see a lot of opportunity to help our customers solve tough problems they face. As we look at some of the newer things we're doing, including expanding into international markets and with the recent acquisition, there's a lot which is very encouraging. With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. In the first quarter, we grew revenue and EBITDA on a comparable basis to the prior year, while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Our growth in the quarter was below trend as several headwinds affected us at the same time, consistent with our comments on our fourth quarter call and in presentations earlier this year. Currency hurt revenue results in the quarter by about $7.5 million. As we move through the year, we're confident that revenues will improve. Revenue in the quarter grew 2%. Organic constant currency revenue grew 2.5% and 3.4%, excluding the prior year true up revenue. We have included a new table in the press release to help you see the acquisition and FX results for each of our revenue lines more clearly. As a reminder, organic constant currency growth excludes the contribution from recent acquisitions and reflects current period exchange rates applied to prior period revenue. Total acquired revenue in the quarter was $5.3 million. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 0.1%. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 1.5%. This quarter, insurance was the fastest growing vertical and also the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Underlying the results are the continued resilience in our insurance business and some timing in our financial services revenue growth. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 4.1% in the quarter. Last year, had around $4 million of one-time true-up revenue. And adjusting for this, organic constant currency revenue growth was 6.5%. Growth was led by strong performance in underwriting solutions, claims analytics, loss qualification, and catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. We've spoken about reinsurance having an impact in some areas in terms of growth, but we are pleased that those trends aren't worsening and that the underlying growth in our subscription solutions and cap modeling remains very good, as Mark mentioned. Customer retention remains very high and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. Energy and specialized markets category revenue declined 5.9% in the quarter. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue declined 2.1%. While continued energy end market headwinds and the British pound impacted revenue in the quarter, as expected, both of those trends have started to improve. The benefits will be over time, given the multi-year subscription nature of the majority of that business. The WoodMac team continues to do a great job managing the business to outstanding relative performance. The category revenue growth was reduced also by a decline in environmental health and safety solutions due to lower demand following the late 2015 completion of GHS standard-related implementation. Financial services revenue declined 0.5% in the quarter. The recent acquisition of Fintellix closed on March 31 and is contributing to revenue in the second quarter. Strong growth in media effectiveness and good growth in core banking solutions were offset by a couple of long-term government customers and a non-core customer who concluded their contracts in the fourth quarter. Those combined contracts contributed about $11 million for the full year 2016. Additionally, we typically see a seasonal step-down after Q4, which did occur this year as well. We remain optimistic about delivering growth in 2017 and building on what is a great dataset and analytic capability. Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 4.2%. The stable growth demonstrates the value to our longstanding insurance customers as well as contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the recent acquisitions. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.9%, reflecting our 2017 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as predictive models and Electronic Rating Content. While still early, we're encouraged by the strong efforts to drive new product development in this part of the business. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 3.5% in the quarter. Growth was led by subscription revenues. We have some components of this line that are purchased transactionally, which is where we are seeing more variation. EBITDA decreased 1.1% in the quarter to $246 million. The reported decline was a result of timing of revenue related to operating expenses, legal and acquisition costs, and the prior year true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance that occurred in the quarter. The combined cost of revenue and SG&A increased 5.9% or $15 million in the quarter. The increase was just 3.3% on an organic basis as we continue to manage expenses. EBITDA margins as reported were 48.9%. Margins were reduced by about 80 basis points due to acquisitions and about 60 basis points due to legal and transaction fees in the quarter. Total acquired revenue – sorry – total acquired EBITDA in the quarter was break-even. Acquisitions we're doing are close to the core with well-defined paths to top-line growth and margin expansion. Margins were also impacted in the quarter by our decision to grow expenses to support a multi-year view of revenue expectations as well as investment opportunities we've been discussing with you. Margins by segment were affected by rebalancing of our technology resources to reflect internal priorities as our Decision Analytics businesses expand the data sources they own and that serve as the foundation for their solutions. Our data storage needs are growing. Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at March 31, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was 2.2 times, below our 2.5 times reference level. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.5%. Adjusted net income in Q1 decreased 1.6% to $125 million. The average diluted share count was 170.2 million in the quarter and we bought about 1.3 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $81.24. Our repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. On March 31, 2017, our diluted share count was 169.4 million shares. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.74 in the quarter, a decrease of 1.3%. Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased because the quarter's unusually modest revenue growth was more than offset by a higher tax rate and currency effects. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $318 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 12.8%. Capital expenditures increased 22.9% to $31 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. CapEx was 6.2% of revenue year-to-date. Free cash flow increased 11.8% to $287 million for the three-month period ended March 31. Free cash flow was 116.7% of EBITDA as we continue to collect more cash in our seasonally strong Q1. Growth in free cash flow was driven by strong working capital management, highlighting an important aspect of our business model. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value. As you think about your models for 2017, currency will continue to be a headwind in 2Q, moderating a bit as we move into the second half based on current exchange rates. To help you look at the FX impact, the following 2016 total revenues are restated at the March 31, 2017 rate. If rates were unchanged from March 31, 2017, these would be the base for the organic constant-currency revenue growth for the remainder of the year. Most of the FX impact falls within the energy and specialized revenue line items in Decision Analytics. For 2Q 2016, the revenue would have been $490 million versus the reported $498 million. For Q3 2016, it would have been $494 million versus the reported $498 million, and for Q4 2016, the revenue would have been $505 million versus the reported $506 million. You'll also recall that merit increases go into effect April 1, which typically creates a seasonal step-up in the expense base. So there's a natural step-down in margins from Q1 to Q2, all else being equal. The net of many of these factors is that we continue to expect growth to improve as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. In addition, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization of $130 million to $135 million, up from what we expected last quarter as we were able to move projects into service faster than we had planned and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. Based on our current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to be around $113 million. This includes non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. And in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% for the tax effect on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect the diluted weighted average share count of about 171.2 million shares. We look forward to ramping results through 2017 and beyond. We're excited about the opportunities to invest as we work to drive long-term free cash flow. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long-term. We also continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. First I guess, just want to follow-up on Scott's comment that, I think you said for the full year you expect insurance and financial services to grow consistent with history. But I think you also – given the loss of those contracts, can you help us understand – I guess more specifically, what you mean by consistent with history? And I guess, can you see Argus get back to the growth rates? I mean, that implies a pretty significant growth rate, so any more color, I guess, on the recovery from here?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Right. Well, one of the things to know about Argus is that it is sort of, I would say, a constantly dynamic environment in the sense that we are able to and are reaching out to new customers consistently. And so the right way to think about the business is that the customer list grows. There were these rotations of the government customers that we noted for you. But it is a dynamic set of customers, as well as a dynamic set of offerings where the media effectiveness solutions are really finding their mark. And so it will be a combination of new names on the customer list and increased levels of spending with customers that are already on the customer list.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And I guess mathematically, I think in the past, insurance and financial services have combined to grow kind of 7% to 8% the last few years. Is that the number that you're thinking of?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes, that's exactly what we're saying.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: And is that an organic or including some of the acquisitions?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Organic.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: On financial services, it seems like growth or revenues maybe more dependent on large projects than I previously appreciated. So just – how much – how many large projects or what's the exposure to large projects do you still have in the revenue base there? And I heard that some slipped out of Q1, but just what's the visibility into the pipeline? And then I guess more importantly, how do you think about the long-term growth rate for Argus?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. So let me start with sort of the second question first, Jeff. We remain very positive about Argus' intermediate and long-term growth. The strength of where we start from, which is a very unique insight into patterns of consumer spending, we are continuing to find very good ways to commercialize that. And we're also finding ways to take the platform and expand it overseas. And so those trends are going to continue, basically. And so we feel very good about the growth profile. There is – as companies become – I mean, our customers become more aware of and aligned to the opportunity that they have to make use of these newer kinds of data analytics that they haven't made use of before, there are moment in time effects where they kind of get into the new methods and so, you do tend to get a bit more lumpiness when that happens. It's really just the nature of the beast. And the rotations out by, for example, the government customers, I think are very, very specific to their situations and their conditions and really don't reflect the overall commercial potential of what's here. But there is that effect even inside of what end up looking like subscription revenues because there is sort of a moment in time at which customers get into the new methods and that will sort of create a lump of revenue at a moment in time.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then in terms of the moderating industry headwinds that you called out, I heard Eva's comment about reinsurance, I guess stabilizing, but could you just broadly characterize your view of the insurance end market right now? So I guess reinsurance stabilizing, but what are your thoughts on other areas of the insurance ecosystem headwinds getting better, worse, stable, et cetera?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure. This is Mark. Good question. So let me start with the reinsurance side of things. So clearly, it's a very soft market from a reinsurance perspective, which puts pressure on our customers. That remains. At the same time, what we have highlighted is there's a lot of industry consolidations. When industry consolidations happen that also commonly interacts with our contracts with what is now one as opposed to two entities. That headwind has kind of almost cycled through. So that's good news with regard to cycling through. We've addressed kind of those concerns and how we want to contract with customers going forward and what we're also seeing is some volumes back into what I'll refer to as the securitization market. We see customers kind of ramping up to continue to do business as they always have. And as they look to expand and as they look to basically grow their businesses, both on the insurance side as well as the reinsurance side. They're looking at new avenues, whether it's cyber as an example. How are they going to move their books to new, what I'll refer to, is casualty-type of extreme events. So that's a good, constructive approach for the industry and we're kind of on the cutting edge with a lot of that. So that's a positive. I would say to you that I don't see a lot of dramatic change inside the insurance industry, except for the ones I've highlighted in the past. There is a tremendous amount of technology – InsureTech that is happening. People are installing new systems. They're transitioning over. They're really looking to do the big data analytics thing. They're really looking to do digital engagement because people expect kind of better online engagement, like they would with an Amazon or when they're buying product on the web. All of that has created a nice opportunity for us to get involved in those – kind of those projects to redefine how they want to see the future. So, tough time, but good opportunities for us in light of the changes happening. So...
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you, both.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: My first question is, I guess in the past, you've given your expectations for insurance in that same 7% to 8% camp. And then financial or Argus in the mid-teens. And now, you're sort of grouping them together and giving that guidance and from the comments, it sounded like you already reiterated your confidence in Argus. And so is the missing piece here then the natural insurance slowdown until all your investable opportunities, whatever, start coming to fruition? Is that how we should think of it?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No. Manav, it's Eva. Maybe I'll just take it up a level just – as – I know, we always try to have discussions at very detailed levels. But fundamentally, I think what we're trying to tie our confidence to in the statements that Scott made around insurance and financial combined and the growth targets we have there is, we've made comments in the past about our overall long-term growth targets organically for Verisk Analytics. And the statement that Scott made ties very closely to that. Obviously, at the current moment in time, energy's at a moment where it's not at those levels. I think we've talked about that. I think the team is doing a great job. So really, how we've dimensioned it, I would think about it that way because we're – as Wood Mackenzie works through the energy cycle and is doing a great job, putting in that overall bucket at the moment in time would not be appropriate. So that's really what we're trying to message when we're talking about those two on a combined basis.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, got it. And then Scott, of those 20 opportunities, you mentioned a bunch of the different, I guess, bigger headlights and what – the stuff you're working on there. I mean, I think we've heard of telematics and imagery before, but is there any hierarchy or any sort of opportunity that stands out more than the others? Because some of the stuff like you mentioned like machine learning and Internet of Things seem fairly broad.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, the way that we're going to provide for our growth near and long-term actually is to operate on a number of fronts. And you've got some themes like Internet of Things broadly, like cyber as a theme, where the use cases, the path to commercialization is still sort of emerging. But that doesn't mean that the ideas are anything other than very good ideas and ones that we feel like we have special contributions to make. But in the sort of intermediate term, two themes that are – the ones that you've heard us talk about a lot, actually, and we really do have a lot of enthusiasm for are the interpretation of remote imagery, which we think is a very important theme for any number of reasons, including remote imagery and the interpretation of it can apply across multiple verticals and actually, multiple geographies. And the other one that I would point to is, in fact, telematics and especially vehicle telematics, where we just – we are – we can see, in our own experience, sort of the rising volumes of data and the increasing attention to those datasets and those analytics among our existing customer base. So, you've heard us talk about those two a lot. But that doesn't mean that they're tired in any sense. In fact, we think we're kind of in the early stages of both of those being important inside of our business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot, guys.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. Just a question on the energy business, could you remind us what percent of your contracts are sort of multiyear? And do you see energy getting worse here or is that just primarily currency?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes, so on the first question, I would say, it's roughly half that are multiyear. And I think we've talked about in the past how we pick moments in time where we're responsive to customers and also market conditions where we choose to pull those out or shorten those. And what I would say is just with regards to WoodMac, we do continue, just in the reported results, to see some lag effect from the customer management in previous periods. But as we look at the business signing today, we're really seeing good growth in renewal signings, cross-sell, we have existing products. We have new solutions added from acquisitions over the past year or so. So we like how the year is shaping up so far.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. And then just a question on capital allocation, leverage is pretty low. It doesn't seem like there's any significant scale deals outside of the current verticals that you're in. Maybe if you could just frame for us your appetite to put on a dividend here, given your highly reoccurring revenue base, and with regard to that, the $100 million buyback. Is that a run rate we should expect going forward?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. So, let me start with that. Eva might want to add a little something to this. But I want to go back to kind of the premise of your question. We actually have always seen the M&A program as being sort of the complement to our program of internal investment. One of the values that we believe that we bring to our investors that is unique is that we have hundreds of people walking the halls of our customers on a daily basis. And being in such close contact with our customers, we're able to see the solutions that are making a difference for them. First and foremost, our own, of course. But, we're actually able to see other third parties and knowing where we think value lies and what our strategy is about and having this intelligence in terms of what else is going on in the market, we will always lean into the program of M&A. And in fact, if anything, we've really redoubled our efforts to enlist everybody to be a part of the M&A team. And so, we don't see it as a world, a situation where there isn't opportunity. In fact, we think that there is opportunity. So I just needed to start with that because the way that we think about capital, we certainly care deeply about deploying capital effectively. The program of M&A has been highly productive for our investors and we believe that it will continue to be. We're very comfortable returning capital and we've done so and we've done so steadily. Whatever is the right way to deploy capital is what we're going to do on behalf of our shareholders. To-date, it has not occurred to us that a dividend was necessarily a part of that mix. We ask the question routinely. We'll continue to ask the question. But so far, I think you've seen in our behavior that we're not only comfortable returning capital in the form of buybacks, but we have done so and I think you should continue to expect us to do so. So there will be a balance there. There always has been a balance there and there always will be a balance there.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And maybe just to answer your specific question about run rate, I think just tying into how Scott described our capital allocation, our first filter that we look for is buying interesting companies that meet our distinctives that add to growth, that add to customer solution. And then after that filter is put in place, the next filter is our stock repurchase program and that's going to be keyed off, as it always has been, the value of the stock at the moment in time and we are managing that not to accretion/dilution, but rather actually to the returns like our investors would as well. So when you ask about run rate, we don't actually design our program as a run rate program. It's going to be a function of that initial filter around M&A and obviously, I think, as you know, M&A isn't sort of quarter-by-quarter, you chunk it in. And so that repurchase rate will vary across the year depending upon what that filter and what that pipeline looks like.
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you so much.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Morning.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the question. As I think about Verisk and my experience with the company, I would describe the business, insurance business generally, as being relatively unexposed or underexposed, I guess, to insurance end market fundamentals. I wonder if you can comment, sort of qualitatively on whether or not you think (35:59) changed and accordingly would it – does it influence the type of products you're developing, the time to market, our expectations for return on the investments you've been making and so forth. So I appreciate the comment on the reacceleration of revenue growth. I just wonder if there's something that's sort of fundamentally changed in the relationship between Verisk's insurance business and the end markets it serves.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. No, we really don't think that and as you would imagine, we actually are very alert to that and would be quite sensitive if we thought there was something there. But, no, actually, I mean, if you look at industry structure, there – I mean there's like one larger merger that is sort of in the process of ratcheting through. And as we've discussed many times on these calls and in other forums, when something like that occurs, where those two companies are concerned, there may be a moment in time, adjustment. But, yes, I mean that's kind of normal course business from our perspective. And the regulatory environment really is not changing. It's not particularly dynamic. And so kind of from that perspective, the environment in which we do our business is more or less the same. When I talk to the chief executives of other insurance companies, as I do routinely, what they are really about is changing their methods and trying to find ways to grow their businesses. That's fundamentally what they're giving attention to. And we stand in that stream of activity for them. Do they have healthy amounts of self-respect and want to make sure that they're getting ultimate value from a partner like us and do they like to talk to us about the invoices that we send them, et cetera? Sure. And they always have. But I don't really think – if you go back 15 years, you could find moments when premiums went up pretty substantially year-over-year. That has not recurred for quite some time now. So our mission is the same as it's always been, which is to do a fantastic job of relating to our customers and bringing them new sources of value. I think they're as open to that as they've ever been. I think that we are more innovative than we've ever been. And that's really what's going to determine the outcome as we go forward. I will say, we definitely need to keep our feet moving. Their issues modify and change and we need to be right there as they do. So it's not a question of staying where we are. We have to be extremely energetic. But I don't think anything has changed in terms of our standing with them.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And if I play devil's advocate and say, okay, Verisk has been investing in a lot of these new solutions, which I think you enumerated, Scott, for a while, and you just had a tough quarter with some external pressure. Why is it now that all of a sudden, at least it feels that way from the outside looking in, some of these new solutions gain traction? Are there specific contracts or customers to which you can point that create sort of a coincidental inflection point in the growth from some of these new offerings?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, that is why we have the view that we have of the rest of 2017 and beyond. As we know specifically what is going on in the business, specific customers, specific contracts and so, yes, I mean that's – whenever we're reporting to you, whenever we make a forward-looking statement, it's on that basis. That's how we think about our business.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I'll give a little color, if it's helpful. One of the things that we try to always do is take a look at what's committed from the standpoint of contracts, what's implementing, when and I think what we've seen is two things. About 2/3 of our kind of need for revenue growth is committed in the form of kind of contracted price escalation, contracted new products, contracted new customers and what remains is kind of a new sale type of target that is reasonable in light of what we've done in the past and reasonable in light of what we have in our pipeline. So we continue to feel good about the full year.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thanks very much.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, I just wanted to get delve a little bit more into Mark's good feelings about the rest of the year. So if we ended up at about, let's see look, so (41:01) 2.5% organic growth in Q1, you adjust for the true up, it will probably be about 3.3%. So, I wanted to ask about the pace of acceleration towards that 7% to 8% target and the 7% to 8% target being the level at which all businesses are firing on all cylinders. And are we thinking you could get there at the end of 2017? Or maybe we're thinking more of the end of 2018? I'm just trying to get a sense for the pace of the acceleration.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. Just to reiterate, that was a 2017 comment. So just to say it again, the rate of organic growth for our combined insurance and financial services businesses we think will be on a historic trend, in that 7% to 8% range for the full year.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And as it relates to insurance, I'll reiterate to the extent that we think of the incremental growth that we need, about 2/3 of it, we believe, are committed in the form of contract with 1/3 or so of this incremental being, let's go, get it and that's new sales.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And just to wrap on, I think you're asking a question about ramp, I think you know the nature of our business where we have a large portion of subscription contracts which is a real positive for us, but that also means is a subscription starts July 1, that starts contributing then. So naturally, as you layer in subscriptions, that layers into the growth across the rest of the year.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask about the international expansion opportunity. You've talked in the past about an opportunity in banking, also an opportunity in insurance. I want to know if we could get an update on that and also maybe talk a little bit about how cloud receptivity by the client base is playing into that.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. So first of all, with respect to international, there are some – we're presenting differently internationally than we used to. WoodMac has always been international. But I'm – and actually, Argus has always had a strong dimension of that. But the – I just want to underline the Fintellix acquisition and the additional reach that that provides to the Argus franchise, which is a really good news. Over on the insurance side, we are presenting credentials and presenting solutions at a level and to a set of customers that we kind of haven't before, basically. I mean we were aware of them. They were aware of us, but we are now in a position to be able to make large proposals to name brand companies. We've always been able to do that in the reinsurance vertical. But now in the insurance vertical, we are increasingly positioned to be able to do that. It's really very exciting, actually. Nothing is going to occur overnight in vertical data analytic lands the way that we do things. But we are quite encouraged actually by what's going on there.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you very much.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Scott, I was hoping if it's okay to look back to 2016. Looking back to early 2016, Verisk thought the insurance vertical, in total, would accelerate for full year 2016 and then later, contract starts seemed to slip and the insurance vertical didn't accelerate for full year 2016 and so what I want to know is the contract wins that you got from last year that you thought would ramp and then didn't ramp, are they ramping now?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. It's all a part of the overall view that we gave you. I mean, we've got thousands of customers. And it's depending upon which part of our company we're talking about. But so the effect, the overall effect in our business is the accumulation of a lot of different things that are going on. But fundamentally, the relationships with the existing customers are as strong as ever. We are pushing out internationally, which isn't yet an overwhelming effect but it's positive, it's constructive, and new solutions continue to find their way. And it's really at the intersection of all those things that our results occur.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.
Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. This is Patrick in for Toni. I wanted to go back to the stream of new products. How should we think about the relative commercial impact of the new products you're currently developing or rolling out across the insurance business, as compared to the classic products you developed and rolled out over the last three years? I'm wondering if there are just fewer home runs left to hit in that market.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No. I don't feel that way at all. In fact, I think some of the newer solutions have probably above average potential. And it may – those of you who have sort of been with us for a while, if we keep saying the same things like remote imagery analytics and Telematics that may sound like there's nothing new there. In data analytic land, particularly in vertical market data analytic land, it takes a while to get to the inflection point. And then you get to the inflection point. And so, that's effectively the dynamic that work inside of our business. So, don't misunderstand us going back to the same themes and as you try to interpret our growth in any particular time period, you may be trying to sort of create sort of a 1:1 equivalence. Solutions, when they finally find their mark, actually have an unusual inflection relative to where they began. And so, as you would imagine, day-to-day, minute-to-minute, we're working on this absolutely as hard as we can to get established as well as feeding the pipeline with additional new solutions. I don't – it's not the case that the newer solutions have lesser potential than those that maybe we developed three to five years ago. I don't know if you want to add to that, Mark.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Only thing I was going to highlight, too, is I think we have a preference. I'd assume our colleague from the phone do that. We would prefer a subscription-type model. So as opposed to kind of going at it from a transactional perspective, we'd like to create longer-term contracts with customers and the revenue rec on that flow (47:57). So that is a way we feel that they'll use us for all of their transactions as opposed to selected ones, if you were to try to price it on a transaction. So maybe a little bit of a patient philosophy, but that's the way we typically worked up the side of the (48:14) solutions into our revenue mix.
Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. And in the Investor Day in December, you talked about a $2 billion TAM for Argus. I'm wondering if there are opportunities for you to go after that market in a bigger way with incremental investments in sales and new product development or perhaps more transformative M&A.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sort of reverse order on your question. The acquisition of Fintellix for example, we really do believe it puts us on a different foot in global markets. And there are other solutions other – I would call them kind of point solutions, data analytic point solutions that relate strongly to things that we already today that we are interested in thinking about. And that would be a combination of buy and build. But otherwise, the way that the Argus business advances is basically, we present credentials to companies that aren't customers. They find out the speed with which they can begin to commercialize the insight that we bring them from a data analytic perspective. So in a sense, I agree with the tone of your question in that the more that we can do to present credentials to an ever-expanding set of customers, the more of that we can do the better. That said, I think we've got a great team and I think we're doing a good job with that. But we're always leaning into how can we take this wonderful platform and leverage it?
Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Appreciate the color.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about the margin outlook. Have you adjusted the cost based on the slow start? And how much of the margin outlook is dependent on the growth this year?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. Well, thanks for the question. I think as I've mentioned, as we're talking through the quarter, we were modest in the growth in the quarter. Expenses grew about 3.3%. We are within that investing in the new solutions and also making sure that we've got the capacity as revenue ramps. So, I guess the way I would think about it is, we don't manage those expenses quarter-by-quarter because we are managing for the long-term growth. Certainly, as – if you see revenue ramp, that's helpful to margins as we go through the year. But what we want to make sure that we're not doing is that we're not being reactive to unusual, short-term events and disadvantaging ourselves for the long-term.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. And then on the energy front, how much of the rebound is dependent on oil prices and CapEx versus selling the new solutions?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: It's a mix of both. But when we talk about pricing and we talk about the energy business, it's not the case that there's this one to one correspondence between what the price of the commodity does and our growth opportunity. It is true that there has been – the shape of the price curve over the course of the last couple of years is one that hasn't been seen for several decades. It's a very unusual moment. Actually, if you think about it, the WoodMac business, there were two once in a generation things that have happened in the course of the last two years. One is that, the shape of the price curve is extremely unusual. And the other is Britain exited the EU, and the effect that it's had on their currency. Those are two real big effects, both of which are relatively difficult to foresee. In spite of all that, actually, I think the strength of WoodMac is seen more than it has ever been. But back to your specific point, I think that what you need is – what we need is essentially where we're getting to, which is a stable environment, one where our resource company customers are making money and leaning into investments on the front foot, basically. And they got, understandably, very defensive beginning late in 2014 when several of them had to borrow money to pay their dividends. So, these very, very major macro effects. But as they wash out, one of the things about Verisk is we're in the business of growing faster than the underlying markets – vertical markets that we serve. And we've essentially always done that. We've been doing that, 2016, 2017 we will – I mean that's who we are, that's what we do.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Arash Soleimani of KBW.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. A couple questions. So first, I just wanted to ask, within energy and specialized, how much of the decline came from WoodMac versus environmental health and safety? And then just continuing on that question, how much of that was subscription versus transactional?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So if you were to look in the segment, you're right. Those are the two key pieces within there. Obviously, WoodMac is a larger business than our environmental health and safety business. Although I would say that in the quarter, its performance was better than that smaller business. So there's sort of a balance between the two. As I said earlier, we still have some lag effects from previous periods in WoodMac. I mean, that's the nature of subscription businesses. And so that did contribute to a bit of the decline in the quarter. Also remember, you've got – we've got a lot of numbers in front of you. Now you've got three different growth rates per line, so if you're looking at the absolute reported, the currency effect from WoodMac would be the largest impact. And I think I talked about that $7.5 million in the quarter.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And then I have a question that's probably very, very, very long-term in nature. But just as we look at technology that's making cars safer and that ultimately will even make cars drive themselves, which will increase safety even more, that could have a very negative impact on auto premiums longer term. I'm just curious how that impacts Verisk.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. Let me take that on. I mean clearly, that's on the minds of our personal lines of writers. The insurance industry as a whole, I think has a view that that's going to make for a safer long-term environment for people on the road. It can save a million or more lives per year. And I think there's some views out there, you can kind of do your own research that, now, the personal auto premium could be something that looks at maybe half of what it is today. I think those customers are looking to ways to kind of reimagine their business and I think a lot of it has to do with moving into what I'll call small commercial lines, so micro business owners work on the cyber side of things. That very much fits our model. That's very helpful. They want to try to move into what is kind of a personal lines flow, meaning just, do it in an expert way without people involved, and they want to move that concept, which is on the personal lines side, to commercial. So those fit well into what we're trying to help them do that. The other thing I think we should just remember as a whole, a large part of the risk throughout the world is either uninsured or underinsured. And I think that's the biggest opportunity for the industry as a whole. There's a need there and I think the industry needs to find ways to ensure what is a very, very large market opportunity with better analytics and ways to assess that risk. So longer-term, bigger picture, but (56:17).
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I would just add that one of the things that will always be the case is, almost regardless of the size of the segment, the participants will still need to understand where they stand relative to the overall marketplace and part of what we do is we really help get a handle on what's affecting that whole space and also the relativity – excuse me, the relativities between the players. That will be an enduring need. So it's not just the scale of the market. It's also the need to pick apart what's going on in the market.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you very much for the answers.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, guys, morning. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Hi, Henry.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to make sure I understand in terms of the trends in insurance and the Decision Analytics side. I understand there's a number of moving parts in terms of the revenue growth. Just from an earnings growth perspective, is that tracking sort of in line with the organic growth post – or excluding the true-up revenue. And as a follow-up to that, in terms of the ramp-up that you expect from the new products in insurance, is that also a ramp up that you expect in earnings as well? Thanks.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes. So, there are a couple questions in there. So maybe just to start with, I think your first question is when you say profitability, I presume you're speaking on an EBITDA level. And what I would say is – I mean, what you see across the company is, we're managing expense growth to both fund the existing solutions as well as new ones and I would say that's the same within insurance. So I don't think you'd see dramatically different trends if you were to sort of parse apart the profitability by vertical because we are investing across all of the verticals. I would also note that in the acquisition front, there are a number of new acquisitions. In the quarter, those were essentially across all the acquisitions breakeven. Those are things that we're clicking into our existing business and we think that those margins will ramp. So you have those two effects within the margin. And then I think your second question was with regards to new products and the profitability of those as those sort of click in. Generally, similar to the rest of our solutions, the whole idea of build it once, sell it a lot of times. The more you put on the top-line, the greater the profitability expands. Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything additional about any of the specific solutions we're working on there.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So I think we were trying to address this a little bit before. I think we are seeing uptake in some of the remote imagery. I think we're seeing some uptake in our customers with telematics. I think we have good growth and opportunities internationally the way we contracted around that will be probably more subscription that it is on the transactional perspective. So as that uptake is more of a second-half story, we would also see that as hopefully helping margins because what happens here is we've already invested in or investing in a solution. So it's just the overall dynamic of the nature of our business. Yes, there is a lot of costs that are there and they'll remain because we're investing and once we start the uptake in revenues, there's not a lot of variable incremental cost sales.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Anj Singh of Credit Suisse.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you folks spoke to some of the contract signings slipping out of 1Q for your energy customers. Is that just timing randomness perhaps, or is this indicative of the end market that continues to stabilize? Just wondering if there's anything particular we should be taking away from that anecdote.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes, the comment was about the financial services segment, not the energy segment. And no, there is – it really was just timing.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, got you. And then another question on the 20 opportunities, Scott, asked slightly differently. Realizing these are longer-term opportunities, would it be fair to say that the internal augmentation or development focus is also primarily on remote imagery and telematics? Perhaps, if you can offer any color on which ones you've made the most progress recently aside from their good market traction. Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes, it really is remote imagery and telematics. Those are the places where they both represent very large opportunities and places where we're seeing commercial response to what it is we're doing. So we've talked about those a lot. We continue – we will continue for years to talk about those a lot because they're just that important. But there are a lot of things on the list of 20 that are very exciting across all the segments. And some of them are domestically-based. Some of them are globally-based. They all really rely on advanced data analytic methods and in many cases, are being founded on new kinds of contributory data, unique data that will help us to do things we think others won't be able to. So it's an exciting agenda basically. You get to a list like that by being close to your customers and understanding where their needs are going.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi. Most of my questions have been answered. But, Eva, kind of housekeeping one. Could – you were going kind of quick there when you were giving the adjusted Q2, Q3, Q4 2016 revenues. I was wondering if you could repeat that. (62:32) the $490 million, $505 million.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Sorry if I was going too quick on that. So, just to repeat, if we look to 2Q 2016 and restated it to today's currency rates, that would have been $490 million. The reported number was $498 million. For Q3 2016, it would have been $494 million. The reported number was $498 million. And for Q4 2016, it would have been $505 million, and the reported number was $506 million.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. And can I just – did that also exclude the true-up – the true-up was in the Q1 of 2016, correct?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Correct.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. All right. That was my...
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And that was just the reported number total translated at the currency rate.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah. That's really helpful. Thank you very much.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC.
Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. This is Gunnar Hansen in for Gary. I'll be quick. I guess, just the timing of the Argus contract, I guess, for the deals, have those been signed already in the quarter? And I guess, are those new contracts with existing customers or were they – some of those tied to some of the contracts that were completed in Q1?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Those are existing customers. And as we do multiple things for our customers, there is a layering of that. But I think, as Scott said, it's a timing issue and we feel comfortable and confident with that work moving forward.
Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess, with the energy and Wood Mackenzie, obviously, there is still some lag from some of your customers and the multi-year deals rolling over. I guess, can you kind of give us some more color on whether you're seeing greater demand or usage in various regions or some of the pricing terms? Are you guys looking to lock in into more longer-term deals? Or maybe just give us some more commentary on some of the improving trends you mentioned. Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Well, a couple of different things in there. One is the customer set continues to expand, as we've shared with you. The solution set continues to expand also where we're – you've sort of known us as the people that can describe the global supply curve, which is extremely valuable and very hard to do and a very, very nice sort of starting place – a strong place to stand. What we will get increasingly good at is and more of our business will be about is the underlying technical conditions and helping our customers sort of navigate those as well. With respect to pricing trends, we're always just – the WoodMac product set as all of our product sets, we're always stuffing more value in there. And that's one of the things that is productive where pricing is concerned. So you've got that effect. So, basically, new solutions, new customers and improving environment where pricing is concerned. That's basically going to be the WoodMac story going forward. The currency effects will wash out. And I do think that we'll see where this is the kind of thinking we're doing, but it may be that as the environment is improving, we may actually want to be a little lighter on our feet and actually sort of pull in the length of the contract so that we can – as things move, we can actually enjoy it more in real time.
Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Makes sense. Thanks.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. My first question on the energy revenue, I know we've asked a number on this already but as you mentioned that there were some contracts signed the depths (66:20) of the market and there's a lag nature to them. I guess, I wanted to specifically ask, are we therefore at the end of the worst of these lag contracts and you should actually see revenue growth improve? Or is that something will be playing through for the rest of the year and therefore, growth really shouldn't pick up until closer to 2018?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: We would expect improvement as the year progresses.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And I guess, one housekeeping question. Just on the M&A contribution from Fintellix, if you are sharing that as we build our models?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Typically, for the smaller deals, we don't share that in advance. It will come in April 1. So you'll see the numbers as we report in 2Q.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. Appreciate all the questions and interest in the company. And we will be back – and we'll be talking with many of you between now and then but certainly look forward to giving you our second quarter report in the near future. Thank you for your time today.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics fourth quarter 2016 earnings results conference call. This call is being recoded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Director of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.
David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Scott, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2016 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark, and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. All discussions of EBITDA reflect adjusted EBITDA, for which you can find a reconciliation in our press release. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I'll remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, we again delivered solid revenue growth, leading margins and strong underlying cash generation. The resilience of our financial performance while facing currency and energy and end market headwinds, reflects the distinctiveness of our businesses, the outstanding dedication of our people, and the value we deliver to our customers. In addition to a successful 2016, our initiatives during the year position us well to execute on our plans for 2017. Revenue from continuing operations grew 6% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. Organic constant currency revenue grew about 6% in the quarter and for the full year. With almost 8% growth in the quarter from our combined insurance and financial services businesses, the long-term underlying trends remain encouraging. WoodMac finished the year slightly better than flat, a remarkable achievement, given the end market headwinds. Profitability remained strong with total EBITDA margins in the quarter and for the full year of around 50%. EBITDA growth was around 7% in the quarter and excluding the prior year warrant sale gain was about 12% for the full year. Diluted adjusted EPS grew about 8% in the quarter and for the year and about 11% excluding the prior year warrant gain. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up 16%, excluding the one-time tax on the gain on the healthcare business sale. We were pleased to continue returning capital to our shareholders through our longstanding share repurchase program. We bought $144 million of stock in the quarter and after an additional $500 million authorization. We had over $600 million available as of December 31, 2016. With our leverage below our 2.5 times reference level, we have plenty of capacity to make strategically relevant acquisitions, as well as additional repurchases. We made a number of tuck-in acquisitions in 2016 and early this year, which collectively have brought us new data sets, adjacent solutions, distinctive analytics, additional markets to serve, and outstanding data analytics talent. In many cases, the acquisitions also accelerate our strategies, at a lower cost relative to a build approach. We benefit from our flexibility to decide whether to innovate organically or via acquisitions. We remain active in evaluating possible transactions in pursuit of our international expansion and vertical enhancement efforts. The foundations of our businesses remain the Verisk distinctives of one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first to market innovations; and four, deep integration into our customer workflows. Our success is due to the outstanding efforts of our people, who enhanced the distinctiveness of our business, as we focus on serving our customers with innovative data analytics solutions. We feel very good about our ability to serve our customers and drive top-line growth for the long-term as a result. We are well-positioned for 2017 with contributions expected from existing and newly acquired businesses. We continue to invest in innovation, and I'm excited about the multi-year opportunities for solutions under development this year. So with that, let me turn the call over to Mark for some additional comments.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we had several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation, and digital engagement. As we serve our customers with these themes in mind, we made a number of tuck-in acquisitions to complement our organic efforts. We made two acquisitions to enhance our strong position in extreme event modeling. Analyze Re extends AIR's capabilities farther downstream by providing real-time solutions for reinsurance treaty pricing, enterprise portfolio roll-up, and portfolio optimization. Last month, we acquired Arium, which provides modeling solutions and analytics for the casualty market. Our vision is to leverage Arium's capabilities to allow us to do for casualty analytics, what we've done for property analytics. Arium's solutions provide analytics for liability exposures, including visual and quantitative insights into accumulations in areas of risk concentration. These acquisitions got us to market faster and at a lower cost than if we had built the solutions ourselves. We also acquired MarketStance, a leading provider of data analytics solutions that enable insurers to identify high potential market segments of interest. This gives us a broader set of solutions with which to serve our customers' marketing departments. Another of our recent acquisitions was The GeoInformation Group, a leader in geographic data solutions based in the UK, where we are expanding. The GeoInformation Group offers large-scale mapping services and geospatial data and analytics solutions to a wide array of companies and public sector organizations. This acquisition complements our risk management and predictive analytic capabilities internationally and expands Verisk's footprint in the UK across multiple verticals including insurance, energy, and real estate. Finally, just last week, we acquired Healix Risk Rating, a leader in automated risk assessment at the point-of-sale for the travel insurance industry. This acquisition further expands our Risk Assessment offerings for the global insurance industry, providing solutions that are embedded in our customer workflows and can help our insurers underwrite travel insurance with greater speed, accuracy and efficiency. These tuck-in acquisitions are close to our core insurance business and support our deep analytic expertise, unique data and global focus. With that, let me turn the call over to Eva to cover the financial results.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we again grew both revenue and EBITDA, while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 6% and 6.2% organically in constant currency. For the full year, revenue grew 13.3% and 5.8% organically in constant currency. Our combined insurance and financial services businesses grew 7.9% in the quarter and 6.9% for the full year. As a reminder, organic constant currency growth excludes the contribution from recent acquisitions and reflects current period exchange rates applied to prior period revenue. EBITDA grew 7% to $258 million in the quarter and 11.9% to $1 billion for the full year. The full-year growth excludes the 2015 warrant sale gain. EBITDA margins were 50.9% in the quarter and 50.4% for the full year. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 6.5% and 7.3% organically in constant currency. Again, this quarter, financial services was the fastest growing vertical, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. For the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 18.5% and 6.3% organically in constant currency. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7.5% in the fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.3% in the quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by strong growth in underwriting solutions, with good contributions from claims analytics and repair cost estimating solutions. Catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to growth. For the full year, revenue grew 8.1% on a reported and organic basis. The full-year Decision Analytics insurance growth is consistent with what we delivered in 2015. Customer retention remains very high, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. Energy and specialized markets category revenue declined 0.3% in the quarter and increased 43.4% for the full year. On a constant currency basis, WoodMac was up slightly for the full year. We were expecting the results to be about flat, and as a result we were pleased with the performance. Consistent with our longstanding approach, WoodMac became a part of organic revenues starting in the third quarter. Revenue for energy and specialized markets excluding the recent acquisitions declined 5.5% in the quarter and for the full year, primarily as a result of the continuing end market and currency headwinds affecting the energy business. Financial services category revenue increased 27.3% in the quarter and 10.1% for the full year. Growth was driven by analytical and media effectiveness solutions. Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.1% and 4.4% organically in the quarter, continuing to demonstrate the value to our longstanding insurance customers, contributions of newer solutions, and the inclusion of recent acquisitions. Risk Assessment growth was 5.2% and 5% organically for the full year. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.9% in the quarter and 5.4% organically, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as Predictive Models and Electronic Rating Content. Growth was 5.6% for the full year and 5.3% organically. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 2.6% in the quarter and 1.4% organically. Growth was led by underwriting solutions revenue. For the full year, growth was 4% and 3.7% organically. EBITDA increased 7% in the quarter to $258 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.9%. For the full year, EBITDA increased 9.9%, resulting in margins of 50.4% and, adjusted for the 2015 warrant gain, grew 11.9%. Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter and $120 million for the full year. At December 31, 2016, total debt was about $2.4 billion, including about $100 million of revolver borrowings. Our pro forma leverage at the end of the fourth quarter was about 2.2 times. Since the end of the fourth quarter, we've repaid an additional $70 million. Our cash and cash equivalents were about $135 million at the end of 2016. Our reported effective tax rate was 32.9% in the quarter. For the full year 2016, the effective tax rate was 30.9%. Adjusted net income increased 5.5% to $135 million in the quarter and 10.1% to $532 million for the full year. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.80 in the quarter, an increase of 8.1%. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 8.4% to $3.11. Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations for the full year increased because of organic growth in the business, acquisitions, and lower interest expense. The increases were partially offset by higher fixed asset depreciation expense, higher taxes, and a higher share count. Excluding the 2015 warrant gain, adjusted EPS grew 10.7% for the full year. The average diluted share count was 170.2 million shares in the quarter, and on December 31, 2016 our diluted share count was 169.5 million shares. We repurchased 1.8 million shares in the quarter for a total return of capital to shareholders of $144 million. At December 31, 2016, we had $636 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. As Scott mentioned, we added an additional $500 million in December. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. Free cash flow increased 20.8% to $498 million for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2016, excluding the $100 million tax on the gain of the sale of the healthcare business and the $19 million ESOP payment. Free cash flow excluding the tax and ESOP payments was 49.5% of EBITDA. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise, and therefore shareholder value. Capital expenditures were $146 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $7 million over the same period in 2015. Capital expenditures were 7.3% of revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016. As you think about your models for 2017, currency will continue to be a headwind, with the strongest effect in the first quarter and continuing through the year, given the current sterling-U.S. dollar rates. On a reported basis, this will affect the normal quarterly progression we typically see. In 2016, the exchange rate averaged $1.44 before the June Brexit vote and $1.36 for the full year. At December 31, 2016, the rate was $1.23. At $1.23, 2016 revenue would have been about $25 million lower than reported, with the greatest impact in first quarter. In addition to the revenue impact, currency will also have a downward impact on margins. Depending upon your prior FX assumptions, please keep the lower currency in mind as you review your 2017 and forward estimates. In addition, you will recall that in first quarter of 2016, we had several million dollars of one-time true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance, which we discussed with you last year. And finally, please keep in mind that the tuck-in acquisitions are not yet at scale, and therefore are lower margin than the corporate average but proportionate to their size. The acquisitions we are doing are close to the core with well defined path to top line growth and margin expansion. The net of many of these factors is that we expect to see much more of a progression in both revenue and EBITDA, as we move through the year. In addition, we expect CapEx of about $160 million to $165 million. This reflects the opportunities we have to invest in some newer areas, in many cases related to people which fall both under operating and capital expenditures. Fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $125 million, and amortization of intangibles of about $90 million. Based on our current debt balances and interest rates we expect interest expense to be around $115 million, and we estimate the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. In the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% for the tax effect on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of 171.2 million shares. We're pleased with our 2017 plan while being mindful of the currency headwinds. We are excited about the opportunities to invest, looking to drive long-term profitable growth. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long-term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. First, just I wanted to ask for a little bit more color on the insurance vertical. I guess, the growth while you had talked last quarter that you didn't expect that part of the business to accelerate this year, I guess, it still seems to have been probably a little slower than you used to see. So can you talk about the puts and takes that you're seeing just, I guess, within that vertical?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Hi, Tim. This is Mark. Just I want to give you the color you're asking for. First of all, I think, we continue to feel very good about the insurance vertical overall, the combination of greater customer engagement in form of better interactions, higher level interactions, big topics being discussed, as well as a lot of new innovations we're excited by. Inside some of the macro, you do have some headwinds with regard to the world of premium growth industry consolidation, but I think those are to a lesser extent kind of more distinct and I think the team performed well, inside of a couple of, what I refer to as some industry slowdown, but we maintain a very positive outlook for the future.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: I guess just a follow-up in the context of that, I guess, tougher industry environment I assume that's going to continue into 2017. Would you expect the growth rate to stay at a little lower level in that environment? And is that the kind of way you're thinking about it now or how are you thinking about it?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So I would say to you that if you are focused on kind of the industry premium growth, a lot of our contracts now have kind of moved beyond and away from that. So there is clearly a focus on procurement and cost containment inside of our customers, so that's a little bit of what I was referring to. But in what I see is a lot of industry automation that's happening, people are relooking at processes, people are relooking at how their systems operate, and that has given us some big opportunities and some nice pipeline. The other thing I'll highlight as we continue to be talking about here, kind of U.S. premium growth, we continue to have aspirations and some opportunities that extend beyond United States, and the international global expansion remains a key priority for us as we look forward. So, I think we remain positive across the board there. I hope that's responsive.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yeah. And just to continue on that, one follow-up. The cat modeling area seems to have been the slowest growing part this quarter for Decision Analytics, as it was last quarter. I recognize the issues in the reinsurance sector, but are you comfortable that you are still picking up as much market share as you were in the past? You seem to have grown faster relative to your main competitor there even in the past, I guess versus lately.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So I think we are continuing to make a lot of progress there. You've probably hit on couple of the topics, although a smaller piece, the world of insurance-linked transactions is a little lighter so that probably has brought some of that revenue down a little bit. More importantly though, we from the standpoint of working with insurers and reinsurers we have been growing like we have in the past. I don't think there's any slowdown there. When we talk about industry trends though, there is a headwind relative to when – if there's industry consolidation among insurers. So you see some of that inside the growth as well.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Scott, I guess with reference to your comments early on in terms of being well-positioned for 2017 with new and existing solutions, I was hoping you could maybe touch on some of the new ones you were referring to, and if that changes the – I guess the trend in the growth rates you are seeing right now, if there's any material pickup that we should expect in 2017.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: The innovations are very broadly based. They cover many, many different aspects of the insurance value chain, and I'll just reference a few, but there are really so many. So we're working on helping our customers that are doing aggregate portfolio analytics with better portfolio tools. This relates in parts to what we added with Analyze Re. We have platforms which speed up the underwriting process. We have new data sets, which relate to among other things, the underwriting of auto policies, which is related to the Telematics Data Exchange. We're making better use of remote imagery in helping the claims and increasingly the underwriting processes to move ahead. We're bringing new forms of data management to the insurance vertical. One of the things that – and Mark was referencing this before, the big data movements. Last year, I spent a good deal of time with the CEOs of our largest customers. They are very interested in the nature of their technical environments. Everything from our potential conversion to more of a cloud basis, in terms of our computing being a primary consideration, but they realized that like a lot of companies in the world today, that we need to grow beyond the first version of the enterprise data warehouse movement, which was actually a late 1990s, early 2000 thing. So these are very, very significant topics for our customers, and I can keep going on, the overlap between energy and insurance. So it's very broadly based and that's consistent with who we are basically. We're very deeply engaged with our customers and so that's why we're able to move out on such a broad set of fronts. And Mark referenced before the macro environment, balancing the macro environment in the United States, as he said, is the fact that our ambitions are global and we've really had much less activity in non-domestic markets, but that's a factor which is here and which I believe will be increasingly significant as we go forward, so very pleased with where we sit.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then in terms of a follow-up, just with respect to CapEx, again I guess if fell in 2016 at least on a dollar basis and it's ticking back up. I mean, are there any unusual items in there or one-time-ish that need to be called out or just looking at it forward, should we think of 7.5% to 8% as the new normal for the CapEx spend?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Hey, Manav, it's Eva. Good morning. Just in terms of CapEx, I think, the numbers when you said it fell and it did not fall in dollars if you're looking on an apples-to-apples basis, remember we have continuing ops and we have the divestiture of Verisk Health. So I think as I said in the script, you actually saw dollar growth in the year. The percentage was about 7.3% in the year, so as we've talked about we've been managing that CapEx. We had some investment over a several year period where it kind of peaked and now we're kind of bringing that back down. What we're doing though really is we're striking the balance between being efficient with the dollars we're spending and ensuring that we're investing in that internally developed software, which is a lot of the platforming that we've been talking about.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it, thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Eva, it's Andrew. Given the healthy margins in the fourth quarter, I wanted to know if the company is positioned to have margin expansion in 2017 including the comments that you made about FX in the small acquisitions.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So thanks for the question, Andrew. I think as we think about EBITDA margins, as you know there are a mix of number of things that go in there. FX is certainly a weight on margins and the acquisitions, as we said, the small tuck-ins, I think their margins are appropriate for the stage of development they're in, but they are a drag on margins. So while we're not giving specific guidance in terms of the margin, I would say that those are probably the balancing factors you should consider when you think about your model.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Could you give us a sense of size of those two factors?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think that if you were to think about – we gave you the dollars of revenue on FX. That's about a $25 million drag, just apples-to-apples, if we were to use constant currency here. In terms of the acquisition margins, you can look just in the filings, we'll be happy to walk you through the math after the call, the margins for those, and so I think you'll be able to figure that into your model.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you. Just given the insurance industry comments, is the annual invoicing impact this year similar order of magnitude to past years to recent years?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So this is Mark. I just want to make sure I have the question. We have typically and traditionally invoiced around the holidays in anticipation of the future year. So this would be December of 2016.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Correct.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Timing and everything is unchanged. I think the second part of your question, I'm going to read into it is that I think with every passing year we've started to engage with our biggest customers to put in place what are longer-term contracts that are unrelated to premium. So what you'll see is a majority of that revenue that we would typically talk about in industry-standard programs is now unrelated to premium. It's all about a negotiated outcome. If they want to add a new service, obviously, there would be additional fees to be charged. But everything is consistent with the past. It's probably a little less focused on premium going forward.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. And then in terms of the increased cadence of tuck-in M&A, including a lot in the insurance vertical, is this just a moment in time where there's a flurry or is there something that's changed, whether it's culturally making everybody part of the M&A team or something about the end markets, something strategically, just a comment on the increased cadence of tuck-in M&A?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You really answered your own question. We about, I don't know, maybe 18 months ago or so, we basically really began campaigning throughout the entire company for the notion that everybody is on the M&A team. And what we mean by that specifically and relating this to the interest of our shareholders, because we're walking the hallways of our customers' offices on a daily basis, we actually have intelligence that is not available broadly in the world. And in specific, we get a chance to see other companies that are perhaps emerging and at least beginning to make a difference for our mutual customers. And so we've really just hit very hard the idea that that intelligence is an additional source of value for our shareholders. And so we have really engaged at an even deeper level with the folks in our business units, and this is the result basically. So no, I don't think that this is – it is a moment in time in the sense that we've put an increased emphasis on this at a point in time about 18 months ago. But I don't think it's a transient phenomenon. I don't know that we'll always be putting points on the board at exactly this rate. We'll see how it goes, nor do we start with the assumption that it's all about size. If they're strategic, we're happy to do midsized deals, large deals, smaller deals. But I would encourage you to think of the smaller deals as reflective of a very active strategy which is about expanding our source as a value for our customers. And as Eva said in her remarks, there's just a balance here between buy and build, and we're very open to what gets us to the valuable place fastest. So no, not a moment in time although something did change in our environment.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'm wondering just, Mark and Scott, as a follow-up on some of the competitive questions, particularly insurance. Is there anything you're seeing changing on the ground as far as new competition or new technology? And I'm thinking specifically within underwriting and maybe even geospatial and aerial imaging.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I wouldn't really point to new competition. I think that there are classes of folks that have money to invest who have been on the theme of insurance and are in and around it. I think a couple of private equity players and then there are a couple of operating companies that have had the theme for a while. But when you look at the actual operations that are out there assembling information, creating solutions, et cetera, it's really a very slowly – almost no change actually in terms of the cast of characters. So ownership may shift some, but the actual on-the-ground operation and delivery, I don't really see that changing very much. What you do have at the margin are some companies that come more from a big data horizontal methods approach and attempt to work their way into the insurance industry, actually not just the insurance industry, but if you think about all of our verticals, that's a theme out there, which is one of the reasons why we really beat the drum for vertically-oriented data analytics, because we really think that's a very strong place to stand and it's in the verticals the proprietary data grow up. So there are those kinds of players who are out there. And of course there is technical innovation as well. So for example, if you were to pick the category of drones, there is a list of companies who would like to help outfits you with one or two or three or five drones. That list of companies is as long as both of my arms. But the literal difference that they're making in the insurance industry today is low, is very low, very modest. And so no, I don't really – the bottom line is and this is actually true of everything that we do, competition does not fundamentally determine our opportunity or what it is that we're doing. It is all about our relationship with the customers and our ability to really understand their needs and harness methods and technology and data and get them to where they need to be. That is what makes the difference between – or spells the outcome in terms of, for example, our growth rate.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And when I look at WoodMac with the churn in oil prices, I'm wondering if 2017 is likely to be a significantly more positive growth year, how are you thinking about your view on WoodMac business this year?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Let me characterize generally and Eva might care to add something. But the point I really want to emphasize here is really the tremendous performance of Wood Mackenzie in the face of kind of historic conditions. And I was impressed last year spending time with the CEOs and senior members of WoodMac's customer set as well as our others, was how much depth of relationship WoodMac enjoys, we enjoy with our customers and the regard that customers have for us. And a very active set of new product initiatives, which I think are aimed at just exactly where the industry is. And so that's the bedrock. Those are the things which are really core. But definitely the conditions in 2017 are better than they were in 2016 and 2016 was at least the stabilization relative to 2015. So yes, the environment's moving in the right direction. And it's another part of our forward view of being very pleased with where we are with WoodMac. Eva, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yes, I was just going to add I think if you wanted to start with customer retention remained very high in 2016 despite what was obviously a challenging environment. And so that's really the basis on which we start to grow going forward, we start with the existing clients. One thing just to keep in mind is, as Scott talked about, we have new products. There's lots of things that we can sell. The fundamental base of WoodMac remains our subscription business. And so that will – as it creates stability in a downturn, it also takes a little while for that to kind of pick back up. So I think we're very positive on WoodMac, just remember that subscriptions don't turn on a dime, but I think we're optimistic about 2017.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open. Hamzah Mazari, your line is open.
Kayvon Rahbar - Macquarie Group: Yes, hi. This is Kayvon. I'm filling in for Hamzah. I have a question for you guys about the Decision Analytics business. How much of that is subscription and how much room do you guys think you have for converting it – for conversion, how has that been going over time?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think what you'll see is, I mean, you will less subscription in Decision Analytics and Risk Assessments, but still a very, very high level, and overall we're at about 80%, 85% in the whole company. It's interesting, because I think what you tend to see is as we're converting certain parts of that business too from transactional to subscription, we're bringing in actually new solutions which tend to start transactional. So I don't expect that over time you're going to see a grand shift in that as long as we're doing what we want to do which is create those new solutions.
Kayvon Rahbar - Macquarie Group: All right, thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, guys. This is Patrick in for Toni. So the first question is I'm wondering if you guys are expecting financial services to achieve another year of double-digit growth in 2017.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So as we think about our company, I think the way we've really framed it for the market is the total growth of the company and aiming for the organic growth that we've talked about historically rather than parsing it into individual segments. Certainly financial services has been a strong pro forma for us, and we think there are a lot of things going on within that area that are pretty exciting. But I wouldn't put a specific growth rate on it at the moment for you.
Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. And then it looks like normalized free cash flow conversion ticked up a few points year-over-year but remained below the 60% of EBITDA target you've talked about in the past. Is 60% still your target? And if so can you talk about some of the leverage you have to reach that goal?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I'm not quite sure where the 60% target is coming from. I don't know that that's something that we've stated. I think that we were very pleased with the conversion of the free cash flow. Clearly, there are just a couple of things that come out after you have EBITDA, I mean, you've got to pay taxes, so certainly we do that as we should. I would say that the working capital remains a positive contributor there. CapEx would be the other offset. So I think, fundamentally, we feel good about where we are in terms of free cash flow generation.
Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks, Eva.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Just a couple quick questions. On Risk Assessment, specifically property-specific underwriting, the organic there seem to have ticked down a bit sequentially. I was just wondering if that was due to anything specific.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So first of all, it's business as usual in property-specific. If you actually kind of look through 2016, you'll see the revenue there per quarter is anywhere from $42.4 million each quarter inching up about to about $42.7 million. We did sign a couple nice contracts in fourth quarter of 2015, so that helped us in 2015, probably creates a bit of a grow over in the fourth quarter of 2016, but I think it's a wonderfully consistent business that's had some stable growth.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And just a last question still on Risk Assessment. Is the hiring there basically complete now or is that still ongoing?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: It's a good question. I think we are getting through it, signing the right people. We're very selective, and we had some new initiatives in Risk Assessment that we're excited by and we're going to probably bring in some talent to lead those efforts. So not completely done. I think that will continue to have or add some expense inside of Risk Assessment as we progress through 2017.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you very much for the answers.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. I wanted to ask the growth rate question for the individual businesses a little bit differently. Is there anything we should be aware of from a business perspective that would impact the present growth rate that we exited 2016, heading into 2017, obviously excluding the FX in those individual business lines?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. I mean we're back to the same point we were on before, which is we've noted what's in the macro environment. And Eva talked about currency, Mark talked about the in the moment condition of the insurance industry. I would just add the financial services companies are wondering where they're at right now. U.S. financial services companies maybe on the one hand, there will be some deregulation, and on the other hand they've been dealing with mounting compliance requirements and have felt some squeeze on the bottom line, and we've talked about the environment in at WoodMac. But the counterpoint to all of that is our program of investments, and creating new solutions and our ever deepening relationships with our customers. Those two things are the wellspring of our future performance.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it. Okay.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And we feel very good about those things.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. And how should we think about the breakdown or the focus of investments in 2017? Anything you'd like to call out as areas that you're keenly focused on outside of the international growth? Thanks.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. I mean I would say that we're investing across all the different verticals that we're in and pretty excited. I think international growth is certainly a highlight as well. So I think it's pretty broad-based.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: We have noted for you all in the past that there is an increasing software intensity to our business which is essentially another way of saying that we're a solutions-oriented company. And I think that that's a true statement. But we've moved into that position over the last couple of years. I think I don't know that the relative software intensity is going up from where we are, but that's a drumbeat inside the business.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks so much. And just looking at the cost of revenue in the quarter that you booked, it was fairly high compared to last year. Were there any one-time items going on either this year or last year, and is this the kind of rate we should look for going forward in 2017?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think the best way to think about it is in aggregate. And as we think about the business and the cost of revenue versus SG&A, sometimes there are things that, that balance between those depending upon where we are in development versus implementation of those solutions. So I don't think that there's any conclusion to draw from that as you look forward to 2017.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): So let me ask the question another way. If I take the combination of cost of revenue and SG&A again, the run rate that we saw in the fourth quarter would be something we'd use for 2017?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I think that's certainly a starting point. Again, I think there are a number of things that go on within those numbers, but that would be the baseline (43:40).
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right, and one more quick numbers question. What should we be looking forward for stock based compensation this year?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I don't think that you'll see any grand shifts in that.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, good morning. I know you had a couple points about your international expansion goals being part of the M&A strategy, and I know you now have a hub in the UK on the back of the WoodMac acquisition. I was just wondering how we should think about your focus on UK businesses as opposed to other parts of the EU, given each country there operates very locally.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah, so let me start there and then maybe Mark will fill in with a little bit of detail around the insurance vertical specifically. But at the general level, first of all, we have beefed up our corporate development capability in Europe and we're in the process of beefing it up in Asia as well, so it's really an around-the-globe view of our opportunities. And that expresses itself both as acquisition. You've seen some of that in the more recent acquisitions, also partnerships, and we really like both flavors and we'll be spending time on both of those flavors. But I really compliment the question, Andre, because it really is the case that if you are a data analytic company and you take the data dimension of the data analytic agenda seriously, then you have to find this third way to operate basically if you want to be global, because there's the one form which is you make it wherever, Copenhagen, Detroit, whatever, and you export it around the world. That tends to relate more to physical goods. And then there's the second form, which is just you become utterly local, completely local in what it is you do, and the whole really doesn't become greater than the sum of the parts. If you're a high intellectual property company with the databases, you actually have to find a third way, which is you can manufacture your methods centrally. But I think in line with what you're trying to get at, you actually have to occupy each marketplace because there is in the world today and will be in the world increasingly in the future what I call data nationalism. Most countries work very hard to make sure that their data physically resides in their country. And in fact, the follow-on to the Safe Harbor in the EU was just a particular example of the general case, where there's just concern about where do our data physically reside. And so you do actually have to become local in order to have access to the data. So you have to be the third way or we have to be the third way anyway. And so we're working very hard on that, and that is everything from where we place our people to how we deploy our people. And so here's where I now want to turn it to Mark because he led us through a very significant reorganization towards the end of last year with respect to our go-to-market folks in overseas markets. So, Mark, maybe you want to talk about that, including how broadly based this particular program is.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, Scott. So I think what we've tried to do is identify markets that are, A), mature and like the U.S. markets. That's where our solutions act and feel the best. Obviously, we have the focus on some of the emerging markets too, but where we're currently putting most of our resources is also where we have customers, so that we have the ability to follow a customer to different geographies. So that focus has led us to really take a lot of people who have been typically in different business units and put them into what we refer to as our global business development teams. And those teams are working across all of our insurance operations to really focus in on different markets and opportunities across all the solutions we offer. So that reorg provides us with a focus on customer, better relationship with customer, and talking about Verisk, not individual point solutions, and that's starting to make a difference. The other thing I'll just contribute, and by the way, those business development teams are across the world. You had brought up UK as an example. Clearly the UK market feels the most like the U.S. market. There's a lot of movement between risks between London and the U.S. And as a result, we're most dedicated and most focused right now on the UK. And you can see that not just from an organic perspective, but some of the acquisitions we've done, whether it's with GeoInformation, Healix, even Arium is from the UK. So we think we're starting to make a difference and we are very much focused on bringing that opportunity, I call that third dimension to the cube here into a positive and profitable light here over the course of the next couple of years.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Maybe that's more than you expected, Andre, but we really care about this trend actually. You bumped into something that we do a lot of work on.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: We're glad to spend the time. Thank you for the question.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Chu with Bank of America. Your line is open.
David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning, thank you. So last quarter, you highlighted that there were some delays in implementation of contracts that have already been signed. Can you just provide an update on this?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. I think that we're progressing as expected. That's really a comment as its related to the revenue that would be received in 2016.
David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, got it. And then in regards to WoodMac, you didn't lose too many clients despite lower oil prices in 2016. So does this suggest that we shouldn't expect a meaningful lift to client count this year, despite higher oil prices?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: I'm sorry, you cut out just for a second we shouldn't expect, could you repeat that part?
David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Like a significant lift to client count this year, despite higher oil prices.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, I actually think that we've expanded, and I know that Steve Halliday spoke about this on Investor Day. We've actually expanded our customer base, fairly significantly through some of the new solutions and companies that we've brought into the WoodMac mix. So actually what we're looking to do is, we're looking to grow those customers into broader solution purchases throughout WoodMac. So I think you have to think about the customer base a little more broadly than just the core you might have thought about when WoodMac first came into the family.
David J. Chu - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC. Your line is open.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi. Good morning. If I could just go back to the international insurance strategy and opportunity over time, it seems to me, the key to the U.S. business or one of the keys is certainly the consortia data model that you've built. And unless I'm misunderstanding this, you really haven't had success creating organically the same level of consortia dataset to be the core in any other market, and I know you've talked about doing that successfully with the Argus business in other geographies. So why have you not been able to do that? What's the gating factor? And maybe more forward-looking optimistically what's the outlook for doing that to deliver the kind of business that you have here in the U.S. over time? Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Let me just put your question in a slightly different context, which is we continue to feel that proprietary data is an advantage and one that we always pursue. We recite it as one of the four distinctives, so it's always there in our minds. There are two ways that you can build a proprietary dataset. One is you can have an a priori discussion with the market you're trying to serve and essentially get agreement that let's all join hands and take the plunge together and start putting our data into one place where we haven't previously put it. That's the history of our early roots in the insurance industry. Argus has proven to be very effective at doing that. Wood Mackenzie is always about proprietary data, and it ends up being a consortium, but I want to relate it now to the second way that you can build a dataset, which is you can also go customer-by-customer. And you provide them solutions and as a part of having earned their trust, you ask for the opportunity to use and repurpose the data, which is flowing through your application. We do it both ways. We've always done it both ways. And in some markets that maybe that we can leap straight to the consortia, Argus has had particular success at that. And in other markets, whether they're defined by vertical or geography, we may have to do more of the second method which is on a customer-by-customer basis. So I just want you to have that perspective because we don't – we never lose sight of the goal to create proprietary data assets. It's more a question of how you go about it. Specific to the insurance industry, what goes on particularly, as you look at, I'd say especially Europe, is you've got differences in terms of both regulation and market structure. And of course those two things go together, regulation has an effect on market structure. And essentially Europe, European primary P&C markets generally tend to be more concentrated. And so the larger share player is naturally going to say, let me think about it a little bit more before I make my data available. And so that's really just a condition that we deal with, but we're not deterred in the least in terms of trying to move towards proprietary data assets. It's just the pathway maybe a little bit different.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC: And so what are the long term implications about the potential profitability of an insurance business overseas, given that concentration? Should we read into that, that it's unlikely even at scale to achieve the margins you've done here in the U.S.?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No, I would not draw that conclusion. If you look at the most profitable parts of what we do whether it's in insurance or other places, there is a very nice mix of businesses which are built on our priority consortia data, and businesses which are not built on our priority consortia data. So you can get there both ways.
Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, everybody, for your time and your interest today. I know that we're going to be – we'll be following up with several of you even later today. We're going to have events in the course of the coming months. Some of you'll come see us in the office, and we're looking forward to being with you. So thanks for your time today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics' Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recoded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Director of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.
David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Beth, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2016 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. All discussions of EBITDA reflect adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain severance costs and a gain from an investment in a business which was acquired by a third party. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures which we will reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, David. Good morning, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered solid overall results with total and organic constant currency revenue growth of around 6% as we continue to grow faster than our end markets. With almost 8% growth from our combined insurance and financial services businesses, the long-term underlying trends remain encouraging. Profitability remains strong with total EBITDA margins of around 51%. Adjusted EBITDA growth excluding the prior year warrant sale gain was around 6%. Diluted adjusted EPS grew about 8% and about 17% excluding the warrant gain. Year-to-date free cash flow is up 13% excluding the tax on the gain from the healthcare business sale. We were pleased to resume returning capital to our shareholders through our longstanding share repurchase program. We bought $73 million of stock in the quarter and we had $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of September 30, 2016. With our leverage back below our 2.5 times reference level, we have plenty of capacity for strategically relevant tuck-in acquisitions as well as additional repurchases. We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions in particular as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion and vertical enhancement. Analyze Re is a great example where we found a high performance analytics capability that complements the Touchstone platform at AIR. While the deal only closed last week, the teams are already working on integration and go-to-market strategies. We continue to make progress enhancing the Verisk distinctives of one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows. Consistent with our efforts, Verisk was recently ranked in the top 20 on Forbes magazine's 2016 list of the world's most innovative companies. Our success is due to the outstanding efforts of our people, including those who have joined us relatively recently. And I'm very encouraged by the growing enthusiasm across the company to serve our customers with innovative data analytic solutions. We see a direct relationship between the excellence of our employees and their commitment to creating innovative solutions for our customers. We remain confident in our double-digit growth forecast for financial services this year, and we still continue to expect WoodMac to be around flat in constant currency. In pursuit of our goal of insurance growth above the 2015 run rate, we are pleased with new contract signings and the performance of several newer, more innovative solutions. As you know, there's been some softness in the reinsurance market, and 2016 has been an extremely quiet storm season. In addition, a handful of customers have signed contracts as expected, but the related implementations are starting a bit later than originally planned. While timing is a factor as we cross the 2016 finish line, we continue to feel very good about the quality of our data assets. Our customers' regard for us is higher than ever according to our NPS methodology, and the long-term outlook is for continued revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mark who will make some additional comments.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we had several key industry themes, including vertical big data, industry automation, and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I'll highlight a number of positive recent developments. In the vertical big data area, we launched a new energy insurance group focused on transforming risk assessment, rating, and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power generation, and metals and mining industries. The group is drawing on deep domain expertise and proprietary data from our ISO, AIR and WoodMac businesses. The data analytic solutions will help global property and casualty insurers evaluate and select risk and manage portfolios based upon energy and insurance industry-wide data, rather than relying solely on their own experience, data sets and tools. We're uniquely positioned to be the first to market at innovating the intersection of insurance and energy sectors. One of our industry automation solutions saw a win as a leading insurer expanded use of A-PLUS, Verisk's Loss History solution, to conduct loss history evaluations at the beginning rather than the after the quote process. This change of workflow will enhance the experience of their customers while improving operational and sales efficiencies. Improving conversion rates through better customer experiences while keeping expenses flat and maintaining underwriting integrity is a forward-thinking, innovative approach to profitable growth. We continue to perform well in the cat modeling space. As an example, we're very pleased when a leading global player decided to select AIR's Touchstone platform as its primary modeling solution along with the complete suite of AIR's global catastrophe models. Their decision was informed by, in their words, AIR's detailed loss modeling capabilities and superior service. This follows the June 2016 release of Touchstone 4.0 which features a variety of enhancements designed to improve performance, workflow automation and efficiency, and the overall user experience. Finally, we continue to improve digital engagement in the P&C industry through the availability of Circular Authority for Insurance. This is a cloud-based analytic solution designed to help insurers better manage ISO content with tools to visualize, compare and analyze updates. The solution helps insurers plan, implement and track our filings with state regulators and stay informed on the latest insurance topics. This is a natural extension to the thousands of insurance program updates we issue each year, and we're confident that it will add value and functionality for our customers. With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. In the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth in the future. Revenue grew 5.9% and 6.2% on an organic constant currency basis. Our combined insurance and financial services businesses grew 7.7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 5.9% to $250 million. This growth excludes the prior period gain on sale of warrants. EBITDA margins were 50.9% in the quarter. Within Decision Analytics, revenue grew 6.2% and 6.9% on an organic constant currency basis. Again, this quarter, financial services was the fastest growing vertical, while insurance-focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7.4% in the third quarter. We saw solid growth in underwriting, claims analytics and catastrophe modeling solutions. Loss quantification solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. Customer retention remains very high, and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. Financial services revenue increased 24.5% in the quarter, led by growth in analytical solutions and media effectiveness. We are seeing good interest in the solutions we are building with our partners and continue to believe that our differentiated data assets position us well to execute on our plans in this vertical. As reported, energy and specialized markets revenue was about flat. The continuing weakness in the British pound remains a headwind to both revenue growth and Decision Analytics margins on a reported basis. Consistent with our longstanding approach, WoodMac became a part of organic growth starting in the third quarter. Organic revenue, which excludes PCI, Infield, Greentech and Quest, declined $5.3 million in the quarter, but increased slightly excluding the impact of FX. Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.3% and 5% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our longstanding insurance customers. Contributions in new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.4% reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as Predictive Model and Electronic Rating Content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue. EBITDA decreased 0.6% in the quarter to $253 million resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.9%. EBITDA growth adjusted for the 2015 gain on sale of warrants was 5.9%. EBITDA excludes a third quarter 2016 severance charge as we combined administrative functions following the WoodMac integration. It also excludes a gain on an investment in a company which was acquired by a third party. Decision Analytics EBITDA excluding the prior year gain grew 7.3% to $147 million in the quarter. Decision Analytics EBITDA as reported decreased 3.7%. EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 4% to $106 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management offset by increased staff levels following the previously announced talent realignment. Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at September 30, 2016. After using our proceeds from the healthcare divestiture to pay down debt, our pro forma leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 2.2 times, below our 2.5 times reference level. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 26%. We saw a one-time benefit in the quarter from a change in the tax rates in the UK. Adjusted net income in 3Q increased 8.1% to $144 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.84 in the quarter, an increase of 7.7%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations, both organic and acquired, lower interest expense, and lower taxes. The increases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, and the 2015 warrant sale gain which did not recur this year. Excluding the 2015 warrant gain, adjusted EPS grew 16.9%. The average diluted share count was 171.8 million shares in the quarter. On September 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171 million shares. We repurchased 900,000 shares at an average price of $81.72 for a total cost of $73 million in the quarter. At September 30, we had about $280 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. Free cash flow increased 12.8% to $429 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, excluding the $75 million tax on the gain of the sale of the healthcare business. Free cash flow excluding the tax was 57.4% of EBITDA. These numbers are all from continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses, the addition of WoodMac, and lower CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value. Capital expenditures increased 0.8% to $88 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, and we continue to balance the capital intensity of the business with investing for future growth. CapEx was 5.9% of revenue year-to-date. We expect for the full year, our CapEx will be about $10 million lower than we previously discussed as we manage efficiencies across our hardware and software spend even while developing more software for solution delivery. As you think about your models for the remainder of 2016 on a continuing operations basis, please remember that in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a one-time P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a non-recurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO and will exclude – be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. This is really the final item that will be associated with ESOP adjustments. For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx from continuing operations of $140 million to $145 million, fixed asset depreciation/amortization of about $125 million, and the amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $120 million for the full year, and we estimate the tax rate to be around 31% for the full year. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rates applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a full-year diluted weighted average share count of about 171.6 million shares before incremental repurchases. We are executing on our 2016 plan despite larger than expected currency headwinds and are actively engaged in planning for the future. We're excited about the opportunities we see for profitable growth and remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for the long term. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Hey.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Scott, you mentioned the softness in the reinsurance market does this impact your ability to grow insurance this year over last year or are you still confident that you'll be able to achieve that and could you just remind us of your exposure to reinsurance?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So, our goal remains the same and I did mention it just because it is a factor in the environment right now. Our exposure to reinsurance is primarily with respect to the work that we do in the cat modeling world, not exclusively. We also provide some loss distribution content to the global reinsurers, but it's principally through catastrophe modeling and basically and I'm actually mention two things that are in the environment right now, the other is it's a very quiet storm season and in fact, it has been a quiet storm season for the last several years. And that does interact with the way that the reinsurance market behaves. And so, there have been some combinations in the reinsurance world including the brokers. And so, you have that in the environment. So, it's in there. It's a factor but the business – our insurance business overall is really good. And even yesterday, we had a visit from folks from an extremely prominent global non-domestic insurance organization and they were essentially asking, how could they get closer to more of our solutions. I think it's a conversation that we were probably not going to be able to have even just a couple of years ago. So, that's kind of where we sit right now.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. And my follow-up is just on the expense side. You had a really strong quarter specifically referring to the 63% gross margin in DA. Just – was anything one-time in there? How sustainable is that? And just overall when we think about EBITDA margins of 51%, it's obviously extremely strong. So, what do you view as may the key areas to move margins higher, not that we're complaining? But, or are you focused on keeping margins flat and just plowing scale benefits or any sort of additional expense benefits into supporting future growth?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, you had a couple of questions in there. So, the first one, there was really nothing one-time in the results. And in fact, we're trying to kind of help you see that there were actually some one – there were some one-time effects in 2015. So, but no, nothing with respect to 2016. And it's really the same story that it's always been which is that there is definitely scale just built into the way we do what we do. And the offset is the investment in new things and we're actually just completing our annual refresh of our five-year plans. And I think we have the most robust new solution pipeline that we've ever had, actually. So, we're excited to be investing in the business, and that is the one offsetting factor. But the business continues to demonstrate the same scale effects as it always has. So, we've said we're constructive on margins in the intermediate and long term, and we're still in that place.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Terrific. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh, William Blair & Company. Your line is open.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. First, just on the energy and specialized markets. Can you – the organic growth that you mentioned was slightly positive on a constant currency basis?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Correct.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Can you help us think about the legacy part of that segment versus Wood Mackenzie and how that contributed to that performance?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Tim, it's Eva. Good morning. I think, if you think about the business, I mean, as you said, we have the legacy, we have the environmental health and safety, and some of our (20:35) analytics solution. And I think some of the comments we made last quarter would be reflected in the performance there. We had a grow-over from last year and some global regulations that went in place in the H&S, and that will sort of continue to be an impact on the growth you see this year. And then with regards to WoodMackenzie, what we've talked about is, for the year, we expect about flat growth on a constant currency basis. And we're tracking towards that. We feel good about the performance of the business there. And I would say sort of by degrees, I think, the third quarter, some of the renewals we've been seeing are positive signs, I would say, that the market continues to be in the state it's in, and so I wouldn't overweight that. But I would say that we're pleased with the performance at WoodMackenzie.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, on insurance, I guess, not to, to follow-up on it. To get to a faster growth this year than you had last year, it seems to imply you need a growth rate, I guess, for that vertical that we haven't seen in a while. And so, are there any like, kind of project or one-time revenue that can get you there? Or is it – I guess, can you help us think through that and anyway to size some of the headwinds, the storm season, the later start, and I guess, as we think about how that kind of impacted kind of the revenue for this quarter or kind of the outlook?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Tim, well, maybe just to start on your question, the insurance business and aggregate is split probably a little more weighted towards subscription than our overall but roughly if you think about 80%/20% subscription, non-subscription across Verisk Analytics, so I would say that you see a reflection in the business similar to that. So, there are elements that are transactional and others are longer term. I think, as Scott observed, we have – the storm season can have some impact both in transactional and some of the other items. And as we think forward to the quarter, I think we're just pushing hard to do everything that we can to position the business well for the future. And sometimes, we have implementation timelines that are not fully in our control.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey, SunTrust. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, all. Thanks for taking the question.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey, Mark, I'm intrigued by the vertical big data comments especially, I guess, the integration or overlap between commodities, analytics and insurance risk management. Could you elaborate just a little bit, I guess, and talk about what the long-term, you know, maybe the TAM is and the long-term potential to contribute to growth on sort of an enterprise basis. Cause that sounds like somewhere – an area where you have pretty good competitive differentiation.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, I think across the insurance value chain, whether it's in the front side of underwriting or inside the claim space, all of our customers are very much looking to become more efficient and improve on the selection of the risks, better pricing of the risks or literally doing claims adjudication kind of in an automatic way. They would really like, for the most part, not touch a lot of claims which would save them money and actually improve their own relationship with the customer. So, I'm not sure we've been able to quantify TAM for all of that. But let me just describe to you some of the bigger things that we think are important. One, we highlighted here, as you underwrite a claim – excuse me, if you underwrite a risk, you have a lot of information that is necessary to underwrite that risk. We want to take and move that to the front-end. We want to do that upfront so that people can be quoting with all that information in mind. And I think that's a big opportunity. I think the other opportunity we highlighted here was energy. So, bringing together the big data kind of world of what we do with WoodMac, and the information we have with WoodMac and what we do in insurance, we have found, or at least we think, that the energy market is a little bit more specialized – it's a little bit the expertise of the players in it. And they really have never had look at, and views into a pricing or a risk assessment approach that we would do with traditional limited insurance. So, this is more of a E&F type asset. It exists in surplus. It's the bigger players across the world and we think this is a, I would say, probably tens of millions type of TAM if not larger.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, thank you. And, the other question I just have is can you talk a little bit about the growth in insurance that you're seeing from international expansion of existing customers and whether or not you think about that as distinct from broader global expansion plans?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So, I think that's a great question. I think there's two ways we think internationally and as Scott highlighted, it's become very much a priority over the last couple years. There's two things I think we're doing well. There's a couple places, particularly on the claim side of things, where we have a customer, they're using us in a geography, let's use the UK as an example, they like the results they've gotten. We're able to demonstrate strong ROI, and that large global insurer takes us from the UK to other geographies and ultimately, I think the plan would be to implement across all of their operations. Once we get into another geography and we customize for that geography, one of the things that we always have to identify and understand is the insurance markets are very different. So, we have to locally customize the software and that's true of things we've been trying to put in place, so that we can then extend down beyond the one customer into many. There's other places, kind of the second tact we've taken is, we know markets that look and feel a lot like the U.S. market. It has maybe not the same regulation, but it has the same kind of nature of transfer risk, and we're good and knowledgeable that we can help them. And to the extent that is maybe U.S. speaking and has a more mature market, we're starting there because we can probably be most helpful. I think we've seen some opportunities to do things with buildings as an example. Big commercial buildings, we're very good at. We're very knowledgeable of a building that sits in some foreign location, has the same type of risk attributes as long as we can get an understanding of the property characteristics and we can relate a building in whatever foreign region to something here in the United States and we can build out with a lot of imagery. So, we're following our customers, one; we're finding like markets, two; and we have a kind of a team that's really focused on trying to accelerate our growth internationally.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman, JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Scott, do you still plan on seeing Verisk combine DA and RA insurance revenue growth to accelerate for full-year 2016 compared to the growth rates of 2015?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: As I've said, we're working hard towards that goal. That is our goal, it remains our goal. And I also laid out sort of what's in the environment right at the moment that is a part of the performance that we will eventually produce.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And that's totally separate from looking at DA financial services, right?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Oh, yeah. Of course. Yes.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik, Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. So, just wanted a little bit more color on the – I think, outside of the reinsurance market (29:33) and the quiet storm season, you talked about some contract implementation delays. I was just hoping you could give a little bit more color on that and maybe some examples of what's going on there?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, this is Mark again. Let me provide a little color. One of the great parts of Verisk is we're deeply embedded into our customer workflows and that's true of a lot of the competitors in which we go after. So, if you were to think about where we try to provide information at the point of underwriting. So, transitioning a customer from another solution to our solution just takes time. It takes a lot of effort from internal IT departments and we just can't always control the timing of those things. We also have contracts, so we know it's going to happen but the timing and where they want to roll out, sometimes they want to roll out regionally as opposed to across the nation. So, those are the type of things that we are kind of referencing there when we talk about timing. So, signed contracts, just look into push implementation where we don't necessarily have as much control as we'd like. I think the other comment or, at least, the other thing Scott referenced was in our world, we have a lot of subscription, pretty high visibility, storm, storm activity effects some of our repair cost estimates. There is a variable aspect to that and some of the contracts allow for additional charges when we have higher volumes. And just more broadly, if I'm to answer your question right, storm, storm activity creates what is maybe some pricing opportunity for both reinsurers and primary insurers and that helps the overall state of the market and really just the mindset of insurers who, at this point, are really focused on cutting cost as opposed to growing their book and growing their top line. So, little bit of a mindset as well as build transactional. So, hopefully that provides a little of the color you're looking for.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on Argus. Obviously, some really good growth there. I was just hoping you could give us some color in terms of the growth coming from the – what we knew of Argus in terms of the move to financial services elements of the business versus the more media effectiveness that you guys have talked about recently like, is there a way to describe the split in growth there or what's more exciting or where that's coming from?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. It's really very balanced. The growth at Argus is extremely balanced. So, as we've talked about before, there are data management solutions, there are analytic services, there are the contributory data sets, there is the media effectiveness world, there is international expansion. And all of those are contributing. So, I really wouldn't point at any one thing. But the wellspring of what Argus is good at is a remarkable ability to integrate large amounts of data, contributed data in an extremely efficient way and then equal capability at turning it into insight and putting it back into the customer's environment in a way that they can consume the analysis and the data very quickly. And so, all the things that I just mentioned are essentially expressions of that same capability.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari, Macquarie. Your line is open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi, guys. This is (33:13) filling in for Hamzah. Have a question about the talent realignment initiative in Risk Assessment and the overall hiring plans you guys have as you look toward 2017.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Eva, you want to take that?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Well, I think, as we mentioned the last quarter, we've been filling in the positions that we had targeted as a part of the talent realignment. Obviously, as we had announced that back in the end of 2014, there was some period of time during which those people had left and the new talent that we were bringing in had not yet joined. I think we've been doing a good job and you've probably seen a few press releases about various people who've joined us and their areas of focus. But I would say that we are working hard to have all of those seats filled. I think that we'll probably talk about this less as we get to 2017.
Unknown Speaker: All righty. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler, Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Thank you. On the WoodMac flattish organic constant currency, I'm guessing there's some customers that are under extreme distress or going out of business. So, I'm wondering what the positive offsets are to get to flattish. So, just looking for color around uptake of new solutions, any initial successes with broadening the selling motion. I think you previously said it was undersold. Just what are the positive offsets?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So, several things around that. First, customers generally have been under pressure, but I don't think it would be correct to draw the conclusion that, if what you're picturing is a lot of industry consolidation and the exit of a lot of players, fewer belly buttons on the customer list are out in the market, that's actually not the case. And in fact, one of the reasons why we were interested to do the small tuck-ins that we did is, in some cases, they actually serve different segments of the market. For example, more pure-play E&P kinds of companies. And so actually, the net effect of all of the acquisitions is that the customer list which used to be circa 1,000 is now closer to 3,000. And so we're obviously very excited about the cross-sell opportunities inside of that. Let me just also remind everybody that one of the largest segments that is served by Argus is the financial services world. There are a lot of folks who are interested in understanding what's happening in the hydrocarbon ecosystem that are not – I'm sorry, did I say Argus, in the WoodMac – excuse me, I'm addressing WoodMac. One of the largest segments for WoodMac is the financial services segment. And because there are a lot of folks that are interested in the performance of the hydrocarbon ecosystem other than the oil and gas companies and that segment has remained a very important part of what it is that we do. And then WoodMac is, actually yesterday, literally yesterday, launched a new solution, and new solutions have always been a part of the WoodMac story and I think always will be a part of the WoodMac story. And yet another thing which is in the environment right now is the oil and gas companies have really trimmed their work staffs, and part of the effect of that is that when the rebound comes, and it will come, I mean, you can just see it coming based upon lack of investment in CapEx. When it comes, the – our customers will be a little bit shorthanded in terms of talent. And so we think that they'll want to make use of both of our sort of products as well as our services. And you can see little green shoots of some of that even today.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Jeff, it's Eva. I'd just add, I mean, I think we've talked about this before but generally, the WoodMac client base isn't very highly rated investment grade type client base. So, it's not to say there is never something here or there but I think to characterize it overall, despite the industry pressure, it's a very high-quality customer base.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then on the Touchstone win, just how penetrated is that market in terms of either using your or a competitor's solution? And how does your market share differ between, I guess, U.S. and European-based insurance companies?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, let me help you out with this. This is Mark. I think if you were to look at the number of insurers, most of the larger insurers use multiple models, so they would use both AIR and the competitive model. What we have seen is more and more people are using us or at least we're winning what I'll refer to as the primary modeling spot. If you're embedded in the workflow, if you're a part of that underwriting decision, the primary model is paid more. The secondary model is used as a reference point and to make sure things look right and to kind of sync up (38:45) with other information. So, it's a checkpoint. Our goal and it continues to be is to displace the competitor and drive towards being that primary model in the biggest insurers where the competitors, historically, had a little bit more prominence. The other part of your question is, I would say to you that a large majority of (39:08) of the world uses models. In some cases, they own them themselves and kind of have their own internal staff. In other cases, they work through brokers and we license our product through brokers. So, I think everyone has access to the models. I think it becomes more prominent for larger insurers to own it and have it directly in-house for use by their internal staff. So, they're using more and more models, too. So, that's why Analyze Re provides an opportunity to kind of bring all those modeled outcomes together. You could pick a region, you could pick a model, and you can kind of look at across the book in a portfolio way to do that. I think the last part of your question is, we model 100 countries. It think it's 104 countries, all major parallels. We are listening to our customers where they think there's economic loss to be covered. And we will attempt to build models where there is customer feedback and demand, and we think we're pretty well covered, albeit we're always looking to improve and always looking to expand.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. There's also a dynamic in there, which is that there are new modalities of risk. So, cyber would be an example of that or a comprehensive look at risk in the agricultural channel, both of which lend themselves to the kind of stochastic methodology that AIR uses. So, when you think about cat modeling, I would just encourage you to open up the aperture on the view just a little bit. It's a little bit more dynamic. It's actually considerably more dynamic than just earthquakes and hurricanes and weather phenomena.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington, Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Hi.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, a question for you on WoodMac and the GEM renewals. If you look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, meaning adjusted for currency, GEM dollar renewals on a year-over-year basis, are those trending up, flat, down? And then, how do you look at that trend, how do you expect that trend to look over the next 12 months to 18 months?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, it's very segment specific inside of the customer base today. There are some segments, who's current situations are sort of more leaning in and growth oriented, and there are somewhere that they've been more heavily impacted by some of the trends in the industry. So, there's really no one answer which sort of covers all of that. The way that we manage inside of the energy vertical is the same way that we manage the insurance vertical, actually, everything we do, which is we take a comprehensive view of the relationship with the customer, so when we're thinking about making our proposals, it's a combination of when it's time to renew the existing product or products, but also we're always presenting new solutions that they're not using today. And where we come out on a customer-by-customer basis is essentially the net of all of that. So, I would say that in the current moment, we've had to be particularly thoughtful about the pricing on like-over-like when we come to those renewal points. Bear in mind, by the way, that there are multi-year – a number of multi-year agreements here. So, it's not as if that really predominates in what goes on. But really the outcomes in these negotiations with customers have really been kind of what we expected. And certainly, as we go forward and the environment normalizes, I think that there will be room there.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: And Bill, I just wanted to add. You asked your question kind of narrowly just focused on GEM, I mean, we've had this discussion before, WoodMac is much more than just GEM. We have a lot of offerings there. So, I just wanted to add that color.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Well, fair point. For my follow-on, I wanted to ask about – a year ago, we started to see some weakness in the non-GEM products, the non-subscription services like consulting. And consulting has historically been a leading indicator within the energy space for the other parts of the business. And I was curious whether you're starting to see – or how your consulting pipeline is looking there, whether that was one of the green shoots that Scott had mentioned earlier?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, as you know, we don't sort of formally break out the results between the different sides of the business. But the team, the consulting team has been very busy this year. And we actually are talking about as we move into 2017, ways to amplify that team.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Well, thank you very much.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is open.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Thanks. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Good morning.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Just had a question on the RA side. I'm looking at growth in the quarter. Could you just help us understand some of the components of that, whether it's just growth in end markets versus pricing versus new solutions? I know in the past, you mentioned that you've shifted some of the subscription agreements to value-based-type arrangements. Just trying to understand growth there and how we should we think about it for the next quarter? Thanks.
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, this is Mark. I think we've had a very high subscription rate inside of those industry standard programs, as you know, it's in large part the pricing and the invoice that goes out at the beginning of the year, and it renews, prepaid a quarter in advance for a majority of that revenue, in some cases a full year. So, good visibility. The things that kind of cause some, ups and downs if you will. Clearly, we have the opportunity to sell more where there's a customer looking to expand services or a new insurer concept. When two insurers become one inside of mergers, obviously that has some potentially negative downward effect on the way we kind of price. You're correct, a large chunk of the contracts today are kind of multi-year subscriptions, and they have kind of inflationary type of clause in there that is ongoing. Last piece of it is, inside industry standard programs, we continue to do a lot as it relates to new products and services. So, if you were to think about ways that people take our content and bring it into their own solutions, we call it Electronic Rating Content. That has been growing nicely. We've done a lot of work around analytics. We called it Risk Analyzer Suite. Those are the type of things. But because of the way we contract, it's usually multi-year and it's kind of spread evenly over the term. So, you've been seeing a pretty constant approach to industry standard programs from year-to-year-to-year. I hope that's what you were looking for.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. Yeah, no, that's helpful. And should we expect, I guess, an improvement from the current levels in terms of growth or the next quarter, the next year?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, I'll talk long term. I think we need to believe that the solutions and new solutions that I'll refer to as our ISO solutions team continues to produce is promising. I think there's a lot of analytics that are on the pipe. Things like energy we discussed here provides upside and opportunity. So, I think we generally remain pretty confident and remain pretty upbeat about the long-term prospects for insurance.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: We don't view it as a mature business and we manage very much as if it's not a mature business, but one that has the opportunity to grow.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of An Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on your energy insurance unit launch. Realizing its early days, hoping you can share some color on what the initial demand or commercial reception has been. And now that you've married energy to some of your supply chain capabilities, and now insurance, perhaps some thought on where you continue to see opportunities as far as products that combine your areas of expertise?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Sure. So, I think we always had approach where we want to work with our customers for any type of rollout. So, we brought all of our teams together to see what we have and what capabilities and solutions we have to help energy insurers including and featuring a lot of the WoodMac content. With that group together, kind of a cross functional team, we built what we refer to as a minimum viable product. It's something that could be used for demos and used for (48:18) and look into what really can happen. And what our attempt is always to work with partners, development partners, to build out and enhance that solution. So, we are – have gotten some very nice acceptance and interest from some of the largest players in that space. We have a couple development partners and we are anxiously looking to move forward and trying to move as quickly as we can on that front. I think it opens up some nice opportunities and really provides a little insight into what is a great opportunity to build across the two verticals of Verisk. You also had a comment or question about supply chain and I think that offers another kind of opportunity where a lot of different partners.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. We really like the supply chain theme because it lends itself to the kind of stochastic network kind of analytic that we're good at. And in fact, a lot of our supply chain thinking at the moment is directed at one of the most complex supply chains in the world which is around the hydrocarbon ecosystem. And so, we're actually – that's a place where we're trying to bring together sort of the pattern of thought, and the vertical market. The other thing that I think really ties our company together is large-scale data integration and data management which is just – and it's just the bread and butter of doing what we do, but bringing those methods across all parts of our organization and finding ways to make sure that we're commercializing those opportunities in all of the vertical markets. I think that's, by degree, it's kind of new business for us, and it's exciting. But that, to me, is actually the most – that's the greatest amount of connective tissue we have across the company.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And as a follow-up, could you speak to your media effectiveness business within financial services? I know you've been more optimistic on the project revenue opportunity there. But wondering if you have any updates you can share with regards to that view. It seems there's some discretionary pullback from some customers in that space. And while I realize you guys aren't (50:32) working on more subscription-type arrangements, does it all change your outlook for the more, more of the larger projects that we've seen in the past?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. Not quite sure what you're referring to with respect to discretionary pullbacks. We had one relationship that was project-based and then got sort of put into just a fundamentally different context. But, no, I mean, 2016 has been a year for the acquisition of some very exciting name brand companies that are definitely new economy kinds of companies that have essentially come into our method. And we've also continued to have a lot of success with our way of partnering with others in the media world to be able to say very unique things to companies that are using old media and new media. And so, it's a very good story. And, it's very broadly based. It's the same story as it was a year ago, exciting and growing.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. Good morning. So, what's causing the slowdown in implementations? Is it decisions on the part of the customer? And have you seen any cancellations?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No, to your last question. And, basically, some of the things that we do, and I'll actually make a comment about the longer term by the way, but some of things that we do have an on premises quality which require customers and their IT departments to do something in order to get hooked up to our solutions. And so, there are just kind of occasions where, as they're moving into our product suite, they just need to essentially to be sort of scheduling the implementations and that's something that isn't always entirely in our control.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. And then, given the reinsurance and demand comments, any early thoughts about maybe your outlook for insurance for 2017? I figured I would try. Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Well, we remain very, very excited about our business. And just this fall, having gone through long-range multi-year plans for all parts of the business including all the parts of the insurance business, I think we have the most robust view of new forms of value that we can bring to the market that we've ever had. I think the pipeline of internal opportunities has never been stronger. So, insurance remains a world where you can really think of an insurance company as an information factory and there are many, many insurance companies and they're all in different places in terms of their journey towards data analytic proficiency. They are all I think, in varying degrees becoming even more comfortable with the thought of third-parties like ourselves contributing to what it is that they're doing. So, the environment in general, is one that our approach which is vertical data analytics is a meaningful one. And we're actually having a two-day customer conference beginning tomorrow for our North American customers and it's very exciting. The attendee list is very exciting and what we're going to be talking about is really interesting, future oriented stuff.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani, KBW. Your line is open
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Quick follow-up. The tax benefit you mentioned from the UK legislation, did you say that was a one-time benefit or could it have an enduring benefit going forward as well?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. So, basically, there are two elements. There was about $0.04 in the quarter that was one-time. The rate basically came down by a percentage point in the UK and there, the change that we make to our deferred tax asset is a result of that, that's the one-time, but obviously the lower rate of one point will continue through the future.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: That's helpful, thanks. And, the other question, I know you said WoodMac, you still expect it to be flat for the year as you said before. Did you say earlier what the organic constant currency was for WoodMac this quarter specifically?
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: No. We haven't called that out quarter-by-quarter, but I think we're tracking to the full-year view. And the reason we talk about it that way is that's really consistent with how we run the business.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right, perfect. Thank you very much for the answers.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning. I'm outside here, so hopefully you can hear me clearly.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: We can hear you fine.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My first question was, in the past, you talked about efforts with the connected car and the push to kind of be the part or help to shape the ecosystem for data shared between OEMs, property insurers and drivers. I didn't know if you have anything new on that and how you are thinking about the opportunity there?
Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: So, we continue to be really at the forefront of this as it relates to the insurance industry in connecting OEMs and to others, together with insurers. I think it's just a very difficult process to try to connect with all the numbers, contributors, all the different OEMs as an example, and 300 insurers, 400 insurers that may be interested in it. So, we are making good progress with other OEMs, meaning other car manufacturers, as well as folks who do central alarm systems and connected home, things like that, because we think it will be a key element in understanding, assessing and rating in the insurance policy. We've made good progress both here, and it also kind of creates a nice beachhead for us in international expansion opportunities. So, I think we are a little ahead of the markets right now, but I think we are well positioned and Scott earlier mentioned, there's a industry conference we're holding later this week, and that will be a featured part of the presentations and we'll have some news information about that as well.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: My last follow-up would be the Argus partnership with Nielsen, some of the market impact of this has been tremendously successful. I was wondering, one, is that agreement exclusive or could you partner with potentially some of the others in that space which is growing rapidly? And similarly, are you thinking of any alternative areas where you could use Argus data outside of the traditional credit suite?
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Yeah. We're not, Andre, talking about the specific partnerships. I realize that there is sort of chatter in the market, et cetera. But we, ourselves, aren't really talking about who our partners are. But I will say that it's a rich ecosystem and we are relating to a number of players in the space.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: You're welcome.
Operator: I will now turn the call back to our presenters for closing remarks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc.: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We appreciate your interest. And I hope and expect we'll see a number of you at our Investor Day next month, and, which we're looking forward to. And until then, be well. Talk to you soon.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Director of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead.
David E. Cohen - Director-Investor Relations & Business Analytics: Thank you, Shannon, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for discussion of our second quarter 2016 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. Unless stated otherwise, all results we discuss today will reflect continuing operations. All discussions of EBITDA reflect adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the second quarter 2015 hedge gain and one-time costs related to the Wood Mackenzie acquisition. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. The earnings release contains reconciliations of several non-GAAP measures which we'll reference on today's call. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, David, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we delivered solid overall results with total revenue growth of about 16%, adjusted EBITDA growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 1.4% including the impact of the shares we issued last year for the Wood Mac transaction. Year to date free cash flow is up 21%. Organic revenue growth was 5.4% as we continue to grow faster than our underlying end markets. We've spoken of higher longer term organic growth, and the underlying trends remain encouraging. Profitability remains strong with total EBITDA margins over 49%. We're focused on leveraging our Verisk distinctives which are, one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into customer workflows and our core capabilities to add value for our customers and in turn for our shareholders. We're also seeing traction in new solutions that are being developed and continue to be optimistic about their long-term potential to contribute to customers and ultimately our financial performance. As we announced in June, I'm excited to have expanded the roles of several members of our senior leadership team. Mark Anquillare, who had been our CFO since before our 2009 IPO, is now Verisk's Chief Operating Officer with responsibility for our insurance businesses and our technology and customer experience organizations. Eva Huston is now our Chief Financial Officer responsible for financial strategy, including accounting, tax, treasury and investor relations. I'm also pleased to have appointed Nana Banerjee and Steve Halliday as group presidents. Nana leads Argus, Geomni and Verisk Retail. Steve leads Wood Mackenzie, 3E Company and Verisk Maplecroft. The strength of our platform and the clarity of our vision, combined with greater scope of responsibility for these four proven professionals, will support our growth agenda and global push into the near and long term. These are all natural evolutions from their previous roles and will help us continue to deliver value to our customers, employees and shareholders. During the quarter, we closed the sale of the healthcare business and used the proceeds to pay down our revolver, giving us plenty of capacity to support our long stated capital allocation strategy for a balanced approach over time to acquisitions and repurchases. We had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization as of June 30, 2016. We remain active in evaluating possible acquisitions, in particular as we make buy versus build decisions in pursuit of our international expansion. We also see M&A as a channel for expanding our solution footprint. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, you saw that we purchased Greentech Media, an industry leading information services provider for next-generation electricity and renewable sectors. Greentech Media joins Wood Mac, enhancing our research and other capabilities for subsectors, including solar generation, energy storage and smart grids that react dynamically to changes in supply and demand. These are very exciting areas in the energy and power markets and an excellent complement to our outstanding oil and gas franchise. I remain encouraged by the opportunities we see for growth both near and long term. We're excited about a number of early stage efforts where we are developing new and innovative solutions for our customers and where we are expanding existing solutions around the world. Near term, we continue to expect acceleration of our combined insurance businesses and double digit growth at Argus. Wood Mac is performing in line with the expectations we discussed with you last quarter. So, with that, let me turn it over to Mark for some additional comments.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer: Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses which serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have seen several key industry themes including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. With these themes in mind, I will briefly describe a number of positive recent developments in our businesses. Reflecting on all three themes, Verisk Insurance Solutions launched a new integration option for 360Value, our web based replacement cost estimator for homeowner's insurance. 360Value is built on our unique and industry standard construction materials and labor cost data. This solution helps our customers estimate coverage limits for residential, commercial and agricultural properties. Our customers can now integrate 360Value directly into their online homeowners quoting platforms. This helps the industry deploy more engaging solutions which include pre-filling and online insurance application with property-specific information when a homeowner enters an address. Another recent launch is Mozart, a new product development platform increasing engagement in automation which helps our clients to easily research, create and distribute coverage language, providing efficiencies in time-to-market from new products and critical coverage updates. Mozart will help our customers accelerate profitable growth, reduce expense ratios and enhance audit and compliance. Leveraging big data methods, cutting edge technology and pioneering automation, AIR released a hosted cloud solution for its catastrophe risk management platforms, Touchstone and CATRADER. More than a dozen companies are already up and running on the AIR cloud, which enables them to conduct all of their analyses remotely while minimizing capital expenditures. Finally, in addition to the new deployment option, AIR recently expanded its coverage model of Southeast Asia. These models combine 10 years of extensive scientific research by AIR scientists with findings from studies of local building codes, damage surveys, lost experience data and structural engineering research. With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Mark. In the second quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing in solutions that we expect will deliver incremental growth going forward. Revenue grew 16.3% and 5.4% organically. EBITDA grew 12.4% to $245 million. EBITDA margins were 49.2% in the quarter. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 23.5% and 5.5% organically. Financial services was the fastest-growing organic revenue end market while insurance focused solutions were the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 6.2% in the second quarter. The increase was led by strong growth in loss quantification and claims analytics solutions. Underwriting solutions also grew in the quarter. Our catastrophe modeling solutions saw a modest decline versus the prior year as a result of lower cat bond issuance and consulting revenues. Customer retention remains very high, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. Financial services revenue returned to strong growth, up 15.9% in the quarter. We were particularly pleased with the contributions from the media effectiveness solutions, which grew very well in the quarter. Our international revenue continues to grow nicely here as well, which does mean that FX may influence the reported results throughout the rest of the year. As Scott noted, we remain comfortable with double digit growth based on accelerating growth in the second half of the year. Energy and specialized markets revenue grew 70.4% including Wood Mac, which was acquired in May 2015. In this year's second quarter, Wood Mac revenue was around flat on a constant currency basis. The decline in the British pound late in Q2 will have a larger effect on reported results starting in Q3 as the average Q2 rate was $1.43 and is currently in the low $1.30s. Organic revenue excluding Wood Mac, PCI and Infield declined $2.4 million in the quarter. Services revenue peaked in the prior year as customers met 2015 compliance deadlines. We are also transitioning to a subscription revenue model, which is better for Verisk and better for our customers over the long term. The dollar impact remains small in relation to Verisk as a whole. Finally as a reminder, Wood Mac is organic starting in Q3. Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.5% and 5.3% on an organic basis, continuing to demonstrate the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Additionally, contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the inclusion of Risk Intelligence Ireland, which we have rebranded as Verisk Insurance Solutions Ireland, added growth. Industry standard insurance programs revenue grew 6.0%, reflecting our 2016 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 3.8% in the quarter. Growth was led by an increase in commercial underwriting solutions subscription revenue. EBITDA increased 12.4% in the quarter to $245 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 49.2%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 20.8% to $141 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions and growth in our existing businesses. EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 2.9% to $105 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, offset in part by talent realignment initiatives we have been discussing with you. This resulted in moderated margins versus Q1 as the hiring started to take effect, as well as the impact of our annual merit increases. We are very excited about the additions we've made to the team, and we look forward to their contributions over time. Reported interest expense was $31 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at June 30, 2016, after our repayments facilitated by cash flow generation and the proceeds from the sale of the healthcare business. Our leverage at the end of the second quarter was about 2.2 times pro forma for the healthcare divestiture, and we are pleased to have reached our target ahead of plan. We appreciate the support and confidence of our debt holders as we acquired Wood Mac with the goal of returning to the 2.5 times steady-state leverage. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.5%. Adjusted net income in 2Q increased 3.7% to $124 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.73 in the quarter, an increase of 1.4%. Adjusted EPS increased because of solid operations both organic and acquired and lower interest expense. The increases were partially offset by higher fixed asset depreciation and amortization, only a partial quarter of Wood Mac ownership in the prior period and an increase in shares outstanding related to the 2015 acquisition of Wood Mac. We expect that our adjusted EPS growth will normalize over time to reflect similar trends you see in our underlying business results. The average diluted share count was 171.2 million shares in the quarter. And on June 30, 2016, our diluted share count was 171.4 million shares. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to balance our appetite for share repurchase with our desire to maintain flexibility for M&A. At June 30, 2016, we had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. Free cash flow increased 21.1% for the six month period to $305 million including Wood Mac. This represented 61.9% of EBITDA. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by greater profitability of our businesses and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the acquisition of Wood Mac. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and therefore shareholder value. Capital expenditures increased 4.6% to $52 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2016, due to the inclusion of Wood Mac's CapEx for the full quarter. CapEx was 5.2% of revenue. We expect CapEx for the full year to be $150 million to $155 million pro forma for the divestiture of the healthcare business. We continue to manage our capital intensity to enable free cash flow growth. As you think about your models for 2016 on a continuing operations basis, we expect that based on current FX rates, there's about a $25 million impact to full year revenue relative to where rates were at the start of 2016. This is up from our estimate last quarter of a $10 million impact. FX is a new factor as you think about our future growth, and we will look to provide more insight going forward to help you include it in your forecasting. As you think about Q3, keep in mind that last year, EBITDA included a $15.6 million warrant sale gain which will not recur this year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we expect to have a one-time P&L charge of $19 million related to the ESOP. This is a nonrecurring item related to adjustments made to the ESOP at the time of the IPO which will be excluded from adjusted EBITDA. This does not affect the underlying business profitability, and we just want it to be on your radar ahead of time. For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of $150 million to $155 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. We know these are items that are hard to project, which is why we share them with you each quarter. Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense after paying down the revolver with the divestiture proceeds to be around $120 million. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible and amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% to reflect the tax rate that's applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. Overall, we are working hard to execute on our 2016 plan and remain excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We're well positioned for profitable growth in the future and have the financial strength and capital structure to support investment for continued long-term growth. We continue to appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow-up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you. First, I wanted to ask about the cat modeling business. I guess, one, can you give us any sense in terms of the magnitude of the impact from the consulting and cat bonds or I guess how big those are relative to the size of the cat modeling business? And just trying to get a sense of the underlying trend in that cat modeling business versus the trends you have been seeing.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Great. Hey, Tim. It's Eva. Thanks for the question. Maybe just starting at a high level, cat bonds and consulting are less than 5% of overall Decision Analytics insurance revenue. Obviously for AIR, those would be a greater percentage. But if you were to peel back the onion and look at AIR's performance, the underlying subscription business is performing very well. We're very happy with our position in the market. And with regards to cat bonds, we continue to win and we have strong market share. There's just some variability that can happen across periods in some of those revenues that are non-subscription.
Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then the comment about accelerating growth in the insurance vertical this year, it seems to imply you would need pretty strong performance in the second half of the year. I guess, can you just tell us, make sure I guess, tell us what you are assuming there? And I guess, just to be clear, is that I guess inclusive or exclusive of the kind of true-up revenue that you had in the first quarter?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Scott, here. We'll come back to that true-up question. But the way that we observe our business, Tim, it's always really going through pipelines and conversion rates on renewal opportunities or new business opportunities. So, it's very much a bottoms-up view. If I look across the insurance vertical, it's pretty broadly based in terms of our expectations for the latter half of the year. I wouldn't say that any one theme really stands out. We called out that in this quarter some of the transaction based business around the cat modeling space were soft. But overall, as we look at the latter half of 2016, it's really pretty broadly based across claims, underwriting, industry standard solutions and catastrophe modeling. One perspective I thought I might just add here is, if you just think about the kind of the world in which Verisk sits at the moment, and you think about really exogenous factors, there's really three things that are kind of out there that are just sort of bubbling at the moment, probably in order of importance when you think about Verisk outcomes overall. One would be that our customers in the oil and gas industry are under a lot of pressure at the moment because of where the commodity stands. We think that that's a moment-in-time effect. We don't predict the oil price, but we expect a more normalized environment. The second is that there hasn't been a lot of extreme event activity over the last couple of years and that really tends to have two effects. Now I'm in the insurance vertical. That tends to have two effects. One is the reinsurance world has softened. The pricing has softened, and there has been some consolidation, and so that works its way in little bit. And then cat bond issuance has actually responded to that as well, the lack of extreme events. And as Eva said, we continue to get the overwhelming share of the cat bond activity. It's just that the absolute volumes have turned down there. We get asked a lot, by the way, whether overall premium progression in the insurance industry tends to affect us, and the answer is basically no because of the way that we contract with our customers. But when there is a sustained period of less extreme events activity, it actually it shows up a little bit because the underlying markets respond to that. And also, a few of the things that we do like repair cost estimating, there is an element of it which responds to the absolute number of claims. And when you have extreme events, you have more claims. And then the third thing is, as Eva was pointing out in 2015, a lot of our environmental health and safety customers needed to really scramble to make sure that they were compliant with regulations that required compliance by the end of 2015. So, there was a bit of surge of work in that regard. So you have kind of a moment-in-time effect which is that was kind of powering the business up to 2015. That is also a part of the business where when you look at subscription-based revenues, we're actually happy with what's happening. So, I just thought I would throw out that perspective overall in the sense that, on the one hand, I don't really think our business is that affected by what's happening in the outside world, but it's not as if we're totally immune. And probably, all the dials are pointed in the wrong direction just at this moment, and yet the performance of our company is good. I'm really happy with it. So then, Mark, did you want to just take on the?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer: So, just to kind of follow up on the question you had from a DA perspective, that growth would be with and without the true-up adjustment. Just to kind of reiterate Scott said, I mean we're feeling pretty good and confident because of what I refer to as contracts that are signed and waiting for implementation, so those do kick in in the second half.
Timothy J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: In Wood Mac, so good to see that the trend was largely as you expected. Any reason to think that that changes in one direction or another in the back half of the year based on what you're seeing from client demand?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. No. The retention rates on the subscription based part of the business remain very strong. And actually, the services side of the business actually had some very nice wins in the last couple of months. So no, we don't anticipate any changes.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Great. And then turning to margins, as we think about margin trends for the two segments, you had talked before about plans for increased hiring in Risk Assessment and it looks like we saw that come through in this quarter. Are we now at a stable run rate for cost in that segment or is there further ramp in the cost base to come? And if you could help us think about various factors impacting the margin trends for Decision Analytics in the back half of the year as well, that would be great. Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So let me just make a general comment and then, Eva, maybe you want to take it on a little more specifically. One of the decisions that you get to make when you are in the position we are of leading a company like Verisk is, when you're aware of kind of the macro environment and modest waxing and waning in terms of revenues in any particular moment, the question you get to ask yourself is what is your confidence in the business. Are you going to continue to invest? And we're very confident in this business. And so we have continued to invest knowing that at this moment in time, we have the kinds of just macro factors that I talked about before. Specifically with respect to ISO solutions, we are very interested in amplifying what it is that we do there. And so the kind of talent that we brought in with respect to topics like – and all of these relate to the insurance world, cyber, Internet of Things, the linkage between the energy ecosystem and the insurance world, et cetera – we've really created a substantially new talent base that we just didn't have before. Also resilience issues as they relate to extreme events, and I could go on. We're excited to have this new talents inside of the organization. And so our judgment is that the best thing to do is to keep investing inside of our company and to do it on a consistent sort of a basis, which is where we are right at the moment. Did you want to add anything to that, Eva?
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah so, Sara, just to take on your specific questions around margin, I mean I think Scott's elaborated on the talent realignment, and there is impact there as well. Don't lose sight of our usual annual merit increases that go in in the second quarter, a common occurrence and does have impact on margin in 2Q. I think if you look back historically, you would see that as well. With regards to Decision Analytics, one, I would just point out that the non-subs revenue that we've been talking about a bit, actually unlike some of the historical transactional revenue that we used to have in businesses we no longer own, that's actually pretty high margin business. And so when we don't have that come through, that can have some impact on the margin in the moment. I would also point out to you, I mentioned in my comments FX, and FX can have some impact on margin as well. Revenue and expense, we try to have those mostly aligned, but they're not always perfectly aligned.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Scott, I definitely heard the second half acceleration for insurance which is expected. I just wanted to know quantitatively if we're still looking for Verisk to see each RA and DA insurance accelerate for the full year 2016 from the 2015 rates which were 6% and 8%.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Most of the lift in terms of the growth rate is going to come on the DA side.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hey.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I appreciate you taking my question. Hey. Mark, the color on some of those new products is helpful. I wonder if you can elaborate again as a follow-up to Andrew Steinerman's question, specifically within DA, is do we see some of those new products making a meaningful contribution in the back half or is this sort of just the natural motion of continued share gain and pricing to value and so forth?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer: So, the short answer is I think these will become more meaningful as we think about 2017 and beyond. But as I highlighted, we have some AIR customers that are on the cloud and moving quickly. So it does help 2016 back half, but I would think these are a little bit more longer term in the way I think and outline the business for the future.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And are there any other callouts? I know underwriting is sort of one of your burgeoning areas, or is as you indicated in the second quarter, the growth sort of pretty evenly distributed across your solution sets? And again, I'm thinking about insurance DA.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer: Once again I'll just, I'll echo Scott. I mean it's broad-based. I think we feel good about most areas of the business with regard to growth in the second half relative to the first. And there's a couple areas where we actually are having customers transition to our solutions. And that just sometimes takes a little more time than you anticipate, whether it's volumes coming through or the volumes you expect coming through. Although you have signed contracts that you know there's a commitment over time, we want to go as fast as we can, and we have to work with our customers to do that.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, so maybe a little bit of timing to consider in the second quarter too then?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer: All true.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani from KBW. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Just to start off. In terms of Wood Mac, I know in the past you talked about how you thought it was undersold. I was just wondering if you have any updates there on progress you've made on that front.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah so, the sort of the selling of Wood Mac really you can think of it as being in two different buckets. So one of those is to cross-sell and up-sell inside of our existing customer set which is order of magnitude 1,000 customers. And we give a lot of attention to whether we're right-sized there. Obviously, we're trying to pick our spots at the moment because of just the overall environment. But that is a team that is strong and getting stronger. We actually have new leadership of the sales team there and very excited about Lynda's leadership for us. And then secondly, there is how do we go from 1,000 to say 5,000 or more kinds of customers. And that in part hinges upon opening up new channels for distributing our content. And we have one new such relationship in place and are working hard to get others in place. So, I think that it's a good feeling into the future and kind of there are some early shoots with respect to these new channels.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thank you for that. And I guess next question is kind of staying on the Wood Mac topic. Just given that I guess last year in the second of half of the year was when Wood Mac started to become sort of challenging, and given that earlier in this call, you mentioned that even on the services side, you're starting to see more of a pick-up. Is there any reason not to expect there to be positive momentum in the second half of the year given those dynamics?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, we're sticking by what we said before which is our view of 2016 overall is essentially flat relative to 2015 and there are puts and takes with respect to the different lines of business that Wood Mac does. And then of course, there's always the X factor of just the macro environment overall. And so we're pretty comfortable with where we're at. But I would like to say as I said also last quarter, I think the performance of our Wood Mac colleagues is absolutely outstanding in light of something which is tsunami-like inside of their end market. I mean, I think the quality of what Wood Mac does and the depth of relationship with customers is actually demonstrated so strongly in this moment actually. So we expect a normalized environment. We want our customers to feel less pressured than they do today, and when they do, I'm absolutely certainly that it will be reflected in our performance.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks very much for the answers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Good morning. Can you just give us an update on where you are in terms of aerial imagery image capture as well as productizing the broader aerial imagery capabilities?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, one of our favorite topics. So we have at the moment basically two different ways that we give ourselves access to images today. One is our own efforts to source images and the other is working with third parties who have been sourcing images for their own purposes. That mix I would say is working, and has helped us to take all of the great image analytics technology that we've got and basically make that more active, particularly in the insurance vertical today. That's really where it's happening today. And we continue to ask questions about how we can be more in control of a larger set of images that are optimized for the use cases that we have in mind and we're working actively on that right now. So the report, Jeff, would be that commercially we're succeeding with what we're doing in the imaging space and we continue to think deeply about additional things that would help us to be more in control of a larger set of images.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): When you say commercially succeeding, do you have the image library and gathering apparatus necessary that you're at the point where you're productizing and selling to clients?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yes. Correct.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then, just maybe a comment on the Wood Mac M&A pipeline. There's been a few smaller deals, so I guess just any comment on how much of the activity is you putting more capital behind Wood Mac than they were getting under their prior ownership. How much is it more opportunity in the market because of what's going on in the end market? And then just any, what's your appetite for a potentially larger deal for Wood Mac?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Yeah. So, let me just step through to that real quick. So, part of what we've done on the M&A front has been what I would consider to be small and tuck-in and really about trying to give ourselves additional distinctive data assets. That for example was the Infield acquisition. So that's sort of point one. The second point I would make is that we're very excited about Greentech Media because of the depth of expertise there with respect to solar and smart grids and grid edge technologies and storage technologies. And what we're finding is that our existing hydrocarbon-based customers are increasingly interested in the alternatives. And so, not only is it in a sense new business for us, the degree to which we're now looking specifically at the dynamics of what's going on in solar generation, specifically in terms of what's going on with respect to grid edge effects, not only is it new business, but it also actually makes us a more compelling partner for our existing customers in the hydrocarbon ecosystem. So, we are really excited about it. We think that it's really going to be helpful. And then I think overall, you were just kind of looking for what's the forward profile. Well, I'd make a couple comments. One is, there have been some very large trades in the oil and gas space. And we didn't participate as you saw. And we continue to ask questions about what strategically would advantage this business the most. But we're certainly not enamored of the thought of large deals. And a lot of it is, we're going to make the business that we have run well. I think that again, kind of around the edges, we will try to support that which we already do. And there will be opportunities that are kind of thematic in the way that say Greentech is thematic.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you, Scott.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning everyone.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Hi.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Good morning.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So, first congratulations to Mark and to Eva on the promotion.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Bill.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer: Thanks.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So first question for the new CFO, you've hit your leverage target, exceeded it, 2.5 is what you had set back when you had purchased Wood Mac, you're at 2.2 times. Going forward, what's that new leverage target? It had been 2.5, but that seemed like more of a combination temporarily. Is it more like 3 times?
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Bill, I would say that our leverage target steady-state remains 2.5 times. But remember how we've always operated, is we have flexibility to go above that. We did with. We said we'd delever. I think that we have a leverage point that our business can very easily support. I think that we always just look at the opportunities and figure out where we need to settle that. But I think the good news for us is we've got capacity under even at steady-state and the flexibility to go up as warranted if there's a deal that makes sense for us.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Got it. And then a second question for you on the insurance business and Decision Analytics. If you could talk a little bit about Xactware, XactContents and the blend of the subscription and transaction business and then also how the new 360Value product fits in with that whole category.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah so, Bill, maybe I'll take the second part first, then I'll let Mark talk a little bit about some of the specific products in insurance and solutions. If you were to think about Decision Analytics overall, the mix between subscription and non-subscription, it's about 77% subscription. I would say insurance in Decision Analytics looks fairly similar to the rest of Decision Analytics now, now that we don't have that highly transactional business in healthcare in there anymore. There's more uniformity across that. So, I think that we love where we sit. We've always thought it was natural to have someone out of non-subscription revenue, and I think in Decision Analytics, we have a bit more of that, and that includes things we do that provide us opportunities to work closely with customers and develop those new solutions. I'll let Mark comment a bit on Xactware and some of the other solutions.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And the 360 innovations.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Operating Officer: Sure. So let me just quickly highlight the fact that we continue to improve the suite of Xactware solutions. Our vision and our focus for this year and next is to bring out what I'll refer to as a more integrated solution which brings together Xactimate that's used in probably about 85% of the property repair cost estimates across the United States in combination with XactAnalysis which is the BI tool and everything around it so that you can work and use your back office in an efficient way. In addition, Contents, which represents all of the information about pricing and materials inside the home to replace the TV, couches, rugs and things. So our focus, make it more integrated, easier to use, more focus on the claim as opposed to the assignment, which was doing the work but more on the claim. All of that has been kind of a focus from a customer perspective and our perspective to achieve those things. Very much in our forward vision is to take that solution, that more simplified solution and bring it to the global insurance market, customizing it in a way that it is fit for use in that market and we've put a lot of time and resource and are making progress there. The final component to this is we are seeing a lot of activity in the US market where people are interested in trying to make access to the quote engine, going online and getting a quote for auto and home, more and more interactive with the customer. And our ability to help our customers do that through the enhancement here at 360Value, lets you as a homeowner go online to make sure you have the proper coverage for your home. That's valuable, that's helpful and it's easy. You have the policyholder, or the person who's getting the quote do it himself and that's the type of innovation we want to work with and help our customers with their customers. Last piece as we think about this bringing it together, we are finding increased interest in basically the whole property suite of solutions as we go overseas. So we kind of led in with the claims side of things, but clearly people are looking for information about large commercial buildings. So, replicating some of the things we do here in the United States, using both remote sensing and aerial images, providing with insights into risk about a building and help him understand what the insurance to value is, meaning what's the replacement cost if there was a total loss. And all of those themes, I think we are trying to be more comprehensive, more seamless, both internationally and that will obviously revert back with our US customers as well. So I probably said a lot, but I want to make sure I responded to some of the questions then.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Well, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI: Thanks. Good morning, would appreciate your thoughts more broadly on capital allocation, Scott, especially since you've reached the target leverage ratio or even below it, ahead of schedule. Post the sale of healthcare, you have more subscription revenue, more visibility on cash flow. You indicated a preference for small tuck-in data-oriented acquisitions. I guess two questions. First, how do you think about opportunities in the acquisition pipeline versus share repurchase given the current price of your stock? And then secondly, with the higher subscription based revenue, more visible cash flow, higher margin profile, how do you think about the possibility of initiating a dividend?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean all good, all good topics. So, maybe back to the top. If you look at our company over extended periods of time, the program of acquisition and the share repurchase program have both done very well for our shareholders, both have done very well. And there's really nothing in our situation that would cause us to think that anything fundamentally is going to be different in the future than in the past. You actually pointed out one of the features of our company, which is that the cash flow visibility is, if anything, even greater than it was. So we would continue to see both of those as real pillars inside of the way that we do what we do. And so at any given moment, this moment for example, we're always taking stock of where we stand in the M&A pipeline and how imminent we think good opportunities are. And we remain very interested in deploying capital in terms of returning it to shareholders when we feel that sort of that which is right at the head of the pipeline and the size is such that we still have capacity. And I would say that we do have, we have capacity as we sit here. So we're very alert to the application of capital and we'll remain so and that's a statement for the third quarter and the fourth quarter and really forever. I actually thought your second question, David, was going to be different, more about sort of a higher leverage target rather than a dividend. We're very interested in returning capital to shareholders I guess that's the way that I would put it. Our analysis to date has not indicated that there's anything fundamentally superior about doing it in the form of a dividend versus the buyback program that we've had. So, that's kind of where we sit with that thought at the moment. By the way, even David and I and Mark and all of us that are out there talking to investors, we actually ask that question all the time, how do you feel about it. And so we remain open to the conversation, but I would say that we haven't drawn the conclusion that a dividend is a superior way of expressing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders.
David Mark Togut - Evercore ISI: Understood. Thanks so much for the insights.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I was hoping you could give a little more color on the pieces within specialized excluding Wood Mac. Were there parts of the business that did well this quarter? And basically, where were the sort of the troubled areas; where were the bright spots?
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, Toni, I'll kick off on that and Scott may want to add some comments. I think if you take Wood Mac, PCI and Infield out of specialized because those are all inorganic in the quarter, you primarily have our environmental health and safety solutions and some of our weather solutions. We referenced in the press release and on the call, when you think about EH&S, there were some global standards that went into place in 2015 which gave us the opportunity to serve our customers in making those transitions. Those transitions are complete and so you'll kind of see a normalization of that type of work this year which is leading to the organic result of a decline there. I would say that that's probably the primary impact. And if you were to think about it, I think the headline growth decline as a percentage is larger than the actual dollar impact on Verisk. The other thing we mentioned is with regards to that area, we are transitioning into more subscription based revenues. And I think that's really great both for us and for our customers. So in a moment in time, if you're going from more transactional to more subscription, the great thing about subscription is it's recognized over time but in the moment, transaction is not there and subscription is only the portion of what you're going to recognize, you're going to see a little impact.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: We've actually observed on this before, but just a little sort of data analytic observation is that when you start out with a new solution, both customers and the vendors often want it to be transaction priced, because nobody really knows the absolute level of demand. There really do come these moments where the customers are open to, and maybe even wanting to move to a subscription, because they want more certainty and visibility in terms of the future. So, it's a kind of a natural sort of a development for newer kinds of solutions. And Eva was describing that with respect to some of which goes on on the EH&S side. Same thing on the country and political risk side, we're doing the same thing.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then looking at financial, the comps get a lot easier in the back half of the year. I think you've previously talked about double digits in that segment for the full year. What would be the difference between getting to low double digits versus mid teens? Would it be project revenue? You mentioned the media effectiveness grew nicely this quarter. And how's the transition going from sort of project revenue to subscription in that business?
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Toni, I would just start by saying as a reminder, when we talk about double digits, we're actually including the grow over impact of that one-time media effectiveness revenue we had in 2015 in the first quarter. So I actually think the target we set is pretty ambitious. If you consider that we're not taking that out in that analysis. I would say that like many of our businesses, I think there's opportunity for us to add incremental revenue through project revenue. And certainly, that's something that you can move, that could move a growth rate in a short term. But I think fundamentally, when we talk about the double digit growth rate, again given the comparable that we have for last year, we think that that is very strong.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, and I'll just add that there are some sparkling new names on the customer list even this quarter. I mean, this business is doing a wonderful job of reaching out to new customer sets.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks a lot.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital. Your line is open. Pease go ahead.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks so much. I know it's late. I just have a quick question. Eva, you had mentioned the potential $25 million impact from FX for the year. Can you give us a little bit more color exactly which line items from a revenue perspective we might see the biggest impact? Thanks.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sure, absolutely. I mean obviously Wood Mac has the most of the pound-based revenue which is the rate we're referencing, although we do have other currencies in there as well. I would say that we have international revenue in our financial services, as I mentioned. We have some of that in EH&S. I mean we have a little bit now in insurance as well. And so most of it would be in Wood Mac, but I think it is actually scattered across the company. And as we go forward, I think one of the things that's been on my mind is, I think we will continue to try to provide you more visibility into that, because my sense is that to date, your inclusion of that impact in our forward-looking expectations that you develop has been a little more soft as opposed to direct. And so we'll try to help you with that.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. That would be appreciated. Thanks so much.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. So, my question is just on the longer term margin profile of the business. It sounded like obviously there's some macro issues and some issues within the insurance vertical in general that are kind of, I wouldn't call them one-time, but are ebbs and flows of the business. and you're taking the opportunity here to add resources and to maybe bulk up on some of your new offerings. So how should we think about the longer term margin profile of the business? Is this a short term thing, and if those macro factors turn in your favor, will you kind of pull back on that or is this something that's in place until those new businesses kick in? How should we think about it? Thanks.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, well maybe just starting with long term because as we think about long term, that's over multiple years. I don't know when you're saying that and you're referencing the quarter, it almost sounds to me like you're referring more to a shorter long term than we would. But what I would say is I think we continue to be constructive on margins over the long term. Our business is that build it once, sell it many times. As I did observe in the quarter in particular, when you have some high margin non-subscription business like cat bonds and you have lots of that, that will have a moment-in-time impact on the margin in the quarter. But that being said, I think over the long term, nothing has changed in our outlook for what we can do there and the opportunity to expand margins over time.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Welcome.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open. Please go ahead.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi. Let me echo the congratulations on your respective promotions. I'll just ask my two questions up front. And you sort of addressed them in your prior three responses, Eva, but I just want to make sure I had this right. The transition to subscription in Wood Mac, how should we sort of dimensionalize the revenue impact? That's the first one, the subscription in Wood Mac. And the second one is, were there any project based revenues in the Q2 related to financial services? Thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah so, just on the first question, a clarification. When you're talking about transition to subscription revenue, that was referencing ex-Wood Mac in energy and specialized, so that was really more around our EH&S solutions.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, in country and political risk.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Country and political. So, that was not a Wood Mac related comment. With regards to project revenue in financial services, I mean we always have some. I would say there was nothing in particular that we would call out in the quarter.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: And that's not the dominant theme in terms of what's going on. The growth in financial services is very broadly based. It's new geographies. It's the traditional subscription revenues. It's analytic product. It's the whole mix.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thank you, Scott. Thank you.
Eva F. Huston - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: And there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time. I would return the call to the presenters.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, just wanted to say thank you all very much for your interest today and all the good questions. And I know we'll be seeing some of you in the relatively near future and look forward to that. And otherwise, we'll speak with you next quarter. Thanks a lot.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics First Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Chief Knowledge Officer: Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everybody. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2016 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. Unless stated otherwise, all the results we discuss today will reflect the classification of the healthcare business (0:53) operations. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. And finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And now I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Eva. Good morning, all. In the first quarter, we delivered strong overall results, with total revenue growth of 28%, EBITDA growth of 24% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 19%. Organic revenue growth was 5% and was 7% excluding the first quarter 2015 nonrecurring project revenue at Argus and a one-time true-up of partner revenue this year in the Decision Analytics Insurance segment. Profitability remains strong with total EBITDA margins of 50%. We continued to be encouraged about the performance of our businesses in our key verticals of insurance, financial services and energy. This quarter is a good start to the year and we will look to build on these results. On April 25, 2016 as you know, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to sell the healthcare business to Veritas Capital for $820 million. We expect the sale to close by the end of the second quarter. The returns we generated on the business reflect value creation for our shareholders with a pre-tax IRR of about 12% through our ownership period which began in 2004. One of our most important responsibilities is the careful stewardship of our shareholders capital. We continually assess our assets and their productivity as well as opportunities to deploy new capital in line with our strategic priorities. Consistent with our capital allocation approach, we identified and evaluated a range of alternatives. We determined that we have better uses for the capital invested in the business and for any future capital which would've been required to make the operations more Verisk like. Additionally, we believe that management time should be directed to areas where we can have the most impact in driving shareholder returns. This transaction will allow us to focus on data analytics businesses in our key verticals which are most closely aligned with our strategy, our distinctives and global ambitions and where we believe we can add the most value. The majority of the proceeds will be allocated towards future acquisitions and repurchases, consistent with our long-term approach we've discussed with you in the past. We remain committed to our 2.5 times steady-state leverage. Pro forma for the sale of the healthcare business and related proceeds at March 31 we would have been at that level. I'm glad to have found strong ownership for our healthcare business and very much wish the team continued success. We go forward from here better aligned with the key distinctives which mark excellent, vertical, data analytics businesses. We have higher margins, more stable revenue growth, less seasonality, a higher mix of subscription revenue and stronger free cash flow conversion post this transaction. Overall, we look even more like the Verisk business model that we all value. During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of $116 million of our stock. At March 31, 2016, we had $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. In addition, we remain active, looking for strategic and financially sound tuck-in acquisitions. As you may have seen, we recently acquired Risk Intelligence Ireland, a leading provider of fraud detection compliance, risk control and process automation services to the Irish insurance industry, which becomes part of our ISO solutions business. This acquisition advances our efforts to expand our insurance business beyond the United States. We remain constructive on the outlook and expect acceleration in our combined insurance businesses and double-digit growth at Argus. WoodMac continues to perform remarkably well in an environment which is extraordinary difficult for our customers. The team is working very hard to achieve growth for the year, even as we acknowledge the macro environment continues to be challenging relative to historic norms. In a recent achievement of note, Verisk was included in the Forbes list of America's Best Employers 2016. This follows are inclusion in the Forbes World's Most Innovative Companies list. Verisk is one of only 15 companies to appear on both lists. We are working hard to attract and retain great talent as we continue to make progress fostering a culture of innovation. We apply that innovative thinking in working with our customers to find new solutions to their challenges by leveraging our unique data assets and methods. And I personally am inspired by the efforts of our people and I think that shows through in the results we have been delivering. We are well positioned to execute on our strategies and global ambitions in the future. So with that let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Scott. In the first quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing for the future. Revenue grew 28.2%. Organic revenue grew 5%, excluding recent acquisitions. If you adjust for $11 million nonrecurring project revenue in Argus in the first quarter of 2015 and several million dollars of true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance this year, organic revenue growth was 7% in the quarter. EBITDA grew 24% to $248 million. EBITDA margins were 50.4% for the quarter. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 46.7% and 4.8% in the first quarter, excluding acquisitions. Adjusting for the nonrecurring financial services project revenue last year and true-up insurance revenue this year, organic revenue growth in the segment was 8.5%. Revenue in the quarter was again driven by insurance. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew at 11.6% in the first quarter, increase was led by strong growth in claims analytics solutions with good growth in loss quantification, catastrophe modeling and underwriting solutions in the quarter. Even excluding the several (7:29) million dollars of true-up revenue, growth in Decision Analytics insurance was about 9%. Financial services revenue decreased 19% in the quarter and increased 17.7%, after adjusting for last year's nonrecurring project revenue, with solid underlying demand for our core solutions and services, offset by prior-year project revenue of $11 million which did not recur in 2016. Energy and specialized markets revenue grew by over 350%, including the recently acquired Wood Mackenzie, PCI and Infield businesses. Organic revenue declined 3.6%, as growth in the environmental health and safety solutions was offset by a decline in weather and climate analytics. WoodMac revenue, in constant currency, excluding PCI and Infield, increased slightly in the first quarter 2016 and, as reported, declined slightly, when including the effect of purchase accounting. We expect pro forma constant currency revenue to be flat in the second quarter, as reported. As we think about the full-year outlook as reported, we expect to be near flat. Also, as we move through the year, keep in mind that currency will have an impact on our reported results. Risk assessment revenue grew 5.2%, continuing to demonstrate the value of our longstanding insurance customers. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.2%, reflecting our 2016 invoices, which were effective January 1 and continued contribution from newer solutions, such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. This increase was driven by higher committed volumes in our commercial underwriting business. EBITDA increased 24% in the quarter to $248 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.4%. Decision Analytics EBITDA increased 40% to $139 million in the quarter, as a result of acquisitions and profitable growth in the business. The EBITDA in risk assessment increased 8.3% to $109 million, as a result of revenue growth and good expense management. Reported interest expense was $32 million in the quarter. Total debt was $3 billion at March 31, 2016. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was about 2.6 times. After the sale of the healthcare business, we expect to be at the 2.5 times leverage target, ahead of plan. Our reported effective tax rate was 31.7% for the quarter. Adjusted net income increased 26.1% to $127 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.75 for the quarter, an increase of $0.19 – 19%, excuse me. Discontinued operations includes about $0.03 related to healthcare operations and a negative $0.11 for tax liability as a result of classifying healthcare business as discontinued ops. As a result, we reported discontinued operations adjusted EPS of a negative $0.08. The average diluted share count was 171.5 million shares in the quarter. On March 31, 2016 our diluted share count was 170.9 million shares. For shares purchased in the quarter, the average price paid was $69.97. At March 31, 2016, the company had about $353 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. Free cash flow increased 20% to $256 million for the first three months ended March 31, 2016, including WoodMac. This represented 103.2% of EBITDA, as our first quarter is typically our strongest for free cash flow generation, due to invoicing patterns. These numbers are all for continuing operations. Growth in free cash flow was driven by improved profitability of our business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest rates and fees related to the acquisition of WoodMac. Capital expenditures increased 22.7% to $25 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2016, driven in part by the addition of WoodMac. CapEx was 5.1% of revenue. We now expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million, pro forma for the divestiture of the healthcare business. We continue to manage our capital intensity. We're pleased with the announced agreement to sell the healthcare business and the opportunity to focus on our core competencies and our distinctives. The sales price of $820 million consists of $720 million of cash, a $100 million subordinated promissory note, and other contingent consideration. As you saw in our 10-Q, the note has an 8-year maturity and a 9% PIK interest rate. The consideration, which is unrelated to the note, is tied to the future value of the healthcare business, and provides upside to our sales price under certain conditions. We expect the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. We anticipate the after-tax proceeds of approximately $675 million, of which about $600 million will be received at closing, and the remainder on the repayment of the promissory note. The precise tax amounts will be determined after we've all adjusted for the working capital. On an estimated after-tax basis, the IRR generated exceeds our cost of capital. Of the cash proceeds, we expect that the majority will be allocated to our longstanding capital allocation priorities. In the near-term, we intend to use the proceeds to repay our revolver drawings, but we'll then use that increased revolver capacity, as opportunities arise, for our long-term capital allocation plans. While we manage the transition, some of the corporate cost to support the healthcare business will remain with Verisk. I'd like to thank all of our Verisk and Verisk Health teams for the hard work that has gone into this transaction. We are excited for the future of Verisk, and we wish our colleagues at Verisk Health the very best as they move forward. As you think about your models for 2016 on a continuing operation basis, we encourage you to review Table 8 in last night's press release, which contains selected financial metrics for 2015 on a continuing operation basis by quarter. We expect that based upon current FX rates there is about a $10 million impact to full-year revenue relative to where rates were at the start of the year. As FX is a component that has become more relevant to Verisk, we would look to provide more insight going forward. For the full year 2016, we expect CapEx of about $150 million to $155 million. Fixed asset depreciation/amortization of about $132 million and amortization of intangibles about $95 million. Based upon our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $123 million. We estimate the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. The healthcare divestiture may help that tax rate a bit, but by less than 50 basis points based upon the information we now have. For the intangible amortization add-back and the adjusted net income calculation we will use 26% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible assets. And finally, we expect the diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. Overall, we are pleased with our plan for 2016, excited about the go-forward financial profile of the company. We are executing on our operational plans, and we are well positioned for profitable growth in the future. With that I'll turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A.
Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Chief Knowledge Officer: Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your question to one question and one follow-up. And with that, I will ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning Bill.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Bill.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And congratulations on selling the healthcare division and then also on crossing the 50% EBITDA margin threshold. And that's where my question is this morning is you've gone from a 43% to 45% range to a 45% to 47% range and, last at the Investor Day you talked about expanding margins over time. And how should we think about that? Are you still committed to expanding the margins over time? And then also how should we think about the quarterly margin progression throughout the year, now that you don't have healthcare there?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, so this is Mark, Bill. Thank you for the earlier comments. Let me just remind (16:48) some (16:48) – in the second quarter, this is just kind of the quarterly aspect in response to your question, second quarter we do have our salary increases. A majority of – a super majority of both married and promotional increases come in and effective April 1, so that typically hurts us from a margin perspective as you progress through the year. What we also do is we give out our equity awards. So what will happen is this year's equity awards will come in; the equity awards from four years ago will kind of move out because they're vested, so those two things will affect the rest of the year. The other thing we always like to just remind, we continue to make progress, but we did, for the most part, had this talent realignment in risk assessment, so there's some staff that we are continuing to hire and that will ramp up as we progress through the year. We did some hiring in first quarter, but probably still a little bit behind the levels we expect. So those are the couple of points that I will call out. The other thing that I think to your earlier question, remember, what we have as a business that's wonderfully scalable. It kind of comes to how much investment we wanted to do and we need to kind of talk about the opportunity to take advantage of that operating leverage. I don't think we see a lot of incremental investment relevant to revenue, so I think we have over the long-term an opportunity to continue to work on margins and move those in a positive direction.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you for the insight.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair. Your line is open.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks, guys. Just, I guess questions on the insurance vertical. One, can you elaborate a little bit more on, you mentioned growth was led by the claims analytics part of Decision Analytics which I would've thought of as the most mature part of that business, so I guess, what's driving that growth? And then secondly, the true-up for I believe it was Xactware, can you talk about that? And I guess also from a margin perspective, does most of that revenue just flow through to the margin line? Just trying to understand how that impacted margins for the quarter? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So Tim, it's Scott, and I'll take the first part of your question. There's something going on in claims, which actually is going on across many of the things we do in insurance, and that is we are as – implicit in your question, we are well-platformed, that is true. But what we've been doing is working to enhance the value in many cases by sort of building around the platform, adding features which help the customers get more value out of what we're doing. And that's true, not only on the claims side, but that's also true on the underwriting side as well. So it's not any one thing. It's actually very broadly based. New products that bring, for example, more analytic acuity to trying to figure out within the claims flows which claims should really get the most attention because they represent the greatest dollar recovery opportunity for the customers, and that's just one example. But the general story is think of it as embroidering on top of the platforms that we've already got. And then, Mark, maybe you want to take the question about the true-up?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So inside of our healthcare – excuse me, inside of our insurance businesses we have a lot of licenses and partnerships which combine a kind of an upfront amount and then there's kind of true-ups based upon how much our partners sell. So inside the true-up we have kind of a royalty component, and sometimes we need to true-up past volumes or past royalty amounts and that's what you're seeing in the first quarter.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: And is it really from a margin perspective? Is it right to think there's not a lot of offsetting costs when you true-up?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: That'd be true. Yeah, I mean, I guess we incurred the cost probably in the past, like 2015, but correct.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, thank you. Just first revisit what you said on WoodMac, I think you said flat for a full-year as reported, just wanted to verify that includes, I guess, an FX headwind? And then you're not adding back the acquired deferred from a purchase accounting standpoint, are there any other adjustments in that number? And if you could remind us roughly how much has the acquired deferred add-back been adding to the WoodMac year-over-year trends you had been reporting since the acquisition?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, just to clarify, what I said was on a constant currency basis we'd be flat as reported. So I just want to make sure you threw in the FX on top of that, so I just did want to call that out; we do try to factor that in. So, that hopefully is clarifying. I think we could see growth, yes, for the year, but the environment is a difficult one for everybody, and we're trying to work through it. I think our team's done an extraordinary job to be where they are.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): But just on the acquired deferred, I think you had been adding it back to the numbers you had been quoting since the acquisition, and now that you are lapping it, it sounds like you're giving us a reported number. So just if you could help me with that differential?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, I mean, your point is valid. I guess, we are in the point where we can be a little bit above; we can be a little bit above. The difference between the two is not all that material since it's a few million dollars that we're talking about.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just finally on the healthcare divestiture, I think it's pretty easy to calculate the EBITDA multiple that it transacted at externally. But can you give us what the LTM free cash flow multiple of the transaction was if you have it handy just so we can do apples-for-apples with how you were talking about the WoodMac acquisition purchase price?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I think we'll have to follow up, so we can get you the accurate numbers there. I'm sorry I don't have those in front of me. That was a little while ago.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just wanted to ask a little bit around the capital allocation you talked about. But firstly just, Scott, you mentioned an active, I guess, tuck-in M&A pipeline. And I'm just trying to understand or just get a little bit more color on where you're seeing these? I mean, I guess, my initial impression was it'll be more the PCIs and the Infields. But I don't know if I should be reading into the Ireland insurance acquisition you made that there's a lot more in some of the other verticals as well?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Oh it's, the M&A agenda expands all of the verticals and what I would say is very active across all of them. And, actually, the place where incrementally we have put in the most energy to raise our game on the M&A front, actually, has been in the insurance vertical. And I would say especially non-domestic. And so we're very much leaning in on that agenda and quite active actually on that front.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, fair enough. And then I guess just a follow-up on in terms of the outlook for Argus, I think at the beginning of the year you guys have said you expect double-digit growth there. I just want to confirm if that's correct? And if that's sort of a reported number and not backing out the one-time stuff that you had last year?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: That is correct and that is not backing out the one-time stuff.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. Scott...
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Scott, I think you were indicating last conference call that you thought within the insurance verticals that both RA and DA would accelerate this year. Do you still think that's the case?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep, we feel good about insurance.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Could you talk a little bit more about RA because obviously that would have to pick up throughout 2016 from first quarter levels to accelerate for the first year?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, it's – RA is a rich mix of the industry standard programs and the new solutions that we brought to market recently which would include our predictive models, our electronic rating content and also innovations around the – in the category of telematics. We're using our commercial property capability to spread out in the new verticals. All of those things are contributing to the performance of that segment.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations for growth for energy for next year. I know that it is fairly early, but it seems like we've gotten to sort of a flat constant currency growth rate at this point. And so I'm wondering, how should we think about that in relation to the price of oil? And then I have one follow-up.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: So, here's the view about WoodMac. WoodMac, right now in our view, is laying the foundation for its next round of growth. So what's going on right now? Customer retention is very high. The new product pipeline is robust. The utilization of our portal offerings is growing strongly, and we're also opening up new channels of distribution for our proprietary content. The challenge of the moment is the extreme pressure on our customers, who are almost two years into this down cycle, and they're still laying off some of their associates. And so they're seeking, even at this time, cost-savings anywhere they can find them. But our view is, because our customers are leaning out their staffs, when the market returns to more normal conditions, demand for WoodMac tools and solutions will escalate strongly, and that's why we are staying the course, and we're remaining invested in the present and the future at WoodMac. Having said all of that, the one thing that we will never do is make pinpoint predictions of the commodity. We certainly expect more normalized conditions into the future, and we'll see when those occur, and we're hopeful about that, because it'll be good for our customers. But we've said from the beginning, and we still maintain that, in normalized market conditions, we expect Wood Mackenzie, and the pieces that we've added to Wood Mackenzie, to grow at or above the rate of organic growth of the rest of Verisk.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, on the margin side, what's your biggest opportunity to move margins up as you look across the businesses? I'm wondering if you could just maybe rank the top 3, and where you think that there's the largest opportunity to kind of move margins higher? And any commentary you can give on pricing? I figured I'd sneak one in.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Well, it's not three factors, it's one. And that is – it's the fundamental nature of our business. The way we do business is fundamentally scalable. So as long as we have a healthy business which is growing, and as long as we pay attention to tightly operating our business, that is where the margin opportunity lies. We've made some structural changes to the company where, for example, just systemically, our tax rate is lower, but otherwise it's basic to the way we do business. It's not – there's no one long lever.
Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is open.
David M. Togut - Evercore ISI: Thank you. Good morning. Scott...
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
David M. Togut - Evercore ISI: ...earlier you mentioned your interest in doing international acquisitions, particularly in the insurance vertical...
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Right.
David M. Togut - Evercore ISI: ...can you talk a little bit about the platform that WoodMac gives you internationally as you expand your presence in other verticals, outside of the U.S.? I'm thinking in terms of resources, operating leverage?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Right, all that. I had the opportunity, the latter half of last year, to visit many of our WoodMac offices around the world. And it really caught my attention when I was in Beijing. So, in Beijing, we have about 30 to 40 WoodMac people. And at the moment, we have four or five people for our AIR unit, which is our catastrophe modeling unit in the insurance business. We brought them all together in order to just talk about the company, and just your typical town hall meeting and – to talk about the future. You would've thought that these were long-lost relatives who had just found one another after decades. The pleasure of being able to pull together, in a single market, share ideas, and share just even infrastructure, so all those folks previously had not been co-located, now they're co-located. In an intellectual property business like ours, it's just absolutely golden when you can get people ideating with one another, and we remain very interested in the intersection of energy and insurance, and it is something that increasingly is going to be very important for us. And so, just at a very basic level, the ability to pull together intelligent people, have them sharing what it is they're doing and finding the mutual opportunities, is so big. And we've commented many times in these calls that the right way to think about a global Verisk is as a multi-domestic Verisk. In other words, in many of the markets we serve, and I'll use insurance as an example; a Chinese primary carrier is not really all that interested in what happened in the United States last quarter, in terms of premiums and indemnity losses. They just aren't. It's not that relevant for them. So we have to be more Chinese in China. But the fact that we're already legitimate in China actually means quite a bit, and it's just very supportive. And also, as we try to source new talent, the fact that we're a reputable, credible player in all of these markets is a very major factor. And we're experiencing that right now as we try to add new highly talented local-market appropriate associates in a number of places around the globe. So it's – maybe it's a little bit difficult to spot from a distance. It's a very powerful effect actually inside the company. Mark, I think you wanted to add something?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I was just going to add it just to give you a little color from kind of a little vignette. In the world of China just to kind of tag along that comment, we think we can do some things around buildings to help understand the risk associated with those buildings and what it would cost to underwrite them. And there were some reinsurance brokers that were interested in the tool that we were developing for China. I'm not sure we would've had a way to put that on the ground and actually respond to that without the offices we had there and it made for a – beyond the incorporation and we went there (33:02), we had people there with cards that were Verisk. So just a case in point.
David M. Togut - Evercore ISI: Thank you. Greatly appreciate your perspective. Just a quick housekeeping question for you, Mark. What was the March quarter EBITDA that the healthcare business generated?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It is in the discontinued ops area. You can see it and I believe it was about 21%-ish. I think that was around there. It did include some transactional related costs.
David M. Togut - Evercore ISI: Understood. Thank you, very much.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi. Thanks, it's Jamie at Susquehanna. Scott, in your opening remarks you were talking about the Verisk distinctives and that was helpful. One of them that you had called out was the increase in subscription revenue as a percentage of the total pro forma for healthcare. I was hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Meaning, why we care about that or just where the number goes? Are you asking where the number goes, too?
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: I didn't want to get too – I mean, if it's too specific quantitatively, that's fine, but directionally is that as significant?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No, I mean, I think we can – yeah, so let's, I think Mark is looking up the number right now. I'm not sure if you've got it there, Mark. But it's just part and parcel of what we do. The fact of the subscription revenue really goes to the nature of the relationship with our customers, which is deep and embedded. And it's when you're in that mode that you can move to subscription forms and just the recurrence and the visibility associated with the subscriptions is something that's very supportive of cash flow and operations and forecasting. So we do care about it. And it's one of the reasons why we feel good about the way our mix is rebalanced here now as we move towards the sale of the healthcare business. Mark, I don't know if you wanted to comment specifically on the numbers?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think it was 82%.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: 82%. Thanks.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: So, Mark, just to clarify that, what's the denominating? Are you saying that healthcare was – oh, 82% of the revenue pro forma for the healthcare sale is now subscription?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Correct.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Yeah. That's really helpful.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mean, hope that was responsive to your question.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Yeah, that's what I was getting. I wasn't sure if you have that so I thought it might too specific.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, we'll take 82%-ish. It's around there, yes.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Okay. Okay, and then I think also, Scott, you had suggested that it decreases seasonality or – yeah, decreases seasonality...
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Right, right.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: ...yeah, so could you remind us what the seasonal patterns were for healthcare with the sweeps and all that?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Healthcare was 40% first half of the second year and 60% second half of the year.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: All right. All right, you got all the answers. That's very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, how are you?
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: How should we think about growth in the specialized segment non-WoodMac, it seems like that has been jumping around a little bit?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah, there was a little perturbation there in the first quarter. I think you're going to find that settles out as we go forward.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then I just wanted to ask one additional question on your plans for further international expansion in the insurance business. Which geographies would make the most sense, just given the structure of their insurance systems? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep, yep. So you should think – that's a really good question, that's one that we think about quite a bit actually. You should think of us as a portfolio. So, the logical place for us to sort of drill down would generally be established economies that tend not to be overly concentrated in terms of market shares of leading players. So for example, on balance, and also you have to concede that language issues are here a little bit also, U.K. is a little bit better for us than, say, Germany. So we can sort of pick our spots that way. Japan is a highly developed economy that also doesn't have an overly concentrated insurance market, so that would be another. So, that's kind of your first sort. But the other part of it is, we are interested in emerging situations as well. And to that I would call out there, you would have to consider China still to be an emerging situation, so that's one that we look at. But it's also interesting that when you look at the sum of Southeast Asia, it turns that Singapore is becoming something of a hub. And so we're really kind of have both flavors inside of our portfolio. More of the energy will go into established economies, but we're going to feature both kinds in what we do.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thanks for taking my questions...
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): ...I apologize if I had missed this, but could you help us bridge what's changed or wasn't anticipated in your outlook for WoodMac in 2016 versus last quarter? It seems you're now you're looking for a flattish growth versus some growth last quarter. And perhaps if you could give us some color on how your conversations with clients are faring in light of some recovery in the price of oil? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So these are kind of small adjustments in our view, I would say. And it's really just a product of sort of the environment and the rate at which it does or doesn't change. Conversations with customers are overall very encouraging. I had the chance – I don't know, month, month-and-a-half ago to sit with the deputy CEO of one of the world's largest energy companies. And the stories they tell about how they make use of WoodMac content and their focus upon WoodMac as a partner, these are very, very encouraging kinds of stories. And then we just look into the data in terms of, for example, the number of users of our portal offering and the rate at which they're making use of our content, all of which are going up really pretty strongly. But it's also the case that even now kind of well into the nosedives in the pricing of the commodity, there are still reactions in terms of our customers trying to get their own cost structures right. And so – and in the same way that there was a little bit of a lagging effect in terms of the commodity price coming down and then the reaction – excuse me, of the energy companies, you have to expect that there will be some of that also on the way back up. So there will be some timing effects inside of all – I would not expect instantaneous reaction of our customers to what the price of the commodity is doing because the price of the commodity has to work its way into not only their forward plans, but also the way that they're actually spending their own CapEx dollars. And there just will be time dependencies inside of that.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, appreciate it. And as a follow-up as it relates to the DA insurance business, it looks like cat bond issuance reached a new quarter record after not a very exciting year 2015, could you talk about the tailwind that provided in the quarter? And what you would expect if these trends continue for the year?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, just first a comment, cat bonds are an interesting category and it's one that we participate in. And it definitely is there in the mix of risk transfer mechanisms that are out there in the world. But I would encourage all to not kind of overstate the amount of risk that gets managed through that mechanism. It's interesting to look at it, because you can sort of carve it out and identify it. You're right, it was a good moment for cat bonds, and our AIR business did very well. The share of the identified cat bonds that our team analyzed was very high. And, as I think everybody knows, we almost always have the vast majority of that market anyway, so yeah, it was helpful. But there's movement also in the cat bond world, don't miss that. There's the move towards the so-called mini cat bonds, and there are different ways that you can actually analyze cat bonds. So, it's kind of a – it's a dynamic environment, I'll put it that way. But yeah, we feel good about how we did with the most recent issuances.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, great. Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you so much.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from Arash Soleimani from KBW. Your line is open.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Good morning.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: In terms of – can you break out the revenues for Infield and PCI?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah, they're pretty modest in the scheme here. I don't think we've provided that detail in the past. They're not substantial. They're more tuck-in in nature.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, that's fair. And then, with WoodMac, is it fair to think there that the organic should do a little bit better in the second half of the year, given that, I guess, the discretionary consulting revenues were pressured in the second half of 2015? Does that comp get easier in the second half of 2016?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So the answer is, as reported, it probably could get a little bit better. It really is, again, to the consulting side of things, it's a bit of a swing factor in this, so we continue to try to remain conservative, although it's performing well and the underlying usage is up and strong.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: All right. Thank you for the answers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, good morning, all. A very thorough...
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: ...job as usual.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: My question is actually around Argus. I'm wondering, when you think about the growth in Argus, how much is coming from the core products versus the media or marketing effectiveness piece of the business? And where do you think the relative growth rates of those two (44:46) are?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean, the contributions to Argus' growth are very broadly based ,across not only sort of the traditional consortium model, analytic view, but also the specific analytic products that are being provided to customers, to the white labeling of our analytic environment, to the opening up of new markets, like media effectiveness, to the opening up of new markets geographically. All of those cylinders are hitting.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So there is no one call out per se?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: No. One of the reasons why Argus is such a wonderful business, and has such a bright future, is that it has many different ways to grow.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sara Gubins from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, thanks, good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Morning.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Morning.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Looking at the margin compression in Decision Analytics in the first quarter, it sounds like organic margins may have been up year-over-year. And so I'm wondering, first, if I'm reading that correctly? And second, if then the margin compression would be attributed perhaps to WoodMac and investments that you're making there?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: This is Mark. I think your observations are correct. Let me just remind you of two facts. First of all, WoodMac has very good margins. However, they have a tough comp in the rest of Verisk, so you are seeing that come into the quarter, that does work against us in Decision Analytics. The other thing you need to look at is, in first quarter of 2015, we kept talking about that project revenue from Argus, and we also highlighted back a year ago, there were extremely high margins on that project revenue. And as a result, that kind of creates an artificially high margin in 2015 in that first quarter. So, those are the two things that I think, if you normalized out, you would see probably a pretty good story inside of organic DA margins...
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And so, as we think about margins in that segment for the rest of the year, it doesn't sound like we should necessarily expect to see significant compression?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, I'll highlight the things I made before. We do have all of our salary increases that take effect in April. And we also give out our equity awards April 1 as well, and those will replace equity awards from four years ago. So those are some additional costs that are layered into the underlying structure from second quarter on. But, all else being equal, I agree with you.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then, sorry to bring this up again, but I just want to make sure that I understand your comments about WoodMac expectations. There are a number of moving pieces between purchase accounting and FX, as well as the timing of when WoodMac came in. On an underlying basis, excluding currency and excluding purchase accounting, is your expectation for 2016 trends lower than or worse than you had previously thought, given the overall environment? Or is your commentary about seeing it flat on a reported basis more a function of the purchase accounting mechanics?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I think what we tried to describe is that we remain very optimistic on the business, but we do believe that there are some probably some market economics that are just difficult for our customers and us right now. So in both cases, we think that's going to be down slightly. But still have the opportunity to grow on a reported basis. So I'm just trying to give at least get a little bit more color to everyone.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO. Your line is open.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Just had a follow-up question on the DA insurance piece, I was wondering if you could share any color on the pricing environment for your services? Just trying to better understand some of the acceleration and the growth there? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I would describe the environment as relatively unchanged, relative to last year and, actually, over many years. One of the hallmarks of the insurance industry is its stability. And so the regulatory environment has not really changed that much. Industry structure hasn't really not changed all that much. There have been a couple of larger mergers, but industry concentration still remains pretty much the same. The way that we price our products has not changed. Probably our pricing actually gets even a little bit tighter as we continue to grow the subscription based part of the mix. So there's really not – there's not a lot of change really in terms of what the environment yields.
Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, got it. All right. Thanks for the color.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Hansa Mazzarri (50:24) from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. This is Kavon Ravon (50:29) filling in for Hansa (50:28). Could you give us a little update on the Verisk telematics stat exchange and how many OEMs are currently signed up? And how large that initiative could be?
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Yep, so you've actually got a couple questions there. So the current status is we're actually in the rollout phase with our first OEM, who we announced some time ago. And we'll be providing product to the insurance industry kind of right around the crossover from third quarter to fourth quarter. So that'll be the first fruits commercially of what we've been doing. We're very pleased with the discussions we're having with the insurers in terms of their interest in the data and the analytics. And we are actively cultivating other OEMs, and I think we feel very good about the prospect of this really being the industry standard. But every OEM is going of kind of think about it in their own light and draw their own conclusions. But we're actively calling on all the name brand OEMs in the United States. So yeah, we feel good about it and the technical work has proceeded very nicely. And we're just kind of all – we're primed. We're ready to go.
Unknown Speaker: All right, appreciate it. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: You're welcome.
Operator: There are no further questions in the queue.
Scott G. Stephenson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. We're happy to talk about a quarter that we feel very good about and look forward to being with you again roughly 90 days from now. And we'll be seeing some of you between now and then who are coming to visit us here in the office. We look forward to having you. So thanks very much for your time today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Chief Knowledge Officer: Thank you, Dorothy, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2015 and full year 2015 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. The earnings release referenced on the call, as well as the associated 10-K, can be found in the Investors section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, until March 24, 2016, on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. And now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Eva. And good morning, everyone. We reported another year of industry-leading high-single-digit organic revenue growth with margin expansion and excellent free cash flow generation. Fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations, with total revenue growth of about 21% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 23%. Full year revenue grew 18% and diluted adjusted EPS increased about 29%. We grew the top line, excluding the healthcare analytics business and recent acquisitions, over 5% in the quarter and 7% for the full year. Profitability was strong as adjusted EBITDA excluding acquisitions grew about 7% in the quarter and 14% for the full year. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 47% in the quarter and 48% for the full year. We continue to work on our comprehensive review of strategic alternatives for the healthcare analytics business. There is a range of alternatives and not solely limited to a sale of the business. As responsible stewards of shareholder capital, we are being methodical and thoughtful in our approach. The volatility of the equity and leverage markets in the last quarter of 2015 and the beginning of 2016 has contributed to the timing of our efforts. We expect to be able to provide you with an update by the time we report first quarter earnings. We're always looking to innovate to drive growth at Verisk. For example, in our insurance business one of the solutions which has been contributing to growth in Risk Assessment is the ISO electronic rating content suite. We rolled out new features including an automated maintenance feed that allows insurers to import the most recent changes to ISO loss costs and rating algorithms directly into their rating systems. This is innovation which helps our customers to implement rate changes more quickly and more efficiently. In other recent news, WoodMac announced a commercial alliance with Thomson Reuters. This alliance gives customers of the Eikon platform a direct link to WoodMac's oilfield data and research. The information and analysis we are providing includes crude oil production, oil product balances and stocks, oil product prices, crack spreads and refining margins. This is an important new channel for WoodMac, extending our reach to customers we were largely not already serving. Looking at capital deployment, we are on track to meet our deleveraging commitment even as we have made a number of tuck-in acquisitions and returned capital to our shareholders through repurchases. We made a couple of acquisitions in the fourth quarter for about $50 million. We acquired Infield Systems including its proprietary database of offshore asset prices. We also acquired PCI Group, which has proprietary data assets and deep chemical industry domain expertise. These two acquisitions complement and enhance our data and capabilities at WoodMac very nicely. During the quarter, we returned capital to shareholders through the repurchase of over $20 million of stock. Our remaining authorization at the end of 2015 was $469 million after a $300 million increase in December, and we remain buyers of our stock at current levels. We are committed to a prudent mix of M&A and share repurchases over time to complement and enhance our core businesses. This combination positions us very well to deliver the kinds of shareholder returns over the next several years that we expect of ourselves and you expect of us. Our initiatives during the past year position us well to execute on our plans for 2016 and we're constructive on the outlook. We expect our combined insurance businesses will grow at least as fast as they did in 2015. This reflects the quality and value of the solutions we provide and the strength of our relationships. As we discussed at Investor Day in December, we expect WoodMac to grow in constant currency, even when excluding the effect of Infield and PCI. Given the end market dynamics, we think this is a strong reflection of the quality of our team, the strength of our intellectual property and the depth of our customer relationships. Our health care business grew 6% in 2015 with expanding margins, and we anticipate a higher rate of growth and additional margin expansion in 2016. We also expect Argus to grow double-digits for the full year 2016, even with the one-time project revenue we had in the first quarter of 2015. Over and above all of this, in 2016 we will strengthen our foundation. Our internal environment for handling large amounts of diverse data types is rapidly and continuously improving. Our data assets, already among the largest private data sets in the world, will expand. And our global footprint, a key to providing organic growth opportunities over the long term, is now in place and growing. Verisk is today one of the world's most valuable, vertically oriented data analytics companies. Our robust plans to the year 2020 will lead to new levels of distinction and performance. So with that let me turn it over to Mark to cover the financials in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Scott. For the fourth quarter, we again delivered solid revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing for the future. Revenue grew 20.6% in the fourth quarter and 18.4% for the full year. Net of healthcare pass-through revenue, and excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, total revenue grew 3.9% in the fourth quarter and 7.4% for the full year. Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the second quarter hedge gain and WoodMac one-time acquisition costs, grew 22.5% to $263 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew 24% to $996 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 47.4%, excluding the $15.6 million third quarter warrant gain. And adjusted EBITDA margins excluding healthcare, acquisitions, and third quarter warrant gains were over 50% for the quarter and year-to-date. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 29% in the fourth quarter and 5.3% excluding healthcare and acquisitions. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by insurance. For the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 25.9% and 9.3% excluding healthcare and acquisitions. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by strong growth in loss quantification solutions with good contributions from insurance, anti-fraud claim solutions, and underwriting solutions. Catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to the growth. Full year Decision Analytics insurance growth was a solid 8.1%. Financial Services revenue declined 2.6% in the quarter due to project work in the prior-year period which did not recur this year. For the full year Financial Services revenue grew 20.5% as a result of media effectiveness project revenue and continued demand for analytic solutions and services in the U.S. and notably expanding globally. The Healthcare business again performed slightly ahead of our internal forecast. Net of pass through revenue, Healthcare declined 2.4% in the quarter but grew 6.2% for the full year. Population solutions led the growth in the quarter while payment solutions led the growth for the full year. All areas contributed to full year growth and full year margins improved versus 2014. Energy and specialized revenue increased 410% in the fourth quarter and 264% for the full year. Organic growth in the quarter was 4.3% and for the full year 5.1%. Commercial weather and climate analytics and environmental health and safety solutions led the growth. WoodMac revenue in pounds and on a comparable basis declined 1% in the quarter and increased approximately 5% for the full year. For the period of our ownership, WoodMac contributed $211 million, slightly ahead of what we discussed with you last quarter despite exchange rate headwind. We're pleased with WoodMac's performance in an extraordinary time for their customers. Annual contract value of signings were up in 2015. Customer retention remained strong and client engagement as measured by portal activity was up 26% versus 2014. Turning to Risk Assessment. Revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter, indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment was due in part to 5.5% revenue growth of industry-standard insurance programs resulting primarily from growth in 2015 invoices effective from January 1. Property-specific rating and underwriting revenue increased 4.9% in the quarter. Growth was a result of new sales with higher committed volumes. For the full year, Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.8% driven by 6% growth in industry standard programs and 5.1% growth in the property-specific rating and underwriting category. As I mentioned earlier, EBIT (sic) [EBITDA] increased 22.5% in the quarter to $263 million resulting in EBITDA margins of 46.9%. Decision Analytics adjusted EBIT (sic) [EBITDA] increased 30.8% to $161 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions, growth of the business and lower professional services fees. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, second quarter WoodMac onetime items and the third quarter warrant gain. Decision Analytics adjusted EBITDA increased 3.7% in the quarter and 13% for the full year. EBITDA margins for the Healthcare Analytics business net of pass-through expenses were 24.8% in the quarter and 25% for the full year. Fourth quarter 2015 EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 11.4% to $102 million as a result of good revenue growth, good expense management and the talent realignment costs in the prior period. Excluding the prior-period talent realignment cost, EBIT (sic) [EBITDA] grew 5.8% in the quarter and 8.8% for the full year. Reported interest expense was $33 million in the quarter. At December 31, 2015 total debt was about $3.2 billion including about $870 million in revolver borrowings. Our leverage, at the end of fourth quarter was about 2.9 times. We'll remain committed to bring the leverage down to about 2.5 times by the end of 2016. Since the end of the fourth quarter we have paid an additional $165 million. Our cash and cash equivalents were about $138 million at the end of 2015. Our reported effective tax rate was 30.3% in the quarter. For the full year 2015 the effective tax rate was 29.3%. Adjusted net income increased 28% to $138 million in the quarter and 28.1% to $520 million for the full year. The average diluted share count was 172.6 million shares in the quarter. On December 31, 2015 our diluted share count was 172.2 million shares. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.80 in the quarter, an increase of 23.1%. For the full year adjusted EPS grew 28.8% to $3.09. For shares purchased in the quarter, the average purchase price was $73.20. At December 31, 2015 the company had about $469 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs well above our cost of capital. In 2015 free cash flow grew 33.5% compared with the prior-year period of $458 million and representing 46% of adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in the 12 months of 2015. Growth in free cash flow is driven by improved profitability in the business and stable CapEx, partially offset by higher interest and fees related to the WoodMac acquisition. Capital expenditures were $166 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $19 million over the same period in 2014. Capital expenditures were 8% of revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. We continue to manage the capital intensity of the business and expect it to continue to move lower as it has over the past several years. To think about your models for 2016, we expect CapEx of about $175 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $140 million, and amortization of intangibles of about $121 million. Based on our current debt balances, we expect interest expense to be around $130 million. We expect the tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 33%. For the intangible amortization add-back in the adjusted net income calculation, we will use 28% to reflect the tax rate applicable to our intangible assets. And finally we expect a diluted weighted average share count of about 172 million shares before incremental repurchases. As a reminder, first quarter of 2015 still had healthcare pass-through revenue included in the reported results. You will recall that after adjusting for the pass-through revenue of about $6.7 million, first quarter 2015 would have been $68.4. Also in the first quarter of 2015 we had about $11 million of project revenue at Argus, which had higher than average margins. Overall we're pleased with the results for 2015 and excited by the plan for 2016 and the opportunities ahead. We expect to see growth from multiple verticals and we're managing the business to generate long-term shareholder returns. With that I'll turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A.
Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer & Chief Knowledge Officer: Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. This will give more people an opportunity to ask their questions. And with that I'll ask the operator to open up the line.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Sara Gubins from Bank of America.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thank you. Good morning.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for the commentary about your revenue expectations. Could you talk about what gives you confidence that you'll be able to grow WoodMac in constant currency in 2016, given the 1% decline in the quarter? I know you're not going to give details about subscription versus service, but any color about what you were seeing on the subscription side, particularly around renewals would be very helpful?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So retention of customers remain strong and even in the first month-and-a-half of 2016 we're seeing strong year-over-year growth in terms of numbers of research subscriptions clients. We are seeing a increase in use of the portal, customer engagement is up 6% already in the year. So these are the kinds of things which basically relate to where we stand with our customers and is the source of our expectations for the year.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And so, I guess, is the expectation on the service side that you would continue to see pretty significant declines there, but it's less important as it becomes a smaller piece of the total?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're not really breaking that out, as you know, Sara, but I mean, our plan is for the whole business to perform.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, great. And then just separately on margins. Could you give us any color on how you're thinking about margins in 2016? Particularly because there were some hiring plans in Risk Assessment, I'm wondering if those have started to come through or if you would expect to ramp that next year or this year?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Good question. This is Mark, Sara. So first of all, let's start with 2015. We had some one-time items: the hedge gain, WoodMac transactions, the EVT, the warrant gains. So we'll pull that out and we remain positive and constructive with regard to margins in 2016. I do want to highlight two things that we tried to do. One, specifically, the talent realignment you mentioned. We would and we do expect people to be hired back to former levels. That's probably about 50 people, just to kind of give you a flavor of things, like around (18:31). And the other thing we did try to call out is that the project revenue of Argus in first quarter of 2015 was about $11 million. It had very high margins. So you have to just factor those two things in and hopefully that gives you some color on where we stand.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The first question just around WoodMac again. I was just wondering if you could help characterize your organic growth guidance of WoodMac next year in the context of what you're assuming the energy environment is? And then also maybe in context, like is this, the Thomson Reuters announcement that you did, a sign of more to come and is that maybe a material contributor to showing that growth number for 2016?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We think there are additional channels for getting WoodMac content to market and we actually think that the number of customers that WoodMac will have in the years to come will be substantially greater than it is today and part of that is in fact the new channels. And we're very early in the journey on that particular front but I would definitely expect additional channel partnerships as a way of supplementing growth at WoodMac.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And just on the assumption for the energy environment...?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're never going to be folks to predict the price of oil. The thing that is our real bedrock on this business is the depth of relationship that WoodMac has with its customers. We actually performed in the fourth quarter or we completed in the fourth quarter of 2015 our Net Promoter Score assessment across all of Verisk and WoodMac came in with the second highest Net Promoter Scores across all of Verisk. Their customers love them. I was with the deputy chair of one of the name brand global energy companies a couple of weeks ago and they just – they love WoodMac and they find the content and the analysis absolutely indispensable and that's really the foundation of the business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just real quickly I know in the comments you mentioned that you expect insurance growth to be at least as good as 2015. I was wondering if there was anything, any puts and takes to call out between the two divisions when we think about our models for the year?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Looking at you, Mark, I mean, it's kind of broad based. It's across almost everything that we do actually. Underwriting was strong in 2015, will be strong in 2016. I wouldn't really differentiate greatly among the different parts of what it is we do.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I agree.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks a lot, guys.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Just on healthcare, I guess, can you elaborate what gives you reason to think that it will grow faster in 2016? And then you also alluded to obviously there's more options than just selling healthcare that you're looking at. Can you, if you're able to talk at all about what other options are front and center on the table right now?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, maybe your second question first. So from the very beginning we had all options on the table taking a very thorough look at the business and how to maximize value for our shareholders and the standing of the business and so nothing changed. There is nothing changed in that regard. When we look at the growth of the business, part of it is we actually are having success in generating new revenue streams. I think you know that there was a lot of what we did on the revenue side that was related to Medicare Advantage. We started to do more work on the commercial side and that's a nice supplement to what we've traditionally done in the business.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then just on Argus, the marketing effectiveness type of projects, I know there's a tough comp in Q1 but when you gave your outlook in 2016 in terms of double-digit growth, are you counting on any other large lumpy projects at some point during the year when you say that?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I think we've been – I think we've – for some time now been trying to make it clear that there are large name brand companies that sort of get interested in the methods and when they come in, they come in a fairly big way. There have actually been several of those in the course of 2015 and into 2016 that will be a part of the growth overall. So there will continue to be sort of these breakout kinds of moments. But as we've said, the project then ripens (23:38) into a sustainable subscription and that's fully what we expect.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, thank you. I caught the commentary from Mark in terms of annual contract value growth at WoodMac for the full year but as the year progressed, mainly as we got into the back half and into early 2016, has there been any weakening in bookings trend at WoodMac?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I mentioned we've typically talked (sic) [not talked] about bookings. What I can tell you is that from a retention perspective, what we've seen in the end of the year and into even January/February is we've had retention rates that are consistent with – consistently high with what we saw for full year 2014 and 2015. So we're comfortable, actually a kind of very good part of the WoodMac business is that retention with the customers. We also mentioned kind of broadly that the bookings have been up so that's the good news. I'm not sure we're not going to give color dating back to prior to ownership. I'm not sure we have that detail with us. Sorry.
Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just thinking about healthcare quarterly modeling, with the shift in mix towards I guess de-emphasizing a little bit Medicare Advantage as a percentage of mix in favor of commercial, how much does the seasonality shift in healthcare relative to prior years?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So the short answer is that, I think we've talked about this in quite a bit of detail, but the MRA business, and the medical side of it in CMS, runs the SWEEPS from July to January, February. Typically what happens is the commercial side of this nicely fits in with – more in the first half of the year. But we're not going to talk as much about the details of Verisk Health given the strategic alternative process we're engaged in.
Jeffrey Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Can you give us a sense of I guess how pricing conversations have been going for WoodMac just as the year has progressed? And whether margins are still sort of – we should expect that sort of mid-40% number is still the right way to be thinking about it?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So I think the reality is the contract renewals, given the nature of the customers and the pain our customers are feeling, is kind of one that is a little bit more challenging. We've tried to bundle solutions. We've tried to do things that kind of provide value to them and also provide us upside to the extent that the CapEx spend and profitability returns to our customers as they use more solutions that will give us some upside. I think the combination of some of the work that we're doing to make the business; I'll call it a little bit more industrial – strength around IT and also to invest in the sales pipeline that gives us an extension to more people to sell it to. But we've been investing from a sales perspective more, and we've also from a technology perspective so we can, for the most part, take some of the solutions and maybe smaller swaps and maybe more confined view, a little bit more downstream in the sense of smaller customers. And that will hopefully help us in the top line. So those investments probably have taken margins down a little bit and we would expect that in 2016 as well.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And just, if you could give just a little bit more color on the business model of the Thomson Reuters partnership; is that going to be considered subscription? Or is it more like one – like data feed? And are you providing sort of data at a lower rate than you would in a direct subscription? And is there a similar margin profile for that? Thanks.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So let me try to take your questions, I'm not sure I'm going to do them in sequence but let me give it my best shot. First of all, the way the relationship with Reuters would be is it would be a kind of a subscription and access to a limited scope amount of information. If you wanted more you can buy different modules and different pieces. We've tried to take the data and cut some very big products into maybe smaller subsets, and provide it in a way that more people would be interested in it. Different groups of people, different customer sets. So once again, the nature of the information businesses that we have, we would expect one, to be subscription; two, not a lot of incremental cost once you sell that implementation service, not a lot of incremental cost there. So I think we feel pretty good about the margins.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hi. You spoke a little fast I believe in the prepared remarks on WoodMac like-for-like growth in the fourth quarter, and does that include the couple of small WoodMac acquisitions? And if so, what would be the organic fourth quarter number, like-for-like?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So like-for-like is a negative 1%. So we said that it was in the quarter negative 1%, comparable basis and that was in pounds. And we said 5% full year. And that excludes the acquisitions.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.: That excludes. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hello, Bill.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So I wanted to ask about the – if you look at the normalized, organic, constant currency growth rate for 2016, I think it would be helpful if you could frame for us the basis for drag that you're getting from WoodMac? I understand that WoodMac is still growing positively on a constant currency basis for 2016, but I'm trying to get at this normalized, organic, constant currency growth for 2016?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Bill, I think we're not going to give specific guidance. I think we've said it's going to grow next year, I think we feel good about the business. You've heard that. So I'm not sure I can directly answer your question without giving you a specific point target for WoodMac, which I'm not going to give here today.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Well, the – okay. Then second question. There's been some speculation in the media that you guys have been looking at Argus. Now I don't think any of us would expect you to comment on that speculation, though my question is what are you considering doubling-down in energy? By that I mean making a sizable acquisition in the energy space?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're always thinking about where do we sit and where do we want to go with respect to our customers. And I will say that having a sense, a good sense of where the price of the commodity is going as a part of a lot of the modeling that is already built into what it is that WoodMac does today. So at a general level I would say that understanding the entire supply and demand picture is a useful thing to do. Now we already – I mean, if you subscribe to WoodMac product, you know that there are views of forward prices as well as the supply side volume as well as dollar value. So that will all continue to be a part of what we do and our thought process is entirely around what is it that we can do to bring more value to our customers and when we put A and B together do we unlock even more value for our customers? So we're constantly thinking about everything that we can do to increase value so I'm not going to comment on that specific situation but just generally we're very active in thinking about where we are and where we ought to be.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One of the conversations I've heard you had with investors over the last 12 months to 18 months with regard to healthcare is the sort of value of the data in your healthcare business compared to the data across your other businesses and I assume that the relative value of healthcare data is one of the things that has led to this exploration of alternatives. We recently saw IBM buy Truven for a pretty big price tag. How does that influence your overall view of the value of the healthcare data in your business? Is it distinct from Truven's data? Just a little compare/contrast and whether or not sort of directionally that influences the range of outcomes possibly for that business at Verisk?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, so first of all our business, there are I would say small overlaps with Truven. In fact there are bilateral commercial agreements between us and Truven. But in general, their business is by degrees different than our business. So I wouldn't really use it as a particularly meaningful marker and we're very focused on how to – the business that we've got, what are the future opportunities, how can they be maximized and how do we maximize shareholder value for our shareholders? So yes, of course we've referenced things that are going on like that transaction but in reality I think that our situation is relatively custom. To the point about data, the basic point I would make to you is that obviously data is very important in the data analytic kind of work that we do and others do and everyone – all of the third-party vendors do but the distinction that we're trying to draw is when you look at the vast majority of the data that we've got inside of the insurance vertical, the financial services, retail banking vertical, and the oil and gas, metals and mining vertical, a lot of what we've got is very, very unique. The nature of regulation and industry structure in the healthcare world in the United States makes it relatively harder to have distinct data assets. That's the point that we've trying to stress. So it's not that we don't have data. We actually have a lot of data. But we very much want Verisk to be a highly distinctive, very differentiated partner to our customers. And one of the things that provides distinction is unique data assets. And they're just harder to achieve in the healthcare space.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hi. Thanks and good morning. Just a couple questions.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Can you – on the talent realignment where you said that you'll be doing about 50 new hires, is that pretty steady throughout the year in 2016? And could that have a favorable revenue impact maybe looking forward to 2017?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, let me remind you of the goal of the talent realignment. We did try to take what would be our more traditional ISO solutions business inside of Risk Assessment and focus this on kind of a shared services model, trying to take groups and become more efficient and more effective. And I congratulate the team on the work that was done there. We then took those resources and we said we were going to kind of invest in new products and in new segments. And our hope is that, yeah, that type of investment would lead us towards kind of sustainable growth in the future. And it's probably a little bit of a longer-term march than a short-term march but we're optimistic like we described earlier in those initiatives. With regard to timing, I think we've seen quite a few people hired in the latter part of 2015 and into the first quarter here of 2016. So although, I think you're right, it will kind of extend throughout the year, I think there's a little bit more of a push or an emphasis here in the first half.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll just add, I am very excited by the quality of the people we're attracting into the business. These are world-class people, global perspective. They are definitely going to help raise our analytic sights and just the quality and depth of what it is we do. It's very, very encouraging to people that we can attract to Verisk.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And lastly on the tax on amortization. I think the guidance there was 26% before and now it's up to 28%. I was just curious what drove the increase?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So what we did was we took a best guess back at the time. And remember, the world of purchase accounting and developing how much amortization runs through your books is something that won't be finalized until mid-2016. We gave you our best guess, we have a more refined estimate as to how much amortization is coming through and the amount as it relates to WoodMac is down a little bit from those original estimates, meaning that the U.K. rate is a little less pronounced or weighted in the calculation.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the answers.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.
James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group: Scott, I appreciated your dimensions you shared on the growth prospects for 2016. I wanted to ask you about your comment about your insurance assets. Would you anticipate that both RA and insurance in DA will accelerate next year?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group: Okay. And then if you could comment – I know that pricing is working through the system now on the ISO database and Risk Assessment. So, could you update us as to how much of that is still on the look back of prior period premiums and what some of the inputs are for pricing on RA overall?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So we, I think we have shared with you in the past that sort of the mix of revenue sources in that part of the business has changed, where it used to be that most every customer was being priced according to a two-year look back on premiums. But we're now at a point where more than 50% of what we do in RA is on multi-year agreements, not related at all to what was happening in the premiums two years prior. And then with respect to the rest of our customer base, where we still do reference premiums from two years before, just want to remind you that there are three terms in the pricing algorithm and premium is only one of the three. And we have complete freedom with respect to the other two, which is mill rate and the flat fees. And so the actual, literal effect of what is going on in the premium environment is actually very muted at this point. And it's really value-based pricing. It's the work that we do every year to try enhance and bring current what it is that we're providing to our customers. Our customers understand the value of that kind of work and it's really on that basis that we set the prices.
James Friedman - Susquehanna International Group: Helpful. Thanks a lot.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you so much. You had mentioned on the adjusted EBITDA margin when we take out the gain on sale of the third-party warrants, I think it was 47.4% for 2015, and then you said you were constructive on margins going forward. Does that mean you expect margins to go up in 2016 from that base?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: All right. What I tried to say was that I would caveat that positive just with the two adjustments I described. One, I mentioned the talent realignment. I kind of pointed to about 50 people, which would be some expense in Risk Assessment. We've talked about that over time. And the other thing I was just trying to call out was in first quarter of 2015, Argus had that revenue that was very high margins. It was about $11 million of project work. So I was trying to call out those two items in the context of what is a fundamentally sound and positive margin picture going forward.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. And then just going back to Argus, you mentioned what the project revenue was in 1Q 2015. Can you give us that number 4Q 2014 just so we can see how the quarter you just reported compare?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I'm not sure we've provided that in the past. It's not – it's notable as first quarter. I don't think we've given that out in the past. I'm sorry.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. No worries. Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald.
Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Hi, guys. This is Mike Reid on for Joe. Thanks for taking the call.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure.
Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: I had a quick question. Maybe a little more insight on Infield and PCI Group in specialized markets and kind of the impact, how much that could possibly move the needle in 2016?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We haven't really put out the absolute size of those but I would just encourage you to think of both of those as modest tuck-ins.
Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay. All right. And obviously Argus is still doing well. Are you hearing anything else in the financial services vertical on demand in regards to macro? Or does that seem stable?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Actually, some of the fundamentals in the business are actually quite exciting. And one that I would point is the success that we're having in getting consortia of banks in end markets other than the United States to come into our method, and it's really very exciting because when that happens then we're essentially platformed in the market and now we can do – now we can bring the whole range of solutions that we've got. So we have several very exciting developments right now along those lines. But with respect to the macro environment, I mean, we've referenced it. I would encourage you to just understand. It's not really material as it relates to the prospects for the business going forward. No, it's kind of steady as she goes.
Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Okay.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The macro environment.
Mike Reid - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities: Great. Thanks, guys.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Credit Suisse.
Zachary Bakal - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, everyone. This is Zach Bakal on for Anj. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to first ask again about that Argus segment and I think for the full year your commentary has been pretty consistent that you expect a high teens growth and we had a little bit better than that. I'm just wondering if that was a little bit stronger than you expected and that if that's just driven maybe by the consortia of banks or something else?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I would tell you that Argus is a wonderful business. I mean I just always like to mention that again. It has an incredible data asset that kind of creates a real barrier there and what the team there has been able to do is two things. One, provide great service and new products to those customers. And then we have the project revenue that is a little bit more related to the marketing and advertising effectiveness. We're trying to transition that to more subscription and I think we're being successful. So what we try to call out from an outlook perspective is that we continue to see very strong double digit growth and that is a growth even with or even kind of assuming the growth where that's going to happen in first quarter. So I felt we were trying to pretty transparent on that and hopefully that just clarifies the comments we made earlier.
Zachary Bakal - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Thanks. I think we all appreciate that. And then just secondly on the Telematics Data Exchange, you know what we've been reading of that, it's getting prepared for say a June launch. We haven't really heard any additional partnerships aside from the one you already mentioned with OnStar and GM. Have you been able to build any additional partnerships? And will the program require any further partnerships to launch in June?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So in reverse order, we can start serving insurance companies even without additional OEMs in the partnership. One of the things you have to reference by the way is how advanced or not each OEM is with respect to the connected car movement. So some had gotten on with it more. Others less, GM has actually been a leader. That's one of the reasons why we were so excited about striking the partnership with them. But no, we can and will and are selling the data and the analytics into the insurance vertical beginning with the rollout of the platform. And as we add additional OEMs, the value just simply goes up, but we don't have to wait for that. And as you'd imagine, the team is out and having a lot of conversations with a lot of OEMs domestically and globally to promote the method. So this is a very – this is something we talk about very frequently inside of the management team, and we have great hopes for this and a lot of focus on this.
Zachary Bakal - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): There's a lot of interest from us as well. Thanks for taking my questions.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. You bet. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I think both of my questions have been answered, but I guess one piece I was hoping to maybe push a little bit more back to the WoodMac color, I know you're not giving any specific guidance, but I think the other businesses you have given at least directional color on how you're thinking about growth in 2016 versus 2015. So versus the 5%, is there any color that you can provide whether up or down from there, knowing that there's a wide range for positive?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. I'm going to say it again. I said that it's going to grow, and I think we've been trying to be a little bit more transparent with regards to an outlook. I think that's as far as we're going to go at this point, and I hope you can respect that.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Then I think aerial imagery is an area you talk a lot about in the past, and we know you continue to innovate in a lot of parts of your business that don't necessarily get as much air time. I was wondering if there was any update on what you're up to there and the effect we can expect that to have on the insurance growth?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So you may have noticed last year that we actually put out a press release that we were sourcing images again. And that's on our – based on our own efforts, but we're also working with others to source imagery. What makes it really special is the analysis that converts it into solutions that can be used by insurance companies and players and other industry verticals. And we are very, very happy with our methods, and we expect to see increasing commercial results in 2016 for what it is that we're doing. So yeah, it's an abiding part of what we're doing.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. You're welcome.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn it back over to you for closing remarks.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest, and we are looking forward to being together with you again in about a quarter's time. And we certainly will have interesting updates for you at that point. So thanks very much, and enjoy your day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President and Treasurer: Thank you, Jackie, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2015 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Eva. Good morning, everybody. Before we turn to our third quarter results, I want to highlight two recent milestones in our journey. Forbes included Verisk in its list of the World's 100 Most Innovative Companies, and Verisk was added to the S&P 500 index. Both of these achievements are recognition of the foundation that's been created over decades and the hard work being done by our colleagues to add value for our customers every day, and evidence of excellence at scale. Yesterday, we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives for our healthcare analytics business. We've spent much time and thoughtful consideration of how Verisk Health fits within the broader Verisk. Our process of exploration has been underway for over a year and we are running a deliberate process. Verisk Health is an excellent business with a large market opportunity. Given our strategy and global ambitions, along with current market valuations per assets of its type and quality, we may have an opportunity to both refine our strategic focus at Verisk. We will update you on the strategic process in the future. Now on to some high-level results. In the third quarter, we delivered strong overall results with total revenue growth of 23% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of 33%. Profitability was strong with adjusted EBITDA growth of 32% and margins that continue to be industry leading. We grew the top line, excluding the healthcare analytics business and recent acquisitions, over 7%. On that basis, and excluding the gain on the sale of third-party warrants, adjusted EBITDA grew about 10%. We are well-positioned to execute in the future, and we'll have more to say about that at our upcoming Investor Day in December. As we think about long-term shareholder value and capital allocation, an essential filter for us is the set of distinctives, which are part of the Verisk way. These distinctives are: one, unique data assets; two, domain expertise; three, first-mover advantage; and four, deep embedment in customer workflows. These distinctives define successful data analytics businesses and will continue to inform our approach, and our long-standing approach for the allocation of capital, which is a mix of acquisitions and share repurchases. We also remain focused on delevering to our long-term target of 2.5 times by December 2016 with progress in the third quarter. Even as we delever, we have flexibility to make acquisitions and return capital to our shareholders through repurchases of our stock. Our existing authorization at the end of the quarter was about $190 million. I'd like to make several remarks about Wood Mackenzie. This is a very unusual moment in the oil and gas industry. Even though a challenging energy market has increased the demand for WoodMac's analyses, our customers have reacted to the current circumstances by being very careful with all forms of spending, ranging from capital expenditure to more discretionary services. We have certainly felt that impact most strongly seen in our non-subscription revenues, which have softened at this moment, and somewhat sooner than we had anticipated. And yet, I believe the true quality of WoodMac is shining through particularly brightly right now because of the current challenges. This is a highly moded business providing must-have content to customers and doing so in ways that highly engage our customers. As a result, the challenging circumstances notwithstanding, WoodMac has grown 7% year-to-date. I find that to be extraordinary performance under extreme circumstances, and I couldn't be prouder of my WoodMac colleagues. This business is even better than I thought it was at the time we bought it. Renewal rates are extremely high, same-store use of our content is up around 25% year-over-year, channels for distributing our product are expanding and customers are being well-served. It is my view that the moat around this business is widening at this moment. When customer spending patterns return to normal, we will be an even stronger partner to our customers and our growth will reflect this. In the intermediate and long term, I continue to expect this business to produce strong growth that equals or exceeds that of Verisk overall. An investment analyst recently said it well. Businesses like ours are about very strong end-market positions and compounding organic growth. WoodMac has proven that even in unusual and challenging circumstances, it can deliver both. I can also report that we are beginning to see all of the benefits that we expected, in addition to WoodMac's own performance. The integration of WoodMac and Maplecroft has been achieved, and we are beginning to see the first examples of cross selling. WoodMac is serving as the hub of our supply chain thinking, and we have added oil industry experts to accelerate our work there. WoodMac's global footprint is being used to strengthen and integrate the overseas operations of other parts of Verisk, and we are collaborating well to extend Verisk's strengths with respect to core competencies like large scale data integration. Speaking of which, at our upcoming Investor Day, you will hear more about our focus on our five core competencies, which are: number one, large scale data integration; number two, multitier, multispectral imaging; number three, data visualization and consumability with an emphasis on geolocation; number four, stochastic methods leading to prediction in complex environments; and number five, localization of solutions, including the sourcing of relevant local data. During the past several months, our progress advancing our competencies agenda was well-aligned with the distinctives, as you would expect. For example, we announced General Motors, through its subsidiary OnStar, as the first auto manufacturer to sign on to the Verisk Telematics Exchange. Auto insurers will have expanded access to connected-car data in an easily useful format, paving the way for new and innovative usage-based insurance programs. Insurers that have their own telematics models will also be able to connect to the exchange for data about their consenting customers. The exchange will create new opportunities for customers who choose to deepen their relationship with auto manufacturers. More recently, we announced a new ISO ClaimSearch integration model for claim system vendors. The model provides claims handlers an unprecedented interactive view of over one billion industry claims and allows them to navigate seamlessly across a series of interactive analytics in order to improve efficiency. This deep claims systems integration represents an important evolution of real-time claim analytics and processing and is an important part of a multiphase project to create a more intuitive, robust ISO ClaimSearch System that offers cutting-edge solutions fully integrated throughout the life of the claim. Finally, AIR is collaborating with leading security, risk and cyber data providers to build an advanced cyber risk model to help the insurance industry better manage the evolving threat of cyber attacks. AIR will leverage terabytes of data gathered by a partner from sensors deployed across the Internet. Another partner has provided AIR with historical infinite data on more than 16,000 breaches. In addition to probabillistic loss estimation, the AIR Cyber Risk Model will offer a set of deterministic scenarios that will allow companies to begin to truly understand their aggregated risk from large-scale cyber attacks. We will continue to build out our solutions to benefit our customers in the industries we serve, further developing the core competencies aligned with the Verisk ways for distinctives. We view these as critical foundations for the most successful data analytics businesses and a lens through which we have made and continue to make our capital allocation decisions. We're very confident in our path and our ability to execute. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Scott. In the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth while also investing for the future. Revenue grew 22.7%. Organic revenue grew 7.3%, excluding the healthcare analytics business and recent acquisitions. EBITDA grew 31.9% to $279 million. EBITDA margins, excluding healthcare, acquisitions and a $15.6 million gain on the sale of third-party warrants, were over 50% for the quarter and year-to-date. Third-party warrants related to our ownership position in the EagleView. Within Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 31.8% and 8.1% ex-healthcare and acquisitions in the third quarter. Decision Analytics insurance category revenue grew and led the organic growth in the quarter both in percentage and dollar terms. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 8.6% in the quarter. The increase was well-balanced across our solution areas and reflected the close integration of our teams as they serve our customers. Financial Services revenue increased 7.3%, driven by continued underlying demand for our core solutions and services. Year-to-date growth was 30.2%, and as we noted last quarter, we continue to expect Argus to grow in the high-teens for the full year 2015. The underlying growth rate of the core business continues to track in the high-teens as well. The variability around the quarters has been driven by our activity in the media sect of this space, an area we continue to see opportunity to develop and monetize. The healthcare business is tracking to our internal full year revenue and EBITDA forecast. It is an excellent business in a growing market. Energy and specialized revenue increased 5.6% on an ongoing basis, reflecting continued success in our environmental, health and safety business. Including the recently acquired WoodMac and Maplecroft businesses, growth in the category was over 400%. As a reminder, WoodMac's revenue contribution continues to be impacted by a purchase accounting reduction. WoodMac's revenue, in pounds, grew 1% in the quarter and approximately 7% year-to-date through September. You'll recall that we indicated a conservative approach to our model for 2016 and into 2017. For the more discretionary part of the business, some of those headwinds materialized sooner than we had forecast. However, despite these earlier-than-expected headwinds and because of the strength of the subscription business, we expect full year growth, in pounds, excluding deferred revenue impact, to be in the mid-single digits and modestly below our prior expectations. Including the adverse impact of the exchange rates, we expect WoodMac's reported revenue under our ownership for 2015 to be about $210 million, lower than we have previously discussed. We continue to focus our efforts and resources on the long-term development of our business for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. We are pleased with the work that Wood Mackenzie and Maplecroft have begun to do together. Risk Assessment revenue grew 6.4%, continuing to demonstrate the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Industry-standard insurance programs grew 6.7%, reflecting our 2015 invoices which were effective January 1, and continued contribution from newer solutions such as predictive models and Electronic Rating Content. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 5.2% in the quarter. This increase was driven by new sales and increased prices. As a reminder, sequential growth in the fourth quarter last year was higher than normal as a result of a few one-time items in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, EBITDA increased 31.9% in the quarter to $279 million, resulting in EBITDA margins of 50.7%. Decision Analytics adjusted EBITDA increased 49% to $177 million in the quarter as a result of acquisitions, growth in the business and lower professional services fees. EBITDA margins for the healthcare analytics business were 27.6% in the quarter and 24.1% year-to-date. The third quarter 2015 EBITDA in Risk Assessment increased 10.1% to $102 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management including the impact of lower cost resulting from the fourth quarter 2014 talent realignment. Reported interest expense was $33 million in the quarter. Total debt, both short-term and long-term, was about $33.2 billion at September 30, 2015. Our leverage at the end of the third quarter was about 3 times. We remain committed to bringing the leverage down to 2.5 times by the end of 2016. Our reported effective tax rate was 32% for the quarter. This rate reflects the benefits of our tax planning efforts and the lower foreign tax rates. Adjusted net income increased 35% to $146 million in the quarter. The intangible amortization in the quarter was lower than expected because of our updated valuation for the WoodMac-related intangibles and longer average useful lives. The longer lives reflects the unique proprietary and embedded nature of the WoodMac data. The average diluted share count was 172.2 million shares in the quarter. On September 30, 2015, our diluted share count was 171.8 million shares. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.85 for the quarter, an increase of 32.8%. Excluding the gain on the sale of the warrants, adjusted EPS was $0.79. Free cash flow, defined as cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures, increased 50.3% to $414 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 including WoodMac. This represented 56.5% of EBITDA. Capital expenditures increased 2.7% to $106 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 and were 7% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx to be about $170 million including WoodMac. As of September 30, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents were $169 million. As you think about your models for the full year, including WoodMac purchase accounting from the time we closed, we now anticipate a diluted average weighted share count of 169 million shares, fixed asset appreciation and amortization of about $125 million and amortization intangibles of about $95 million, and we'll provide an update when the purchase accounting is finalized. In addition, for the fourth quarter, based on the current debt levels, we expect interest expense to be about $32.1 million. For the intangible amortization add back and the adjusted net income calculation, we're using a 26% tax rate as we discussed last quarter. And finally, we expect the tax rate to be around 35% for fourth quarter of 2015. Overall, we're pleased to report the WoodMac integration is proceeding ahead of schedule while executing our operational plans, and we're positioned well for profitable growth in the future. With that, I'll turn it back to Eva for comment before the Q&A.
Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President and Treasurer: Great. Thank you, Mark. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us now, we would ask that you ask one question and one follow-up. That will give more people an opportunity to ask a question during the Q&A. And with that, I'll open the line to the operator to open for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair and Company. Your line is open.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Excuse me. Thank you. On Wood Mackenzie, can you just give a little more color? You, I guess, talked about non-subscription growth slowing, but did you see any slowdown, I guess, in the subscription side of the business, and I guess, any way you can help us kind of quantify more the different pieces impacting that?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We're not breaking out those two parts of the business, Tim. But I will say that the subscription revenue growth has held up very nicely, and the full year view and the quarterly view are both good and strong.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And then in healthcare, I guess, one, your comment that it's tracking to your annual guidance or annual expectation, can you just elaborate? I think it was probably slower than most people expected, and maybe we had the wrong view. But is there anything that's changed in the environment, whether demand or competition wise? And secondarily, can you give us any sort of help with the profitability of that business as we think about the potential sale of it? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So let me take the first part of that, Tim. So the comment that Mark made earlier was that the business is tracking with our expectations, meaning, our portfolio forecast for the business, and so that was his comment. With respect to the business, the environment is relatively unchanged. The dynamic with the customers is relatively unchanged. As you know, there's seasonality in this business, and it's also the case that this business has more transaction volume than the rest of Verisk. And so you find the timing can play a role in what happens. And that's fundamentally where we sit at the moment. So, Mark, you actually commented on healthcare EBITDA margins a moment ago. So maybe you want to come back around.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So just to clarify, the third quarter healthcare margins were 27.6%. So hopefully, you have that in your math and I just will reiterate strong business, competitive nature, has not changed, I think, we are still currently well-positioned into a very nice, big market.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Well, can I just ask is there any seasonality to that margin? I guess, as we think about the full year, I guess, a full year run rate or is that (20:01)?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So the healthcare analytics business in the third quarter was 27.6%. Historically, because of some additional volumes that we've seen for what we refer to as the Medicare side of things, it has been a little bit bigger, maybe margined a little bit better in the second half. Year-to-date, we're at 24.1%. I will tell you, though, there is a little bit of noise in there because of the transition of accounting from what we refer to as gross versus net. But hopefully those couple of factors will help you out.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So I guess, with regard to RA, which is doing very nicely, can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of that faster organic revenue growth, say 6%, 6%-plus, and what exactly is underpinning that improvement over what we've seen in the last few years? Is it all invoicing, or is there some specific customer ROI call outs that are driving that?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Definitely not just invoicing. This is the time of year where we actually set the pricing for the kind of the industry standard program, rules, forms, lost cost, the part of it that relates heavily to just the overall regulation and structure of the insurance industry. But we are working very hard to expand that suite of solutions, bringing new solutions to the market and growing newer forms of putting the content and the analysis out there. So predictive models are growing very nicely. Electronic Rating Content is growing very nicely. We're searching for all opportunities to expand the business to international customers, and we've made headway on that front as well. So it's broadly based, and we're very optimistic about the future profile for this business.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And as a follow-up, just from a big picture, now that the strategic nature of healthcare is something you guys are thinking hard about, kind of down to three core businesses, in the long term, do you start to rebuild from there? Are you looking for new areas strategically long term that are a good fit or is this really probably the right sort of core business set with which Verisk runs going forward?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thank you for the question. And that is something that we've spent a lot of time on, and we feel very good about these three core verticals. And I think what you can expect from us is that we will continue to grow and expand inside of them. Our thesis is, and I referenced this in my comments up front, that there are things that make Verisk, Verisk; those four distinctives. One of the things that I just feel so strongly about is Wood Mackenzie is absolutely aligned with those four distinctives. And we'll do a better job of both feeding off of core competencies that we have at Verisk, but also feeding them. And so, for example, Wood Mackenzie is a business that definitely will benefit from our strong and growing expertise in multitier, multispectral imaging in a way that actually the healthcare business wouldn't. Another comment along the same lines is that the global energy business is inherently global, whereas healthcare will always remain a domestic business. And so we think very hard about who is it that we want to be. And I think that the right way to frame us is the verticals, the distinctives and the core competencies that I laid out for you. And we feel that the three verticals that you focused on are very, very nice steps with that, with all of that.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, guys.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So I just wanted to step back and just try to understand what changed, in a little bit more detail, so both WoodMac and healthcare. So with WoodMac, I mean, last quarter the energy environment was challenging as well, but it sounded like you guys were confident with the growth rate there. So trying to understand the delta there. And on healthcare, I guess, I understand the rationale that it sounded like you said, you guys were looking at this over a year ago. But I think around that time, you guys were pretty committed to the long term, like selling it wasn't in the sights, and I think you had that focus on Investor Day. So I guess what I'm really trying to get at is from last quarter to today, what are the real changes that have led to the WoodMac result and the healthcare decision?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. So in order. On WoodMac, the thing that I would call out for you is just that there are different profiles to how the energy market works basically, and we had said for some time that we thought that 2016 could represent some softness, and the question was what might be the timing. And we just found that the timing has been pulled forward a little bit, probably related to things that are going on with our customers as they make decisions about spending in light of the current environment. And it's really that simple. On healthcare, we've been asking – well, we're always asking the question about the deployment of capital across everything that we do. So even a year ago, we were thinking critically about what are the highest and best uses of our capital and how does healthcare fit into that picture? Since that time, what has happened? Well, there has been a public offering of a company that is very analogous to ours. There has been the activity in the healthcare M&A market generally. And we just take account of all of that basically, and with deliberation at a moment in time, we've drawn a conclusion about an exploration.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then just a quick follow-up. So just on WoodMac, how should we think about the trajectory of that 1% growth you called out in the quarter? Is that where your initial 2016 expectations were or was that even worse than maybe what you had modeled there?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So we're going to talk in more depth about WoodMac at our December Investor Day, and I would encourage everybody to come and be with us. But what I would point you to, as Mark put out there, our view for full year 2015 and that's what we've said about it so far.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks.
Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President and Treasurer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): When you said that 2016 softness in WoodMac may have been pulled forward, I know you're not breaking out subs versus non-subs. But does that include some weakness being pulled forward on WoodMac bookings trends for the subscription business?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then on the healthcare decision to, I guess, explore, at least, the strategic alternatives announced last night, the disclosure or the timing of the disclosure, should we view that as being driven by press reports or by reaching some step in the process relatively recently? And if it's the latter, can you just comment on, and I know you've talked about the timing over the last year, but can you talk about the timing of reaching that conclusion just given how trends are right now as you think about maximizing value for your shareholders?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We've been in a long and deliberate discussion with our board. And the process has accounted for a lot of different things, a lot of different considerations and driven by our own considerations, definitely not by the press. Not at all. It's just in our own timing, we decided that we were comfortable making the statement that we made last night. But it was entirely our own thinking and developed, again, over a very – we've been talking with our board about this for some time.
Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks, Scott.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Within WoodMac, could you just give us a better sense of what services clients are pulling back on, and also, just what types of customers are tightening their spending the most? Is it the NOCs or is it more broad-based?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'll start, and, Mark, you might want to jump in as well. So we have commented on the difference between the hardcore data analytic business and then the services, and it's definitely being felt on the services side. The hardcore data analytic, which is subscription-based, has performed very nicely in this environment. With respect to within the customer base, there is some segments that are doing very nicely, actually. But it is among the companies in the industry, the oil companies themselves, and I would point particularly to NOCs and also the focused E&P players. That's where it's been felt most strongly.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I will just highlight, I think, something Scott said earlier. I think the silver lining, the good news in there, besides the subscription rates being extremely high, the renewals of those. We've seen a lot more usage. This is about what the analytics and the actual people looking at the content of about 25%. So you can clearly see the value of the solutions they provide despite what is an interesting time in the market.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, sorry. I just wanted to correct something I said. I didn't mean to say the NOCs. I meant to say the integrated global oil companies. National oil companies have actually been pretty strong in the current environment.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. And just on healthcare, just looking at fourth quarter, like, should we expect sort of a similar expectation to what the growth in this quarter, is there any reason to think that it will be better than this quarter was? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think we've just tried to highlight that we did expect a deceleration in the second half of the year from a growth perspective. We are continuing to track internally. We think it's a very good business, very big market, and we have confidence in that team.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: (32:09 – 32:13) usual about EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter, including healthcare. The way I just want to make sure I understand the third quarter number for EBITDA margin, the 50.7% includes warrants. So if I exclude the warrants of $15.6 million, gains in the third quarter was $47.8 million, right? And how should I be thinking about the fourth?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Your math is good. I got $47.9 million, but I'm sure we're probably just rounding. I would tell you that we continue to see a strength in the margins. I think you saw that in third quarter. There's operating leverage throughout. We do have beginning of some of the hiring that we had identified earlier on with that realignment inside of risk assessment. So some of those costs will come back into fourth quarter. I want to mention that. And I think the natural ebbs and flows of expenses as it relates to fourth quarter should feel generally like the third.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Bill.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Good morning.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So first question on healthcare, just to ask. If you go through this process and you do decide you want to sell the asset, what are your thoughts in terms of the use of the proceeds?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, you can expect from us the same approach that we've always taken, which is when we put out a leverage target, we're going to meet that leverage target. And then we continue to lean into the M&A agenda. That's our first best use for available funds. And we've always felt very good about the share buyback program, and you will continue to see that featured in our capital deployment as well.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And now the second question to ask about, financial services and Argus. Basically, if you could comment on the pipeline that you're seeing in demand for media effectiveness and then as you – I understand it's a lumpy business because of the project-related apportion of some of the revenue. So I'm trying to understand how we should think about the annual revenue, the growth rate for revenue on an annual basis.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah. So the overall profile for Argus, when you account for all the different ways that this business can grow, it can grow internationally. It can grow by new customer acquisition for the existing solution. It can grow by more applied analytics for individual customers. It can grow by the expansion of the media effectiveness business. All of those things are at work. All of those things are powering the performance of Argus. I expect Argus in 2016 and beyond to be the same Argus that you've known and that we've known. It is a very innovative team that is working on top of a very proprietary set of intellectual property assets and doing a great job with them. And so the outlook is completely unchanged. And there is this somewhat lumpier quality that will be there from time-to-time when the very large, particularly, I would say, new media players get interested, their entry tends to have a pretty substantial effect and then it sort of normalizes as you go forward. So there probably will be lumps going forward, but the overall profile of the business is going to look very much like it has.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Bill.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch: First, a question on Decision Analytics margin. When we adjust for the benefit of the healthcare pass-through revenue change and the investment gain, it looks like the underlying margins in that segment were down year-over-year. Could you talk about what might be driving that and whether or not we should continue throughout next quarter?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Let me take that. There was some reduction in the margins for the third quarter relative to last year when you do do that math. I would highlight that overall, margins are extremely strong. I think the Decision Analytics margin is based upon kind of the overall way the business is set up should, into the future, continue to grow. But obviously, a consistency to fourth quarter as you saw third quarter, that's probably a good parallel.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch: And is there anything that changed versus the first half of the year that would be driving that?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, I mean, there's a few things that we did highlight up front. If you were to think about the Touchstone investments, some of the work that we're doing to kind of integrate platforms and bring Touchstone together, that is one item. The other thing is some OpEx and CapEx as we bring on new initiatives like the Telematics data exchange. There's cost in there that we need to incur now and revenue is following. So these are long-term investments that will prove fruitful for both our top line and bottom line in the future. But there's some cost to be undertaken.
Sara Rebecca Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Arash Soleimani with KBW. Your line is open.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks, and good morning.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Couple of questions here. You mentioned in the press release on healthcare that it'll give you the opportunity to pursue some of your global ambitions. I just wanted to know if you could talk a bit about that. Is that mostly on the insurance side and just see if there's any more color you can provide there?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So you're going to see the deployment of capital having a couple of characteristics going forward. One is it will be spread across everything we do at Verisk. So it's not going to be concentrated in any one part of the business. And the other thing that you'll see is that we are going to try to deploy the capital disproportionately in non-U.S. markets in order to support the expansion of everything that we do globally.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And this is Mark. So just trying to, and sorry to do this, but even to Sara's earlier question, some of the margins that you were referring to on last question, we have put some resources into international business development and, also, to localize our solution, so that we can attract and attack various international markets. So let me add that to be as the third bullet to some of the cost we incurred. Sorry for that, Scott.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. No. Thanks.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. And my second question is just back on to the tax rate. It was 32% this quarter. I think you guided to 35% for the fourth quarter. So it seems like it's starting to trend below the 36% we were expecting on the last call. I'm just wondering, where could that end up? Is there is still opportunity to improve that in 2016?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So this is Mark. We do believe that the rate, the effective rate, in the UK should come down by potentially a point come 2016. So that would add to the, from a balance or weighting perspective, that should add to some good news in 2016. And I think we'll try to provide you a little bit guidance as we get closer to 2016 with what our expectations are. So a little bit down, but still we're pretty much a U.S. taxpayer with a lot of footprint in New York, New Jersey, California and Massachusetts. So the U.S. operations kind of come with high state tax rates.
Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You bet.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much. In the 10-K, when you're talking about the lower growth in healthcare, you say that it was due to changes in our customer contract language in the healthcare revenue category. Can you elaborate a bit on this? Is that something that just happened in the third quarter, and is that something that's going to impact growth going forward? Thanks.
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So I think what we're referring to there is with a customer beginning, like, first quarter of this year, we went from basically a gross accounting for certain services to net accounting. So we did not want to, for the most part, continue to provide the service. We went to a third party. So we transitioned because of the contract, because of the nature of the contract. The bottom line, let me say, did not change. The EBITDA did not change. I think this is just the notion of how we account for it, gross versus net, from a revenue perspective. Same contracts, same revenues, same pricing, it was just simply the nature of the relationship caused a change in the accounting methodology.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And I'm sorry. Roughly, what was the impact this quarter?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hang on. Give me a second here. Maybe David can follow-up with you, but I do believe that it was probably about $10 million to $11 million, but we'll get back to you.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. I'll follow-up on that. And then just one question on WoodMac. Sorry. You had mentioned that you're looking for I think it was $210 million in revenue contribution on a dollar GAAP basis. It was lower than it was before. Can you just remind us what it was before?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We were at $225 million.
Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, great. Thanks so much.
Operator: You're next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. I first wanted to ask about the expectations for the Telematic exchange even though I know it's not supposed to launch until summer 2016. I was wondering what is the go-to-market and how you actually plan to charge insurance companies for this service. And then given it's really not until 2016, how much still needs to happen? Is it still primarily development work that needs to be done or is it just signing people up, et cetera?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me start with the answer of kind of what we're doing and where we're at and then Mark can talk about the revenue model. So we are in the process of actually dimensioning the data sets and the UX so that our insurance customers can make use of the data that we'll be compiling inside of the data set. So there is root and branch work which is going on right now, and Mark mentioned that before and I'll just mention more. Here's the general theme where Verisk is concerned. I think we're doing a very good job of running the business tightly, which I think you can see in the margins. And we're doing that at a moment where, actually, the software intensity of a number of our businesses is actually going up. And so it's kind of a fine balancing act, but I actually feel very strongly positive about the way our operation has been able to actually raise efficiency while, at the same time, actually deepening investment in some of these ways. So there is root and branch development work of all of the processes associated with extracting, transforming and loading the data then the management of the data inside of the exchange and then the return of the analytic to the user community. That is going on. That's part of between now and December 2016. The other thing I would comment on is, as you would imagine, when the announcement was made of our partnership with General Motors, it created quite a stir among all the OEMs. And so there is a very brisk set of conversations going on right now with the other OEMs. The focus at the moment is the U.S. But our hope is that with time, having built out this capability in the United States, we will be able to work with the same OEMs, particularly those that are not headquartered in the United States, and bring the same method into other markets. So I think you can think of it as two streams of development going on at the moment for the domestic market, the infrastructure and the participation of the other OEMs. And then subsequent to that, there will be a pushing out globally with respect to all of that. So that's kind of what we're doing with the business. Mark, do you want to talk a little bit about the revenue model?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. So what we've put in place is really this wonderful consortium model that will ramp up for those people who choose or opt in. What we do expect to do is monetize this by providing this very useful N+1 type data to our insurer customers in, really, two forms. We'll play the part of if you need the data like we would serve that up to them. But what we also do have the opportunity to do is provide a lot of analytics around that. So as you know, we have some very interesting Telematics scoring models, whether it's about the behavior of the driver or about the location in which that drive happens from point A to point B. All of that factors into the underwriting and pricing of the risk, meaning the pricing of the policy. So we have an opportunity to provide those analytics along with the data to our customers. And I think we have a very unique position to aggregate a lot of industry data in a very unique way. So I feel pretty excited about the opportunity here and the relationship to bring basically all of these OEMs together with the insurance industry and be the hub of that consortium.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: As a follow-up, I know you've talked in the past about the efforts to build up the imagery capabilities and you've listed out a number of areas that you hope to talk about at your Analyst Day. But just wondering, any detail about how you're thinking about that today, given it has been something you talked about in the past would be helpful. And as we think about cost, I was wondering what the impact these investments in that effort are having on costs. And should we see a step up or a step down from current levels over time as you roll those out?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So our interest level remains very high. And our goal is to have a number of use cases. Some of the most important use cases in the nearer term relates to the insurance industry. And we've already actually seen our ability to create material revenue streams in what we're doing. But to my way of thinking, we're still kind of right at the beginning, basically. Our methods are very good. Our methods will be expanding because, as you know, sort of the heart of the paradigm today is to make use of an image coming from the belly of a plane 2,000 feet or 3,000 feet above the ground. When we say multitier, multispectral imaging, we're talking about using an image from a satellite, which is 30 miles to 50 miles up a plane, an unmanned aerial vehicle. And something else which is going to be occurring going forward will be the use of handheld devices to also provide imagery. We're not very far away from the day when all of us may use our handheld device to image the interior of the places where we live. And that information also can potentially be used in the insurance process. And then there are a lot of other use cases: the solar industry; municipalities; and on and on. So I think we're just at the beginning of this march. We have made efforts, and we continue to make efforts to step up the availability of relatively precise aerial imagery today because that relates to today's use case. I think what you're going to find from us is that with time, the relative importance of the other forms of imagery will go up, and so the mix will probably modify as we go forward. With respect to the cost of sourcing aerial imagery today, we are sourcing more images and it will be there in the cost structure. But I don't think it's going to be a huge factor, partly because we found new and different ways to sort of contract for the sourcing of the images. So it'll all remain relatively dynamic, but the category remains very, very interesting to us.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): I was wondering if you could discuss the dynamics behind why there was such a latent impact on the services businesses for WoodMac in light of where the oil prices have been and some of your competitors dealing with this pressure for a few quarters now.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. You know, I'm not really going to comment on the competitors except to say that we observe in what we're doing the relationship that we have with our customers. And what we see is that the content that we provide is a must-have, and the depth and quality of the customer relationships remains unchanged. The renewal rates are enormously high. They're actually higher than found in several other parts of Verisk. And so we're very, very pleased with where the business is in terms of making a difference for customers and the content being meaningful. And as you know, the revenues at WoodMac are weighted heavily towards the recurring subscription-based data analytic, and that continues to do very well. In this moment, I would think particularly our industry customers, our oil and gas industry customers, are attempting to respond to an unusual set of circumstances. They've decided, in this moment as they've right-sized their own teams, as they have modified their capital expenditures, they've also taken hard look at that which is discretionary. And the kind of services that we provide, which is the minority of what we do, those have been under pressure at this time. But I think the true measure of the business is the underlying recurrent subscription business and that's held up, I think, very nicely actually.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And one other one on WoodMac. You recently announced an e-commerce service for WoodMac.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Right.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Curious to see how much of this decision here was something that you're being proactive on, or is it more about pull-type of function from clients interested in one-off or à la carte types of products and services. Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So glad you asked. And actually you're going to see more of that from us. So we actually put out there an announcement about the first one, but there will be many, many more. There are a number of ways to put the content out there, and it is definitely us pushing not other's pulling. In other words, we've said we can slice and dice our content, which is the thing that we look – that's one of the plays we've run across everything that we do. Particularly relevant here is not existing customers saying, I want to get it differently or I want different discrete packets of what you've got. You've already got a very highly featured menu that you can already shop when you're an existing customer. This is really about trying to move the content towards entirely new user communities. Mark, you wanted to say something else?
Mark V. Anquillare - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think we highlighted this even at the last quarter call. If you actually look at the number of customers that WoodMac has in that 800 to 900 range, that's a very small number relative to the number of people who could potentially benefit from the content. So moving downstream, not in an upstream/downstream perspective, but kind of to the smaller customers has been a constant push that we're on. It comes in the form of some new sales reps to attack that, but as well, the Internet or e-commerce approach to providing a smaller package of solutions that people can access through the Web is another approach to doing that. So we remain optimistic about ways we can get downstream to maybe provide opportunities to a bigger set of customers.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As much as WoodMac is the leader in its category, this is an undersold business.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. Scott, there's a couple concerns have come up with the results around healthcare in the call today on energy and the lack of guidance has created probably even more uncertainty around both of those. Is there any way here at the end of the call you just want to try to clarify or help us get a little color on trends going forward? Can you give us 3Q bookings growth for WoodMac? And how does the fourth quarter in healthcare look? Is it more like the third quarter or more like the first half?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We've never provided bookings commentary on any of our businesses. Mark already put out there our expectation for WoodMac for the full year of 2015. So I do think we spoke to that. And in light of our comments about our strategic review, we've sort of said what we're going to say about healthcare.
Paul L. Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Stephenson for closing remarks.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Well, thank you very much, everybody, for joining us. We look forward to catching up with you at Investor Day in December. Hope all of you will be there with us. We're going to feature a lot of discussion and commentary about Wood Mackenzie particularly, so hopefully you'll find that very helpful and interesting. And otherwise, thanks and enjoy your day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Verisk Analytics Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Houston. Ms. Houston, please go ahead.
Eva Huston: Thank you, Jennifer and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2015 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark, highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we'll open up the call for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors Section of our website at Verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K, that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dialing. Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our SEC filing. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, Eva. Good morning, all. In the second quarter, we again delivered excellent results, with total revenue growth of about 18% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 35%. Profitability was strong, with adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% and margins that continue to be industry leading. On an organic basis and excluding the Verisk Health pass-through revenue and expenses, the top line grew 9.4%. On that basis, adjusted EBITDA grew 16%. We're pleased with these results, with good contributions from our existing and our acquired businesses. During the quarter, we completed the $2.8 billion acquisition of Wood Mackenzie. As we've told you since announcing the transaction, WoodMac is very much Verisk-like, a subscription business built on proprietary data assets and benefiting from network effects and scale economies. For the full second quarter and on a comparable accounting basis to last year, WoodMac grew revenue over 10%, measured in pounds. To fund the acquisition of WoodMac, we issued $1.25 billion of bonds and drew $1 billion of borrowings, under our new $1.75 billion revolver. We also issued a 10.6 million shares of stock for $722 million. Our use of a prudent mix of debt and equity allows us to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings, while taking on an appropriate level of financial leverage. We remain committed to our long-standing approach to capital allocation which is for a mix of acquisitions and share repurchases. With regard to capital allocation for buybacks, we completed the $500 million accelerated share repurchase in June. While in the course of delevering toward our long-term target of 2.5 times, we expect to reengage our share repurchase program. Our existing authorization at the end of the quarter was about $190 million. We're even more excited about the opportunities, now that the WoodMac team is part of the Verisk family. Given the depth, expertise and professionalism of the team, I am particularly pleased by the high levels of employee retention and enthusiasm following the close. Year to date, the retention of our subscription-based customers was almost 99% which demonstrates the value of the WoodMac solutions. Our comprehensive integration efforts are tracking well, including looking for opportunities to cross-sell Heritage solutions into the WoodMac client base. One of our first initiatives was to move Verisk Maplecroft under WoodMac leadership. This effort has clear goals to enhance the existing suite of risk management and supply chain solutions for all clients and to help businesses in the natural resource sector better navigate their above ground risks. We intend to be the leading provider of risk analytics to the world's largest companies. By combining WoodMac and Verisk Maplecroft, we offer clients a formidable scope of resources which now cover the entire range of above and below ground risks. As we think about the medium-term revenue growth opportunity, you will see us investing now. While WoodMac's private equity owners invested in the business, allowing WoodMac to grow revenue, we have made a very conscious decision to accelerate some incremental investments, to allow WoodMac to go even faster, with a view towards driving medium-term growth. In addition, we're taking advantage of the end market downturn, to hire exceptional talent from the industry. We feel very good about the outlook for WoodMac and its ability to be a meaningful contributor to Verisk's financial profile, for many years to come. We have spent time over the past few months visiting offices around the world and meeting with some of the WoodMac customers and are very encouraged by our now global organization. We're optimistic about the expansion opportunities for our other businesses. For example, we launched Touchstone 3.0 recently which is part of our already global Catastrophe Modeling business. We continue to see good adoption for the platform which is meeting our customers directly where their needs are. We had record attendance at our London risk symposium in June, as we continue to look to add value for our insurance customers outside the United States. We continue to feel confident in our long-term opportunities to grow shareholder value through a combination of innovation-driven organic growth and prudent deployment of capital, including our strategy driven M&A. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark, to cover some of the financial results in more detail.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. In the second quarter, we again delivered both revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, while also investing for the future. Revenue grew 17.5%. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions and Verisk Health pass-throughs, revenue growth was 9.4%. The strong organic growth reflects the continuing demand for the high-value solutions we offer to our customers. We will be discussing adjusted EBITDA with you today which excludes an $85 million hedge gain and $27 million in nonrecurring transaction costs related to the WoodMac transaction. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 24.6% and 11.6% on an organic basis, excluding acquisitions and the Verisk Health pass-through revenue in the second quarter. We saw organic growth across all four categories, led by Financial Services and Healthcare. Decision Analytics insurance grew 8.1% in the quarter. The increase was driven by strong growth in Underwriting Solutions, loss quantification, claims, Catastrophe Modeling solutions, all contributed to the growth. We again saw good growth from Touchstone, Xactimate and 360Value. Financial Services revenue increased 20.8%, driven by continued strong demand for our solutions and services. We're continuing to make progress in the advertising effectiveness space, as well as expanding internationally. Consistent with the plan we put in place at the start of the year, we expect Argus to grow in the high teens for the full year 2015. We called out high project revenue the last quarter. And, we also [indiscernible] to add to our full-year expectations. The underlying growth rate of the core business continues to track in the high teens. And for the next couple years, there may be some variability from quarter to quarter, as large pilot projects start up and wind down in the advertising affective space. While it's still early, we do have a line of sight into our incremental projects in the ad affective space, that we hope become recurring, as we move into 2016. Also, we continue to be pleased by the global advancements for the business. Healthcare revenue grew 19.6%, excluding about $2.1 million of pass-through revenue, in the second quarter of 2015. We saw growth across all solution groups, led by revenue and Quality Solutions. The results in the quarter were, again, ahead of our expectations, as the transactional nature of much of the business continues to provide lesser visibility than our other businesses. With the Medicare Advantage season underway, our execution remains solid. And, we see EBITDA growing faster than revenue for the year, as expected. The Medicare Advantage space remains dynamic, as customers manage their strategies in real time, with respect to the populations they analyze. We remain a leader in the space and we'll have a much clearer sense of what the 2015/2016 Medicare Advantage season will look like, when we speak with you following the third quarter. As we look out a bit further, we're excited about the opportunities we see to grow in the commercial risk adjustment space, including with exchanges which will provide some seasonal balance to our Medicare risk adjustment business. Energy and specialized revenue increased 6% on an organic basis. Including the recently acquired WoodMac and Maplecroft businesses, growth was almost 200%. WoodMac's revenue contribution beginning May 19 was about $40 million, reflecting a reduction due to purchase accounting rules for deferred revenue. Because there's no change in expenses, this will impact reported adjusted EBITDA equally. We reflected this in the accretion range we provided previously. WoodMac has continued to perform well, even in a challenging energy market. And on a comparable basis to the second quarter 2015, WoodMac grew 10% in pounds. We continue to expect full-year growth in pounds, excluding deferred revenue impact, to be in the high-single digits. Based on the current exchange rates, we expect WoodMac's reported revenue, under our ownership for 2015, to be at least $225 million. As a result of the purchase accounting related to reduction to revenue, margins will appear artificially low this year, at around 40%. When these transitional effects have worked their way through our P&L, we expect EBITDA margins, on a normalized basis, to be at least 45%. Maplecroft's $2.1 million of revenue in the quarter was in line with our expectations. We continue to see good growth in the quarter in environmental health and safety solutions and are seeing good traction from our commercial weather and climate analytics. Risk assessment revenue grew 6%, indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Industry standard insurance programs grew 6.2%, reflecting our 2015 invoices which were effective January 1. And, continued contributions from newer solutions, such as predictive models and electronic rating content. Our property specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 5.7% in the quarter. This increase was driven by new subscriptions. Adjusted EBITDA which excludes nonrecurring gains and expenses from WoodMac transaction, increased 22.3% to about $238 million. Total adjusted EBITDA margin was 47.7%. The 32.1% increase in Decision Analytics adjusted EBITDA, to $136 million, was a result of growth in the business and improved operations, including in Verisk Health. In addition, we saw the benefit from lower pass-through expenses which will continue through the year. Risk assessment adjusted EBITDA increased 11.3%, to about $102 million, as a result of revenue growth and good expense management, including lower people-related costs following the fourth quarter talent realignment. We continue to expect to hire additional people, as part of the realignment initiative. Reported interest expense was $37.7 million in the quarter. Excluding the nonrecurring WoodMac transaction related costs, interest expense was $24.3 million. Total debt, both short term and long term, was about $3.3 billion at June 30, 2015. Our leverage at the end of the second quarter was about 3.3 times. We're committed to bringing leverage down to about 2.5 times, by the end of 2016. Our reported effective tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter. Excluding the nonrecurring WoodMac related costs, the effective tax rate was about 31.1%. This rate reflects the benefits of our tax planning efforts and lower foreign tax rates. Adjusted net income, excluding the nonrecurring WoodMac related costs, increased 32.8% to $129 million in the quarter. The nonrecurring items in the quarter which were excluded from adjusted net income, totaled $55.9 million. The December 2014 accelerated share repurchase was completed in June 2015. As a result, an additional 800,000 shares were delivered to the company. The $500 million ASR resulted in the repurchase of 7.2 million shares, at an average price of $69.62, during the period. The average diluted share count was 167.6 million shares in the quarter. On June 30, 2015 our diluted share count was 171.4 million shares. Adjusted EPS, excluding the nonrecurring WoodMac related costs, on a fully diluted basis, was $0.77 for the quarter, an increase of 35.1%. Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, increased 40% to $295 million, for the six months period ended June 30, 2015, including the contribution from WoodMac. This represented 65.1% of EBITDA. Capital expenditures decreased 20.7%, to $60.1 million for the six months period ended June 30, 2015. And, we're at 6.3% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx of about $170 million, including WoodMac. As of June 30, our cash and cash equivalents were $145 million. As you think about your models for the full year, including WoodMac purchase accounting from the time we closed, but excluding the second quarter of nonrecurring items, we anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $145 million. And, we'll provide an update when the purchase accounting is finalized. Fixed asset depreciation amortization, about $125 million. Diluted weighted average share count of $169 million. Based upon the current debt balances, the full year interest expense will be about $110 million. This amount excludes the second quarter bridge fees and the May coal fees we paid, to eliminate the private bonds. For the intangible amortization add back in the adjusted net income calculation, we're using a 26% tax rate, to reflect the U.S./foreign mix of intangible amortization, post WoodMac acquisition. Finally, for the second half of 2015, we currently expect the tax rate to be around 36%. Overall, we're pleased to report that our business is performing well. We're seeing growth from multiple verticals and we're executing on our operational plans. And, our integration of WoodMac is progressing well. With that, I'll turn the call back to Eva for comments before Q&A.
Eva Huston: Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, including two who have just initiated in the quarter, we ask that you limit your questions to one and a follow-up. This will give more people an opportunity to ask their questions. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the lines.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.
David Togut: Could you give us some perspective on the positive operating leverage we saw in the quarter? It looked like tremendous operating expense control. Is this something that represents an inflection point for Verisk? If we put WoodMac aside, Verisk ex-WoodMac, do you think that your past the big investment cycle that you've been in, in the last two to three years?
Scott Stephenson: We have talked about the margins being strong and we would expect that to continue. So, now let me add maybe a little bit of color. And, maybe more directly respond to some of your questions. First of all, as you think about why those margins are higher, a couple things. One, the business has natural operating leverage we've highlighted in the past. I think you're seeing that. Our level of investment continues. I don't think it's accelerating, inside the business. But, we continue to have a lot of opportunities to invest, but the leverage is outpacing. Verisk Health passthroughs, that is just a mathematical thing. But, clearly, that helps the overall margin picture. And, if you look back on 2014, we did incur some FTC related costs in 2014, that aren't there in 2015. Only thing I'll caveat, as you look forward, we did have the talent and realignment in the fourth quarter of 2014, related to the risk assessment group. We do intend to hire back a lot of those people. So, you'll start to see that in the second half and into 2016.
David Togut: Just a quick follow-up question on the healthcare business which was up nicely, 20% in the quarter. You called out RQI, but any specific call outs on payment accuracy or enterprise analytics in the quarter?
Scott Stephenson: Well, we're very pleased with broad-based growth across all four pillars, inside of our business. So, we're not really distinguishing among them. But, we definitely look to all of them for growth and they're all growing.
Operator: And your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & company.
Tim McHugh: Just on healthcare, I think last quarter you had had a comment, that you expected growth to slow in the second half of the year. I didn't notice that comment this quarter. Is that still the case or has your view changed?
Scott Stephenson: No. Same view as last quarter, no change.
Tim McHugh: Okay. And I guess, can you talk a little bit at a high level, to the extent what your view at this point is, on M&A activity amongst your client base? Both in the reinsurance market and the health plan market. How do you think about that impacting you? And, how do you think about the opportunities and challenges that that will bring about?
Scott Stephenson: When we go through our planning cycle each year and I'll start with insurance for example, we actually build into our assumptions a degree of industry consolidation. We just expect it, actually. And, it's just a very routine part of our planning. And, we're not trying to specify any two organizations will come together. But more, just anticipating that there will be a degree of it. So, what's happening in the insurance space is, moment in time, nothing other than what we would have expected. And at the moment, whatever small effects are being felt, are being felt, probably differentially, on the reinsurance side actually. But moment in time, the next time that, unfortunately, the world experiences a major natural catastrophe, that will all turnaround very, very quickly. And, new capital will come into the market. And so, it moves a little bit. But, nothing out of the ordinary, nothing unanticipated. On the healthcare side, we'll see what the effect is, of some of these organizations coming together. Their own operating plans, I don't think, are clear at this time. Maybe starting to take shape, but it will be a little while before they work through, et cetera. But, the two things that give us confidence; number one is where Verisk Health sits in this universe, as a very, very important partner to the leaders in the space. And the other comment I would make is, as we just look at the demography of the emerging world, some of our most important customers and closest relationships seem to be the ones that are doing well, as the industry structure changes. So, that's an encouraging point for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeff Meuler: You gave a metric ton WoodMac client retention. I just wasn't quite sure exactly what it was. I think you said 99%, but was that at a customer count level? And, was that during Q2 or since you've owned that? What exactly metric did you disclose?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So Jeff, it was 99%. It was year-to-date. It was on subscription-based revenue. So what we're doing is, we're looking at customers that have had subscription contracts and asking the question, as we've moved forward in time, how many of those did we retain? And, that was the 99%. We also gave you the 10% organic growth number, also. And I think everybody knows, that this is a business which is substantially subscription revenue. So you can derive from that, that the revenues associated with subscriptions have also done very well in that time period.
Jeff Meuler: And then, given that WoodMac offers a range of subscription products, can you help sign up for us how big that cross-sell opportunity is? In the past, you've given some metrics around Decision Analytics insurance. If you got full penetration of existing products, could you give us something similar for WoodMac?
Scott Stephenson: I don't think we put that number out, Jeff. But I'll put -- let me give you a different way of holding that. Which is, if you look at WoodMac's historic performance with respect to organic growth which we think is the normalized expectation for this business over long periods of time. There has been a very healthy mix of signing up new customers, cross-selling existing solutions into the existing customer base and introducing new solutions. It's been a very healthy mix of those three.
Operator: Your next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik: My first question's also on WoodMac, just to confirm. Mark, did you say that the full-year revenue contribution from WoodMac was going to be 225 million pounds and that the WoodMac --
Mark Anquillare: That's dollars. $225 million, for the period that we would own it, through the end of the year.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. And then for the - Got it. And, you said the margin's at 40%, that was WoodMac specific, right?
Mark Anquillare: That is correct. And by the way, as we did the math there that you just described, it's at the current exchange rates. The other thing we highlighted, just processed with purchase accounting, there was some revenue that won't be recognized, deferred revenue won't be recognized. So, that artificially lowered the margins to 40%, for this period in 2015.
Manav Patnaik: And, will that lapse first quarter next year or is this just this year?
Mark Anquillare: It mostly lapses. The biggest reductions occur at the beginning of the period. So, it gets generally better over time and I think it does end sometime in the middle of next year, But, the dollars are much less significant then.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Last thing, on Argus. You guys said high teens. Given the first half performance, that does imply a material slowdown in the second half. Is that something -- is that just conservatism? Is there something to it?
Scott Stephenson: Well, I want to go back to the nature of Argus. So, it also is substantially a subscription-oriented business. There are really three revenue streams associated with Argus. The subscription based, the services that we provide to individual customers and now we have this third dimension which is related to ad effectiveness. And, I think what Mark was referencing in his comments earlier is that, that third piece is so exciting, precisely because some of the customers that are coming newly to this capability, are very large entities. And so, as they get interested in the capability, even on a trial basis, the amount of work that they look to do with us and the amount of analytic they look to consume, is very, very large. And so, as this method becomes established, what we're going to see is, at moments in time, large entities diving in. And, in a very deep way. That's what happened with the project-based revenue that we reported and that I think you're referencing here, Manav, in the first quarter of 2015. And by the way, some of that same project revenue was actually there at the end of 2014, as well. So, it wasn't literally just only the first quarter of 2015. We also had it in 2014. But, you get these little novas and then it becomes more standard operating procedure. You're going to see that from us for the next couple of years. So, the expectation that you should have is that the underlying business, the subscription oriented business, is going to be a very strongly organically performing kind of a business. And that we will have at moments in time, almost on a quarter by quarter basis, you're going to see some of this project revenue, that's the effect that you're seeing in 2015. But, the basic business is not only as healthy, it's actually healthier than it's ever been.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line James Friedman with Susquehanna.
James Friedman: I'll ask my two up front. Mark, also on WoodMac. Mark, you had mentioned in your commentary that some of the deferred revenue gets written down. Maybe that's the wrong language, but if you could dimensionalize how much is that? And then Scott, with regard to health exchanges, I think you had mentioned in your prepared remarks or maybe Mark said this. That you had an opportunity in commercial, on the health side and potentially with exchanges. If you could elaborate with that as well? Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: I'll take the second one, first. Because, I think there's actually more depth in Mark's response. So yes, the exchanges are, I would call it an emerging part of the healthcare landscape. To us, it's another channel. It's another customer segment, basically. And, the same kind of risk-adjusting analytics are needed there, as are needed everywhere else. We're excited about it. It's going to grow. It's not nearly as big as, say, Medicare risk adjusting today. But, we're providing leadership there, as we're in these other segments. And the other thing I'll just underline here which I believe was a part of what Mark said, was that the timing with which commercial risk adjusting revenues will show up on our P&L, will actually be a little asynchronous with the Medicare risk adjusting. Which, all else equal, is actually kind of good. And it helps us to manage our operations a little bit more smoothly. So, we're excited about that part of the business. So then, Mark. Back over to you for the WoodMac revenue.
Mark Anquillare: Sure. We had some deferred revenue on the books. So, as a result, you can't recognize 100% of that. In the quarter, that was a couple million dollars. And basically the way that works is, you'll have a normalized or full quarter, for third and fourth. But it will, then, start to move down and get lower, through probably about the third quarter of next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.
Toni Kaplan: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the investments that you're making in WoodMac and what the magnitude is, like going from a 47% margin to a 40%? How much of that is the investments, versus how much is the deferred accounting piece? And also, just confirm that the investments that you're making is part of the 40%?
Scott Stephenson: So, let me let Mark begin by picking apart the revenue effect. And then, I'll come back and talk categorically about some of the investing that we're doing.
Mark Anquillare: I just provided you with the top line effects of things, so think of it this way. You don't recognize as much revenue, the same expenses exist, so as a result, it has a little bit of erosion to the margin itself. What we said is 40% for the year and we would get back to normalized 45% in the future. In addition, I think there's some investment which we're very excited about making, that maybe Scott, do you want to give some color on?
Scott Stephenson: Just a couple places. In a business like hours, it's always actually people. And so, some of the topics that we're on with WoodMac would include -- It's actually a very nice opportunity in the oil and gas space, to try to help players in that space observe, what we call, supply chain effects. And that is something which is, I'd say relatively nascent. And so, we're actually building the team, the resources that are able to go after that. We're continuing to try to enhance the platform by which the content is put out there. There is so much content that is available, from WoodMac, that crosses the desk of a user's work, on a daily basis. o, finding ways to make it granular and accessible is an important thing. That will also actually expand the available market. And the third is, we actually think that WoodMac solutions are undersold. And so, the go-to-market capability is being expanded.
Toni Kaplan: Okay. Great. My follow-up question. The $225 million for WoodMac, for this year, in your results, in terms of revenue. Does that include any of the cross-selling that you're expecting? And also, when would you expect to start to see some, either cross-selling or synergies? And, would you expect it to be either more gradual or a step up? Thanks.
Mark Anquillare: So the answer to your question is, the $225 million is the, I'll call it the WoodMac set of solutions. It does not include any of the cross-sell of other solutions, that we think will be attractive to that market.
Scott Stephenson: The latter part, we'll talk about it as it emerges. We're putting great emphasis on it. We've actually taken two relatively Senior Executives and put them in charge of, essentially, achieving this cross-sell that we're talking about. We're taking it very seriously.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington: First is, I just have to mention that on the Nielsen call yesterday, they specifically pointed to marketing effectiveness being up about 22%. So, kudos to Argus there. But, that doesn't count as a question. So, hold on here. On the purchase accounting, my first question, looks like, if you ballpark it with the pro forma, looks like that was up about, adjusting for currency, about maybe 6% or 7%. And then, if you throw in the other couple million dollars for the deferred revenue adjustment, maybe that's another 400, 500 basis points. So, WoodMac was growing at maybe 10% to 11% in the quarter? And, I wanted to first ask if that math was right. And if so, it looks like an acceleration from last year. And, maybe talk a little bit about what's driving that acceleration versus last year?
Scott Stephenson: Your math is correct. WoodMac content is must-have for their customers. It's absolutely indispensable. And, when the end market gets perturbed the way that it has, there are puts and takes. And everybody likes to talk about the takes, I suppose which is CapEx temporarily moving down. But, the put is that people need to understand this dynamic marketplace even more than before. And as a result, there have been some of the customer segments, some geographies in the world which have actually grown quite strongly. But overall, it's more of the same story. Which is, basically, when you have must-have information, it's going to find it's market. And, that's what WoodMac is doing right now.
Bill Warmington: And for my follow-up question, to ask if you could update us on the pipeline for aerial imagery, new products and enhancements. I know there has been talk about Xactware's aerial sketch coming out. And, I wanted to see how that was going.
Scott Stephenson: So we really, genuinely, believe that we have the industry standard method for the interpretation of aerial imagery. Think of it as the algorithms, think of it as the method. And in fact, we're talking about it with our customers quite a bit. And there's a lot of excitement. So, the only thing that we haven't commented on yet and we're not going to comment on today. But we will comment on, in the relatively near future, is our strategy for sourcing imagery. And, I'll just remind everybody that it does include aerial imagery which makes use of the visible spectrum. But that's not all. Our imagery strategy also embraces satellite-based, drone-based. Basically, anywhere that you can develop data about some condition, on the surface of the planet. So, you'll be hearing a lot more about that from us. But, we continue to lean into that heavily. We continue to talk to our customers about it a lot.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman: I wanted to revisit these long-term margin framework of 45% to 47%. And, given the year-to-date results being above the high end, should we consider the high end 47% to be a cap for this year? Or, is 45% to 47% not meant to be a cap, in a specific year?
Scott Stephenson: Andrew, I think what we've tried to outline is a profile of our company over the longer-term. Yes, we've talked about that 45% to 47%. I think we're feeling good about where the margins are today. We feel that the leverage will continue, so I do not see it as a cap. I see it as a long-term direction. Obviously we're trending towards very upper end of that. And, we consider investment for the future, whether it's around aerial imagery or around acquisitions that just don't have the same margins profile that we have. So, I would not think of it as a cap. It's kind of a longer-term type of set of numbers.
Andrew Steinerman: Is there anything in the second half of the year, of stepped up investments, that might keep us within that 47%? Or, does the second half investment plans look similar to the first half for this year?
Scott Stephenson: I think the only thing that we tried to highlight is that, risk assessment has done a talent realignment. We're probably a little light on resources there and we're staffing up. That will affect us a bit in 2015, the second half. And, probably more into 2016, but that's the one noteworthy item.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey: I wonder if you could dig in just a little bit more on the WoodMac investments in new products? Scott, could you talk a little bit specifically, from a functional perspective, as to where you see the most opportunities for growth? My sense is that WoodMac is maybe a little more capital markets intensive than its largest competitor? And I wonder if broadening out the offering is part of the initiative? And it seems like, despite that spend, it's not going to have an adverse effect on consolidated profitability. So, I wonder if you could frame up those two.
Scott Stephenson: You're on the right trail, there. So, first of all, one of the strengths of WoodMac is that the customer base is very broad and very diversified. And, it includes integrated global oil companies, national oil companies, the Financial Services sector as you point out, pure play E&P companies, just anybody who's basically interested in the hydrocarbon. And, that's a real strength. That is a genuine strength of the company. So, part of the opportunity here is to find ways to take this extremely rich content and make it just as consumable as possible, for each different use case. And in fact, I would describe the company as being fairly early in its journey, in that respect. So, that's one dimension. Another dimension is, remember how this business got started. It was some very talented Scotsman observing on North Sea oil, as a part of helping investors to get a perspective on all of that. And I mentioned that simply to say that, that point of initiation relates to what you could consider to be WoodMac's very greatest strength at this time which is upstream. And I would say, particularly, rest of world. So, some of what we can do to try to create additional growth opportunities, is to make sure that the depth of the content is equally differentiated, everywhere around the globe. And another thing is that, we have opportunities to complement the upstream focus with some other data analytics that the industry needs. Some of them relate to the supply chain, so you're moving from upstream to downstream, as I mentioned before. Some of them relate to issues, maybe, more of operational excellence, than they do to issues of asset valuation and asset disposal. And, some of them would relate to more directly technical dimensions of what's going on in the oil and gas industry. So, a whole variety of ways that the business can grow. It's exactly the same play-book, in terms of what the nature of the business is and how it operates. But, yes. A broad customer base with an expanding set of functional solutions for them.
Andrew Jeffrey: Okay. And shifting gears to insurance, to make sure that business doesn't get short shrift. There's been some discussion around, I think in the investment community, the risk of a softer underwriting premium market. I know we've been, Verisk has been through a cycle like that before, as a public company. Could you refresh us as to the risk of a softer market? How you address a softer market? How, maybe, your approach to your customers might change, et cetera?
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Our approach to our customers will change not one iota, as we move through the cycle. We're so deeply engaged with our customers that, even before cycles get observed externally, we're very aware of what's going on in their businesses. But what goes on in their business, first of all, is that the strong signal inside of the insurance industry is that, everybody knows that there needs to be an intense intensified use of data analytics to drive decisioning. And in parallel with that, a drive towards more automation. So, it's actually precise analytics in a speedy way. And, that's exactly what we're working on with our customers. As the industry cycles around, actually, when there's softness on the underwriting side, the pressure on our customers to have good underwriting performance, only increases. And so, making use of our solutions, arguably, is even a better idea when the cycle is turning down. So, our approach remains absolutely invariant. And in fact, if anybody has the impression that our pricing, for example, is tied to industry premium volumes, that's just a misunderstanding. We're in control of our pricing. And we price to value. And our customers understand that.
Operator: Your next question is from Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery.
Joseph Foresi: This year, we saw healthcare get off to a really good start. And, obviously, it's still performing pretty well. I was wondering, I've typically thought of that business as being backend loaded. Because, it went into Medicare. Evaluations took place. The Medicare Advantage evaluations took place. Has the seasonality in that business changed at all? And, how do we think about that seasonality going forward?
Scott Stephenson: No. The seasonality has not changed. Medicare Advantage is still, substantially, a third and fourth quarter event. But, what Mark referenced and I'll just highlight it again is, as we begin to complement what we're doing on that side, with more commercial risk adjusting, the seasonality of commercial risk adjusting is asynchronous with what goes on in Medicare risk adjusting. So, the pattern may modify a little bit as the exchanges grow and as commercial risk adjusting increases. But no, that's an accurate perspective on our business, as it is today. More back half than front half.
Joseph Foresi: And on WoodMac, obviously, the oil prices have rebounded. But, it seems like the business may be insulated from any changes in oil prices. Can you talk about why you think that there's a moat between the end market and what the revenue growth was this quarter and going forward? Maybe you could spell that out for us, that would be great.
Scott Stephenson: If you're interested in the hydrocarbon ecosystem and you are considering the possibility of investment. Either as the principal who's investing, the principal who's dis-investing or the agent who is advising on the investment or the dis-investment. You have simply got to have Wood Mackenzie content in order to make your decision. Because, this being a global commodity, you have to understand with high precision, what the global supply curve looks like, at any given moment in time. And that supply curve is very dynamic. Very dynamic. An existing asset will lose more than 5% of its productivity in a 12 month period, if it's not reinvested in order to maintain it. And so, staying on top of that, there's always new exploration. And then, there is the need to understand existing projects. How productive are they? And, how productive are they becoming? And so, you will feel uncomfortable knowing what to do from an asset investment or disposal point of view, if you don't have Wood Mackenzie content. It's that simple.
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.
Jeff Silber: Mark, I'm apologizing in advance for this. But, I just wanted to circle back to your comments about the 45% margins with Wood Mackenzie. Is that after you've made these investments that you've spoken about? And, how long do you think it will take you to get there?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So, I did say at least 45%, just to make sure I readdress that. I think we feel like these are the types of investments we can monetize relatively quickly. The way some of these businesses work, I'll use supply chain as an example. You have to do some services before you can actually productize. So with that model, you're hopefully bringing in some profitable business, some profitable growth off of those services. And then what happens is, we can productize the observations and start to build margin and leverage into it. Similarly, if you think about the platform, some of that is just customer satisfaction data visualization. But at the same time, a part of that strategy is to try to take and bundle a solutions in a way that we can attract, I'll call it a tail, to the customer set. Scott addressed it with some salespeople. But at the same time, we feel that there's 900 customers that are currently a part of what I'll refer to as WoodMac customers. But, there could be 5000, 6000 people who are interested in the material. And, we need to get to them. So, that's another way to monetize it. So our hope is, we talk about it medium term, but we're making thoughtful investment decisions that I think will pay off in 2016. And, you'll hopefully start to see some of that.
Jeff Silber: On the risk assessment side, you had mentioned some of the hiring that may be going on there, back half of this year and into next year. So, is it safe to assume that we would see some EBITDA margin compression, from the 59% level or so, that you've been reporting the past couple quarters?
Mark Anquillare: Yes, you should. That's just a reversion back to, not where we were, but we would still have leverage. I just want to highlight again, we have found ways to continue to do things more effectively and more efficiently. And what we're starting to see, on inside risk assessment, is opportunities to re-imagine our markets a bit. And, we're going to places that we think there's opportunities. So, we're going to put some talented resources in place, to try to grow the business in a couple other spaces. And, we're excited by the opportunity there. So, you should look to that. And, I think we would continue to see some of the growth in risk assessment continue, that is above historical norms.
Operator: Your next question is from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sara Gubins: Going back on WoodMac. So, I'm understanding that you've got a significant moat. When you talk about high-single digit growth for the rest of the year, it would suggest a bit of a slowdown from what you've seen most recently. And so, I'm wondering if you are seeing any short-term slowdown with clients? Or, if there's any variation within the client base around their behavior or perspective client behavior?
Scott Stephenson: No. It's really, very steady as she goes. WoodMac have really adopted a very customer-centric approach. Well, they've always been that way. But, in this current environment, I think they've shown special care and attention for the condition of individual customers. Have customized their go-to-market down to the individual account. Under the leadership of a very, very good go-to-market team. And, the engagement with the customers. I would say the only thing that's actually changing is the term of the agreements is actually stretching out. In other words, the duration of the agreements is actually lengthening in the current environment which is a positive.
Sara Gubins: Switching gears over to insurance in Decision Analytics. Catastrophe bonds were down pretty significantly in the second quarter. The comp was really difficult and it looks like June trends have already improved year over year. Could you talk about whether or not that had any impact in the insurance segment? Obviously, the growth there was very strong on a tough comp.
Scott Stephenson: Yes, it was there. The absolute amount of work we do around cap bonds, the absolute amount of revenue we drive there, is not particularly large as a percentage of the mix of what we do. But, yes, the effect was there. Happily, where all of us as citizens of the world is concerned, hurricane and earthquake activity has actually been relatively low over the last couple of years. That's good. Long-term, one can't really count on that. But, with an effect like that, the whole market orients to that at a moment in time. And, the next time we have a major event, you will see hardening, you will see capital come into the market. You will see investors trying to find lots of ways to respond to catastrophe risks. And by the way, I'll also say that, we remain extremely pleased with the share that we enjoy, inside of the analysis of cap bonds. We're the clear leader in that category, have been for a long time and still are.
Operator: Your next question is from Arash Soleimani with KBW.
Arash Soleimani: Just a couple questions here. First, I think you mentioned in the second half of the year you're expecting a 36% tax rate. So is that 36%, is it fair to think of that as the new normal, going forward more permanently?
Mark Anquillare: The simple answer is yes. We would say that's probably the new norm, as it relates to going forward. We could have a little bit more opportunity as we get into 2016, but we'll keep you advised. That's where we think will play out, around 36%.
Arash Soleimani: And the other question I had, I know you talked a bit before about the International opportunity you could have in insurance, because of the more global platform that WoodMac has, from a business development standpoint. How significant is that opportunity, on the insurance side, now that you do have that platform? And, what's a general time frame? Is that something within the next 24 months or more of a five-year strategy?
Scott Stephenson: This is a longer-term initiative on our part. At the end of the day, it will be very powerful. At the end of the day, something that will be very material inside of our insurance business, is the globalization of it. But, it will take time. Because, the way that you become global when you are a business like us and especially in our insurance vertical, is that you're actually multi-domestic. So, you have to be very chinese in China. And, you have to be very french in France. And, the platform will definitely help us. And at the same time, as you know, our business model is it's absolute peak best when we have proprietary data derived from our customers. And that just takes time. So, the theory of the case absolutely holds. And, this will be a powerful effect inside of our business, but over intermediate to longer periods of time.
Operator: Your next question is Anj Singh with Credit Suisse.
Anj Singh: I was wondering if you can talk more about advertising effectiveness? It seems you're quite optimistic that the currently transactional activity could turn in to more subscription oriented, as well as more one-time projects. And, I appreciate the earlier color. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about what's driving the confidence. Are you starting to see engagement from a larger number of clients? Is it the same customer at Q1 that's indicating more interest? Just trying to understand the dynamics there better. Thanks.
Scott Stephenson: The interest in this new category is fairly broad-based. I would say, probably the primary source of my own confidence is actually looking at the size and sophistication of companies that have awakened to this opportunity and are expressing deep and, I would say, enduring interests in these kinds of categories. And no it's not hardly, simply, the major project customer committing over the longer period of time. It's a very rich set of opportunities. And again, as much as anything for me, it's the scale and the sophistication of the companies that are interested in what it is that we can provide here.
Anj Singh: Okay. Got it. And a little bit of a departure from the earlier questions, but could you update us on some of your innovation initiatives? Particularly around telematics? You had mentioned this at your Analyst Day last year. We saw the press release on your recent alliance with IMS. Wondering if you could share some of the progress you've made there. And, give us a sense of the client activity as it stands today?
Mark Anquillare: Let me take that. This is Mark. I think we feel very optimistic about telematics. And clearly, the U.S. market's a little bit behind Europe. But, we're making progress in three areas. One, we have a couple of analytic models that seem to be truly predictive. So, one's focused on the geography and where you drive. And then, the other is on the behavior of the driver, both highly predictive. Two, we have been working with, obviously, our insurer customers, in a way to try to figure out a way to work with them as this third party data provider. Along with, providing those analytics. And there's certainly an openness to that, especially with and around, the PII or personally identifiable information, that's out there. There seems to be an interest in having someone else handle and provide that data stewardship. And thirdly, I think we have interest in working with OEMs that are a part of, inside of the car and automobile manufacturing world, that are harvesting some of that data. So, we hope to provide some better color and some better information about our direction there, in the very near term. But, I will highlight again, a very insightful question in a topic that we're focused on and optimistic about.
Operator: And next question comes from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.
Adrienne Colby: It's Adrienne Colby for Paul Ginocchio. I wanted to go back to the subject of M&A. I was wondering how the consolidation in managed care has had an effect on Verisk Health. And, if you could comment specifically on your revenue exposure to potential inquirers, versus those being acquired?
Scott Stephenson: I think we actually touched on this before. So, just to recap. First of all, there have been announcements. These large transactions have not been completed yet. I'll also just point out that, when you look at our performance over the last several years which has been very strong and the industry it's been consolidating for some time now. So, it's not as if this is any brand new phenomenon. I did comment earlier, also, that one of the encouraging things for us is that, as we look at the demography of the emerging world, we look at who it is that seems to be, in essence, coming out on top in all of this. We're encouraged to see that some of our deeper relationships, those are the companies that seem to be doing pretty well.
Operator: And our final question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin: Just one quick question. Was there any update as to how the efforts to increase the excitement about the ISO ClaimSearch DNA product you called out last quarter is trending? And, whether or not you expect that to be a more material contributor to growth in the near to intermediate term?
Mark Anquillare: Let me give you a little bit of color. We have and we're in the process of really redesigning and relaunching our ClaimSearch solution. Just to remind everybody, that is the industry standard around fighting fraud and abuse inside the P&C industry, with over a billion claims. So, that relaunch is being rolled out in a sequential way, with some of our largest customers. What we've seen is both the data visualization has been very well-received. The tool which, maybe in the past, was a little bit more of a reporting of instances, has a lot more predictive capabilities. Which, I think, are leading to, I'll call it this way, more use of and more value from the solution. Now, how do we monetize that? Remember, this is a well penetrated solution. What we have is a set of other analytics and information that is around that ClaimSearch product. And, we hope that continued and expanded use will lead to cross sell and upsell, into those other products. So, a little bit of a fortification. And hopefully, it will provide us for an opportunity for further growth, as we look into 2016, when we're fully launched.
Scott Stephenson: I just want to give a shout out to our colleagues who been working on that. They have really done great work.
Andre Benjamin: A little bit of a housekeeping question. As your partner on the ad effectiveness product talks a little bit more explicitly about the growth rates there, is there anything about the nature of the arrangement with them, that would mean that you're growth from that product is any different from what they're talking about?
Scott Stephenson: I would make a different point, Andre. Which is that, we do work in the space with our partner, but also on our own. And so, you can't just directly link the two in that way.
Operator: We have no further questions in queue at this time. And, I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Stephenson for any closing remarks.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, everybody, for your interest and for joining us today. And, we look forward to speaking with you, certainly, no later than when we report out Q3. So, thank you very much for your time today.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-04-29 08:30:00) =====
Executives: Eva Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer Scott Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director Mark Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Analysts: Tim McHugh - William Blair and Company Manav Patnaik - Barclays David Togut - Evercore ISI Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley James Friedman - Susquehanna Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Alex Kramm - UBS Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Anjaneya Singh - Credit Suisse
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics First Quarter 2015 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice-President and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva Huston: Thank you, Jake, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2015 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. All the numbers we discussed today, unless otherwise stated, will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx. Interthinx is shown in discontinued operations reflecting the sale of the business in March 2014. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday’s earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott Stephenson: Thanks, Eva, good morning, all. In the first quarter we again delivered excellent results with total and organic revenue growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 22%.Profitability was strong with EBITDA growth of 18% and margins that continue to be industry leading. We’re pleased with these results which we believe reflect the strength of our solutions and their value to our customers. During the quarter as you know we announced the $2.8 billion acquisition of Wood Mackenzie. We have received regulatory approval for the transaction and expect to close in the second quarter as we had previously stated after completing debt and equity offerings to fund the transaction. I had the chance recently to spend time with many of our new Wood Mac colleagues in a variety of offices around the globe, and I came away more impressed with the debt, expertise and professionalism of the team. And we could not be more excited to welcome the Wood Mac team into the Verisk family. Wood Mac is the global data analytics company with a culture very much like our own. We’re adding a truly Verisk like business, one which offers its customers industry standard solutions based on proprietary data. The solutions are primarily provided through recurring subscriptions which benefit from network effects and scale economies. Like Verisk, Wood Mac has demonstrated an ability to grow by adding value through all of its customer’s business cycles over a very long period of time. In the first quarter, Wood Mac grew revenue in the high single digits as measured in pounds. Because of our combined free cash flow generating capabilities and the strength of the Verisk balance sheet we will be able to acquire Wood Mac with the benefit of an appropriate level of financial leverage. Our use of a prudent mix of debt and equity allows us to maintain our investment grade credit rating. With regard to capital allocation for buybacks we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in December of 2014, as a result we had no incremental repurchases during the quarter. And once we are on track to meet our commitment to de-lever to 2.5 times gross debt to EBITDA we will manage our repurchase program as a part of our balanced use of capital. Our existing authorization at the end of the quarter was about $190 million. We continue to focus on innovation throughout our businesses as we believe this will enable us to deliver value to our customers and therefore strong financial results for the long term. A great example is our ongoing innovation effort that we announced recently with the launch of ISO ClaimSearch DNA. Some of you may have seen a demo at our Investor Day in March. With this new solution, PMC insurers can better visualize large networks of suspicious activity operating across the industry. DNA magnifies the power of ISO ClaimSearch which recently passed the $1 billion Claims mark to find patterns of potential fraud in increasingly large data sets and the detect entire networks of organized activity among individuals and businesses including related service providers. The patent tending technology provides a fully automated solutions proactive fraud network detection. The advanced analytics and predicted models work seamlessly to uncover hidden relationships across large data sets and to prioritize the networks of interest for each customer. ISO ClaimSearch DNA also provides insurers with alerts and actionable intelligence on their suspicious networks and claims for further investigation. Organized fraud often affects multiple carriers. So an industry wide perspective is essential to helping companies fight large scale fraud by giving them the whole picture. This is one of many and various innovative solutions that we continue to develop. We continue to feel confident in our long term opportunities to grow shareholder value through a combination of innovation driven organic growth and prudent deployment of the capital including through our strategy driven M&A. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Mark to cover the financial results in more detail.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. In the first quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in the future. Revenue grew 12.1%. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, revenue grew 11.5%. The strong organic growth reflects the health of our business and the value we deliver to our customers through our mission critical solutions. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 16.6% and 15.6% on an organic basis. We saw organic growth across all four categories led by financial services. Decision Analytics insurance grew 8.7% in the first quarter, the increase was driven by strong growth in underwriting solutions and good growth of catastrophe models, claims and loss quantification solutions. Touchstone continues to be a growth drive in the quarter and we were pleased with the contribution from [Indiscernible] as well. Financial services revenue from continuing operations increased 67.3% driven by strong overall performance bolstered by a significant onetime project around advertising effectiveness. This project yielded very nice profitable revenue in the quarter as well as intellectual property which we will leverage repeatedly as our advertising effect in this business grows. Excluding this project which had revenue around $11 million growth in the quarter was 15.1%. The advertising affect of this market is early in its development yet has significant long term potential. Healthcare revenue grew 17.5% as reported which increases in all solutions group led again by payment accuracy. The results in the quarter came in ahead of our expectations as the transaction nature of much of the business means we have lower visibility than in our other businesses, and we saw higher levels pass the revenue than anticipated. Our current forecast indicates growth will moderate as we move through the rest of the year. As you know our second half of the year is seasonally larger than the first half. We are expecting visibility in the Medicare Advantage business to increase as the year progresses. The changes in contract language we discussed with you last quarter took effect later in the year than we had anticipated. As we told you last quarter the Verisk health revenues for the first quarter 2014 would have been $58.4 million if reported on the basis of the new contract language. On that same basis, the first quarter of 2015 revenue would have been $68.4 million. Growth on a net basis was 17.2% just below the reported growth of the quarter. Specialized category revenue increased 16.5% in the first quarter and 4.3% on an organic basis. Maplecroft’s $2.6 million in revenue in the quarter was in line with our expectations. We continue to see growth in the quarter from environmental health and safety solutions and we’re seeing good traction from our commercial, weather and climate analytics. Risk Assessment of revenue grew 5.3% indicating the value to our long standing insurance customers. Industry standard insurance programs grew 5.5% reflecting our 2015 invoices which were effective January 1 and continued contribution from newer solutions. Our property specific rating underwriting information revenue grew 4.8% in the quarter; this increase was driven by higher transaction volumes from those customers who have not yet migrated through a subscription for a long term contract. We have focused on transitioning most of our customers to subscriptions over the past couple of years which provides us good visibility. Total EBITDA increased 18.3% to $216.3 million. The 28.9% increase in Decision Analytics EBITDA to $115.3 million was the result of growth in the business and improved operations particularly at Verisk Health. Decision Analytics EBITDA was also helped by some non-recurring project at Argus which was very profitable. And finally, Decision Analytics EBITDA includes about $4.4 million of fees related to the Wood Mac acquisition. Risk Assessment EBITDA increased 8.2% to $101 million as a result of revenue growth and good expense management including – people led across following the fourth quarter talent realignment. We do expect to tie additional people as part of the realignment initiatives. Interest expense was up $823,000 primarily due to increased debt related to the funding of the accelerated share repurchase program. Total debt of short term and long term was about $1.3 billion at March 31, 2015. Our reported effective tax rate was 38.1% for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net income increased 15.2% to $107.5 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully dilutive basis was $0.67 for the quarter an increase of 21.8%, the average diluted share count was 161.5 million in the quarter on March 31, 2015 our diluted share count was 161.7 million shares. Free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures increased 25.2% to $146.2 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2015. This represented 113.8% of EBITDA. As you know this quarter is a strong cash flow quarter for us given our January 1 cycle of invoices and industry standard programs. Capital expenditures decreased 31.5% to 24.8% in the quarter and were 5.4% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx of about $150 million up modestly from 2014. As of March 31, 2015 our cash and cash equivalents were $152.8 million. As you think about your models for the full year all of the following observations are before adding Wood Mac. You will recall that second quarter is when we have our annual increases and they cause a typical step up salary expenses. As I mentioned previously the Argus project work was very profitable. In addition, we anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $53 million. Fixed asset depreciation, amortization of about $110 million and a tax rate around 38%. Higher expected deprecation, amortization is due to internally developed software leading to new solutions moving into services sooner which we view as a positive for our business. Because of the accelerated share repurchase our share count will be down year-over-year in 2015. Based upon our current debt balances and maturities full year interest expense will be about $66 million. After Wood Mac transaction closes we will provide additional details to help you update your models with more granularity. Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing well. We are seeing growth across multiple verticals and we are executing on our operational plans. With that, I’ll turn it back to Eva for a comment before the Q&A.
Eva Huston: Thanks Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow up. This will give more people an opportunity to ask their questions. Also, given that the Wood Mac acquisition has not yet closed we will appreciate you focussing your questions on the Verisk quarter and business. And with that, I’ll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Tim McHugh from William Blair and Company. Your line is now open.
William Blair: Okay, thank you. Just want to add on Argus the media effectiveness can you elaborate I guess in more detail what it was and I guess on the financial impact I guess how profitable is it and then I guess also elaborate on the future and I guess you talked about retaining the intellectual property you know maybe you can repeat the works in the future.
Mark Anquillare: Yes thank you Tim, let me take that. This is Mark. The Argus business is very subscription oriented, because of the nature of advertising effect in this there is some project work either direct with customers or with partners. This is an opportunity to really build out a very interesting capability that we will be able to leverage and use it in the future. And I would tell you that I think we are optimistic that both that capability and database will be leveraged but I think it also kind of set the stage hopefully in the future for a longer term subscription along the same line. So, we are optimistic probably a little longer out. To answer your question, some of the work or a lot of the work that was performed in support of that project did take place or a part of it took place in 2014. So as you think about the first quarter in 2015 that was higher than our traditional margin it was a strong margin business as it affected the first quarter 2015.
Scott Stephenson: And Scott here, I’ll just add that one of the things that’s going on is the functionality that Argus represents any add effectiveness world is one that various players are becoming more familiar with more comfortable with and I think that probably from time to time there will be projects like this just because they kind of get started, they figure out what it’s really about and then hopefully and often usually it matures into a longer term kind of a relationship.
William Blair: Okay, thanks. And then I guess on healthcare you made the comment that you expected to moderate I guess across the year, is it just tougher comparison is that something that you see I guess in the pipeline or something that’s falling off that I guess it makes gives you that expectation?
Mark Anquillare: Yes sure Tim, let me take that. Obviously we were very pleased with the quarter at Verisk Health. As you kind of move forward, yes second half of the year is where a lot of the Medicare Advantage work comes in. We don’t have quite the visibility on that as we said in the past it’s a little more transactional in nature and we are just trying to make sure that we are going to appreciate that first quarter was a good one but we do see that there will be probably a little bit of ramp-down as we progress through the year as a relation to the comps and the lack of visibility into the perspective revenue streams.
William Blair: But is there – I guess would you be willing to frame it all I guess in the level of moderation than you expect?
Mark Anquillare: Tim, I think we tried to stay away from any specific guidance on this topic and you know as I said I think we feel good about the healthcare business. We like the fact that its growth is across all the segments but I think we’ll stay away from any specific growth rate at this point.
William Blair: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is open
Manav Patnaik: Thank you, good morning everybody and congratulations on another impressive quarter. I just wanted to follow up on that add effect discretion; I mean clearly you guys have been talking about this for a couple of quarters. And I think I understand what the opportunity there is. I was hoping you could help us frame what the addressable market is from your piece of the pie, your share of what that market potentially is just to understand you know how we could frame the potential size of this business for you down the road?
Scott Stephenson: Manav, Scott here. Just a couple of things, one is, I would say that while interest in advertising effectiveness has effectively existed as long as advertising has existed. In reality we now have data sets and methods which allow us to look at the relationship between the signals which are put out and the response which is given to those signals. And our August team is very well equipped to work in this field both because of the content that we’ve got but also the methods. And our general excellence actually add to large scale in analytics. So this is a category, down the way we are doing it that is relatively new. And so that to me is the primary framing thought here is that its’ early days. The other thing that I would say is that the kind of work that we are doing applies to both traditional and new media. And we’re working to bring the capability into all of those different domains. And so, when you’re talking about the new media space for example, you tend to find some relatively large players. And it’s very much a part of our plan and our goal to be working with a good number of them. So, that’s not giving you sort of a total TAM for the opportunity, partly again because we’re in early days. But we see this is as a very major opportunity.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Fair enough and just on the follow-up, on the Verisk Health side, you know, you mentioned that you saw some notable operational improvement on the healthcare side. I know you haven’t given us absolute margins before. But can you maybe just help us understand the magnitude of that improvement, and if that is something we should see a sustainable going forward?
Scott Stephenson: We certainly expect that operational effectiveness will continue to grow at Verisk Health. It was a point of primary focus by our Verisk Health colleagues in 2014. It was reflected in what I would call material improvements in some of the core metrics that relate to for example, the RQI side of the business, and the team remains focused on taking it to an even higher level. So, you’ve heard us say that we have felt and continue to feel that there is an opportunity, and that we will margin improvement in Verisk Health. And we stand by that.
Manav Patnaik: Okay. Thanks a lot for the time, guys.
Scott Stephenson: You bet.
Mark Anquillare: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Togut: Thank you. Good morning Scott and Mark.
Scott Stephenson: Good morning.
Mark Anquillare: Good morning.
David Togut: We saw very strong margin expansion in the quarter, EBITDA margins up 250 basis points year-over-year. Historically, Scott you’ve said that you’re very long term focus in your investment program and you perhaps you could frame this for us recognizing that you did call out some one time high margin revenue in the quarter. Is this potentially the beginning of a trend where we start to see positive operating leverage going forward?
Scott Stephenson: Yes.
David Togut: Can you elaborate?
Scott Stephenson: Well, we start with as I think everybody with us today knows. We start with a very highly efficient organization already. And we pay a lot of attention to that, benefited of course by the fact that we run our business in a way where fundamentally our model has scale and leverage built into it. So the starting point for the performance of our business with respect profitability is the nature of the business that we have and that we choose to build. But having said that, I don’t think that there is anything in consistent with our long-term focus and our focus on organic revenue growth as being a particular measure, our vitality as an organization and booking for ways to operate our business with even more efficiency. So we don’t feel as if we’re engaging in any sort of a trade off between the near term and the long-term even as we give a great deal of attention to the efficiency of our operations. Mark, I don’t if you want to add anything to that.
Mark Anquillare: No. I agree. I just will kind of call out a few things that we try to talk about as we discuss here this morning, Argus, clearly that revenue was very highly profitable. Two, we talked about the [Indiscernible] Verisk Health for the most part that as it move gross to net that will actually help margins just mathematically. Offsetting that I want to highlight that there is an element of talent realignment in our industry standard programs and we will be hiring back. There we will also see some salary increases across the universe and the enterprise, so those are couple of things we need to consider in the second quarter and beyond. Finally, we did have about $4.4 million of fees related to Wood Mac that we called out here in the first quarter. Obviously there will be some more in second quarter.
Operator: And your next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Toni Kaplan: Hi, thanks. So, I’m looking at the Decision Analytics, insurance line, the growth rate tends to jump around there. So, I was wondering if there was anything that basically anything that depressed the growth rate in this quarter and how we should think about the full year for that one.
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. I mean, I would not point at any macro factors which would really have explanatory power there. Couple of things that are always just kind of there in the background but they kind of wash in one direction and they will wash in another direction. One would be just levels of claims activity which tends to related to both our loss quantification activities as well as our – it create a climate which is supportive for catastrophe modeling in the general sense. And then, there can be from time-to-time consolidation particularly not really among the primary insurers but more with respect to some of the brokers and some of the maybe the second tier reinsurers. And so from time to time there’s a little bit of that. And so you have those kinds of factors that are kind of in there. But substantially what we do is actually subscription base and long term in nature and that continues to be the case.
Toni Kaplan: Okay, great. And then just on the international expansion opportunity in financial services, just wanted to ask how you see that in terms of timing, I guess this is into Wood Mac question, but given that Wood Mac is global, does that accelerate your sort of process of expanding internationally and financial services and what steps you need to take in terms of adapting to new geographies in that product line.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. So, we do believe actually that we are in the process of re-platforming Verisk globally in a way that will be supportive of. We hope and expect many, many parts of our business, but specifically to Argus, the way you should think of that is it’s a little bit of a step function and what I mean by that is that lying at the center of the Argus business just as with many other parts of Verisk. You’ve got these very rich datasets which are contributory from the same companies that service our primary customers. And so there is kind of a critical math sort of a quality in any given market where once you get, once we get enough of the leaders saying that they want to come in to the consortium model it tends to then cause much of the rest of the market to come along. And so, you sort of have these step function changes in state where you sort of aren’t at critical math until you are. And once you are critical math it all begins to change a little bit. And so, even recently and confirming with our Argus colleagues we heard some exciting news about specific markets. But you should just understand it as there will be movements and time in which any given market, any particular market sort of becomes a part of the Argus model. And that is the way we build a market at a time.
Toni Kaplan: Thanks a lot. Congrats on the quarter.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
James Friedman: Hi. Thanks. Just ask my two upfront. One housekeeping, one Mark, the CapEx decline significantly year-over-year and I know you’ve made some comments about the Q2 CapEx expectation if you could comment why that might happened in the first quarter. And then secondly, with regard to ISO, could you help quantify what some of the cost rationalizations might have been in the quarter that would be helpful? Thank you.
Mark Anquillare: Sure. Let me take the first from a CapEx perspective. We did do some moving of offices and we were moving also our data centers last year and first quarter, so we had some high CapEx in 1Q, 2014. And I think we also started or at least done from our [Indiscernible] inflows of a CapEx seems like there maybe a little bit of movement of CapEx to get some year-end deals from vendors pertain to 2014 which seem to keep the CapEx dollars really low relative to past history in first quarter of 2015. So, I would tell you that we kind keep – we kept our full year forecast generally unchanged. We just think it kind of moves into second and third quarter and I wouldn’t really point anything expect for timing with regard to the CapEx number. Second question I think was a little about the talent realignment inside of our industry standard programs. We’ve have great people and great talent inside the iPass team, the iPass team represents one of the units that industry standard program. And I think we wanted to recognize the efforts of those people over the years and we from most part offer the package so that we could get some new talent that is focused on new opportunities. This is an opportunity to become more efficient with our core business, be more effective with our core business. And at the same time kind of backfill position so that we can aim point to the future with new opportunities and expansion. And I think the hiring to backfill those position is a little bit delay. We want to get the right people and we wanted to get the right position filled as soon as possible but that’s causing it. I would tell you that we’re probably in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 positions, does that help, Jim.
James Friedman: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Steinerman: I want to review DA insurance, 9% looks very solid to me, but the question is around year-over-year comparisons in particular and when I look at 9% growth in the first quarter versus the 12% growth. The fourth quarter, I come away taking perhaps it has to do with the year-over-year comparisons being about 4.5% more difficult in the first quarter and what might be the implications going it into the second quarter here and there’s also a larger year-over-year comparison for DA insurance?
Mark Anquillare: So, let me try to answer your question maybe more qualitatively and then I can maybe address that. So, couple of things always happen, one there is some project oriented revenue as it relates to the catastrophe modeling, the timing of cat bonds and things like that that we called out before, that cause I think a little bit of a comp relative to first quarter 2014 but not material, I don’t think there’s was anything noteworthy there. The other thing some times relates to the timing of new customers, so its sometimes a bit of grow over as an example inside of the loss quantification I know that we had a reasonably large customer that came on in first quarter 2014, obviously that customer was customer 2014 also in 2015. So, I think as we think forward from an insurance perspective. I think second quarter you’re probably right, a little bit tougher comp, but we have a consistency. We have a subscription and I think we feel that we’re going to be in good shape probably a little bit more of a second half story from an DA insurance perspective.
Andrew Steinerman: Great. And 9% for DA insurance feels like a pretty normal growth rate for you, right?
Scott Stephenson: I think the business is substantially, well, entirely the same business that it was, the only thing I would add is as this year progresses I think we’re going to have some very exciting things to be able to talk about in terms of the expansion of some of thing for doing specifically on the DA side of insurance, and we look forward to being able to talk about those. These are innovations and partnerships and customer relationships. So it actually feels very good. The nature of those businesses is that they are very, very embedded with their customers and behind that we have a series of innovations that I think are really quite exciting.
Andrew Steinerman: Sounds good, Scott. Thank you.
Scott Stephenson: You bet.
Operator: And your next question comes from Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.
Joseph Foresi: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you feel would be the trajectory or seasonality in healthcare. I know that’s usually backend loaded, I know you have some different comps. So not really guidance but the way that it worked in the past has been more backend loaded, so I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color on sort of how this year looks, and if that’s change versus other years?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. I will tell you that we’ll probably see about the same split or the same balance between first half and second half. Second half is typically a 60% relative, first half being a 40% type of total. The swing or the nature of that disparity is really in the Medicare Advantage business. It’s more transactional and because Medicare and what we refer to those Medicare suites typically runs from July through the beginning of – end of January that’s what causes that. Now when those transaction volumes happens whether its third quarter or fourth quarter it lies in the first, it’s a little tough to be very specific about that.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. And then just on the pricing in the insurance DA or other insurance business can you talk about your relative pricing power versus this year versus all the years and if there’s been any change there.
Scott Stephenson: No change.
Joseph Foresi: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Bill Warmington: Good morning everyone.
Mark Anquillare: Good morning.
Bill Warmington: So, one question for you on the margin and very strong performance this quarter, if you add back to Wood Mac closing cost, it would put you about 48.1%. And I know that when you started out few years ago with the 43% to 45% long-term target and then after the Sale of Interthinx, that went up to 45% to 47% range. And then given that strong performance in this quarter adjusted through Wood Mac and in fact that the gross to net in the healthcare isn’t yet in the numbers, should we be thinking about that upper end of that range moving up going forward?
Scott Stephenson: Again, we feel –we were very committed to running the business with efficiency and we feel that we are steadily finding those efficiencies and we do a fire to run a business which is as profitable as it can be and at the same time is growing strongly especially organically over long periods of time and we’re still on that March. And we don’t – we don’t feel that we have exhausted all of the opportunities to operate efficiently. At the same time there is always the counter balancing points that we’re introducing new innovations, even yesterday we were sitting down and looking at an investment that we’re going to initiate this year to pursue one of those exciting opportunities that I was just talking about as it relates to DA. So there’s always a balance there. But just as was the case, when we started out in the 43% to 45% range that didn’t mean that we relax our interest in becoming more efficient and profitable and we’re still on exactly at that same mode.
Bill Warmington: Okay. And then my second question on the discrete network analysis module, just wanted to ask if you could frame what you thought that opportunity was and what kind of a contributor that was likely to be either to – and how we should think about the time frame there, 2015, 2016?
Scott Stephenson: Well, yes, the work is ongoing and I say by the way that is another good example of the Verisk way of doing innovation because one of our confidence points on this work is that its been done with close collaboration and consultation with customers, which is a very, very important part of our process. I think what remains to be seen is how much the effect of claim CNA is reinforcing the overall ClaimSearch franchise versus how much it will generate incremental especially identifiable incremental revenue streams. But when I think about value to the customer, the opportunity to be able to essentially interrogate the data and there’s much more big data kind of way, I think the value will be significant, how we chose to commercialize and monetize that, that’s -- think that’s a little down the road, yeah.
Bill Warmington: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: And your next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open.
Alex Kramm: Hi, good morning. Just, sorry to come back to the margin, but doing some of the math here myself, if I just look at Decision Analytics, and I assume that this project in Argus was about 80% margin and maybe that being conservative and I just for the one-timer and pass through, I get to about 41%. So first of all is that in the ballpark and if I compare this to a year ago, I think that’s about 350 basis points margin expansion. So, maybe you can just break this down where you think that margin expansion came from in terms of efficiencies and on the healthcare side and maybe scale you gaining and other things you want to point out?
Andrew Steinerman: Yes. Thank you. Let me try to help you out that. I understand your math and I think it’s reasonable with regard to the project revenue. I think we try to call out that the nature of our business is across the board have natural scale to it and the incremental margins are extremely high, its how much investment we put in. We continue to have a consistent level there. Verisk Health, I think was one of the nice positives inside the quarter. We would expect that to continue, obviously as revenue typically is a little lighter in second quarter relative to the other quarters that may work against us in the quarter, but Verisk Health is the biggest contributor to that, that good news. And I think we would as Scott suggested I think we would expect that to continue.
Alex Kramm: Okay. Helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just on the imagery side. I think you talked post-EVP that’s an area that you still want to get better, there’s some investments. So, A, is that meaningfully depressing margins right now. Are you still doing a lot of investments there and any update on where you at in terms of competing with that business and getting bigger piece of the pie?
Scott Stephenson: So, my earlier reference to some exciting developments in 2015, this category will definitely be one of them. The way that you need to understand this category is that they’re really actually two things you have to do in order to be able to create commercial solutions for a customer. One is you have to have methods by which you can in a highly automated way take an image and turn it into data. And the second thing is you need images which are sufficient to what it is that you’re trying to do. Our methods are world class and you heard our or you saw our announcement about AMS Geomatics that’s all part of that. And we really have a team and a set of capabilities we put up against anybody. What we haven’t working on is how we are going to infuse those methods with a very comprehensive set of images. And we are laying some extremely exciting plans in place right now not able to talk about them just yet, but we will come back on those, not really influencing margins very much at the movement and we actually think the approach that were coming up with here it probably will – there will be maybe a minor effect but we’re going to manage this is a way that we believe there’s a good chance, but as revenues mounts they’ll be matching and exceeding ultimately the expenses, but that will be a little bit of build through time. But they were very, very focused on those categories.
Andrew Steinerman: All right, great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Andre Benjamin: Thank you. Good morning.
Scott Stephenson: Good morning.
Andre Benjamin: Question on the healthcare business, I was wondering if you can maybe give a little color on the drivers of the growth particular how much is from new clients versus your existing clients just running more volume through the business and/or how much of it is from those same clients maybe buying more products from within the suites you offer?
Scott Stephenson: You always going to find those three things in the mix, Andre and I would say that something that is always very important to us and something that is always very encouraging to us is when we find existing customers moving into new parts of our suites. And we definitely all of those are represented in the mix including first quarter 2015.
Andre Benjamin: And I guess in conversation with the same customer I was wondering are there any notable thoughts or feedback that you’ve gotten with respect to how they’re thinking about the changes in Medicare reimbursement rules and the management of your products?
Mark Anquillare: Well you know that’s always going to be a part of their thinking and they and we both pay close attention to what CMS is doing. I would say that I think what is really leading the thought process for our customers in this category it’s probably less what’s going on in the regulatory environment and it’s more about their own thoughts on how to maximize their own performance basically. And so, it’s literally then trying to do their good work and manage their businesses to highest level of performance and I think that’s the greater factor in how they are choosing to manage the way that they engage with CMS and therefore that part of our business which is about that, which is over in RQI it’s more their own thoughts about that own businesses that’s really what is the leading factor.
Andre Benjamin: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Anjaneya Singh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Anjaneya Singh: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. First off on just the advertising effectiveness project revenue you discussed you know the opportunity around this quite a bit in the past and on this call. I’m wondering as we look forward if the project revenues are is what should be you know expected in these types of solutions or if subscription based engagements might also be possible at this early juncture?
Scott Stephenson: Subscription based engagements are definitely possible and are occurring even at this time. And really what we were trying to indicate with our comments was simply that it may well be the case that from time to time as the category emerges there will be individual larger players who get interested and there is sort of at a moment in time there is a high degree of engagement as they assess the methods and figure out exactly you know what they can do and what they will mean for them, which we hope and expect will sort of mature into ongoing subscription like relationships.
Anjaneya Singh: Okay that’s helpful. And a question for Mark, you talked about the risk assessment talent realignment savings being invested back into the business and I appreciate the comments on the 30 or 40 positions you need to sell. Wondering if you can discuss what your expected timeline is to fully work through those hiring plans just trying to get a sense of when RA margins may work back down to a more normalized level?
Mark Anquillare: Sure, I mean I’ll give you my best timeline. I mean, our goal continue to be find the right people because we want to move and kind of create some exciting opportunities in markets, the new product ideas. But if you think about Verisk as a whole, it’s about people and intellectual capital is so important, so we just need to right people. I think we would have hoped to have many of those position filled in the first quarter and if I said second quarter I know things will roll into the third, but I think we are actively kind of fill those positions with the right people and are looking to do so as quickly as possible.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's SVP and Treasurer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer: Thank you, Shannon, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. All numbers we discussed today, unless otherwise stated, will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx. Interthinx is shown in discontinued operations reflecting the sale of the business in March 2014. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K, which we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, until March 26, 2015, on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Eva, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the results we reported last night with outstanding revenue growth and strong operating discipline. In the fourth quarter, we delivered excellent results with total revenue growth of about 12% and an increase in diluted adjusted EPS of about 18%. Full year revenue and diluted adjusted EPS both grew about 9%. Excluding the costs associated with the FTC review of the EVT acquisition and the fourth quarter risk assessment reorganization costs that Mark will discuss in more detail, our diluted adjusted EPS growth in the quarter was 22%. Our consolidated organic revenue growth for the full year was 9.4%, Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin of 46.2% in the quarter and 46% for the full year. Adjusting for FTC-related costs and Decision Analytics and the reorganization and risk assessment, full year EBITDA margins were 46.6%. This is consistent with our expectations and previous comments that we would maintain margins at about the same level as 2013, while also investing in our business. As you know, in December, we concluded our efforts to acquire EVT following the vote by the FTC to challenge the transaction. We worked hard to come to a mutually agreeable solution with the FTC, but no agreement could be reached that was in the best interest of our shareholders. While we were disappointed in the FTC's decision, we are committed to remote sensing and imagery analytics and intend to be the leader in these areas. For competitive reasons, we'll be measured today in our comments regarding our go-forward strategy. The solutions we have and will create over time will be based on a multi-tier, multi-spectral set of images. We are doing this today with satellites in our Verisk Climate division and with non-satellite images at Xactware. In fact, Xactware recently announced that Property InSight is now available for all residential, commercial and agricultural structures in the United States. The Property InSight data bundle includes 3D property models, roof exterior and property measurements and property risk factors, among other critical data points, for professionals who work with properties. We also announced the launch of the Xactware Remote Sensing Lab, a collaborative industry group dedicated to developing remote sensing technologies specific to the property industry. The Lab is a natural extension of Verisk's long history of partnering with customers on new technology and applications. Participants in the Lab include experts in remote-sensing, computer vision, geospatial intelligence and analysis, computer science, engineering and geology. We expect to pursue our strategy through balanced investments, synchronized with revenue growth, and will remain within our typical margin expectations. As we had accumulated cash in anticipation of EVT transaction, we determined that a return of capital to our shareholders in the form of a $500 million accelerated share repurchase was appropriate. This was in addition to the $90 million in the fourth quarter and $275 million for the full year we spent repurchasing shares in the open market. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was $190 million. We continue to feel confident in our long-term opportunities to grow shareholder value, and the accelerated share repurchase is evidence of that confidence. In addition to returning capital to our shareholders, we remain active in looking at M&A opportunities. We continue to focus on assets with a strong strategic fit, and as we've been discussing with you, we are interested in using acquisitions to support our international expansion efforts. We remain interested in both our existing verticals as well as potentially other global verticals that can leverage our existing intellectual property. In the fourth quarter, we made two small acquisitions, both of which expanded our global footprint. One, DART, is in financial services and is now part of Argus. The other, Maplecroft, is in the area of country and political risk and an important complement to our existing supply chain initiatives. DART is a leading provider of benchmarking and advisory solutions to financial services institutions in Australia, New Zealand and other Asia-Pacific markets. Argus and DART will serve financial institutions in lending and payment product optimization. Maplecroft, which is based in the U.K., uses a proprietary data aggregation and analytical approach enabling its customers to assess, monitor and forecast a growing range of worldwide risks, including geopolitical and societal risks, many down to the local site level. Maplecroft's unique solutions are used by multinational companies, financial institutions, governments and NGOs. Maplecroft's research data and platforms complement our world-class capability in natural catastrophe and extreme weather impact assessment in order to form a comprehensive set of analytic solutions. The combination will enable organizations to make informed risk-adjusted decisions for their assets, operations and supply chains. With the addition of Maplecroft, we are establishing ourselves as a leading provider of value chain optimization tools, providing comprehensive quantitative risk analytics and platforms by which our customers can visualize, quantify, mitigate and manage their risks. We have rebranded the company Verisk Maplecroft to reflect our growing international strategy. You'll have a chance to see Maplecroft's solutions at our Investor Day next week on March 5 in New York City. As we look back over the past two years, we've been able to deliver very good results in the context of a temporary step-up in our investments and a sizable expansion of our healthcare business. Both our organic revenue growth and our operating profitability continue to be sector leading, and we remain committed to a prudent mix of M&A and share repurchases over time to complement and enhance our core businesses. This combination positions us very well to deliver the kinds of shareholder returns over the next several years that we expect of ourselves and that you expect of us. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover the financials in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Scott. For the fourth quarter, we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, while also investing in the future. Revenue grew 11.6% for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 and 9.5% for the fiscal year 2014. Excluding the effect of recent acquisitions, revenue grew 11.4% for the fourth quarter and 9.4% for the fiscal year 2014. The strong organic growth reflects the health of our business and the value we deliver to our customers. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 15.2% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 15% on an organic basis. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in financial services, healthcare and insurance. For the full year, Decision Analytics revenue grew 12.1% as reported and organically. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 12.3% for the fourth quarter of 2014. Underwriting solutions led the growth, followed by catastrophe modeling and loss quantification solutions. Insurance fraud claims solutions also contributed to the growth. Overall, growth was driven by the increased adoption of existing and new solutions and annual increases in invoices. Touchstone, our next-generation catastrophe modeling platform, continued to drive growth, as did our GIS risk platform and property replacement cost underwriting solutions. In the Financial Services category, revenue grew 25.2% in the fourth quarter 2014. The revenue increase was driven by demand of our analytic solutions and services. As you know, we sometimes see project revenue in the fourth quarter from our clients as they look to fully utilize their budgets, and again saw that in 2014. For the full year, Financial Services revenue grew 19.3%. In the healthcare vertical, revenue in the fourth quarter grew 21.8%, all organic, with growth across all divisions led by Payment Accuracy Solutions. For the fiscal year 2014, revenue from healthcare grew 16.2% at the higher end of the direction we gave you for mid-teens growth. This is a strong outcome in the area of our business that is more transactional than the rest of Verisk. As we look ahead to 2015, we want you to understand a change in one part of the revenue in the Medicare Advantage area of our RQI business at Verisk Health. We recently adjusted some of our contract language at Verisk Health to accommodate health plans that want to include prospective health assessment costs in their medical loss ratios. We prefer changing the contract language instead of becoming a licensed medical provider. There is no impact to our bottom line as we've always netted out these revenues and expenses. The only result is a change in less pass-through revenue in 2015 than in prior years. Overall, we expect to see good growth for the full year versus comparable 2014 revenue number of $279.5 million. Similar to 2014, revenue growth will be somewhat weighted to the latter part of the year, and while we don't breakout profitability of Verisk Health, we expect EBIT to grow faster than revenue in 2015 as we continue with our program of operational improvements. In specialized markets category, revenue declined 0.5% in the fourth quarter 2014 and 0.8% for the full year. Good growth in Weather and Climate Analytics and Environmental Health and Safety Solution was more than offset by lower activity related to government customers. Verisk Climate continues to provide important analytic content for our insurance customers and our supply chain related initiatives. The specialized category will return to growth in 2015 both as reported and organically. Turning to Risk Assessment, for the fourth quarter, we reported revenue growth of 5.5% indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment was due, in part, to 5.1% revenue growth of our industry-standard insurance programs resulting primarily from growth in 2014 invoices effective January 1. Property-specific rating and underwriting revenue increased 6.8% in the fourth quarter. Growth was a result of new sales with higher committed volumes. For the full year, Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.2% driven by 5.1% of growth in industry-standard programs and 5.7% of specific rating underwriting category. For the fourth quarter 2014, EBITDA grew 13.4% to $214.6 million with an EBITDA margin of 46.2%. For the fiscal year 2014, EBITDA grew 7.8% to $803 million with an EBITDA margin of 46%. Excluding professional fees related to the FTC of $6.9 million for the full year 2014, including $1.7 million in the fourth quarter as well as risk assessment reorganization costs of $4.8 million in the fourth quarter 2014, EBITDA margin was 46.6% for the fiscal year 2014. The fourth quarter 2014 EBITDA margin for Decision Analytics increased 41.1% from 38.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The fiscal year 2014 EBITDA margin in Decision Analytics was 39.6% versus 40.7% in the fiscal year 2013. Excluding the FTC-related costs, full year Decision Analytics EBITDA margin was 40.2%. Over the past year, we've been working to position our core insurance business for sustained growth and innovation into the future. In the fourth quarter, we offered voluntary resignation packages to a group of our long-tenured employees to honor their solid contributions to the business. The risk assessment reorganization was a talent realignment rather than simply a cost reduction exercise. We intend to reinvest the savings from those taking these packages back into our core business in the areas like product strategy, advanced analytics, technology platform and customer engagements, which are crucial for sustained innovation. The fourth quarter 2014 EBITDA margin Risk Assessment decreased 55.4% from 57% in fourth quarter of 2013. Reported fiscal year 2014 EBITDA margin for Risk Assessment was 56.7% versus 56.1% in the fiscal year 2013. Excluding the reorganization costs, EBITDA margin Risk Assessment was 58.3% and 57.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and fiscal year of 2014 respectively, an increase versus the comparable periods in 2013. Our interest expense was down nominally in the first quarter versus the respective period in 2013. This decrease was due to repayment of private placement debt of $180 million during 2013. Our reported effective tax rate was $37.8 million for the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, the effective tax rate was 37.2%. Net income increased 15% in the fourth quarter of 2014 driven by growth in the business, and net income grew 8.3% for the fiscal year of 2014. Adjusted net income increased 13.5% for the fourth quarter of 2014 and increased 6.4% for the fiscal year 2014. Diluted adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.65 and $2.40 for the full year reflecting growth of 18.2% and 8.6% respectively. The average diluted share count was 167.1 million shares in the quarter. On December 31, 2014, we had 161.1 million diluted shares outstanding reflecting the execution of the accelerated share repurchase. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the company executed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase. Under the ASR program, we received an aggregate initial delivery of approximately 6.4 million shares, which represented an estimated 80% of the ASR at the then current prices. The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR were based on a discount from the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock over the course of the program, which will be run up to six months or conclude earlier at the broker's option. At final settlement, we expect to receive additional shares of our stock. In the fourth quarter, we also repurchased an additional 1.5 million shares for $90.5 million prior to the announcement of the ASR. For those shares purchased in the quarter, the average price we paid was $62.54. At December 31, 2014, the company had about $190 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of about 20%. Turning to the balance sheet, as of December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $39.4 million. Total debt, both short-term and long-term, totaled $1.4 billion including about $160 million of revolver borrowings. Today, our incremental debt capacity is about $1 billion and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Our total debt to EBITDA at December 31 was 1.8 times, below our steady state target. In 2014, free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, adjusted for the sale of our Mortgage Services business grew 3.4% compared with the prior period to $329.5 million and represented 41% of EBITDA conversion in 12 months of 2014. Growth in free cash flows was driven by improved profitability of the business and stable CapEx partially offset by shifts in the timing of tax benefits in 2013, previously discussed, as well as other timing items. Capital expenditures were $146.8 million in the 12 months ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $0.8 million over the same period in 2013. Capital expenditures were 8.4% of revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. As you think about your models for the full year 2015, let me give you what our quarterly Verisk Health revenues for 2014 would have been if reported on the basis of the new contract language. First quarter, $58.4 million. Second quarter, $56 million. Third quarter, $81.1 million. Fourth quarter, $84 million. That's $279.5 million for the full year. Turning to our full company P&L, we anticipate the amortization of intangibles of about $53 million, fixed assets depreciation and amortization of about $100 million, and the tax rate around 38%. Because of the ASR, our share count will be down year-over-year in 2015. But we will continue to evaluate additional repurchases in the context of our broader capital allocation program and market conditions. Based on the current debt balances and maturities, full year interest expense will be about $66 million with the first quarter interest expense around $18 million declining through the year. We expect CapEx of about $115 million up modestly from 2014. Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing very well. We are seeing growth from multiple verticals and we are executing on our operational plans. With that, let me turn it back over to you for comment before Q&A.
Eva F. Huston - Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer: Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up. This will give more people an opportunity to ask their questions. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair and Company. Your line is now open.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. I guess the first question just on the margins, and I guess as we think towards next year, if I adjust for the new revenue presentation for healthcare I guess, my quick math, which could be wrong, tells me that's about a 90 basis point boost to the margin just because that's pass-through revenue. And then there's another 60 basis points from stripping out the professional fees in restructuring. So between those two that puts you above the 45% to 47% range, I guess. You've talked about being within. Is that still the range, then, that we should we think about next year, or are there factors offsetting it that the underlying margins would be coming down?
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Tim, thanks for the question. I think your math is good. To the extent you think about the FTC costs, which we do agree are onetime, and the nature of the change in accounting, the 90 bps is about right in both cases. I'll continue to just to highlight that we have a high degree of good feelings about the business into 2015, especially around margin performance. We think that we have scale in all of those businesses. What we continue to, obviously, balance is the investment in the business to make sure that we grow into the future. So our view is, we're feeling very positive about where margins should be anticipated in 2015, moderated by what I would say is some overlap in investment. The other thing I'll highlight to the team, I think we tried to bring it out inside of the conversation, the script is that the iPass reorganization, albeit a $4.8 million number, is probably something that will come back into the P&L in 2015. We are looking to redeploy those resources.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. And the healthcare comment was – I guess, I wasn't clear what you, from a revenue growth perspective on, I guess, the new revenue presentation. Are you still looking for double-digit growth or mid-teens growth like you were talking about last year in that business or, I guess, on an underlying basis, how are you thinking about the outlook there?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We feel good about the business. The growth in 2014 was broadly based across many different solution sets. We expect the growth in 2015 to be broadly based across several solution sets. One of the metrics that, among several, but one that some folks follow is the rate of growth in the Medicare Advantage population. It's been the case, and we expect it will continue to be the case, that in that segment of what we do, we would grow faster than the underlying market, which is actually true of a lot of what Verisk does across our many solution sets. So we feel very good about our growth into 2015.
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And we would take that growth and grow it off of the $279.5 million that we were describing throughout the day.
Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays. Your line is now open.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, guys. So just to follow up on the healthcare, like thinking longer term, one of your competitors obviously just went public and they've thrown out long-term targets of 20%-plus with some mid-30%s margins and so forth. I was just curious if you guys could provide us any color. I know anecdotally you guys are very positive on the space, but just trying to get a sense of how we should think about this over the next, call it, five years.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, our mix is by degrees different from theirs. And so we're certainly interested in an (24:14) company with whom we compete in some categories. But our reference point is really us and the solutions that we've got and the customers that we're serving. And this is one of the places inside of Verisk where, as we've said in the past, we've actually got secular tailwinds in the form of just kind of the underlying demand in the market, and it causes us to feel good about where we sit. We have strengthened the business operationally and expect to continue to do that. So it's a positive outlook for us inside of the healthcare space.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on your M&A pipeline, so for a couple of years, I guess, we've heard you talk about a very active M&A pipeline and maybe the last year, the pending EVT deals that have held you guys back. But what's the roadblock or what's the delay in terms of executing some of these deals that you have in your pipeline?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, maybe other than sort of the obvious one about the FTC process last year. I wouldn't call it a road block, but I would describe us as a very thoughtful acquirer. There are any number of transactions that we could have closed over the course of the last 12 months to 18 months, some of which you actually would have heard about if you observed the space around us where, just based upon our sense of valuation versus the sellers' ambitions, we were definitely positioned to buy businesses, but for valuation considerations chose not to. So we don't actually feel constrained and are leaning very heavily into the M&A agenda.
Manav Shiv Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Congrats on the quarter.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery. Your line is now open.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Hi. I was wondering, could we dig a little deeper as to why the change in the accounting methodology and what opportunities it either opens or changes from a demand perspective in the healthcare business?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So just to go back to fundamentally why we're making this change, our customers in the context of the Accountable (sic) [Affordable] Care Act, are being measured and managed on their medical loss ratios. And they need to make sure that they don't fall below levels that the government has identified as the benchmark. So what they're interested to do is to have as many costs reflected in the expense line, which is the numerator of the calculation. One of those expenses that our customers would like to have in that numerator is the cost of prospective health assessments, and that's the product line that Mark was describing. In order for us to provide the service and book the gross revenue, we would have to have – we would have to be treated as if we were a provider. We would have to have a provider ID. We're not interested in being that. We're not interested in having the liability associated with being a provider. So all we've done is we've said that the pass-through revenue associated with that service, we're just not going to book as revenue anymore. Otherwise, we're still providing the service just as much as we did before. We're simply changing the way that we account for it, and that is the only change. And it really has zero interaction with our business going forward.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Got it. That's very helpful. And then on the insurance business, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing from an underlining demand trends. I know that there's been no correlation between premium movements. But how do you feel about that, and how long does it take, you think, to create that imagery business as opposed to the acquisition? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Okay. So let me – two very different questions, both good questions. So the insurance market has its ebbs and its flows. We're in a place right now where it certainly is not growing at high rates. It cycles around a little bit, but as we've often described, our opportunity is really based on the amount of value that we can create for our customers, the amount of innovation we can put into existing and new solutions. And so our situation is very similar to what it has always been, which is we love the insurance market and our customers. It's a steady market, which is of course what we all look to insurance for, and our performance is going to be a function of the innovation and value that we can bring. On the Aerial Imagery front, I just really want to emphasize two things that I hope are clear, but just to make sure. The first one is we've got fully dimensioned analytics already; the analytics are already built. And the second is that we have a set of images that cover the entire country. So we're all dressed up and ready to go. The ongoing issue with respect to imagery is that we would like to see the quality of the images improved and, in fact, that was part of the thought process around EVT was that we would start with their library but improve it. We're now discussing multiple additional ways that we could go about doing that, and we will inform you when we have chosen which of those paths we're going to go down. But we feel very good about where we sit, and we feel very bullish about the business going forward.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Your line in now open.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So in healthcare, just conceptually, how should we think about the trajectory of healthcare growth rates in 2015 given seasonality but also given the fact that the comps are easier in the first half of the year?
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Toni, so I just want to try to catch the question. Very similar to what we've talked in the past, from a seasonal perspective, the suites (30:32) regarding Medicare Advantage and the work that we do with RQI is second-half weighted. So we have talked about 60% at the end of the second half, 40% in the first. And I think you'll see that same type of ramp as we progress through the year. If your question is a little broader kind of to the one we had earlier, I think I'll kind of reinforce Scott's position. I think we're feeling good about the business as a whole. I think we're feeling good about healthcare. And one of the things I think you probably noted in the way we described the growth, RQI, which is more transactional, has been strong but so is the payment accuracy side of the business which is a fundamental fraud fighting kind of expertise that we have and we felt good about that. Final element or final component from the healthcare perspective, population management is the rage right now. Everyone's trying to find ways to better consume healthcare and probably get better outcomes for less cost. And that trend, that interest, I think will continue to spur our Enterprise Analytics business. So across the board, I think we look forward to 2015.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Maybe just to amplify a little bit on that point. There are a couple of sort of emerging customer sets in the healthcare world. One would be the accountable care organizations and integrated delivery networks and their ilk and the other would be the exchanges both public and private. And we feel very good about the territory we've been able to claim in both of those categories, which is a source of encouragement for us on where we're headed.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, terrific. And then I've been reading a lot about the increasing popularity of cat bond lite transactions. Can you just talk about how you expect that that trend may impact your business if at all? Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I appreciate the qualifier on your question because it's just important to bear in mind that cat bonds are one of many ways that catastrophe risk gets managed and transferred. And in fact, it's one of the lesser ways, so it's identifiable because there are discreet transactions and we do very well on the category. In 2014, we had about 80% of all those transactions, but I just encourage you to keep it in context. Overall, it is a small part, a very small part, of the revenue associated with what we do in catastrophe modeling. So that said, cat bonds lite, you're still going to need a calculation agent that's going to stand as a third party to render a dispassionate and technically deep view of what's going on. And so if that was to expand that market overall a little bit, that would be great. We expect to still be highly competitive with respect to what's going on there.
Toni M. Kaplan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Terrific. Great quarter. Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. I want to talk a little bit about the Risk Assessment business, which accelerated in the fourth quarter. I remember third quarter commentary about some shift in annualizing or annualize contracts with reinsurance customers. It seems like somehow we've overcome that. So could you talk about how we accelerated in the fourth quarter, and given that 2015 invoices are out now, will the fourth quarter trajectory foray continue into 2015?
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Andrew. Let me take that. This is Mark. First of all, I think we had a strong year from Risk Assessment. I think we have fundamentals in the businesses are as strong as ever and the position we have is strong as ever. A couple things to highlight if I think about the fourth quarter. First of all, some of our content is actually licensed through vendors, and that revenue is strong. It's been a component of a license and there's some royalties. So we saw some pickup there, so that's good news and hopefully that will continue into 2015. And I think I've highlighted some other elements of Risk Assessment. We've talked about Risk Analyzer, which is our predicted modeling. We've moved from very much focused on personal auto but into homeowners as well as into the commercial line space and that has been up – the uptake there has been very strong and very good. We've had some good news around what is our electronic rating content. That's the way we take our loss cost and our rules and embed it deeply into our customers' workflows. And finally even Workers' Comp, which we haven't talked a lot about, had some good legs in the quarter and we think will continue. So those are the features of the fourth quarter, which I think will bode well into 2015. And I think to answer the second part of your question, at this point you referenced about invoices; you're right there out. And I think we've done what we've consistently tried to do. We've tried to deliver value to our customers, reflect that in the invoices. At this point in time, though, you have to remember that more than 50% of the way we're contracted with customers, it really is about longer-term contracts now that they're committed to, they're multiple year. So it's not as much annual recalculations. And I think we're going to see a consistent growth reflecting the value we provide.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll just add those multi-year contracts Mark was referencing, they always increase year – they always carry year-over-year price escalators.
Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Perfect. Thanks, guys.
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore. Your line is open.
David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. You saw a very nice acceleration in organic revenue growth in the quarter to 11% from what had really been trend line organic growth in the high single digits over the last couple years or so. So my question really is, are the drivers of the higher growth rate more specific to the fourth quarter, or are you generally seeing an improving demand trend that might support more of a low double-digit-type organic growth rate going forward?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, of course, what we do is extremely broadly based; we're in multiple verticals, et cetera. So I don't think there's one answer really to your question. I would say that the demand factors across the vertical markets that we serve are, at least, as strong as they have been. So if you think of that as foundational, I would say at least as strong as they have been in the recent and intermediate past. And as is always the case with our company, in 2014, including in the fourth quarter, we found ways based upon value to grow our business at a rate which was greater than that of our customers and the underlying markets and we believe that that dynamic will continue to apply in 2015. And we have definitely been doing a lot of investing into the business to try to create new solutions, to try to re-platform existing solutions. All of these things are pro-growth, and we are definitely focused on the organic growth of our business.
David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker): I appreciate that. Just as a quick follow-up, you saw a nice acceleration in growth in financial services in the quarter; I think Mark called out some project-specific work behind that. But are there other factors that might support a more sustained higher growth like what we saw in the fourth quarter?
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So thanks for the question. I think what we've seen inside of the financial services category is really the fundamentals of the business where we've been able to actually take that product and extend it internationally has helped. And that's progress, and I think that's something that we'll continue to see in 2015. The other thing that is a little bit more project work, I don't want to suggest that's a big, big number, but that is a typical kind of bit of a surge at year end where people and customers have some dollars to spend and they try to get their money's worth at year end. So I wouldn't necessarily annualize that base. But the underlying fundamentals internationally is very good. And the other thing that I will highlight is the world of marketing and advertising effectiveness, which is a way to go about helping advertisers understand how good and how effective their advertising is based upon the consumer and the spend is a very big category for us, and that continues to grow nicely and will have legs into 2015.
David Mark Togut - Evercore Partners, Inc. (Broker): Understood. Thanks so much.
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So earlier in the call, you had referenced growth in Medicare Advantage. I'm just trying to balance that with some forecasts that we've seen indicate that growth may inflect negative in the coming years. Just wondering how you think about the impact from that. Is there any risk to the healthcare category's growth, or is it safe to say that demand for the analytics within that space should easily offset that?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We don't see kind of what you're hypothesizing there. We don't actually see that. The long-term factor inside of Medicare Advantage is an aging population and a preference for the Medicare Advantage product. So I'm not quite sure whose projection you're referencing. First, the most recent look at growth in the enroll populations was actually very strong, high single-digits. So between that and our own work, to make what we do valuable for our customers, we feel good about the environment.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Yeah, it's the CMS Office of the Actuary that I believe has those forecasts a little bit further out showing that the growth there dips. But I guess moving onto my next question. I'm wondering if you can discuss the head count reductions in Decision Analytics during the fourth quarter. Can you tell us which category this was attributable to? Is there more room for efficiency there and, perhaps, how you think about your SG&A going forward in light of it being remarkably flat the past few years.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So first of all, just to make sure you're clear, the head count reduction was in Risk Assessment, not Decision Analytics. And basically it was, we took the opportunity on a, really, on a one-time basis to reset the talent inside of that business. As Mark said, we're trying to make the unit more analytic and more capable of the kind of high-value growth that we're looking for. So it really was a moment in time readjustment, and this is inside of what is really the oldest part of Verisk ISO. And so we just made our assessment. Clearly, what we did has made us stronger and will continue to make us stronger into the future. So we feel very, very good about it. The transition was quite smooth and in line with what we expected. So, Mark, do you want to talk about SG&A at all?
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure, and I believe your question there was on a broader context, the SG&A category throughout the corporation. I think we have a constant goal to try to be continuously improving those operations, and inside the SG&A category, I think we've been pretty successful there. Couple things that I'll highlight. We've done some data center consolidation. We continue to see benefits from that. I'm not sure that those benefits will increase as much into 2015. The other thing that helped us in 2014 was pension, and the pension assets performed extremely well. So there was good news in a reduction to the pension cost in 2014. As we roll into 2015, the mortality tables have changed, offsetting what was good news inside of the pension asset returns. So the pension will actually cost us more into 2015. I think those couple things are more or less offsetting. I would just see some gradual increase in SG&A maybe up a little from what you've seen in 2014.
Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman from SIG. Your line is open.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Great way to end the year, guys. I had a couple of questions, so I guess I'll ask them upfront. So, Mark, you had mentioned project-related work in financial service. I think we've become more accustomed to seeing that in insurance DA. Anything to call out there? And then the other one is, Scott, relative to DART and Maplecroft, as we're trying to figure out the contribution for 2015, I realize you gave an organic for the fourth quarter. Did those deals close early or late in the quarter so we can try and annualize those? Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Why don't you take the first question, Mark, and I'll take the second.
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So from a project-related work, the things that typically come to mind both in our cat modeling category and what we refer to as the loss quantification, which is Xactware, sometimes there's work that's done on behalf of a customer to more deeply integrate the models into their environments. Obviously, cat bonds is the other element. Although these are big, sometimes they do flux into fourth quarter. I don't think there was anything to call out in the fourth quarter inside the insurance category. It was probably a little bit more than other quarters, but nothing unusual.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And to your question, DART closed in November and Maplecroft closed in December.
James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning. Two questions, one on energy, one on healthcare. First on energy, I know you said you're going to be measured in your comments, but I know at that time you bought EagleView, you were pretty clear you thought they were a very strong competitor. Now they're going to remain a competitor. So I was just wondering how we should think about how you're thinking about competing, how aggressively you're willing to spend to become a leader, and whether we should characterize imagery as remaining at the top of your priority list that you're going to pursue aggressively or if that's kind of overstating its importance relative to the whole business?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Imagery is a high priority for us, and we believe that imagery will play a number of roles inside of Verisk. So the first order role is the existing product set, which is using images in the process of responding to property claims. The next most important use will be as it relates to a higher degree of automation in the underwriting process, where imagery will play a role in that. And beyond that, we think that the interpretation of images, whether they're taken from 50 miles above the Earth or a couple thousand feet above the Earth or a couple hundred feet above the Earth from a drone, all of those need to be brought together into a kind of one unified way of dealing with imagery so that you get to the best solution at the lowest cost. EagleView plays at one of those levels today, primarily. We intend to play at all of those levels. That is part of what we think is important here. And the other part is that just like with most of what we do, there's also a very important requirement to distinguish based on analytics and the workflow by which the analyzed output gets into the customers' own process. We intend to be doing all of those things in order to make it happen for our customers. And so we believe the category is important. We believe that we will bring a lot of strength to this, and as I said, the only part of it that might register as a question is where will the images come from? Again, just want to underline, we already have the images for the entire country and the objective for us is to get, yet, more precise images. And we feel very confident that we are able to do that and we are really sorting among the options for doing that right now.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And the second question was on RQI. I was just wondering if you could talk about your level of penetration of the client base and the updated thoughts on the size of the market. I know you've got an Analyst Day coming up, so you may be looking to save it for then. And specifically, I was interested in how many of the country's biggest clients that have the large data and analytics firms are currently clients?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So we feel very good about the customer list. We have many of the name brand commercial carriers among customers for what it is that we do. Our sense is that we are a share leader in the business. It's also clear to us, however, that we don't work with everyone and we don't have all of the available business from those with whom we do work.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, everyone.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning.
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Bill.
William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: So I've got a question for you about what impact, if any, you think the severe weather in the Northeast potentially has on some different parts of your business, it seems like, near term, potentially you have some benefit from Xactware and XactContents from a transaction piece there. But could it also be impacting cat modeling demand and possibly even premium growth for the coming years?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So I think you answered your own question. I mean...
William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Does that make sense though?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, definitely. Those are the places where our business actually responds to events. Now that said, in the course of the year, there are lots of natural events, natural – and I'm trying not to say catastrophe. There's a lot of claims that are not related to catastrophes, and so the overall claims volume is going to be a function of not just one event, but a whole lot of events, some larger, some smaller, some that relate more to flooding, some that relate more to atmospherically driven events. So I would encourage you not to get overly focused and think that there's some enormous surge based on any one event. But it is the case that when there are more property claims, there's more call upon the Xactware platform. We have, by the way, in that business, we've worked to have a balance between committed subscriptions and transaction-based revenues. And, in fact, the mix has shifted more towards the committed volume side so that dampens the effect somewhat. Definitely it's the case that everybody gets more sensitized to the need for good modeling when there are large-scale events that go on and, yeah, rates generally tend to harden when there's more claims. So I think you did identify the cause-and-effect levers that are in there. Again, I would just say any one event or any one moment in the course of the year, don't overweigh it too much because there are a lot of different ways that there is damage to property and claims are being filed.
William Arthur Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Welcome.
Operator: . Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Turner of SunTrust. Your line is now open.
Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome.
Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: I know you mentioned in the past that you continue to balance returns of capital versus M&A. Just wondering, can we expect returns of capital of a similar magnitude to the $500 million ASR in the future, or should this be viewed as a one-time in nature just given the EagleView?
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's one-time. I mean, we had earmarked capital for a $650 million acquisition, which we were in pursuit of for about a year. And we felt that when it was clear that for the reasons I stated earlier, we weren't going to do the transaction, that the responsible thing to do where our shareholder were concerned was to return the capital to them. It doesn't infringe our opportunity to do M&A in the future. But at the same time, we felt that it was a responsible move at a particular moment in time but definitely in response to the one-time event of the EVT transaction.
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I'll highlight...
Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay.
Mark V. Anquillare - Group Executive, Risk Assessment, Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: I think we've always said we have a preferenced investor in our business and we always balance between acquisitions and then share repurchases, and this was just the right time given market conditions.
Oscar Turner - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: As there are no further questions on the phone lines at this time, I would now turn the call back to Mr. Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank You. We appreciate everybody joining us here for our Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. I appreciate your interest. And we look forward to seeing many of you at Investor Day next week, and of course we'll speak to you next quarter. Thanks for your time today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva F. Huston: Thank you, Kim, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark, highlighting some key points about out strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investors section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until November 29, 2014, on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thanks, Eva, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue growth of about 9% is slightly stronger than what we've delivered throughout 2014 to date. This is solid organic growth and a strong statement about the value our solutions provide to our customers. We remain highly profitable with EBITDA margin in the quarter of slightly above 47% and adjusted EPS of $0.64, up about 5% over the prior year. We'll talk more about the detailed performance later in the call, but I'd like to highlight the good progress we're making in health care toward our annual goals through solid execution. This is important for us as we continue to position ourselves as a trusted partner for our customers. We recently completed our annual strategy sessions with our business units. During these exercises, we thought forward over many years to envision the solutions which will provide the greatest benefit to our customers and the markets we serve. I'm excited about the effort and energy our teams have brought to the longer-term vision. In terms of current developments, we've continued to roll out solutions for underwriters. In particular, we're using the weather-related intellectual property from our Verisk Climate business to offer valuable, data-driven insights for our insurance customers. Our A-PLUS Property claims database has an underlying data set with 9 million residential property hail claims reported to us from 2000 through 2013. Some of the high-level analysis based on the data indicates that the number of claims are both increasing and becoming more costly. This information creates opportunities for us to help our customers with the challenges they face. By combining A-PLUS data with Verisk Climate's Benchmark hail database, our teams identified that approximately 25% of hail claims from 2009 through 2013 have no evidence of hail activity on the reported date of loss. This indicates inaccuracies in the reported claim information that affect the association of a claim to a causative weather event, be it catastrophe or otherwise. Helping our customers identify those claims benefits their bottom lines in a very direct way. We also announced that Verisk Underwriting Solutions' 360Value now includes property slope and site access data for residential and commercial properties in the United States. 360Value is a web-based replacement cost estimator for residential, commercial and agricultural properties. New data compiled by Verisk Climate is now available in 360Value Property Prefill, streamlining the replacement cost estimation process and increasing the reliability of results. Property Prefill automatically populates key building information, including as many as 21 building characteristics to generate replacement cost estimates. Because the required modifications to the foundation and challenges in construction, properties built on steep slopes can cost an average of 12% more to replace than a property built on land with no discernible slope. Verisk Climate terrain database analytics allow for a high degree of resolution when estimating property slope. The extra expense involved with harder-to-access sites can increase reconstruction cost by an average of 16% compared with properties built in more accessible areas. Verisk Climate technology captures site access using multiple data sources, including road network data that calculates distance and accounts for impediments to easy access. Those capabilities save our customers' time, offering them a competitive advantage and an opportunity for higher levels of customer service. In addition to delivering organic growth, M&A remains high on our agenda, and our team is actively evaluating opportunities. We remain disciplined in our approach, focusing both on strategic fit and sensible valuations. We intend to continue to be excellent stewards of our shareholders' capital, and we're prepared to be patient in our pursuit of acquisitions. We have meaningful capacity for additional acquisitions that meet our strategic agenda, both through our significant free cash flow as well as our borrowing capacity. We also have continued to repurchase our stock, a sign of our ongoing confidence in our future. As we communicated in late September, we continue to work with the FTC towards receiving clearance for our announced acquisition of the EagleView Technologies Corporation or EVT. As we also disclosed, we extended our purchase agreement with EVT through December 31. We continue to work through the clearance process, and we'll report back when we have updates we can share. We're focused on delivering value to our shareholders, and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. In the quarter, we returned capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases of about $66 million. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was about $280 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy as we've previously outlined. Earlier this month, we marked the fifth anniversary of our IPO. Our vision is to be the world's most effective and responsible data and analytics company in pursuit of our customers' most strategic opportunities. We've made great strides executing on our vision based on the dedication and teamwork of our people. The service to our customers through the efforts of our team have delivered outstanding results and returns for our shareholders. One of the ways we celebrated the anniversary was to hold our first-ever Verisk Community Service Week across 28 offices, representing cities and towns throughout North America and the world. Our Verisk colleagues volunteered to help over 50 different organizations. And I'm very proud of our collective interest in serving not just our customers, but our communities as well. With that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare: Thanks, Scott. In the third quarter, total revenue grew 8.9%, ahead of previous quarters in 2014. The mix of areas of growth was slightly different in previous quarters. And it's our diversity of revenue streams and the subscription businesses that allow us to create a consistent overall growth. Decision Analytics segment grew and delivered 8% -- excuse me, 11.8% revenue growth in the quarter. This growth is driven by strong performances in financial services and health care, resulting from the execution of plans we discussed with you previously. Our Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 6.2% in the third quarter. The increase was driven by strong growth in loss quantification solutions and additional contributions in claims, underwriting and catastrophe modeling solutions. While the growth was slower than previous quarters, we are confident that our solutions remain vital to our customers and will drive our long-term growth. There were a number of items that were pushed out of the third quarter based upon implementation timelines and several contract signings which came in late in the quarter. Overall, demand remained strong and we're pleased with the sales and implementation pipelines. Finally, as we indicated to you last quarter, cat bond revenue can be a bit lumpy, and there was no property bond issuances in the market this quarter. In financial services. Strong revenue growth of 18.1% reinforces our confidence in being able to deliver at mid-teens growth in 2014. Growth was driven by our traditional solutions, including our Syndicated Studies, as well as by newer media effectiveness solutions. In the health care vertical, revenue in the third quarter grew 24.8%, led by strong growth in RQI and payment accuracy solutions. Enterprise Analytics also contributes to growth in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress the Verisk Health team is making in its execution and toward our full year goal. We're continuing to work hard to meet our customers' needs during this busy season, which is underway now, and we'll remain on track to deliver mid-teens growth for the full year 2014. In the specialized markets category, revenue decreased 2.6% in the third quarter. We saw good growth in the quarter in environmental health and safety solutions and weather and climate analytics to the commercial markets. Growth in the government space was again offset by the ongoing shift of the GOES-R contract from development to maintenance mode. Turning to Risk Assessment for the third quarter. We reported revenue growth of 4.1%, indicating the value to our long-standing [ph] insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew revenue 3.9% in the quarter. This reflects our 2014 invoices, which were effective January 1, and continued contribution from newer solutions. This was partially offset in the quarter by a decrease in some of our reinsurance product revenue as we shift to a more annualized revenue model with our customers. Another encouraging data point for industry-standard programs is that the contract sizes in the pipeline are up versus last year. Our property-specific rating in underwriting information revenue grew 4.9% in the quarter. This increase was from the sales, including those resulting from higher committed volumes. EBITDA from continuing operations for the third quarter increased 6.2% to $211.3 million and our EBITDA margin was 47.1%. Excluding professional services fees related to EVT, EBITDA margins were 47.7%. The margins in Decision Analytics were 41.3% in the third quarter 2014 versus 44.2% in the third quarter 2013. The decrease in margin is partially due to about $3 million in professional services fees related to EVT, which we had mentioned to you last quarter. In addition, growing revenues in the health care businesses, where margins are still scaling, contribute to the year-over-year difference. Our Risk Assessment margins were 57.5% versus 55.1% in the third quarter of 2013. Our margins were advanced in the quarter by revenue growth, good expense management and lower pension costs. We continue to expect flattish EBITDA margins for the full year, excluding Interthinx and professional services fees related to EVT. In our plan for 2014, we've contemplated Verisk Health margin expansion, balancing investments and insurance businesses. While we continue to expect to meet our mid-teens growth at Verisk Health, we could see a mix that has a somewhat lower margin due to shifts between types of assessments and categories of coding work. We continue to be actively managing the more intensive -- labor-intensive parts of our business while building on our more analytic pieces. This mix shift is a source of possible risk to our margin view. Our interest expense was down $1.2 million in the third quarter versus the respective period in 2013 due to lower debt balances as a result of repayments made in 2013. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate using our newly amended and extended revolver and cash on hand to purchase EVT. Our reported effective tax rate was 37.2% for the quarter. Adjustment net income increased 3.3% to $107.8 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.64 for the quarter, increase of 4.9%. The average diluted share count was 169.5 million shares in the quarter. On September 30, 2014, our diluted share count was 168.7 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased about 1 million shares for $65.9 million. At quarter end, we had $280.3 million left under our authorization. While our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating strong annualized IRRs. Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $432.5 million. Total debt, both short term and long term, was about $1.3 billion. Today, our incremental debt capacity is about $1 billion and will grow over time with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Our debt to pro forma EBITDA from continuing operations as of September 30 was 1.7x, below our steady-state target. We also recently amended our bank facility to extend the maturity to October of 2019, while also increasing the size of the facility to $990 million, providing us with sufficient flexibility for M&A agenda. Free cash flow, adjusted for 2 items discussed below, declined 6% compared to the prior period to $262.5 million. This represented about 45% of EBITDA from continuing operation in the first 9 months of 2014. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. To facilitate comparability to prior period, we adjusted free cash flow for the timing of excess tax benefit from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013 and for the sale of our mortgage services business this year. Cash provided by operating activities, as reported, decreased $7.8 million. This decrease was primarily due to a temporary use of around $75 million of working capital in the quarter. This higher-than-normal working capital relates to timing of invoices and customer payments, which will swing back over the next quarter or 2. We continue to be confident in our ability to generate free cash flow, and it remains the strength of our business model. Our capital expenditures were 8% of revenue year-to-date 2014, below the 8.5% level we were at in 2013. We continue to expect about $147 million in CapEx for the full year. The greater use of capitalized software related to new solutions will moderately raise our capital intensity over the course of the next few years relative to historic levels. We need to grow free cash flow at or above the level of our EBITDA growth. As you think about the models for the full year 2014, we expect flattish margins for the full year, excluding Interthinx and professional service fees related to EVT. Amortization of intangibles should be about $57 million, fixed asset depreciation amortization of about $85 million and a full year effective tax rate between 37% and 30%. The aim of our repurchase program is to keep share count flat and retain flexibility to buy more shares as appropriate. And at our current debt levels, our quarterly interest expense is about $18 million. Based upon the strength of our cash flow generation and current cash balances, we anticipate borrowing about $300 million or less for the acquisition of EagleView, depending upon timing of the close and other events. We incurred about $3 million of professional service fees related to the EVT transaction in third quarter and about $5 million year-to-date. We expect an additional cost of about $3 million in the fourth quarter. Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing well. We are seeing growth from multiple verticals, and we are executing on our operational plans. With that, I'll turn it back to Eva for comments before Q&A.
Eva F. Huston: Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I was just wondering, sort of given that you mentioned you had your sort of long-term strategic discussion and so forth, is mid-teens sort of the right number to view health care's potential over a much longer period of time as well?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. We really are not -- we haven't sort of tried to describe our health care ambitions in that way. What I would say is that we are counting on a broad-based approach to growing our health care business, meaning -- as I think many of you know, we have actually a pretty broad portfolio of solutions and that, we consider to be part of our strength inside of the health care space. And I would also say that, as I think, again, many of you know, there's a good fraction of our mix which relates to the world of Medicare Advantage. And one of the things that's true about that world is that we -- that there is just a very nice demographic trend inside of that world where, as America continues to age, one; and two, aging Americans seem to really like Medicare Advantage as an option. That's actually a nice tailwind inside of our business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the DA insurance side. You talked about the items being pushed out as the rate -- the lead contract timing. Is there any way to quantify, I guess, how much that impacted your business? And should we basically see all of that come in, in the fourth quarter then?
Mark V. Anquillare: So thanks for the question. I think what we continue to say is we think the business is incredibly strong. We are well positioned. We do not see anything that would be of concern. There's no contracts that left. There's no customers that left. So there is a bit of a "push" from third to fourth. There's also some cases where it's just pushed off. So I would expect a return to normalcy. I would not expect any surge in the fourth quarter, as you would kind of think about numbers. It's a subscription business, and I just want to highlight that there's -- it's tough to have surges, if you will.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I guess, just want to clarify on -- you talked about in the Risk Assessment space the reinsurance business, I guess, and the shift to annualized contracts. I didn't fully understand, I guess, what you meant by that and kind of the impact of that. And then, I guess, related to that, just I think there's some who have questioned whether, I guess, a softer insurance pricing environment would eventually have an impact on that business. Can you -- I guess, can you, I guess, comment on that, and I guess, relative to what the results were?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. Tim, let me -- this is Scott. Let me take the second part of your question, and then I'll ask Mark to speak specifically to the reinsurance piece. Just kind of the way to understand the P&C space and our role in it, generally, I would say a couple of things. One is, I think, some of the folks that are involved with us maybe have a little less history perhaps with the company, but there was a period back in the mid to latter first decade of the 21st century, beginning around 2008, where you had several consecutive years of softness, actually negative premium growth. And during that period of time, our insurance business always grew. And I just want to make that point as a general statement about the value of what it is that we do and the fact that we actually tend not to cycle around all that much with what's going on in the insurance cycle. I don't mean to say that there is absolutely 0 effect. But generally, we've shown our ability to continue to add value and to work through that. But more generally, I -- the real kind of tone that I would want you to understand is that we're almost -- regardless of where we are in the insurance cycle right at this moment, insurance companies really are going through kind of a quiet revolution, where, I think more than ever, they are really embracing data analytics as a way of running their businesses. And so we find that this is a very opportune time to engage deeply with our customers and to try to understand what their emerging decisioning needs are and to speak to that. And we really feel that our opportunity is primarily on us. It's really a function of how intimate are we with our customers and how quickly are we moving to help them solve their emerging issues. So just in a very general sense, certainly, I understand that folks want to be watching what's going on in the insurance cycle. But our view is that, that's not really what determines our outcome. And our history has tended to actually reinforce that point of view. But now -- but there are certain things that go on, cat bonds or events, and Mark talked about the way that we actually put our reinsurance products out there. So Mark, maybe you come back now and clarify on that particular point.
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure. So one of the things that we're pretty excited about is, inside of a lot of the Verisk businesses, there's quite a bit of teamwork and collaboration. So what we had done inside of a Touchstone module that's an AIR module, we've tried to combine the kind of best parts of Verisk Insurance. We have the cat risks. We have the non-cat risks. And what we've also done is we've brought in our reinsurance products into that. So these would be kind of big size of loss type problems. And we've bundled that for both reference and access through Touchstone as well as through what we would refer to as our typical industry standard programs. And that kind of contract, the way we're interacting with customers is the much more holistic approach. It's more annualized contract with customers. So that's a part of the transition as we think about kind of better ways we can kind of leverage of all the great parts of Verisk.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then, just the comment on the margin for health care and I guess, the overall margins in terms of the mix of work. I guess, just to clarify that as well as the comment you're seeing more kind of the record collection or record retention type of work then kind of the analytics side for the RQI business or I guess, maybe just elaborate. And I guess, how big of a potential impact, as we think about the overall company's results, could you see from that?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, so the -- really the -- all we're trying to acknowledge there is that even within -- so health care margins are where they are. And actually, when we look at where we stand relative to other, say, publicly reported health care data and analytics companies, we feel good about where we are, but there is some mix effect even inside of what we do in health care. And so that's really what Mark was referencing in his comments, and that's really all he was referencing his comments.
Mark V. Anquillare: The RQI business is a little bit more labor-intensive than some of the Payment Accuracy and Enterprise Analytics businesses, and that's an element of how we have to manage.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Just a follow-up on that last point. Just -- you talked about margins a couple of different times, and I just want to make sure I'm pulling them together correctly. Are you saying you're still expecting margins to be flat year-over-year for the business, excluding $8 million of professional fees, but they're at increased risk because of what's going on in health care?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. We've -- you heard us correctly. We're saying that we expect our margins to be flattish year-over-year. We do want to call out the extraordinary one-time expenses associated with closing the EagleView acquisition. And as we drive forward on the revenue front, the mix of what we do in health care will interact with the margin outcome, but you heard us correctly in terms of our net on all of that.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then Scott, in the last quarter, you talked very briefly about some newly adopted solutions in the Risk Assessment segment. Predictive Modeling and Electronic Rating Content and workers' comp solutions -- I think the general perception of investors is that's not a segment where there's a lot of innovation going on. But can you just talk more broadly about what you guys are doing to innovate and create new solutions in that segment?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. This is one of the really exciting things to me because, as I think many of you know, when we talk about Risk Assessment, these are the most legacy parts of what it is that we do at Verisk, but we -- we're really of the mind that there's nothing that we do that is a mature business because we're always asking the question, "What do our customers need? And where is it going?" So just to make sure everybody understands the couple of the things we're doing. So Electronic Rating Content is really the digital instantiation of our intellectual property inside of our industry-standard programs. And I guess, the easiest way to understand it is, we put out that IP, and in the past, there's been a fair amount of both interpretation and I don't want to call it coding exactly, but digitization of our content in order to get it into the -- our customers' platforms, into their policy admin platforms so that they can actually take our content and drive a rate, a price, for an insurance policy. And so what we've done in Electronic Rating Content is we've made our content much more consumable than it was previously. So that would be -- that's what that is -- and by the way, I'm not sure if I heard you quite correctly, but I don't mean to say that all of these are just brand-new. We've actually -- these are things we've been working on for a while. Another thing which is really big is that I think that our -- I know that our customers now just really get it, that predictive modeling, for purposes of rating and underwriting, actually, are just -- that's almost a requirement now in the insurance industry. And basically, because of the depth of our data sets, we have some real advantages in terms of building some really good, really sensitive, predictive models. And so that's definitely a part of what we're doing. In Risk Assessment also, we're actually trying to take the capabilities that we've got as it relates to creating an engineering view of a commercial building and use them in other ways. In particular, we're exploring opportunities and finding some interest in using that same engineering view of a building to help in a commercial real estate lending situation. So that's some work we're doing. Mark already mentioned sort of in the excess and surplus markets, and this can also relate to the reinsurance markets, finding a way to take non-catastrophe observations about properties and use them -- and put them alongside of the catastrophe kinds of observations that we're already making. So those are a few examples of the sorts of things that we're doing. It's all around, just as everything we do, is it's basically all around trying to help our customers make better, more precise decisions in a more efficient way. And I'm really pleased and proud of our teams for the way that they're really aspiring to get to the next level of value.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Suzanne Stein from Morgan Stanley.
Denny Galindo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: This is Denny Galindo on for Suzanne Stein. I just had a question on the transactional revenue. If I looked at your 10-Q and you kind of break out transactional versus subscription, it looks like the Decision Analytics segment had a lot higher transactional volume than it usually does. Where was this coming from in terms of which industry vertical? And should this level of transaction volume continue?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes. Thanks, Denny. It's a good question. This is Mark. The transaction volume you're alluding to is driven really by the second half ramp-up in RQI, so that's the Revenue Integrity business that we've talked about with Medicare Advantage. So that's the transactional uptick that you see. You'll see that in the third and probably fourth. It's a -- notionally, health care is kind of a 40% first and half -- first half of the year, 60% second half of the year story, and you're seeing some of that.
Denny Galindo - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then, secondly, I'm not sure how much you can say on this, but given it's been a long time since we talked about EVT when you first had your press conference, I was wondering if you can give us an update on how it's doing this year? And also, if the relaxation of resolution restrictions that occur this summer might impact the growth rate and that as it competes versus satellite versus just traditional aerial imagery providers.
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. So -- I mean, I think you anticipated the answer in your question. There's really no comment that we're going to make on this given that the process is ongoing. But with respect to your second question, which is the government-enabling commercial providers of satellite-based imagery to increase the resolution of what they're selling, that is a trend that we're very closely following. And in fact, we ourselves make use of satellite imagery to a fairly substantial degree inside of Verisk today. So that whole world is very important to us. But I believe what your question is trying to get at is, is there any substitution effect from that more increased level of satellite imagery versus the aerial imagery we're talking about, and the answer is a definitive no.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from Contrast.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: It's still SunTrust. I just want make sure, I've been here a while, I just -- I wanted to go back to health care a little bit, recognizing that RQI is such an important part of the business and also recognizing that you've done a really nice job of clearly meeting your customers' capacity needs. Is there anything sort of structurally that informs the long-term scalability of that business, recognizing that it does have sort of, I guess, a little more labor-intensive aspect to it and perhaps more of a front-end loaded expense characteristic? In other words, I mean, is that -- in the absence of more diversification, and it actually sounds like that business is getting a little more diverse, is it less scalable than you might have thought about it a couple of years ago, health care overall?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, there -- I think there are 2 things that are going to apply in terms of -- if we're talking specifically about the RQI revenue streams. I think there are 2 things that will apply that relate to scalability. One is, if and as the U.S. health care world becomes significantly more oriented towards electronic medical records, there will be an efficiency in terms of the retrieval of some of the data. And I would also say that there's just a mounting [ph] ability in the world generally to take unstructured and semi-structured data and to turn it into usable information. And both of those things, I think, will put some wind into the sails of the efficiency with which the process can be managed. An overlay on all of that is, I'm sure many of you know, that the -- sort of the schema for describing what's going on in the health care world, with respect to the kind of the diagnostic side of things, is going to become significantly more complex as we move from ICD-9 to ICD-10. So there will be a moment-in-time effect of just everybody having to respond to that basically. So I just sort of observe that as kind of an overlay to those otherwise 2 trends that I was just talking about. So our goal remains exactly what it always was, which is to create analytically differentiated businesses, and we continue to want to work on that. I think that it's kind of a long march as it relates to health care generally and I think, particularly as it relates to the RQI kind of business, because these trends that I'm describing are not the kinds of trends that are going to sort of flip overnight. And so that's kind of the landscape here, and I think it will be a progressive agenda, but kind of a long-term agenda.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. So some factors are in your control and others aren't, it sounds like. And then, just with regard to the mix, you -- helpful to call out enterprise, is there the possibility for the acceleration of perhaps some higher-margin business within health care? Or is it premature to think about that?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, we're very motivated to see the analytically differentiated highest-margin parts of what we do grow. And actually, in the third quarter, we actually had some very nice, encouraging news on that front, I would say, particularly as it relates Payment Accuracy.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Anj Singh from Crédit Suisse.
Anjaneya Singh - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I know last quarter, you had cited a growth rate for record retrieval. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of what that record retrieval growth looked like in the third quarter. And I realize that the RQI business is weighted towards the back half. But if you could just offer some insight about how to think about the cadence of the growth in the first half of 2015 versus what we've seen so far in 2014?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes. Thanks for the questions. This is Mark. I mean, what we were trying to do last quarter was we were trying to illustrate that we were ahead of last year's pace and we had volumes that we're ramping and we were doing the work to execute and show -- and demonstrate that execution. I think what -- we are at the point now where basically the volumes have trued up, if you will. So we didn't point to that metric anymore because I think you can kind of see those volumes in the execution in the revenue growth. So I'm not sure I'm answering your question because I don't know specific answers about the records that have actually retrieved. But we know that the retrieval volumes have more naturally synced with the rev rec, and that's what you're seeing in the numbers.
Anjaneya Singh - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then, on Argus, I know in the past, you've had a little bit more skew towards project work in the fourth quarter. I'm wondering if that will hold true again for this year or if that any of that may have been pulled into Q3.
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, that -- I mean, that effect is not a part of what we see in -- what we're anticipating in Q4 versus Q3. It actually -- the -- and when you say project work, I just want to quibble with the word a little bit. It -- what it -- what we do on the services side of that business is take our analytic products, those that we've already, in a sense, built and find ways to apply them very specifically for individual customers. And so the point I'm trying to make here is that even our services work feeds off of the intellectual property that we accumulate in aggregate in the form of products, and that's part of why that business is also so appealing to us, in addition to the fact that it really helps us to be very hands-on with our customers and very intimate. But mix shift inside of what Argus does is not really a substantial part of the story there. It's a very balanced set of 3 different ways that the business is growing, and they're all very healthy.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Health care, you had a great growth in the quarter. You're still guiding to mid-teens. Does that -- did you pull forward revenue? Or does that mean there's going to be fourth quarter deceleration? Or is that just kind of a reiteration in guidance, and we shouldn't read too much into that in the cadence of the year on your revenue growth?
Scott G. Stephenson: It was not a pull-forward. There's just -- there's a rhythm to the business. It's what we've been talking about for quarters and quarters, and we're experiencing that rhythm right now.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Great. And so would you be sticking with your mid-teens guidance should that -- does that mean we should expect a sort of a slowdown in the fourth quarter from what we just saw?
Mark V. Anquillare: I think the math would suggest that. But I mean, I would not read too much into that. I think we're kind of on a good pace right now, and we expect to continue.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi from Janney Montgomery Scott.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing in the health care business. If I remember correctly, and I could be wrong, there were some price discounts given at some point in time. How much does that feed into or affect the margin profile?
Scott G. Stephenson: That was a moment in time that was with very specific accounts. And it almost feels like ancient history at this point because things move so quickly. But there's -- we need to make sure that the value is where the customers need it to be, and there was a moment in time where we took some steps to -- where we were willing to trade off a little bit of price for volume. But I would not, in any sense, encourage you to think that, that's some major effect inside of the business.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just on the seasonality of the business. I'm not sure if you've given percentages around sort of what part of revenues typically fall in the first half of the year versus second half of the year, but yes, I think you could probably see where I'm going with that, so...
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes. I think we've normally said that the health care business is a 60% second half story.
Joseph D. Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Right. And we're sticking with that as we go forward just as well, correct?
Mark V. Anquillare: It's going to be about 60%, correct.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So a question for you on health care. Now that we've -- or 3 quarters of the way through this year, and we've seen some relatively large swings in terms of the growth rates. But as we head into 2015, we have then anniversary-ed that, and we should be then into first half, 40%; second half, 60%. And as you lap that, what are you thinking about in terms of what a normalized growth rate against that already seasonal level would be?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. I mean, I think that -- we were trying to get at that maybe with one of the earlier questions, which is what we're really focused on are the kind of the fundamental drivers underneath. And in all 3 of the divisions inside of our health care unit, we feel that substantially, our opportunity hinges upon the amount of value that we bring in to the market. And then, the overlay of that is that there is a definite tailwind associated with the demography of the Medicare Advantage world, and it's really kind of at the intersection of all that. But I think substantially, how well do we do our own work, that will determine our growth rate going forward.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Is that intersection at double and digits?
Scott G. Stephenson: We just haven't really put that -- we haven't really put that out, Bill. I mean, the thing I want to keep emphasizing on health care is that we're on a journey, and we know what an excellent differentiated data analytics business looks like because we run several of them. And we're not, in any sense, trying to represent that, that's where we've got into with health care yet, and yet that's our aspiration.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Well, then my -- for my follow-up, I was going to ask a variation on that question for financial services and Argus, which, again, is seeing -- it's a smaller revenue base, but it has seen some variation in terms of the growth rate, in terms of what we should be thinking about that going forward as we normalize against some of the ups and downs on that growth rate.
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, the thing I would say about the Argus business particularly is that the business was really sort of birthed with some very differentiated data assets, and we continue to try to build differentiated data assets. I would say more of the -- well -- and achieving additional differentiated data assets in economies around the world is a very important part of the strategy at Argus and is an agenda that we definitely, definitely lean into. And I would say, in addition to that, that the other thing that is really going to apply with respect to the growth rate of Argus is the ability to transform the data assets into analytic output that really makes a difference for customers. And one of the things that will be really important inside of all of that is customers, in addition to the -- our traditional base with our banking customers. And we have a lot of focus on that, and that -- it's very exciting that, that creates just essentially greenfield streams of revenue, which we're pursuing pretty strongly. And that's an agenda which I think has real legs and will stretch over a considerable period of time. And when I'm saying all of that, what I'm really referring to is the advertising, promotional effectiveness, the mention of what it is that Argus does.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Scott, in your remarks, you referenced a 5-year horizon for innovation and growth, and I'm wondering if you could maybe look out beyond this year and give us some insight about how you think about operating leverage. Do you think Verisk is a company that, over time, should be able to generate margin expansion, let's say, as we look out over a 2-year time horizon?
Scott G. Stephenson: So a couple of things about that. One is, I think the burden of proof is on us in anything that we do where we have already established the foundation of the business, meaning we're already sourcing the data, we've already platformed the solution. Any business which is like that, I think, the burden of proof is on us that we can't improve the efficiency of what's being done there in a way that the margins were going to advance. That's actually the way that we think about it. So anything that we're already doing, our leaning and bias is how do we make that more efficient and therefore, how do we make the margins of that go up? Now I will say that with some of the -- for example, Mark laid out there where our RA margins are. Those are very high margins. And at some point, you're all-in margin begins to look a lot like your gross margin because the below-the-line costs are relatively a small enough fraction. So just the math tends to say that there's some natural upper limit on it. But still, the point I just made does apply. That's the way we think about it. The counterbalance is that we want to be on the move with our customers, and so we want to be always developing new things. And there's definitely adoption curves as it relates to any innovation inside of any of our markets. And you do have the upfront investment in order to get position to give that -- to be there with that solution. And you're developing not only the technology, you're also developing the marketplace. So that's just my way of saying that we're going to remain investment-minded. And the net of all of that to our way of thinking, a very healthy place to be on all of that, is the long-term view that we shared with you, which is we're in that 45% to 47% range. That's -- I think those are, just by almost any standard of comparison to the market, extremely high margins. And we think that, that represents a balanced place where we'll continue to push for efficiency on the one hand, but investment on the growth on the other hand.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: So in other words, you're reinvesting cost savings from efficiency. Should we expect you to reinvest 100% of cost savings from efficiency? Or is there a little bit of room for margin expansion over time?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, I just want to keep pointing you towards that range. And you can see, actually, we sort of popped through the top of the range this quarter, but that's the way that we think about it over long periods of time. And I also want to say that, yes, we have the model in mind, for sure. But at the same time, it's not as if we say, "Oh well, we've got this much money to spend because that then gets us in the margin range we're looking for." We're actually thinking hard about, on a project-by-project basis, "Does this deserve funding? Does that deserve funding?" And that's really how we get to the outcome.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Understood. Just a quick final question for Mark on capital allocation. Can you update us on the acquisition pipeline, where you're driving in terms of certain verticals or adjacencies that might be interesting to you?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes, sure. I mean, I think we continue to think about acquisition as a part of how we best and most effectively deploy capital, so we're on a constant search. As a matter of fact, as a part of the multiyear plan that we're on, we made it explicit. Everybody is a part of the M&A team. So I think what we've seen is an influx of ideas and opportunities that we're chasing. And I think the most natural places to go, I think we've talked about, we always love to find a good insurance asset, but even one that has a little bit of an international flavor, I think that's interesting. We continue to think about health care frequently. And I think inside of what else we can do with banks and marketing effectiveness is on our agenda. And finally, supply chain. There's more and more interest in what we can do for not just insurers, as you think about business interruption and supply chain, but for manufacturers and chemical companies and the like. And I think there's a couple of things we can do to fill out. So we are kind of moving in all of the more natural verticals, trying to get deeper and wider. And I think we feel good about the opportunities that are out there that we have to now find, price and more specifics.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: I wonder if you could you give us a sense -- nice job in terms of buyback in the quarter. Was there, at any point, you were prohibited from being in the market because of EVT? Or was it pretty consistent in terms of the capital deployment in the quarter?
Scott G. Stephenson: I'm sorry. Could -- you're a little scratchy there. Could you repeat the question please?
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Sorry, Scott. In terms of the buyback in the quarter, were you out of the market at any point because you were -- were you able to buy relatively consistently over the course of the quarter?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes -- no. No, not at all. There is nothing. There was no interaction between those 2 agendas.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. Kind of didn't know from -- just from a materiality perspective there, there might've been some restriction. And then, just real quick on the -- could you talk just a little bit about the savings on the pension expense? And was that kind of one-time in nature? Or should we expect that going forward? And was that contemplated in the guidance as well as if you think about the plan [ph] forward year-on-year?
Mark V. Anquillare: So from a pension perspective, a couple of things occurred. We did increase our pension a few years ago. I think it was 2012. And more recently, shortly thereafter, we actually funded the pension. We were underfunded, we funded the pension. What you're seeing now is obviously, in the last couple of years, the "benefit" associated with that, also, in large part, because the liabilities are generally unchanged. But what is changing is the returns, the asset returns, the market has done well. So you're kind of seeing the net of that inside of what expenses we recognized inside our P&L, and that's what's been disclosed.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. Just so I won't be [indiscernible] from here and your right into the [ph] market, continues perform or underperform, you just never placed it in the income statement, is that right?
Mark V. Anquillare: I apologize. I have a little problem hearing you. But I'll try to give you the answer. I think you're questioning -- for the most part, the liability basis generally can be unchanged because we've frozen pension plan. And now it relates a lot to how the assets performed in the market itself. So think of it, the fixed income portfolio, bond portfolio, as well as equities, and that's -- that affects the expense you recognize each year. It shouldn't vary too much, but that's the variables.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Mark, sometimes when a segment, like DA insurance, is more volatile, your perspective commentary gets a little more specific. So in that spirit, I'm going to ask you about your fourth quarter DA insurance commentary that the growth will return to more normal growth in the fourth quarter and kind of look backwards. And I'm asking you, when you say more normal growth rate for DA insurance, do you mean approximately 10%?
Mark V. Anquillare: So I think what I'd like to do is kind of break it down in a little bit more detail without a very specific answer to it, Andrew. As you can see, the way we kind of organize things, it's inside of the loss quantification, that's the Xactware business, continues to be strong. I think we would continue to see consistency there. Our AIR catastrophe modeling business, I would tell you that just, from a sequencing perspective, that was down a little bit in third quarter. I think we would expect that to come back a little bit in the fourth quarter. And then, claims business has been pretty consistent all year. So when I think about kind of the return, it's really more around 1/3 of it, and I think we would get back to kind of a run rate. As you think about the full year, year-to-date, we should get down -- we should get back to kind of a "normalized" level. I don't think -- which is the heart of the answer here. We have not lost any customers. The market position remain strong. We feel real good where we are customers, and I just want to make sure I share that with those who are listening.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. And when you said there was some pushouts in the third quarter, was there a reason for the pushouts?
Mark V. Anquillare: I think we have some implementation items and maybe a couple of contract signings that I can specifically remember.
Scott G. Stephenson: Okay. Well, we thank all of you for your time this morning and for your interest in our company and appreciate the opportunity to talk about the third quarter. And we look forward to speaking with you at the completion of the next quarter. Thanks very much for your time.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Scott
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you, Eva and good morning all. Our second quarter revenue growth was good, again driven by very strong performance in our insurance units. We remained focused on our effort to continue to innovate and deliver predictive analytics for our customers, which will in turn lead to solid organic growth and shareholder returns over time. As we’ve discussed with you, we consider our organic growth rate to be the single best measure of our vitality as an organization. I believe our assets makes us the best, it has been in my years with the company. And we believe our assets will allow us to deliver the kind of organic growth you’ve come to expect from Verisk. I want to share with you a couple of recent highlights, across some of our key themes. A wonderful example on the innovation and investment agenda is the launch of Touchstone 2.0 which is the next version of our next generation cat modeling platform, released earlier this month. As you know we’ve invested in Touchstone and are very pleased with the customer adoption, we’ve seen in the course of 2013 and 2014. With this second release, we’re introducing many new capabilities, including support for non-cat risks, such as fire, lightening, explosion and vandalism. Having this information in a single platform, by leveraging other parts of the Verisk insurance solutions group, provide some more comprehensive view of risk, thereby expanding the value to our insurance customers, by giving them a more holistic view of their portfolio. Second, we’re focused on the large and long-term opportunity, related to international expansion. We’re in the very early innings with international comprising a small piece of our revenue today. Our units within existing presence outside the U.S are working to expand. We generate revenue outside the U.S today from analytics-related to catastrophe modeling, environmental health and safety, payments and insurance claims. Our other units with solutions and analytics which are applicable or adaptable to international markets are exploring the best ways to enter those markets. A recent example of our international efforts is the Risk Symposium, we held in London, in June. We were pleased with the quality of the attendees and the strong interest in our solutions from the insurance industry. As we’ve discussed in the past, our international efforts will reflect the mix of both organic growth and acquisitions where they make strategic and financial sense. M&A remains high on our agenda and our team is actively evaluating opportunities, while we remain focused on our core principle of creating shareholder value through innovation, discipline and execution. We’ve meaningful capacity for additional acquisitions that meet our strategic agenda, both through our significant free cash flow, as well as our borrowing capacity. We also have continued to repurchase our stock, a sign of confidence in our future. We continue to work through the SEC approval process, in connection with our announced acquisition of EagleView Technology and still expect to close the acquisition in the third quarter of 2014, likely towards the end of September. In the second quarter of 2014, we delivered good overall performance with total organic revenue growth of about 9% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 8%. EBITDA margin in the quarter was about 46%. We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. In the quarter we returned capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases of about $30 million. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was about $346 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy as we previously outlined. And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare:  Thanks, Scott, and good morning. In the second quarter, total revenue grew 8.5%. For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 10.8% revenue growth. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in insurance. Our Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 14.2% in the second quarter. The increase was driven by strong growth in loss quantification and catastrophe modeling solutions. Underwriting growth in the quarter was good and claims solutions also contributed. Overall revenue growth was driven by the increased adoption of existing and new solutions as well as a strong quarter for tax-free bonds, although even without that benefit, our Decision Analytics insurance growth was double digits. Because of the cat bond revenue, which is based upon market transaction, I would expect growth to moderate a bit in the coming quarters, but will be strong for the year. In addition, we have seen the benefit of new contracts and adoption of new solutions in our repair cost estimating business. These began in 2013 and will come full cycle in the second half of this year. In financial services, revenue growth of 11.6% in the quarter was in line with our expectations. Second quarter growth was below our first quarter growth rate due to larger than usual project revenue in the second quarter of 2013. However, overall this is a highly recurring revenue business which offers us a very good visibility. We are confident that the growth outlook at Argus remains strong. This includes opportunities related to international expansion, additional penetration of existing customers, and partnering opportunities, in particular related to advertising effectiveness with traditional and new media companies. We remain confident that financial services will grow at least mid-teens in 2014. In the healthcare vertical, revenue in the second quarter grew 6.6% led by growth in revenue and quality solutions. We are focused on the Medicare Advantage busy season, which will run through early 2015. We have much better visibility into our customer volumes for this year than we did last year at this time. We’ve improved our operations in support of the business and we have achieved over 50% more records in the second quarter of 2014 than in the second quarter of 2013. Pulling the work of the busy season forward and staffing ahead in this way is precisely where we thought we’d be and exactly where we need to be in order to deliver the mid-teens growth for the full year 2014. In the specialized markets category, revenue increased 0.8% in second quarter. So good growth in the quarter in environmental health and safety solutions and weather and climate analytics to the commercial market. Growth in government space was offset by the shift of (indiscernible) contract from development to maintenance mode. Turning to Risk Assessment for the second quarter, we put revenue growth of 5% indicated the value to our long standing trend customers. Our industry standard insurance programs grew revenue 5% in the quarter, this reflects our 2014 invoices which were effective January 1. In addition we saw our contribution to growth from newly adopted solutions such as predictive modeling, electronic reading content and worker’s compensation solutions. We are putting a lot effort into our long standing solutions and building our culture continue our strong position into the future.  Property-specific rating and underwriting information increased 4.8% in the quarter. This increase was from new sales including those resulting in higher committed volumes. EBITDA from continuing operations for the second quarter increased 8% to $194.2 million and our EBITDA margin was 45.9%. The margins in Decision Analytics were 39.4% in second quarter 2014 versus 39.6% in the second quarter of 2013. After the dip in margin, the first quarter 2014 related to increased cost in our healthcare business as well as investments to support our innovation agenda. We are pleased to see the margin close to where we were last year in the second quarter. Our preparation for the Verisk Health busy season has included earlier hiring to ensure appropriate staffing levels. So, this is a good result even with the front loading of these expenses. You will recall that as revenue picks up in healthcare business, some portion of these expenses were as well. These variable costs is something you may want to keep in mind, if you look DA margins for the rest of the year. In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 56.3% versus 56.0% in the second quarter of 2013. Our margins were advanced in the quarter by revenue growth, good expense management and lower pension cost. Our interest expense was down $2.2 million in the second quarter versus the respective period in 2013, due to lower debt balances as a result of repayments made in 2013. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate using our revolver and cash on hand, including the proceeds from the sale of Interthinx to fund the purchase of EagleView Technologies.   Our reported tax rate was 37.9% for the quarter. Adjusted net income increased 5.1% to $96.9 million in the quarter, adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.57 for the quarter, an increase of 7.5%. The average diluted share count was 169.5 million shares in the quarter. On June 30, 2014 our diluted share count was 169.5 million shares.
 :
 : Our debt-to-pro forma EBITDA from continuing operations as of June 30 was 1.7 times below our steady-state target. With the acquisition of EagleView Technology using in part cash on hand, interest paid or leverage will be about two times to close the transaction. Free cash flow just for two items discussed below grew 4% compared to the prior period to $228.1 million. This represented over 60% of EBITDA from continuing operations in the first six months of 2014.
 : Cash provided by operating activities, as reported increased $40.1 million. This increase was the result of $20.6 million increase generated by improved profitability of the business, a $5 million decrease in interest paid due to lower debt balances, and a decrease of $46.2 million in taxes. This is partially offset by a $10 million use of cash for working capital, another balance sheet changes and other outflows of $21.2 million.
 : As you think about your models for the full year 2014, we expect flattish margins for the full year, excluding Interthinx. As we remain focused on our innovation agenda, we are maintaining our longer-term view of margins in the 45% to 47% range. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be about $57 million, fixed asset depreciation, amortization of about $85 million and an effective tax rate between 37% and 38%. We aim to keep our share count flat through our share repurchase program. And at current debt levels, our quarterly interest expense is about $18 million. Based upon the strength of our cash flow generation and current debt to cash balances, we anticipate borrowing about $300 million less for the acquisition of EagleView, depending on the timing of close and other events. We are expecting to incur $4 million to $5 million of higher legal and professional services fee related to the transaction, most of which will fall in the third quarter. After the close of EagleView transaction, we will update you. Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing well. We have a nice mix of growth across multiple verticals, we are executing on our operational plans and we continue to invest with discipline for the future and we continue our strong organic growth. I will turn it back to Eva for a comment before Q&A.
Eva F. Huston: Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. And given the large of analysts we have covered, we ask you to limit your questions to one and one follow-up, this will give more people an opportunity to ask questions. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Operator?
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik – Barclays Capital:  So the first question is just around the cat bond business, I was wondering if you could help us understand the size of that business because clearly it’s been a nice driver for the DA insurance for some time and also if you could maybe help understand, I think you’ve pointed a little bit, but just the one-time impact from just the issuance levels I guess versus the subscription base that moved up?
Scott G. Stephenson: Sure, so let me first describe a little bit about the way we think of cap on some. Those are very big function inside the opportunity where there is a model that is used for any type of insurance link transaction. We believe that the science is very important there it’s probably the pure sense of the quality of the solution and in a very significant majority of the coupons AIR has own that business, so unfortunately it’s a little bit more difficult to predict, it kind of gets up and down year and year out generally though the trend in insurance-linked transaction in coupons has been growing over time. So we think that is positive trend broadly. I think the best way to kind of describe, the impact is, it is not a material part of the cat remodeling business, but it becomes increasingly more important. The overall growth that I wanted to describe inside of Decision Analytics insurance as a whole even without that would have grown about 10%, an excessive 10% actually in the quarter.
Manav Patnaik – Barclays Capital: Okay. And then, maybe just around in the financial services piece, you referred to the opportunity in the advertising effectiveness with media companies. I was wondering if you could just help us or elaborate just a little bit more on what exactly that mean?
Scott G. Stephenson: This is Scott. Basically through the work that Argus does we have a very comprehensive view of spending patterns by individuals and households. And the world of those who are trying to promote to individuals and households is interested in understanding what the reaction is when there is some form of media campaign. It could be traditional media, it could be new media. Argus data are useful in understanding what the reaction is in terms of consumer spending patterns. That’s the linkage.
Manav Patnaik – Barclays Capital: Okay. Fair enough. I’ll get back in the Q. Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.
Timothy McHugh – William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Thank you. First, I guess I want to follow-up on the catastrophe business a little bit. Besides obviously the bond, can you talk about what’s driving the strength there? If you look at the biggest competitor there, they seem to be growing more like mid-single digits. And then, I guess can you touch on, I guess, maybe Touchstone 2.0. I know they’re in the process of trying to roll out their own kind of new technology platform. Just competitively how do you think about that there?
Scott G. Stephenson: Tim, your second question is actually the answer to your first. A lot of the growth that’s going on now is innovation around the software platform that’s used for not only delivering the cat models, but actually interpreting the cat models into workflows. And this is the change in the cat modeling business. It used to be more about the basic model, which was essentially around a stochastic view of the probability of disasters and their impacts on damage and then the damage impact upon insurance outcomes. Those are the core models. The software, which is really – and this business has become much more software intense, I would say over the last year or two. The software is basically about graving those models and helping our customers to interpret them into their own decisions, whether it’s at the portfolio level or the individual risk level. And the market is responding very positively essentially to all of the things that I just described. Our models are seen as being great distinct, very grounded and really good signs. And our software is industry leading at this point. So there’s really been just kind of an across the board very strong reaction by the market. And when I say the market there are lot of different customers segments here, there is global reinsurers, there is insurers, there is reinsurance brokers and all of the segments are responding strongly and positively to what we do.
Timothy McHugh – William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Does that mean that you’re displacing the competitors there, because they don’t have a new platform out there and are they grabbing new shares? And I guess associated with that do you, I guess if you’re displacing the competitors, what is the risk as they were out their own technology platform that it all stalled some of the pace of growth here, I guess that you’re seeing?
Scott G. Stephenson: We are really quite sure that we’re taking share, but it’s also the case that the size and scope of the relationships with our existing customers are also growing. So, both of those are contributing to our growth. And, yes, we expect that RMS will eventually come out with their own solution and this is a – this will be a perpetual journey for us in terms of always upgrading the value of our solution. That is not really anything different from where the business has been in the past.
Timothy McHugh – William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Okay, great. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson: Welcome.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna.
James E. Friedman – Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: I guess I will ask mine up front, but the – I just want to clarify Mark, with regard to expectations that they would imply that this second half healthcare growth is either in excess of 20% and also at the same time that you’d said you’re expecting team’s growth for Financial Services.
Mark V. Anquillare: So your math is correct? Correct, yes we are expecting both of those. We are doing the right things with regard to healthcare and position to deliver. And at the same time I just want to emphasize that how strong a business the Argus business is, and I think we feel that we’re making great progress along lot of fronts.
James E. Friedman – Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP: Great, I appreciate the clarification. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.
Jeffrey P. Meuler – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Follow up first on the healthcare outlook, I think it sounded like part of what gives you confidence is that you are better prepared for the busy season and maybe you’re going to be pulling some revenue forward. Is that the primary sector that gives you the confidence and the re-acceleration in healthcare growth? And asking that from the standpoint that if there is kind of this one-time catch up benefit is the longer term outlook for that business still similarly kind of mid-teens plus.
Scott G. Stephenson: Let me, let me take your question kind of in the order they were placed. Our confidence about the back half of the year is really a product of two things; one is, we have had the benefit now of the first two quarters and the way that we operated to business and Mark referenced the fact that in the second quarter the quarter we just completed, we retrieved more than 50% of more records than we did in the prior period, second quarter 2013 and so, we have a strong sense of the arc of the volume of the business based upon the fact that we’ve already moved a good number of transactions into the pipeline and as I think most of you know we moved from retrieving the records, coding the records on to the answer that our customers’ needs by way of risk adjustment. So we have observed what we – how we actually operated in the first two quarters that, that’s one part of our confidence and the other is we know where we are with the costumers in terms of what they have access to in terms of volumes to the full year 2014. With respect to the longer term and of course our business is made up of many different things we serve the Medicare Advantage space, we serve commercial payers, we have a variety solutions in our view of all those systems that were still a relatively small player in the healthcare data analytics space and essentially our view on that has not changed.
Jeffrey P. Meuler – Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay, and then there is talk at the analyst day about Telematics, there was talk in this call about expanding internationally. I believe there was a Telematics international acquisition that got transacted in the quarter. Can you just maybe recap us on what exactly you are looking for in the Telematics space and whether it’s likely to be a build or buy?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes, so we did announce an acquisition it wasn’t in this quarter was actually a while ago, and it is a very, very small acquisition what we acquired was really technology, but our view on Telematics overall is, it is likely that with time our customers are going to be interested in how they rate auto insurance policies and that at some point which is very difficult to determine actually very difficult to predict, data derived via telemetry from vehicles, it can probably play some role in all of that. And our first and most important goal here is to remind relevant in terms of auto policies get priced. And so we feel the need to be very familiar with the kind of data that are coming off of the installed devices that you kind of see today, the after-market devices and the mining of data from the OBD ports on the vehicles and but also – actually there is more interest now in seeing whether we can use our smartphones to also communicate some of the dynamics of the operation of the vehicle. So we’re really interested in it, because we have a relatively large business today in the mechanics of rating a personal auto policy, net commercial auto policy. And we see Telematics first and foremost as our ability to stay current with respect to what’s happening there. So some of what we do in Telematics will express itself as sort of new factors, which are incorporated into our rating programs and won’t necessarily emerge as separate revenue line items. But it’s also the case that we think that as we continue to do work in the Telematics space, we’re open to also finding ways to license some of the methodology to others that are also interested in mining telemetry data.
Jeffrey P. Meuler – Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Okay. Thank you.
Mark V. Anquillare:  Welcome.
Operator: Your next question is going to come from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman – JPMorgan Chase & Co.:  Hi, gentlemen. Mark, I wanted to ask you about some of the events hiring in Verisk Health – it’s obviously – is it optimistic side about revenues, I want to talk to you about margins. My question is, has Verisk Health created better efficiencies going into this busy season, because I’m still remembering from last busy season which was fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014, that it was kind of a headcount intensive process for Verisk’s part. I was wondering, as we go into this busy season, while always will require additional heads, will it be efficient?
Mark V. Anquillare:  So, thank you, Andrew. It’s a good question and let me just describe a little bit about the plan that we have and how we’ll roll this out. Because of the – a little bit kind of seasonal nature of the business, I think – we are doing right now is we’re getting enough people in place to satisfy what I’ll call the busy season which is the July through to typically into January sometimes in February, Medicare Advantage sweeps. What we’ve also done is we kind of work with some partners to handle overflow business. We have that both onshore and offshore to the extent that we need. And the expectation is because, a, we are hired and ramped up significantly more than last year. So that’s why I referenced the additional costs in the quarter that we probably didn’t see in the past. We should be better ready, better equipped to provide: a, higher quality service; b, the productivity should be there. It is difficult sometimes to try to manage all these new hires and that kind of self staffing somebody who we have had some tenure with will be better equipped to be able to be efficient, be more productive. We’ve also worked – we talk about a lot of effectiveness in efficiency, we’ve also worked on internal processes, we have metrics, we have work flow solutions all of those should contribute to higher quality and more effective process in the latter half of the season but the latter half of what will be 2014. That's what gives us some of the confidence as we talk about going forward. A lot of these volumes is about interacting with customers, making sure we know how they're going to give to us, when they’re going to give it to us, so we can deliver on our promises and deliver kind of results for them.
Andrew C. Steinerman – JPMorgan Chase & Co.: And so there should be some operating leverage as the revenue grows picks up right.
Scott G. Stephenson: We clearly incurred some possible in the fourth quarter of last year and first quarter of this year I mean in 2014 to handle the volumes and to satisfy customers. Those are kind of excess costs we would not expect to continue, correct.
Andrew C. Steinerman – JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify and understand a little better in the Healthcare business. I think the reference was to having collected more than 50%, more volume or increased volume versus the first half of last year. I'm just curious as to how that ultimately translates into revenue. I know there have been some pricing incentives to drive volume. You clearly looking for an acceleration in that business in the back half, but can you just describe the dynamic between record volume and maybe price per and how that informs the revenue growth in the business?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. Let me, you had a couple questions in there. So just first of all, to clarify the factual statement. What we were communicating is that the number of records that we retrieved in the second quarter of 2014 was more than 50% greater than the number of records we retrieved in the second quarter 2013.
Andrew W. Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, so q-over-q.
Scott G. Stephenson: Q-over-q.
Andrew W. Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Got it. Okay.
Scott G. Stephenson: And the way that we get, the way that we get paid is we actually have to work through not only the retrieval of the record, but actually through the coding of the contents which is really onto the interpretation of the content and deliver all of that to the customer. That is the point at which we get paid. And so in a sense, you can see what we did in second quarter of 2014 and the growth relative to 2013 is essentially part of the priming of the pump where we will then sort of work through the completion of each of these units as the second half of the year moves that and that’s when we will recognize the revenue. You should not understand a relationship overall between increasing volumes and price point. Last year we referenced the fact that there was one case in particular, where we made that tradeoff, but that’s not fundamentally an explanation for why our volumes are growing.
Andrew W. Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.:  Okay. So, revenue, all else being equal in that business should more or less track volume growth? Is that the right way to think about it?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes.
Mark V. Anquillare:  Just one quick clarification for you. Exactly what Scott said, yes, but it’s also an illustration that we’d accelerate the program and we’re trying to move some of these work volumes forward too. So I’d to describe to you a combination.
Andrew W. Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So timing in the year versus last year as well?
Mark V. Anquillare: That’s well, as volumes. Correct.
Andrew W. Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, if you could just elaborate, Mark, a little bit on the nature of the project revenue at Argus. Is that business that comes on and off in some sort of predictable way? In on other words, could there be another quarter in the future where you’d see a big jump in growth for these projects or is it much more episodic than that?
Mark V. Anquillare: So a very large percentage of the Argus business is long-term contracts. We recognize it greatly over the year, very high visibility, very high rate of recurring revenue. Around those benchmark studies the beauty of the Argus business is they get very deep and very close to the customers who then need some special projects done. In many cases that work or that project work tends to flow a little bit more heavily into the fourth quarter. It represents a smallish fraction, between 10% to 20% of the business and it’s pretty regular, but there is some timing elements as to when. And there was a pretty major project that took place in third quarter of 2013. I would tell you that it wasn’t anything we would call out because it is just kind of a part of the business. It happens all the time. So I would tell you we are not concerned by anything, but you see kind of slower growth here in the second quarter around the Argus business. I think we feel good about where we’re going to be.
Scott G. Stephenson: One of the nice things going on at Argus is that we’re continuing to find a home in non-domestic markets for our method, which is a real source of encouragement for us.
Andrew W. Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. So that business could be a little bit volatile quarter-to-quarters is what you’re saying?
Mark V. Anquillare: Just on this small fraction revenue, we typically do not view it as all that volatile and I respect the comment.
Andrew W. Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: So, a question for you on EagleView the – I wanted to – to check and see if the company was still on the same trajectory as what we had talked about, early on the year when it has first been announced, and we’ve been looking for revenue about $140 million in 2014 EBITDA running about $45 million, and then growing I’d say, 10% to 2015 to about $154 million in revenue with $5 million to $7 million in cost synergies getting to around $54 million in EBITDA. And I want to see if those – if the company was still on that trajectory.
Mark V. Anquillare: Well, we see the company as fundamentally the same company that we’ve – we’ve always thought that it was we’re not actually updating EagleView financials right now Bill, we will do that once we’ve closed on the transaction we’ll come back to you but, we’re not updating you at the moment
William A. Warmington – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Okay.
Mark V. Anquillare: But it’s the – it’s the same – it’s the same company competitively positioned and enjoying good success in its markets.
William A. Warmington – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Then on the healthcare side, I want to ask about if there was anything you can do to talk about on that pool data initiative.
Mark V. Anquillare: Not really, I mean we – there is one – there is one company that is – is very large and it’s very interested in coming in and the building of the contributory data set is this is how it works, it’s just kind of three yards and a cloud of dust, but every still often you sort of breakthrough and so we’re – we’re hopeful that the one that I’m referencing here, where we actually have – contract papers in their hands will haven’t sooner, rather than later.
William A. Warmington – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Well, thank you very much.
Mark V. Anquillare: You’re welcome.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Montgomery.
Joseph D. Foresi – Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: 
 :
 :
Scott G. Stephenson: Yeah, there is – there is definitely a relationship, I think your word dependent is a little bit strong because as is true of almost everything that we do in healthcare, part of our opportunity is defined by the fact that we are relative newcomer and so, we haven’t really become the category leader in, I would say, almost anything that we do. And so, part of our opportunity is based upon taking our position inside of these markets. But, yes, one of the confidence points for us on Medicare Advantage, the part of our business which faces Medicare Advantage is that on balance we think that the long-term trends are good. If you just look at demography in the United States and you look at the continued relative popularity of Medicare Advantage, we think those are positive factors as it relates to the long-term for our healthcare business.
Joseph D. Foresi – Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Okay. And what percentage of healthcare now is Medicare Advantage or the work you do there? And then just adjacent to that. You said your visibility has improved. Can we assume that visibility in that business will always pickup, maybe here going forward? I actually think about that in general.
Scott G. Stephenson: So we put out in the past that our Medicare Advantage business is more than 50% our total mix of business in the healthcare space today.
Joseph D. Foresi – Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: And then, just on the visibility side of things. Should we always expect that midyear it will dramatically increase? I mean just from a seasonal pattern, how should we think about that?
Scott G. Stephenson: There definitely is seasonality, particularly as it relates to the Medicare Advantage business. And something that we put out in the past is that overall our total healthcare business is about 40% in the first half, 60% in the second half as a rough general guideline. Without question our visibility with respect to the part of the business that is seasonal increases as we move through the year. But part of what we’ve been trying to stress in this call is that because of the substantial ramp in the overall volumes we have in the part of our business which is transactional, especially the Medicare Advantage business, we have been very diligent in the first of half of 2014 in trying to tune operations, anticipate the second half surge, if I can call it that, and to observe on where we need to be. So, yes, there is more visibility, but the other part of the equation is preparedness and our team – I’m very proud of our team. They’ve worked very hard to get prepared for, to deliver against the successful selling that they’ve been doing. And so, we feel good.
Joseph D. Foresi – Janney Montgomery Scott LLC:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.
Anjaneya Singh – Credit Suisse: Hello. This is Anj Singh dialing-in for Hamza Mazari. I’m wondering if we can get an update on your joint demand planning discussions with your healthcare customers and what progress you might have made their during the quarter?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, that’s really what we’ve been reporting on throughout here, I mean our ability to as we mentioned a few minutes ago, the ability to retrieve over 50% more volumes in the same time prior period is directly a function of the coordinating that we have been doing with our customers, as well as our strong sense what the volumes will be in the second half, and so that’s all the product of that of the demand planning, I was actually speaking with the head of our healthcare unit yesterday, and she was in touch with one of our important customer, they’re all important to us. But one of our large customers and it was just more of the same dialog that we're in with our customers in terms of where they're at, what they need. Believe me, there are a lot of operational metrics that get shared back and forth on a very consistent basis and it is that tied in quality us to them and then to us that really characterizes the way we're going about this business.
Anjaneya Singh – Credit Suisse: Got it, and then as we look at your international growth initiative, I’m wondering what are the milestones we should be looking for and as we think about M&A internationally, are there verticals that you prefer to grow organically versus an equivalent basis or will you just be opportunistic and pursue whichever strategy makes more sense?
Scott G. Stephenson: It’s definitely, our M&A agenda is definitely not characterized primarily by opportunism, we have got very hard about which verticals we are in, and our first preference always would be to build out from the verticals that we’ve already established, and so the reference earlier the international market is that’s exactly what that’s about, it’s trying to find ways to take our existing capabilities and as they can relevant in other markets. It’s just a comment which I know many of you have heard us say before, but I think our methods if you think of it as the algorithms and the methods by which we operate the algorithms, I think they're completely applicable by and large in other markets. The issue is that other economy is don’t have the same tradition of data aggregation that we have in the United States. And so, a lot of what actually governs the rate at which we can move out as our ability to begin to cause data sets to flow. We're very open to using our M&A dollars in international markets, but I think you're putting two things together that kind of don't go together in our minds. We will use M&A dollars for international expansion and that’s definitely a part of our thinking, that doesn’t necessarily imply that we were moving into new verticals. I think that it’s our view, generally would be that by and large the set of verticals we are serving is a very adequate playing field for us. There are – there is I don’t want to say too much about it, but there are, there is one vertical which is sort of adjacent to the ones we already in and there may be a linkage there at some point I really wouldn’t want to disclose too much that lower. Thinking that right at the moment, but because I would – I am mentioning that because I wouldn’t want, anybody to be surprised, if it were the case in the future that we did, open up another vertical, but we – for a long time now we said that we are not looking to sort of add verticals without constrain, we are very thoughtful about what verticals we are in and I think we have a good set of verticals.
Anjaneya Singh – Credit Suisse: Very helpful. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson: Welcome.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Danny Caliendo with Morgan Stanley
Danny Caliendo – Morgan Stanley: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question, I want to delve into expenses a little bit, they didn’t jump as much quarter-over-quarter this year, as they have in the past especially on the SG&A line, and looking at the Q, and there is some of the salaries actually went down in the quarter there? So, maybe if you can just give a little color on your expense control on SG&A? Is it something why may be the bonus is very low, but lower, what is there anything else going on there or maybe your down facto the sales force and focusing more on kind of improving the operational efficiency, let me try to color on the expense curve.
Scott G. Stephenson: Sure, I think there s I’ll let Mark, answer that but I’ll just say there’s been absolutely no layoffs, we are on the expense then a number of parts of our business, so that’s sort of the furthest thing from the reality of our business. But Mark do you want to take on this SG&A account.
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure, I think there is couple of things that we continue to do as we tried to fine tune all of our competition plant and in April we give out our Equity words, so one of the things typically affects is obviously you have an increase in equity that that will make the normal increase, I think what you will also find out is, in our program if your age 62 or alter you what make the best and I think we have fewer people in that bracket, or in that kind of category for 2014. So I don’t think we have that accelerated best in accelerated best that, would have historically taken place in the April timeframe so that may contribute a little bit to the SG&A item that you referred to. The only other thing that, does come to mind is we think about overall the compensation plans, I think we at Verisk probably have been a little bit more focused in 2014 on variable comp that would be in the form of our short-term cash programs as well as long-term equity programs and probably had a little bit less in the form of salary increases. So if you’re repositioning, although, the overall comp increases were at least as good as in the past, but the way we went about it is probably slightly different this year.
Danny Caliendo – Morgan Stanley:  One more on the CapEx. Historically you were at the low 5%. Now you’re kind of moving more towards this 9% of revenues number and you mentioned that you were spending more on capitalizing software.
Scott G. Stephenson: Right.
Danny Caliendo – Morgan Stanley: Is there anything one-time in this number or is this just for the next two years or is this 9% number really where you guys are going to be over the next few years? Maybe you’re churning more into a software company than you were in the past or how should we think about the CapEx over time?
Scott G. Stephenson: So we don’t think of 9% as the benchmark. We expect that number to come down as we move into 2015 and beyond. But it is also true that in general relative to, let’s say, five years ago, just to pick a reference point, the software intensity of the business have gone up. I referenced, for example, earlier Touchstone, which is a very major movement inside of the whole cat modeling world and that’s just a category of spending, which is tended to be much lower in the past. I would also say that because of the desire to bring out these solutions in general across many of our businesses, we find are still spending somewhat more on the internal development of solutions, which we capitalized. There have been a couple of things, which I think have been a little bit more one-time. We’ve basically been consolidating down to data centers and all of that, has required some special attention at the moment in time. And we built a major new facility now in Salt Lake City. In that we’re cycling through that in 2014. So, some of those things are going to kind of naturally come down any way. And then, I think as our businesses scale, I think we’ll naturally find that that ratio moderates as well. So 9% is not the benchmark, but it is also the case actually that our business. If you want to be solutions oriented and if you want to be growth oriented, as we do, I think a natural implication is that you become somewhat more capital intense and we have.
Danny Caliendo – Morgan Stanley: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, lastly, just a quick one. Going back to the insurance, you mentioned that the transactional revenue and you kind of indicated that the cat modeling were the big part of that, which you result in this particular quarter. I think you said something that would have been 11% without the cat impact. Number one, is that right? And then number two, just so we can kind of be aware of this in future quarters. With this cat transactional revenue, is it cat as the number of deals, maybe the face value on the deals or maybe the number of terms looking at the deals? Maybe a little color on how to think about predicting when a particular quarter might have higher or lower cat.
Scott G. Stephenson:  Yes, that’s a little – your question sort of ended in sort of a funny place, because prediction is a little bit difficult. And I know you are using shorthand when you’re saying cat, but just to remind you it’s cat bonds. And so, its investors are anticipating that there is something in the market that would allow them to make a return based upon – in essence betting on the frequency and the depth of catastrophe activity, but we’re talking about the investing in the bonds. And the bond volumes tend to be a functional of a couple of things. One is, probably some very general sense of the intensity of catastrophe activity in the economy globally, but also a sense of different ways that you can lay off catastrophe risks. So how active is the reinsurance market with respect to ensuring against cat risk et cetera. So there’s a number of factors that are actually in there. The market over time has tended to grow, but it also has tended to cycle around a little bit. Mark, I don’t really have a predictive metric in mind. I don’t know if you do.
Mark V. Anquillare:  No. I just will reiterate what I said, Danny. The growth in DA insurance is greater than 10% excluding the cat bonds and the way those cat bonds are priced to be exact. It’s about the size of the deal and obviously that the number of deals that happen.
Danny Caliendo – Morgan Stanley: Okay. That’s helpful. I guess my question was more about how the revenue hit, not necessarily the size of the cat bond market, but how did revenue actually hit your insurance plan? So I guess your answer to that is that if we’re looking on cat bond issuance in a particular quarter, we would want to focus on the number of deals and the size of deals and then it could be taken by 3% impact to growth into this year versus the last quarter.
Eva F. Huston: Hey, Danny, it’s Eva. Thank you very much. I think we got four questions in the set. So we’re going to move on.
Danny Caliendo – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thanks.
Eva F. Huston: Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.
Paul Ginocchio – Deutsche Bank: Thanks for the confidence around healthcare and talking about the increase you pulled for. It do sounds like it’s more than 50% of your business. Can you just talk about the remaining parts of your business in healthcare, the kind of visibility you have there? And how you feel about that going to the third quarter? Anything you can give us to kind of help us feel more confident in that backend growth rate would be helpful. Thank you.
Scott G. Stephenson:  So I think most folks know that – so as we’ve talking about Medicare Advantage that’s really about our RQID division. We have two others. One is enterprise analytics and the other is payment accuracy. Payment accuracy is about diligence and claims to get fraud, waste, and abuse out of them and enterprise analytics is essentially about risk adjusting and including applications of risk adjusting into categories like population health management. So those other businesses are very important in the mix of what it is that we do. And we’re looking for really growth across the board in the business. I would say that kind of recently payment accuracy has had some nice win in the sales in terms of growth. Payment accuracy tends to have more of a transactional nature to it. Essentially our revenue is related to the amount of money that we thrift for our customers. Enterprise analytics tends to be very subscription oriented.
Paul Ginocchio – Deutsche Bank: I don’t know if you’ll give the same. But are those divisions with any healthcare growing at sort of a divisional average in the second quarter or was all the growth driven by Medicare Advantage?
Scott G. Stephenson: So I’m not going to get into specifics, but they’re growing. Yes.
Paul Ginocchio – Deutsche Bank: Great. Obviously those are a little more transactional basis. Is Analytics more subscription?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes, that’s what I said.
Paul Ginocchio – Deutsche Bank: Right. Great. Thank you.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.
Jeffrey M. Silber – BMO Capital Markets Corp.:  Thanks so much. Just wanted to go back to the EBC transaction. I think initially you had expected the deal to close in July than mid-Q3 now. It’s the end of 3Q. Are there any specific reasons for the delay?
Scott G. Stephenson: It’s the government’s process. I mean, we’re answering questions and we respect our government and they’re going to run their process the way they’re going to run it.
Jeffrey M. Silber – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. And it’s just a follow-up. Just going back to some, I guess the front loading cost in Verisk Health, would that been in the cost of services line as opposed to the SG&A line?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes.
Jeffrey M. Silber – BMO Capital Markets Corp.: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andre Benjamin with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Andre Benjamin – Goldman Sachs Group Inc.:  Hi. Good morning. First, I want to know understanding that a lot of the business is subscription base. I was wondering if you’re seeing any changes to demand trends in Argus’ services from a push by some of the banks to get more aggressive lending to some less optimal or “subprime lenders” as the recovery matures.
Scott G. Stephenson: No, I don’t see that as a factor.
Andre Benjamin – Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay and on the healthcare side I am wondering in terms of how us think about the size of the addressable market and growth and I know these things don’t change that much quarter-to-quarter, but if you have any thoughts on how those sides in the market is relative to the $4 billion that you discussed at the Analyst Day, how the three markets are growing, and are there any key capabilities that come up in your conversation with clients that you think will help you better attack those buckets relative to what you are capable of today.
Mark V. Anquillare: Well, yeah so our view of the opportunity really have not change as kind of implied in your question. Healthcare continues to be a very large part of the American economy and in general, it is an environment that is characterized by I would say an increasing interest in the use of data analytics to make decisions. Supported in, I would say in a background kind of a way by our government’s seeming interest in pulling more data analytics and to the part of the cost tax of government is responsible for and by making data sets from CMS a little bit more available. So, that kind of the overall sense of the market is that it remains as the opportunists as it has one of the big sort of issues on the horizon is, will the providers become more risk bearing and there is a lot more talk about that and then there is actually progress to-date if not that there has been none and there are more accountable care organizations than they are used to be, but when you look at the fraction of the risk which has been warned by the providers it still relatively low. Another movement in the space that you got the rise of the exchanges there are the public exchangers there are also the private exchanges and we’ve actually had some nice progress in terms of becoming the analytic inside of some of the exchangers. We actually see the exchanges as another customer segment in the same way that commercial payers or a customer segment in the way that state medicates our customer segment etc. So you have those kinds of developments in the market. But the overall story is the effective reform is to have more people be insured and since the majority of our business is with insurers today on balance that is a relatively positive trend.
Andre Benjamin – Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Thanks.
Eva F. Huston: Operator, last question please.
Operator: Our last question will come from the line of David Togut with Evercore.
David Togut – Evercore Partners: Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a quick final question if I would, Scott and Mark. I’m trying to piece together your comments, Mark, that you saw over 50% growth and records retrieved in the RQI business, and that you’re expecting 20% plus growth in healthcare in the back half. Can you sort of correlate records retrieved with revenue growth? It doesn’t really seem to be one-to-one. Is there is a ratio we should be thinking of?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, one thing you should bear in mind. I know Mark is going to jump in at a slightly more technical level, but bear in mind that the record retrieval that we’re talking about relates to only part of our business. So that characterization of a much greater rate of record retrieval is very accurate and augurs for growth in the third and the fourth quarter, but you can’t do it one-for-one in terms of the growth of our overall healthcare business because those records and that retrieval relates to the part of our business, which is Medicare Advantage, which is we said is greater than 50%, but it’s well shy of 100% of our whole mix. So, you can’t complete those two.
Mark V. Anquillare: And, David, I’ll just kind of reiterate what I was trying to describe earlier in terms of follow-on. I think we feel good about the increased volumes. I think it’s indicative of a combination of: a, our customers and working with our customers to get things sooner and also it’s partially indicative of the fact that we do had greater volumes apples-to-apples compared to last year. So, I can’t tell you there is a direct correlation to revenue there, but it’s certainly a partial correlation. And I think it’s a set of good example set aside of several things that we’re doing to make sure that we deliver on the results in the second half.
David Togut – Evercore Partners: Is Medicare Advantage all of the RQI business?
Mark V. Anquillare: Not all of it, but most of it.
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes, yes.
David Togut – Evercore Partners:
 :
Scott G. Stephenson: Not sure we said that, David.
David Togut – Evercore Partners: Okay. That’s just my interpretation. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions. [Presenters] (ph), do you have any closing remarks?
Scott G. Stephenson: It’s Scott here and I just would like to thank everybody for joining us for this earning call and for your continued interest in our company. I know that Eva and team will be following up with several of you and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thanks for your time.
Operator: And this does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics First Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva F. Huston: Thank you, Shirley. And good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2014 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. All numbers we discuss today, unless stated otherwise, will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx, our mortgage services business which we sold in March. Interthinx is classified as discontinued operations in this quarter and previous periods. In our 10-Q filing, revenue is reported from continuing operations only, but EBITDA is shown including Interthinx and the related gain on sale, per the SEC requirement. In our press release, we report EBITDA from continuing operations to assist you in your analysis. As you will recall, last quarter, we included in the back of our press release a reconciliation of continuing operations to the total, as well as the quarterly detail for 2012 and 2013 excluding Interthinx. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until May 29, 2014, on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in yesterday's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you, Eva. And good morning, everybody. Our first quarter revenue growth was good, driven by very strong performance in our insurance units. Our innovation and analytic agenda is active in all of our verticals, and I'm very confident it will lead to new solutions for our customers and that these investments will deliver good returns over time. You can see some impacts of these investments in our margins this quarter, although our margins continue to place Verisk in an elite group of companies. We consider our organic growth rate to be the single best measure of our vitality as an organization. Over the course of the last couple of years, we have improved our mix of assets and supported continued organic growth. In particular, we divested our mortgage services assets and acquired Argus, shifting our focus from the challenged mortgage market to the expanding global payments market. In addition, we have added health care assets that align with the fundamental trend toward improved efficiency in health care spend in both the government and private markets. We remain focused on making sure our health care business delivers excellence. In February, we successfully concluded the Medicare Advantage review season. Ensuring we deliver the results our customers expected in the form of reimbursement from Medicare came with a cost to Verisk, which you see in the margins for the quarter. We did the right thing for our customers in the fourth and first quarters and believe our relationships with them are stronger for the effort. We continue to make progress in demand planning with our health care customers and we are reassured by these positive customer interactions, and continue to expect mid-teens revenue growth for the full year of 2014. On the inorganic side, we remain excited about the opportunity to add EagleView Technologies, or EVT, to our existing solution sets. We are also active in evaluating additional opportunities to align with our strategic vision and focus on strong organic growth over time. We continue to run the business with a long-term focus while remaining aware of the need to execute everyday. The data and analytic mindset informs our strategic thinking, as well as our approach to solving the immediate challenges our customers face. Our approach to managing the business is well aligned with our innovation agenda, as innovation works in long cycles. We will continue to invest prudently in order to drive both top line and free cash flow growth over time. Our twin goals of organic growth through innovation and operating with efficiency remain key focal points for the entire Verisk management team. As you know, on January 14, we announced the signing of an agreement to acquire EVT, who are a leader in imagery analytics and they offer solutions in the property and casualty, contractor, government and commercial spaces. On March 28, we received a request for additional information from the FTC. We are responding to the second request and currently expect to close our acquisition during the third quarter of 2014. As we've stated, our strategy is to allocate capital to the highest-return opportunities for shareholders, and EVT is one of those opportunities. The business has grown strongly, leveraging the foundation of the government and municipality business into new markets in insurance and other commercial sectors. And we have significant opportunity to continue to grow the business both in the United States and, over time, internationally. We continue to evaluate additional M&A opportunities, as we remain focused on our core principle of creating shareholder value through innovation, discipline and execution. We have capacity for additional acquisitions that meet our strategic agenda. We also have continued to repurchase our stock, a sign of our confidence in the future and in our capital capacity. We talked to you last quarter about the number of ideas coming forward from our business units for creating new solutions and enhancing existing ones. These initiatives are moving forward and we continue to maintain strong margins while doing so. We also continue to spend to ensure that our current solutions remain excellent, including re-platforming initiatives in areas such as catastrophe modeling, repair cost estimating, P&C underwriting and health care. We still expect margins to be flattish for the year, with strength building in the second half, as is typical. In the first quarter of 2014, we delivered good overall performance, with total organic revenue growth of about 9% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 6%. EBITDA margin from continuing operations was about 45% in the quarter. We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. As I mentioned earlier, we remain active in looking at M&A. We continue to focus on assets with a strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth. In the quarter, we returned capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases of about $89 million. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was about $77 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy, as previously outlined. And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare: Thanks, Scott. In the first quarter, total revenue grew 8.7%. For the first quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 10.4% revenue growth. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in financial services and insurance. Our Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 11.8% in the first quarter. The increase was driven by strong growth in loss quantification and catastrophe modeling solutions. Underwriting growth in the quarter was good, and claims solutions also contributed. Overall revenue growth was driven by increased adoption of the existing and new solutions. In financial services, we were pleased to see growth of 21.6% in the quarter. The growth outlook at Argus remains positive, including through international expansion, additional penetration of existing customers and partnering opportunities, in particular related to advertising effectiveness with traditional and new media companies. We continue to expect financial services to grow at least mid-teens in 2014. In the health care vertical, revenue in the first quarter grew 8.2%, an acceleration versus last quarter led by growth in Medicare Advantage-related solutions. As you know, there's some seasonality in the business relates -- which relates to the second-half review season for Medicare Advantage plans. So looking at half years when comparing to the prior year is generally more relevant than comparisons on a per-quarter basis. As we discussed with you last quarter and at Investor Day, the 2013 Medicare Advantage season ran through February of 2014, so some of the challenges we faced in late 2013 continued into the first quarter and impacted margins. We continue to work with our customers to jointly improve demand planning and expect an improvement in 2014. We still expect the category to see mid-teens revenue growth in the full year 2014. In the specialized markets category, revenue declined 1% in the first quarter. Good growth in the quarter in environmental health and safety and commercial weather and climate analytics were more than offset by lower activity related to government sector customers. Turning to Risk Assessment. For the first quarter, we reported revenue growth of 6.4%, indicating the value to our longstanding insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew revenue 6.3% in the quarter. This reflects our 2014 invoices which were effective January 1. In addition, we saw a contribution to growth from newly adopted solutions such as predictive modeling, electronic rating content and workers' comp solutions. We also had an above-average amount of transaction revenue in the quarter, which we would expect not to recur at the same level for the rest of the year. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 6.5% in the quarter. This increase was in the form of new sales, including those resulting in higher committed volumes and contracts transitioning transactional revenue to higher, longer-term subscription-type commitments. EBITDA from continuing operations for the first quarter increased 3.5% to $182.8 million, and our EBITDA margin from continuing operations was 44.6%. There was some carryover spending in the first quarter related to Medicare Advantage busy season, which ran through mid-February. This is a continuation of the additional spending to deliver for our customers that we had discussed with you last quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to work to execute on our demand-planning initiatives with our customers. The margins in Decision Analytics were 36.2% in the first quarter of 2014 versus 40.4% in the first quarter of 2013. The lower margin was primarily the result of increased costs in our health care business, as well as some investments to support our innovation agenda, partially offset by revenue growth in the segment. As Scott mentioned, costs in our health care segment allowed us to meet customer needs in the short term while building long-term relationship success as we work to scale our operations. In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 57.5% versus 56.4% in the first quarter of 2013. Our margins were advanced in the quarter by revenue growth, good expense management and lower pension costs. Our interest expense was down $2.7 million in the first quarter versus the respective period in 2013 due to lower debt balances as a result of repayments made in 2013. As we discussed last quarter, we anticipate using our revolver and cash on hand, as well as proceeds from the sale of Interthinx, to fund the purchase of EVT. Reported effective tax rate was 35.7% for the quarter. The lower-than-expected tax rate was primarily due to a favorable state legislative change. Adjusted net income increased 3.6% to $93.3 million in the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 5.8%. The average diluted share count was 170.4 million shares in the quarter. On March 31, 2014, our diluted share count was 169.8 million shares. In the quarter, we repurchased about 1.4 million shares for $88.7 million. At quarter end, we had about $76.5 million under our authorization left. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of about 20%. For 2014, we continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution. Turning to our balance sheet. As of March 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents were $427.4 million as a result of our seasonally strong first quarter cash flow, as well as proceeds from the sale of our mortgage services business. Total debt, both short term and long term, was about $1.3 billion. Today, our incremental debt capacity is about $1 billion and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Our debt-to-pro forma EBITDA from continuing operations as of March 31 was 1.7x, below our steady-state target. With the acquisition of EVT and sale of Interthinx, we anticipate our leverage will rise to 2x at the close of the transaction. Free cash flow, adjusted for 2 items that I'll discuss in a moment, grew 6.8% compared with the prior period to $212.9 million. This represented over 100% of EBITDA from continuing operations in the first 3 months of 2014 due, in part, to the typical prepayment for some of our solutions. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. To facilitate comparability to the prior period, we adjusted free cash flow to the timing of excess tax benefits from exercised stock options in the first quarter of 2013, and for the sale of our mortgage services business this year. Cash provided by operating activities, as reported, increased $41.6 million. This increase was the result of a $6.3 million increase generated by improved profitability of the business, a $2.7 million decrease in interest paid due to lower debt balances, a decrease of $33.7 million in taxes and $13.4 million from working capital and other balance sheet changes. This was partially offset by other outflows of about $14.5 million. Our capital expenditures were 8.6% of revenue year-to-date 2014. We continue to expect about $147 million in CapEx for the full year. A greater use of capitalized software related to new solutions will modestly raise the capital intensity of our business when compared to historic levels, although capital expenditures in 2014 are expected to be lower than 2013. We aim to grow free cash flow at or above the level of our EBITDA growth. As you think about your models for the full year 2014, we expect flattish margins for the full year, excluding Interthinx. You should expect to see that margin building in the second half of the year. As we remain focused on our innovation agenda, we are maintaining our longer-term view of margins in the 45% to 47% range. Amortization of intangibles is expected to be about $57 million, fixed asset amortization and depreciation of about $75 million to $80 million and an effective tax rate between 37.5% and 38%. We aim to keep share count flat through our share repurchase program. At our current level of debt, our quarterly interest expense is about $18 million. Based upon the strength of our cash flow generation and the divestiture and the resulting cash balances, we anticipate borrowing $300 million or less for the acquisition of EVT, depending on timing of the close and other events. After the close of the EVT transaction, we will update you. Overall, we are pleased to report that our business is performing well. We have a nice mix of growth across multiple verticals, and we continue to invest with discipline for the future to continue strong organic growth. I will turn the call back to Eva for a comment before Q&A.
Eva F. Huston: Thanks, Mark. We appreciate all the interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Suzi Stein from Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Could you just help us understand how sustainable the acceleration of revenue growth in the insurance portion of Decision Analytics is? I mean how much of that is transaction versus subscription? And would you expect the level of growth, which had been quite a bit slower the last -- last 2 quarters, to stay at the double-digit rate that it's at this quarter?
Mark V. Anquillare: Suzi, this is Mark. I think we feel pretty positive about the insurance segment. I'll call out a few things. First of all, there's pretty good stability inside the industry-standard programs. We did have a little bit of a transactional blip, not significant, but that would probably not recur in the second quarter and beyond. But to further your point, our repair cost estimating, loss quantification and the catastrophe models, those businesses are performing very nicely. We see good activity. And to kind of follow up on your question, these are subscription-type of businesses where people prepay for a year or more of service, so not a lot of transactional volume related to that. And that's about wins. That's about new products. It's reasonably strong across the board.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then can you help us maybe with what you're doing with share repurchases? It looks like this year -- that at the pace you are going now, share repurchases will be finished, based on the authorization, maybe this quarter. But -- so does the EVT deal impact your view on how aggressive you'll be with that?
Scott G. Stephenson: Not really. I mean, we have confidence -- this is Scott. We have confidence that we will complete the EVT transaction. And so we've already factored that into our thought process. And we continue to believe that the share repurchase program is a very reasonable use of capital. And we talked to you about what our authorizations are. We're always taking account of the facts on the ground, but no, I think we've -- we already know where we're at with respect to EVT. And we will continue to manage the share repurchase program with the same goal as we've always had, which is at least to limit dilution and opportunistically, to go beyond that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little more on the Medicare Advantage inside of health care? And you talked about demand planning. Can you get clients to do this earlier in the year? And I guess, what's been the holdback from them? I guess, just any more color on how you're going to change that process and, perhaps associated with that, automate any additional parts of the process to improve the efficiency.
Scott G. Stephenson: Tim, it's Scott here. So to your basic question, yes. Actually, we do believe and we are engaged in exactly this, which is trying to be more -- for there to be more clarity and transparency in our relationship with our major customers on the Medicare Advantage side. And what helps us in that is that they actually have incentives to get to exactly the same place, because they have so much at stake in getting all of this right. They really want to know that they're important vendors. And I think that -- I know that we are an important vendor to an increasing number of players. They want to know that their important vendors are going to be there for delivery. And so as both Mark and I said earlier in our comments, one of the things that happened was we were really, really focused on making sure that delivery up to the moment that the process timed out on February 14 was really good so that our customers got the results that they wanted, and they did. And as a result of that, inside of these relationships, I think it's fair to say there is even more of a sense of confidence and mutual confidence. And I think that, that encourages the -- our customers to be more planful with us basically. It's good for all of us, them and us. So I think that we're in a situation where it makes sense, and our customers know that it makes sense.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And is this a -- you talked about margins still being flat for the year but building in the second half. I guess, is this the -- there's obviously a lot of factors, but how important is convincing clients to do this and to you actually achieving that and those better margins in the second half of the year? It would appear like this is one of the big swing factors to getting margins back.
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, I think you may be tying together 2 things there a little too tightly, Tim. So first of all, yes, I mean we're focused on growing the business and working very hard at that. And obviously, there's a relationship between top line growth and the bottom line. But as it relates to sort of the ebb and flow of our margins, if you look at us through time, we've typically been a back-half kind of a company for quite a few reasons. Some of it relates to seasonality. Some of it relates to the fact that we take a little bit of a step up, usually in the second quarter, with respect to our people costs. And so there's actually a lot of factors in there. And I actually -- it sounded like what you were trying to do was sort of tightly link those 2 observations. I think that's a little too tight. There's a lot of things that go on that describe our margin profile.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So just on the health care side, real quickly, the additional costs this quarter in health care, was that more than what you had initially expected? I know you talked about it last quarter. I was just curious if that came in more than maybe what you had initially planned. And is basically the lack of that investment a big driver in terms of the second-half margin improvement?
Scott G. Stephenson: I would not describe us as surprised by what happened. I mean there's a process that we're working through with our customers that plays out over a long period of time. And the fourth quarter of 2013 -- the fourth quarter of any year and the first quarter of the following year are both sort of peak moments inside of this [indiscernible]. We were executing in the fourth quarter and we knew where things were. And so no, I would not describe it as a surprise.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And I guess, just on the margin front, like is that -- is basically the lack of an investment a big driver in terms of -- a big component at least in terms of the margin improvement you're expecting in the second half?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, same answer that I just gave Tim, which is there is the -- there is some seasonality inside of health care, and that is a contributing factor. But there are a -- I mean we in general have seen higher margins in the back half of the year for a whole variety of reasons.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Again, can you give any color on that request by the FTC on EVT? I know you said you responded, but anything else you can add there?
Scott G. Stephenson: No. We're at work.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: I guess I want to ask the health care question a little bit differently, Scott. I mean recognizing that every Medicare Advantage season seems a little different and you guys are kind of learning as you go along here in this business, what gives you confidence that you can ultimately scale those customer costs? Are we looking at something that's structural, recognizing there's seasonality? Or is this -- do you get better every year, you go through the process? Do you get more efficient? What -- how do we think about that longer-term in terms of being able to scale what is still a really big piece of your health care business?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes, so there's really 2 parts to it. One is the synchronization of our capacity with our customer's actual demand. And I'll just highlight that it's a little hard for them to know sometimes also, actually, so -- but we do have opportunities to do a better job of that in close collaboration with our customers. And we've already spoken about that. Secondly, there are opportunities to try to automate certain elements of the process overall. And we're certainly at work at those as well. So it will really be a combination of both of those.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And switching gears a little bit to Argus. Mark, one of the things I think you called out when you were going through the drivers is international expansion. How much of that business is rest of world now? And what are the relative growth rates when you look at the 20%-plus organic you put up this quarter?
Mark V. Anquillare: So the Argus business, I think we've always described a couple different ways they grow. And part of it, they do what are kind of like industry-standard study inside of either the card space or the debit card space. And we've talked about taking that platform and extending it into other geographies. About 30% of the business is that international flavor. And we think we can kind of move out into a couple other regions, and we see promise there. With that industry-standard study, I'll refer to it as that, there's been solutions in specialized products that come with that because people want to dig deeper. So that's the second act inside of a kind of a new country or a new set of customers in a different geography. Separately, as we talk about growth, we've talked about things that have been very positive around kind of advertising effectiveness. And with partners, we've started to make some nice progress there to kind of work on the side of kind of more traditional advertising and then kind of the newer-way media. So those have been kind of ways we've grown. And I think we've talked about at least mid-teens growth there. And that's a promising kind of third act inside of what we think is a very, very great business model that Argus has.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler from Baird.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: On the DA margins, can you just help give us order of magnitude of how much of the year-over-year contraction is due to the Medicare Advantage side of things and how much of it's due to the investments in the innovation agenda?
Mark V. Anquillare: So I would -- let me try to parse it a little bit. I think Scott has kind of given a lot of this in broad terms. But some of the margin erosion that you're seeing from year to year, I would say more than half is health care related. And then I would say the other half is kind of that innovation agenda and scaling up so that we are able to continue to satisfy and grow our businesses more broadly across that DA segment. So a little more than half on health care, a little less than half on kind of that innovation and re-platforming agenda that we're on.
Jeffrey P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division: Okay. And then with the website relaunch, couldn't help but notice that it seems like you're featuring retail as a market more prominently. Can you just talk about the go-to-market there, how tailored the solutions are and if it's repurposing existing capabilities and data assets or if at some point you may need to do something from the acquisition standpoint to move more aggressively into that market?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, maybe your -- taking your question back to front. We do think there are some interesting assets out there with respect to retail. And maybe just a word on why retail, why interest in retail. Our method, the kind of what we do works best when we are inside of large markets that have a relatively large number of players that are relatively homogeneous with respect to the way they operate and the problems they confront. And all of those statements apply to retail. So that's the fundamental basis for interest. We're already in the retail business. We already serve retailers. And most of the -- sort of the energy that you're picking up from us is our interest in trying to find a way to essentially deepen the analytics that retailers make use of as they try to run their businesses, to move from something which is more sort of kind of elegant reporting about what's going on to something that we're really making kind of more forward-looking statements. And that's really the Verisk way. That's what we do, is we capture more data, we deepen the analytics and we move towards forward-looking statements for our customers. And that's -- and we're just on the march in that way inside of retail. So that's the energy that you're picking up from us on that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Wells Fargo.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: So back in March, CoreLogic acquired Marshall Swift/Boeckh. And I wanted to ask whether that changes the competitive landscape for that piece of the business. With MSB with about 80% of underwriting and Xactware with about 80% of claims, what happens next?
Scott G. Stephenson: So yes, thanks for the question, Bill. First of all, I just -- without getting highly specific, I think the way that you sort of laid it out there on sort of the relativities on claims and underwriting, not really quite where we see it, first of all, just you so you know. I'll also just say kind of at a high level and then I'll kind of get a little bit more specific. At a high level, that we actually think the privileged position in all of this work is actually being deeply into the claims process because that's the -- there, you observe the literal facts of loss. And having a genuine understanding of loss is very, very important to making statements about potential future loss, which is part of the underwriting process. So we just have a view of the integration of those 2 businesses, the way they work together, and a view of kind of where's the highest and driest and strongest place to stand in order to create value for customers. So that, by way of context. We really think that our case in this category is -- it's really on us. In other words, we feel like we have great relationships with our customers and all the scope in the world to bring more value to them. And we feel like we have their full attention. And basically, therefore, it's up to us to be innovative and to be meeting their every need as they try to apply our tools. But we don't walk around feeling like the sort of the cap or the constraint on our growth opportunity is a competitive one. It's really on us and it's really a function of how well we execute our innovation agenda.
William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then is international expansion an opportunity that you think about for that business line?
Scott G. Stephenson: Very definitely. And back to the earlier comments, especially in the whole area of estimatics, replacement and repair cost estimating, amplified by aerial imagery and all of the analytics around that, which fundamentally have the effect of creating more automation inside of all of that. That whole combination feels to us like a business which has as much global potential as any that we've got inside of the company.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Mark, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the RA industry standards growth rate and getting it influenced by above-average transactional revenues. I still would guess that even when you take that out, this would be a year of acceleration for RA industry-standard growth. And the thinking there would be while it's not a one-to-one relationship, I do assume that the 2012 acceleration that -- within premiums does inform 2014 RA growth rates. Is that still a fair way to think about it when you take out the above-average transactional revenue growth that you were trying to call out for the first quarter?
Mark V. Anquillare: Thanks for the question, Bill...
Scott G. Stephenson: Andrew...
Mark V. Anquillare: Andrew. I apologize. I just want to quickly just draw a distinction. I think we've always talked about kind of the value our customers see in the overall invoice. So certainly, premiums factor into it. I don't think 2014, which relates to 2012 premiums, was the foundation for kind of a more substantial increase. I think we've kind of tried to keep this consistent with the value our customers see. So the process, the approach remains unchanged. What I will kind of draw upon is I think the innovation agenda that we've been discussing here is not just a Decision Analytics agenda. It's also inside of Risk Assessment. So what we try to call out is the predictive modeling solutions that we've now kind of extended beyond personal auto, into homeowners, even the commercial lines, we're starting to gain some traction. We've tried to take some of our rating content and we have created what is a completely automated approach for insurers to bring that content through electronic rating content into their solutions. That has been meaningful. And finally, even inside of some of the workers' comp solutions that we're starting to put out on the market, we're finding traction. And that is contributing to that industry-standard program growth for the year. So some small but good signs of innovation on the Risk Assessment side, as well as Decision Analytics.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I didn't quite -- how much should we think of the kind of growth rate without the element that you tried to call out, the above-average transactional revenues in the first quarter?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes, Andrew, we're not going to get into that level of detail, I apologize. But I hope you appreciate that we feel that, short of that transactional type of onetimer in the first quarter, we would expect a kind of a continuation into the remainder of the year, as you see Risk Assessment.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.
Anjaneya Singh - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: This is Anj Singh dialing-in for Hamza. I was wondering if we could get an update on your M&A pipeline. Do you view the near- and mid-term pipeline as having more tuck-in acquisitions? Or is there a probability of larger ones like EagleView?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, maybe I can go back to sort of the principle that we're working on, which is that it all sort of flows from our strategy. So what we start with is a view of the verticals that we're serving and the mix of solutions that our customers are looking for. And fundamentally, the reason we engage in M&A is that if there are great solutions out there which we feel we can amplify by tying them into what we already do, and if they're -- and if that's positive for our customers, that's really why we're on the M&A agenda. So we're proceeding from really a market-driven, customer-driven view of what's needed and wanted and then how does our current portfolio stack up against that. So inside of that, we don't really start by filtering on size. I mean, even yesterday, we had a very deep session looking at a very large number of companies that are in our pipeline. And the filtering mechanism does not begin with size. It begins with relevance. And so there's an openness to what it is that makes sense. Having said that, one of the things that we have to give attention to is the integration of anything that we acquire. And so I would say that, all else equal, something which is a little bit smaller is a little bit easier to integrate. And so that's always running in the back of our minds, but again, the point of departure is where are we strategically in the market, what do our customers need. And really, size is -- size obviously gets consideration as we think about our capital structure and where we're at, at any given moment, but it's down the road in terms of the thought process.
Anjaneya Singh - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's helpful. And as a quick follow-up, are you still comfortable with the July closing that you'd outlined for EagleView?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, earlier in my comments, I said third quarter, and that's still where we are.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman from SIG.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: I'll just ask a couple upfront, if I could. The first one is, was there any weather, Scott, that you might call out in the first quarter results? The second one is, Mark, you had articulated some of the costs that seasonally recur in the second quarter. Maybe if you could refresh us on that. And then third, to go back to the health care question, Scott, did the first quarter results come in -- first of all, congratulations on the acceleration in health care. But I wanted to ask, did the first quarter results on the revenue come in consistent with your previously articulated expectation of mid-teens growth on the top line. So I know it's a lot upfront, but the first, on weather; the second, on costs; the third, on health.
Scott G. Stephenson: All right. I'll take the first and the third, and then if Mark can remember your second question, he'll address that one. So weather sort of is always in the mix of things that we're doing, but I would not call out weather as a -- as having particular explanatory power in terms of the first quarter, meaning there are always weather events, always. And sometimes, they fall in the first quarter, and sometimes, in the third quarter; some years, a little bit more, some years a little bit less. At any given moment, you can actually almost trace a line between events and claims volumes and how that relates to some of the things that we do by way of estimating. But overall, I would not call weather as something that really has much explanatory power as it relates to the quarter. And just more generally, there's just sort of the long sweep of kind of what the weather is doing. Actually, if you want to understand the impact of weather on the insurance business, for example, you actually have to look at 2 things. One is the nature of damage caused by weather, which to some extent -- meaning the intensity of the weather event itself, the intensity and frequency of the weather event itself. And there has been some trend towards increase. But what's actually even more important is the amount of insurable property and its proximity to where weather-driven events tend to occur. Then it's actually -- that actually has greater explanatory power. So for example, Americans' desire to live on the coast of Florida has a lot to do with the increase in hurricane losses through time, as well as what's happening with respect to hurricanes. So I hope that's clear. With respect to the health care question, no. I mean we feel very comfortable observing the first quarter and reaffirming we're expecting mid-teens. So Mark, maybe you want to take on the second question.
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure. Thanks. So second quarter, if you recall the way we manage our compensation at Verisk, second quarter is kind of the introduction of salary increases. So we kind of have across-the-enterprise performance reviews. And salary increases are effective with the beginning of 2Q. So that's an uptick from 1Q. What we also do kind of on April 1 is we provide and grant equity. That's both in the combination of options as well as restricted stock for our senior team, and that amount would also hit second quarter. Obviously, 4 years ago, grant would come off. There's a little bit of kind of ebbs and flows based upon an approach we have with PRH62 [ph]. You accelerate vest, but usually, that number is generally up a little bit, trends up. And the other thing that affects quarters is the nature of the health care business does have some seasonality, right? The second half is a little stronger than the first half. There's the Medicare Advantage plans kind of go through that review process we described. That runs through kind of Valentine's Day. So second quarter is a little bit of a trough, and there are some variable costs associated with that. So as a result, you would think of the costs being generally down or in line with kind of that top line. So those are the 3 things that kind of ebb and flow with regard to expenses in 2Q relative to 1Q.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Foresi from Janney Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: This is Jeff Rossetti on for Joe. Just if I could ask a question back on health care. I just wanted to see, as you target mid-teens growth, how do you expect some of the acceleration for revenue and quality versus population and payments?
Scott G. Stephenson: We need the whole suite to be performing in order to achieve our goals. And we -- if you -- when you look at the way that our performance builds, and we've had a chance to share this with folks in forums like Investor Day, the cross-selling of our full suite is a big, big focal point for us. And it goes in all directions, so an RQID customer adopting Payment Accuracy solutions or Payment Accuracy customers adopting Enterprise Analytics solutions, et cetera. All those connections are meaningful to us. And it's not that we focus on some and deemphasize others. They all matter.
Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: Okay. And just maybe a bit going back to you mentioned at the analyst day just those drivers. I think you'd called out coverage expansion. I just wanted to see if there was any updates on signings and the update on the product that was launched recently for ACOs with respect to your quality suite.
Scott G. Stephenson: I'm not quite sure I understand what you meant when you said coverage, but with respect to the ACO suite, we continue to make progress on that front. That's a very exciting part of our business. Those of you who are familiar with health care know that, that is a very sort of nascent and emergent part of the health care mix. But we -- one of the leading indicators to us, our relevance in the space, is our ability to do work with emerging ACOs. And we have a good team working on that. And so that's meaningful to us.
Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: I was just referring to -- on the other question on the exchanges, insurance exchanges, like meaning expansion of a potential...
Scott G. Stephenson: Oh, I understand. Yes, we consider -- yes, so we consider exchanges as essentially another segment of customers. And we're on that, as we are on the other segments.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.
Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Sorry to go back to health care, but your guidance for mid-teen growth in the unit implies some sizable acceleration from the 8-plus-percent growth you saw in the first quarter. Is that something we should expect to gradually see through the year? Or do you think you'll finish the year at much higher than the mid-teens rate in order to get there?
Mark V. Anquillare: Let me just come back to, I think, what we were trying to describe. I think we feel that from a capacity planning perspective, we're making good progress, and Scott highlighted this. But even with the way we think of our suites and our solutions, we are trending more towards focusing on the customer needs and what solutions plug in. We were running the business a little bit more around the various product sets. And now we're working more closely with what does the customer need. So it's a focus that is, I think, more directly attributable to customer, as opposed to product. Inside that, kind of across the board, the seasonal aspect of it is still that Medicare Advantage. So that does ramp the overall volumes towards the second half of the year. So just remember, it's a first half versus second half as we always described, the second half being more on the 60% and maybe 40% on the front. I would tell you, though, that the mean -- the quarters, from a growth perspective, I don't see them as meaningful. I think we are looking for, yes, a growth in the ramp from what is 8% up to mid-teens, and that should kind of be across the quarters.
Scott G. Stephenson: All right, just for absolute clarity, ramping in a way that the average for the whole year is mid-teens. So you're -- you've done the math correctly.
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes.
Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then just going back to the EVT acquisition, can you remind us what milestones are needed before closing? Are these things that you're going to be discussing publicly?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio.
Scott G. Stephenson: Sorry, ma'am, we just wanted to -- we wanted to answer that question. So the -- so EVT -- pardon me?
Unknown Executive: [indiscernible]
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. Principally, we -- what we're in is in the FTC review process. And we commented on the fact that we got the second request. And we're in that -- in the process of working through the second request right now, and that's pretty much it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio from Deutsche Bank.
Adrienne Colby - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: It's Adrienne calling in for Paul Ginocchio. I was wondering if you could comment on what the impact of the U.S. government's pending approval of allowing the sale of high-resolution satellite images would have on the EagleView acquisition, and also any expected changes that would have on the competitive landscape.
Scott G. Stephenson: Right. Thank you for the question. No impact. There remains a distinction between what can be gleaned from an image captured from the sky versus an image captured from a satellite. And without sort of belaboring the technology: It's a different sensing mode on a satellite than it is a camera in the belly of an airplane. And the satellite is looking through the atmosphere in a way that the camera in the plane is not. And so you sort of start with that and you have different properties in the image, and then beyond that, a lot of what applies as well is the ability to get a number of orthogonal and oblique images of the same structure. And aerial imagery is advantaged in doing that in a way that satellite imagery is not. Satellite imagery has advantages, for sure, but as it relates to what we're trying to do, it's the kind of precision that one can get from an aerial image. And what are called the radiometric properties of the image are very significant in what we're looking to do, so really no impact. But I will say also, however, those of you who are going to be following our company through time, as we try to mine aerial images, there may be different modalities in which they're gathered. So for example, all the discussion about drones is interesting to us. And fundamentally, if there's a way to get the precise images that we're looking at in a more efficient way, a la a drone, that's actually a good thing for us. We would be open to that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: This is Rayna Kumar, for David Togut. Could you please quantify your price increase this year in Risk Assessment?
Scott G. Stephenson: We don't actually think of it that way. That's not even how we work on it, really. I think that maybe there are some folks out there who are aware of our pricing algorithm, which has in it a -- one of the terms in the algorithm is to reference industry premium volumes. And that, I can certainly understand where that would create an impression, which is effectively there's just sort of a ratchet in the invoices that we're sending out year-over-year, but that's actually not the way that it works. What we do is we take account of the amount of value that we've added in the suite. And so there's actually a great deal of work that goes on every year to have as much relevant and timely information inside of the underwriting rules, inside of the loss costs that we publish, and that is part of the work that we do each year. I will go back to what Mark said also, that inside of Risk Assessment, there are new categories of solutions. And the growth there is really a function of adoption. But back to the industry-standard programs that we talked about in the past, it's not really about price. It's about value. It's about what did we do to improve the product.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Do you expect margin improvement in 2014 to occur in both your Decision Analytics business and your Risk Assessment business during the second half?
Mark V. Anquillare: So this is Mark. I think what we tried to describe is the fact that we would say flattish for the full year 2014. That's an enterprise-wide view. I think what you've also heard is that we did spend a little bit more inside health care satisfying some customers. So there's probably a little bit more expansion in the DA side of things than the RA side of things. RA is obviously pretty special with regard to margins today.
Scott G. Stephenson: And again, we've said that we're a back-half company as it relates to margins generally.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I apologize in advance if this question was asked in some form, as I'm jumping on a bit late here. But I'm sure -- I heard there were a number of health care questions asked. I was wondering if there was any specific color you can provide on how the individual businesses are doing, what the trends have been, even if it's just, say, a range, as opposed to a specific percentage. I know there's a focus on cross-selling and selling at the needs of the customer, but it'd be helpful to understand if there is a material difference between, say, Payment Accuracy and RQI.
Scott G. Stephenson: We haven't really sort of broken it out in that way, but -- and I'm not sure if you heard the comment before, but we really are very focused on all parts of the suite performing, both because of the growth that can be contributed by the different elements of the suite, but as well, we believe that we actually become a more compelling partner to our customers the more that they actually make use of our full suite. And you all know that we have been at work for some time to make sure that we have commonality operating underneath the product platforms with respect to data definition and rules, warehousing. And that remains our view, that it's sort of the -- that we really are greater than simply the sum of our parts explicitly. And that is very much our view of the business and what matters and where we're at and where we're going.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, even understanding that you're going to market as a cohesive suite, are you guys seeing more requests or responsiveness to certain parts of the suite? Or is that just not something you're willing to get into?
Scott G. Stephenson: I think the measure for us is whether or not we can get into a deep dialogue with the leaders in the business and have something relevant to say across essentially all of their decisioning needs. And that is our focus. And we work very hard to make sure that we can go out and have conversations which are very broad with our customers. And I think that we're encouraged by that. And I think that we feel we see the fruit of that in terms of our enhanced standing with the name-brand companies in the health care space.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the back -- call back over to the -- our presenters for any closing remarks.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you. We would just like to thank everyone for your interest and for joining us on our first quarter earnings call today. And we look forward to talking to you again in the near future. Enjoy your day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Eva Huston:  Thank you Chantey. Good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our fourth quarter 2013 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions. All numbers we discuss today unless otherwise stated will reflect continuing operations and exclude the results from Interthinx, our mortgage services business which we announced in February we’re selling. Interthinx is classified as discontinued operations. In our 10K filing revenue is reported from continuing operations only but EBITDA is shown including Interthinx as per the SEC requirements. In our press release we report EBITDA from continuing operations to assist you in your analysis. We have also included in the back of our press release a reconciliation of continuing operations for the total as well as the quarterly detail for 2012 and 2013 excluding Interthinx. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K, can be found in the Investors section of our website, at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until March 26 on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott Stephenson:  Thank you Eva. Good morning everyone. The results we reported last night were in line with the expectations we discussed with you last quarter. We’re confident our long term prospects remain excellent and we continue to run the business with that time horizon in mind. Our view on this has been and will remain consistent. Our long term management of the business and our determination to innovate are very well aligned given that innovation works in long cycles. We’re eager to continue to invest in our innovation agenda which we expect to drive both top line and free cash flow growth overtime. We remain focused on our twin goals of organic growth through innovation and operating with efficiency and scalability. As you know we made several strategic moves over the past several months announcing the acquisition of EagleView Technologies Corporation or EVT and the sale of our mortgage services business Interthinx. We continue to focus on being good stewards of our capital. On January 14, we announced the signing of an agreement to acquire EVT for a purchase price of $650 million. EVT is the parent company of both Pictometry International, a recognized leader in imagery, and EagleView which is well-known in the insurance industry. EVT is a leader in imagery analytics offering solutions in the property and casualty, contractor governance and commercial spaces. While the nascent imagery business today is fragmented and populated by some large companies. We believe our expertise and experience offer an opportunity to differentiate ourselves in the use of imagery and solutions that enhance the efficiency of our customers’ businesses. EVT has over 1 million square miles of images in the United States, covering 85% of the population and 90% of our structures, a very valuable asset with over 20 petabytes of data that has taken years to build. As a reminder we see the natural development of the solution is moving from a catastrophe focus today to include non-cat claims, underwriting customers and commercial property risks. By combining EVTs claims solutions built on their comprehensive library of images with our own extensive insurance customer base and our industry knowledge, we can enhance the selling of these claims solutions in the insurance market, as well as move to develop automated underwriting solutions which do not exist today. Customer reactions to our pending combination has been positive. As we discussed last month on the call regarding the acquisition EVT will be integrated into our Xactware division under the leadership of Jim Loveland. The regulatory and shareholder approval processes are underway, and we expect integration to begin soon as the transaction closes. As we have stated our strategy is to allocate capital to the highest return opportunities for shareholders and EVT is one of these opportunities. The business has grown strongly leveraging the foundation of the government and municipal businesses into new markets in insurance and other commercial segments and we have significant opportunity to continue to grow the business, both in the United States and we believe over time, internationally. We remain consistent in our approach to acquisitions and we are focused on the strategic importance of the business to Verisk as the key driver in our decision to require EVT. We remain focused on our core principle of creating shareholder value through innovation, discipline and execution. Earlier this month we signed a definitive agreement to sell our mortgage services business Interthinx to First American Financial Corporation for a price of $155 million cash subject to typical adjustments for among other things, the working capital of the business. We are currently awaiting regulatory approval, and expect to close by March 31. Our IRR on our mortgage services business based on sale price of $155 million was greater than our typical 15% hurdle and similar to our return experience for our overall acquisition portfolio, which has IRR's of over 20% using our conservative, 10 times EBITDA terminal value. The sale of Interthinx will allow us to focus on businesses most closely aligned with our strategy of providing proprietary data analytics into our key verticals. The Interthinx's leadership team, headed by Jeff Moyer has done an excellent job responding to changes in the mortgage market and we wish them continued success as part of First American. In yesterday's press release we provide pro forma historical financial results, excluding Interthinx which should help you in thinking about the shape of our businesses and our financial profile going forward. Also last quarter at Verisk Health we put a new leadership team in place, led by Nadine Hays which occurred after our update on our financial outlook. I'm pleased to tell you that our team was 100% focused on execution during Verisk Health’s busiest time of year, which concluded on February 14th. We satisfied our customer’s volumes expectations in the quarter. To put this in perspective, Verisk Health’s volume in its Medicare advantage business increased nicely in 2013 and this within a market that is fast-growing, in light of the baby boomer population's progression toward Medicare eligibility. This is the time of year when Medicare advantage plans were to meet a deadline related to submitting documentation to substantiate the health status of their patients. This documentation directly drives the revenue yield our customers realize in connection with the illness burden of the patient population they manage. As you know, helping our customers drive their own revenue growth within Medicare advantage is an important part of our business. A positive result of the Verisk Health’s focus was that it allowed us to deliver revenue for the quarter, just above the high end of our forecast, ensuring a quality outcome on a tight time table for our customers did require a somewhat higher than planned expense level. But Nadine and her team are working very hard on demand planning with our customers to ensure that in 2014 we stand ready to meet our customer’s volume requirements while improving profitability. We have more work to do at Verisk Health’s and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity. We also believe that we are on the right track to ensure that business as a whole is built for the scale necessary to meet the healthcare opportunity. We continue to manage the business to mid-teens growth in 2014 as we discussed with you last quarter. You will have a chance to hear about the business from Nadine directly at our upcoming investor day. On a topic of investing for the future, we were very excited as we went through the 2014 budget cycle to see the number of ideas coming from our business units for creating new solutions and enhancing existing ones. We are fortunate to be able to green light many of these initiatives with the expectation of also maintaining strong margins. In the fourth quarter of 2013 we delivered results which were in line with our expectations with total revenue growth of 7% all organic and a decline in diluted adjusted EPS of about 11% largely due to tax benefits seen in the prior period which did not recur in the current period. Full-year revenue and diluted adjusted EPS grew about 13% and 9% respectively. Our consolidated organic revenue growth for the full year was about 9%. Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin, excluding Interthinx of 45.4% in the quarter and 46.7% for the full year. The margins were down versus the prior year as a result of investments we have been discussing with you and increased spending to meet customer demand at Verisk Health. In the quarter we returned capital to our shareholders to stock repurchases of about $117 million. We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. Even with the acquisition of EVT we remain active in looking at M&A. We continue to focus on assets with the strategic set of strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth prospects and with that let me turn it over Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.
Mark Anquillare:  Thanks Scott. For the fourth quarter we again delivered both revenue and EBITDA growth, we’re also investing in the future. Revenue grew 7.3% for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 all organic in 13.3% for the fiscal year 2013. Excluding the effect of 2012 acquisitions revenue grew 8.5% from fiscal year 2013. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 7.6% in the fourth quarter of 2013 all organic. Growth in the quarter was driven by strong performance in financial services primarily contributions from our Argus, which is now all organic. For the full year Decision Analytics revenue grew 18% and 9.8% on an organic basis. Within Decision Analytics our insurance category grew 7.3% for the fourth quarter of 2013 all organic, the increase was driven by strong growth in catastrophe modeling and insurance fraud claims solutions, whilst quantification solutions also added to the revenue growth. Overall growth was driven by the increased adoption of existing and new solutions and annual invoice increases for certain solutions. We’re pleased we’re delivering acceleration in combined insurance revenue growth in 2013 consistent with our comment at the beginning of the year. Full year 2013 combined all RA and DA insurance revenue growth while 7.8% all organic. In the financial services category, revenue grew 25.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013 for all organic and after classifying Interthinx as a discontinued operation. We sold both the automated and the forensic pieces of the mortgage business. We did retain a small business focus on portfolio analytics in the consumer loan space which is aligned with and will now be part of Argus. Revenue increases were driven by demand of our analytic solutions and services. For the full year 2013 on a pro forma basis financial service revenue from continuing operations which is Argus and retain strategic analytics business grew 26.3%, Argus is a very ISO like business and serves as a trusted neutral intermediary using a contributory data model to upgrade analytics which are deeply embedded in our customer’s processes. The growth outlook at Argus remains positive. Including through international expansion and partnering opportunities as well as additional penetration of the existing customers. However we’re mindful of the larger base against which Argus will be growing in 2014. In the healthcare vertical, revenue in the fourth quarter grew 6.9% all organic driven by growth across all the divisions led by Medicare Advantage related services. The results were a little better than expected as we’re able to meet customer demand. This came across with negative impact on fourth quarter DA margins although margins in healthcare remained healthy and scaling. As Scott mentioned we’re working with Verisk Health team to better prepare for future demand of our solutions. We continue to be excited about the opportunity in healthcare space and we expect growth to remain well above the corporate average. We continue to manage towards mid-teens growth in 2014 and are working with our customers to jointly improve demand planning. In the specialized markets category, revenue declined 3.1% for the fourth quarter 2013 but grew 0.3% from full year. Good growth in the quarter EH&S and commercial weather in climate analytics were more than offset by lower activity related to government contract customers. The quarter came in better than we expected due to unanticipated project revenue in the environmental health and safety space. We’re pleased to see continuing traction in our efforts to repurpose our intellectual property to meet strong demand from P&C customers and think our formation of Verisk Climate will enhance our ability to capitalize on that. We think about AER and 3E’s options on the growing list of analytics on climate and supply chain and see them as longer term elements of our growth strategy. Turning to risk assessment, for the fourth quarter we reported revenue growth of 6.7% all organic indicating the value to our long standing insurance customers. The overall increase within the segment is due in part to 4.5% revenue growth in industry-related insurance programs result in primarily from the continued annual effective growth in 2013 invoices effective January 1. Property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 14.7% in fourth quarter, growth as a result of new sales at higher committed volumes and incremental revenue contributions due to the expiring revenue sharing agreement with the technology provider in fourth quarter of 2012. Full year, risk assessment grew 6.7% driven by a 4.5% growth in industry standard insurance programs and 14.2% in property specific rating and underwriting information. For the fourth quarter 2013 EBITDA excluding Interthinx grew 1.4% to a 189.3 million with an EBITDA margin excluding Interthinx at 45.4%. For fiscal year 2013 EBITDA excluding Interthinx grew 11% to 744.8 million. The EBITDA margin excluding Interthinx of 46.7% There are some moving parts in 4Q related to our expectations. Our spending on aerial imagery in the quarter was below lower than planned as we deferred some image capture. However as I mentioned earlier we spent more than planned at Verisk Health in support of customer demand to meet deadlines. We have talked recently about the transaction nature of some of the Verisk Health business and that played a role. In addition the new leadership team at Verisk Health recognized the need for some operational adjustments to support variable customer demand and to move certain functions towards greater automation. We still have work to do but the team only stands what needs to be done in executing against that plan. Decision Analytics EBITDA excluding Interthinx declined 5% in fourth quarter of 2013 and risk assessment EBITDA grew 9.7% versus same period in the prior year. Fiscal year 2013 EBITDA for DA excluding Interthinx grew 12.1% and risk assessment EBITDA grew 9.7%. The fourth quarter of 2013 EBITDA margin excluding Interthinx for Decision Analytics decreased 38.5% from 43.6% in fourth quarter 2012 because of higher cost to meet transactional demand. The fiscal year 2013 EBITDA margin excluding Interthinx in Decision Analytics was 40.7% versus 42.8% in fiscal year in 2012. The fourth quarter 2013 EBITDA margin in risk assessment increased 57% from 55.5% in the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the previously discussed revenue growth and good expense management. For fiscal year 2013 EBITDA margin risk assessment was 56.1% versus 54.6% in fiscal year 2012. As you know following our divesture of Interthinx our margins are higher than they used to be. As we look forward we’re still comfortable with 2014 our EBITDA margins will be flattish versus 2013 EBITDA margins from continuing operations. Over the long term we believe reasonable range for EBITDA margins is 45% to 47%. We expect the middle of this range would be our reference point as we think about investing opportunities in the future. Our interest expense was down 3 million in the fourth quarter versus the respective period in 2012. This decrease was due to the repayment with cash from operations at a 180 million from private placement debt that matured during 2013. We ended the fourth quarter with total debt for about 1.3 billion and no outstanding revolver borrowings. As we discussed we anticipate using our revolver in cash on hand as well as proceeds from the sale of Interthinx on the purchase of EVT. We estimated the after tax proceeds from the sale of Interthinx will be approximately a 125 million. Our effective tax rate was 37.3% for the quarter which was higher than the fourth quarter of 2012 due to a onetime tax planning benefits in the prior period. As discussed over the past several quarters we have been actively working on our tax planning strategy and realized benefits in both 2012 and 2013 from them. Consequently our full year 2013 effective tax rate was the same as 2012 rate of 36.5%. In 2014 without the one-time benefits, we anticipate the rates to normalize around 38.5%. Adjusted net income decline 11.5% for the fourth quarter 2013 and increased 9.5% for the fiscal year 2013, declining the fourth quarter was largely due to tax benefits seen in the prior period which did not recur in the current period. The average diluted share count was a 171.7 million shares in the quarter. On December 31, 2013 our diluted share count was 171.1 million shares. In the quarter we repurchased about 1.8 million shares for about a $116.9 million. At quarter end we had about a 165.3 million left under our authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to-date generating IRRs of over 25%. For 2014 we continue to anticipate at a minimum buying shares offset dilution. Turning to our balance sheet, as of December 31, 2013 our cash and cash equivalents were about 165.8 million, total debt both short term and long term totaled about 1.3 billion. Today our incremental tax capacity is over a $1 billion and it will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Our debt to pro forma EBITDA at December 31 was 1.7 times below our steady-state target. With the acquisition of EVT and sale of Interthinx we anticipate our leverage to rise to about 2.3 times. We will delever back to our target of 4 to 5 quarters after the close of EVT. As you know we’re willing to temporarily go above our long term target of 2 times debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because of our free cash is strong and allows us to delever quickly. In 2013 free cash flow which we define as cash from operations of capital expenditures was 349.4 million and decrease of about 10% versus 2013. Free cash flow for 2013 is adjusted to the timing of excess tax benefits and prior year voluntary pension contribution was 394.6 million reflecting it's climb to 2.7% compared to prior year. Our capital expenditures were a 107.5 million in 2013 consistent with what we discussed last quarter. Free cash flow represented 46% of EBITDA in 2013 lower than our historic average of 65% to 60% due to the increased CapEx. As you will see in our 10K, our expectation for CapEx for 2014 is a 147 million down meaningfully from a 158 million in 2013. This is consistent with our comments during 2013 at but the elevated CapEx was temporary. Although we continue to expect a greater use of capitalized software related to new solutions will modestly raise the capital intensity of our business when compared to historic trends. We continue to aim to grow free cash flow at or above for level of our EBITDA growth. As you think about your models for full year 2014 we anticipate amortization and tangibles was about $57 million. Fixed asset D&A of about $75 million to $80 million, the tax rate around 38.5%. We aim to keep share count flat through our repurchase program. In a current debt balances our quarterly interest rate expense is about $17 million to $18 million. As we said on the EVT call in January you can model the debt cost associated with the acquisition of about 5.5%, net of the Interthinx sale we anticipate borrowing about $475 million although that number can change based on time of the close. After the close of EVT transaction we will update you. Overall our business is performing well and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and we continue to invest for the future. With that I would like to ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of Tim McHugh from William Blair.
Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co: The insurance vertical as a whole. I know you talked about it accelerated this year on a full-year basis, but it was a little slower in the fourth quarter. So I guess two parts of the question. One is what was a little slower in the fourth quarter versus what you saw in the third quarter, which was very strong and as you look forward here to 2014, is the growth rate you saw in 2013 something that accelerated pace, something you can sustain or would we see a step back towards more I guess the growth trends you've seen in the last couple years?
Mark Anquillare: First of all I think we feel very good about insurance, we delivered this year on kind of some strong organic growth, I think we feel well positioned for 2014, as you were to think about the quarter relative to third quarter we did highlight the fact that there was some onetime lurk that was done in third quarter that we probably make a little bit of an consistency between third and four [ph]. Going back to 2012 there is a lot of pluses and minuses there, I think the general trend is one that we look to across the year and it was a positive one. There is nothing that is systematic that would cause you to be a concern that this quarter was below what it was a year ago.
Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co: Okay. And is the underwriting group, you usually you have mentioned, highlighted that as a source of strength for the last few quarters, but it wasn't mentioned.
Mark Anquillare: I think the answer to your question we continue to see improved growth in underwriting in the quarter just quite up to what we had seen in the first three quarters of the year in a little bit to the point I made just a moment ago.
Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co: Okay. And then just on healthcare, can you help me understand what type of cost you needed to add? I guess maybe I overestimated how automated of a business it was, but I guess where was the extra cost that you needed to put to bear and I guess a little more color on the operational changes you described. The new management side.
Scott Stephenson: There is a couple of things but particularly with respect to the Medicare Advantage business which is the part which is very transaction oriented, there are activities related to chart retrieval and then coding in order to abstract the data out of the chart and those are the things which have to flex up as the unit volumes go up and that’s what we had to put more time and energy into and that is one of the aspects of the business as Mark was mentioning before that we’re working to achieve the highest possible level of automation.
Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co:   Okay. And is that something if you knew earlier you would have been able to spread the cost out? Is that the comment that I guess if you planned ahead?
Scott Stephenson: Well we do plan ahead.
Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co: Well, if the client had planned ahead and told you I guess.
Scott Stephenson: It's more of that, that’s right. I mean there is an aspect of the actual volume that we work which is in reaction to our customers. We want to be supportive of them because they are our own business result hinges upon what we do. So and they have a greater volume it's our desire to respond to it. We don’t always know from them exactly what those volumes are going to be, so we try to remain a little bit nimble and able to flex with them.
Tim McHugh - William Blair & Co: Okay. And just to finalize that, was your comment that the margins, they were still scaling? So can I take that for the full year the margins still improved in the healthcare business?
Scott Stephenson: Right.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital: Just on the health, one more thing. I mean you guys I guess you mentioned in there that the busiest period I guess ended February 14. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that and I guess with that in context, any commentary on how first quarter should shape up sequentially?
Scott Stephenson : Yeah so let me kick off there as we have mentioned in the past there is a seasonality to the work that we’re doing, in fact different aspects of what we’re doing Verisk Health have different seasonal cycles. But there is a back half quality to what it is that we do in the healthcare space overall and we would expect that to continue to be the case this year.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital: I guess so this busy period you talked about though, that was just specific to one area then? I was just trying to understand why that was the busiest time.
Scott Stephenson: Well there is in the Medicare Advantage stage there is a process by which the Medicare Advantage plans have to make their submissions to CMS in order to drive their revenue outcome and all of that times out this year it times out on February the 14, and so there is a lot of activity through the end of Q4 and even a little bit into the first quarter just try to respond to that deadline and that’s what we were referring to.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital: Okay, all right. And then just on Argus, I mean obviously it continues to perform really well. I guess you have a little bit tougher comps, so you maintain mid-teens. But can you just help us understand some of the I guess the drivers near term that have been leading that solid growth?
Scott Stephenson: Well there are multitude of ways in which the Argus business grows which is one of the reasons why it's such a wonderful business in addition to the extremely propriety nature of the data they have got but the business consists of multiple sets of solutions that are provided to retail banks which include the basically the contributory data studies analytic solutions and a suite of services which are built around the analytics solutions as well as actually licensing the analytic platform that we have built back to some of our customers and all of that in the context of the opportunity to grow the business globally. In addition to all of that we’re increasingly finding ways to try to repurpose the data to tie in what’s happening in the retail banking channel with what’s happening in other vertical markets to specifically into the world of trying to observe patterns of consumer spending and how they respond to promotion and advertising whether it's broadcast or online. And all of those are part of the Argus story and will continue to be as we go forward.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo.
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities: With healthcare coming in as strong as it did and Argus as well, do you think it would be as we look out to organic growth for the rest of the year, do you think we've come to a point where we've basically troughed and for total Company organic growth we will see some gradual improvement over the year?
Scott Stephenson: We’re feeling good about the business though and we’re very focused on organic growth and one of the things I would just say is that our case is built on a very broad base. There are I mean we basically do not accept that any part of our business is mature. And so even within the longest standing solution sets we've got, we are asking for innovation and new forms of value for our customer. So we’re looking in a case which is built very broadly across the entire company.
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. And I also wanted to ask for an update on the pooled data initiative, just how many organizations are participating and how effective it has been at reducing fraud in healthcare and is it generating any revenue or when do you have plans for it to do that?
Scott Stephenson: Right, so we’re still in the early stages. Last time we talked about we reported that we had two companies participating that’s still where we’re at but we do have a couple of name brands companies that are deep into conversation with us and this is very definitely one of those network effect businesses and so as we can get more companies into the process the value is going to grow not arithmetically but more geometrically. Even so even with the first two we’re very encouraged by the amount of value that we have been able to point to for our first two beta customers in relatively short period of time. So we’re very encouraged.
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities: Got it and a couple of quick housekeeping questions. One was just the share count exiting the fourth quarter and the other was I didn't know if I caught what you thought the kind of ongoing organic growth rate for Argus next one, two years would be. Sort of mid-teens, is that the way to think about it or?
Mark Anquillare: So let me take on a couple of questions, the share count and you asked specifically where the share count was at the end of the year that was 171.1.
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities: That's fully diluted?
Mark Anquillare: Highlighted that we would try to buy back shares to minimize any dilution at a minimum…
Bill Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities: Got it.
Mark Anquillare: In the year. I think we continue to feel very good about Argus, we highlighted that, we continue to feel that. There is multiple ways that they can expand both internationally into some new customer set as well as some new verticals as Scott highlighted. On a bigger base so we’re cautiously optimistic and I think we continue and kind of live by the mid-teens that we talked about.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase: I wanted to ask about the trajectory of Verisk Health as we go throughout 2014, kind of starting with the 7% in fourth quarter 2013. Do we feel like it is going to be a progressive, rather smooth acceleration through the year to make mid-teens for the full year? And then my second part of the question is does Verisk Health need additional healthcare wins to get there or is this really just ramping existing contracts?
Scott Stephenson: Let me take the second question first and then I will turn it over to Mark for the first one about the profile but the way that we have built our view of 2014 is by looking at all of the customer relationships in place by the end of 2013 and having a I think a good view of how those are going to perform in 2014 and then taking a risk adjusted view of what we believe that sales pipeline is going to yield in 2014 and the very large majority upto 2014 case is built on the performance of business is already in place as we rounded the corner out of ’13 and into ’14. So that’s how we came up with our view of where we’re at and Mark if you want to talk about sort of the profile in ’14?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. I wish I can tell you it's a smooth ramp, I think it will continue to be a little bit of an up and down. Let me describe it a little bit why, first of all I think we already highlighted this because of the sweeps is focused on satisfying our customers’ demands around submitting the reimbursement, everything happens or a lot happens in the second half of the year. That is typically being around that 55% to 60% so continue to keep that in mind and what we’re doing this year in ’14 is trying to demand capacity plans hopefully little more effectively with our customers which would even out some of the volumes there between third and fourth quarter. So I wish I could give you pointed information but I would continue to think about bias towards second half of the year with regards to overall revenue and third and fourth quarter hopefully we have a little bit more capacity planning which would drive a little more revenue in the third quarter, a little less in the fourth.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Chase: And this is all about RQI, I mean the comments you just made really fit RQI's profile, right?
Mark Anquillare: That is the variable aspect of the healthcare business, that’s true.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey:  I hate to kind of pepper you with more healthcare questions, but I'm doing it anyway I guess. With regard to the transactional versus subscription nature of the business, you made some moves I think in the, you talked about in the third quarter to transition the business or to push it in the direction of recurring subscription revenue. It sounds like perhaps in 2014 we are not going to see much of an impact of those initiatives. I guess that would be the first part of the question. And then the second is it sounds like to the extent you had some volume ramp delays that affected the third quarter, you feel pretty confident that those are behind you at this point?
Scott Stephenson: So let me take that on, first of all I don’t want to over characterize in sort of any given period the degree to which we can actually shift the revenue mix from transactional to subscription. So you may be thinking about comments we have made where we would always have that in mind as a goal and over longer periods of time our experience has been that in data analytics business you do tend to move with time from transactional to subscription, partly because our customers would like to have relatively greater certainty about what it is that they are going to be paying us through time. So that is a general view that we have on the business and a general ambition that we would have for the business, but we would not want to over characterize our ability in any given period to move the market in that way because particularly with something like Medicare Advantage where you have had such substantial expansion in transaction volumes, our customers would not really know exactly how to project where individually they're headed and therefore they wouldn't really know how to write subscription contract around that. So you may have heard us express that as a preference but I don't want to give you the impression that that's something that we feel can be moved around, you know, particularly strongly at any given moment in time. And with respect to what went on in the business in the fourth quarter when we were talking about third quarter we had talked about four accounts in particular and we can report that actually that’s the cumulative effect of those four accounts in the fourth quarter was actually slightly above what we had expected.
Mark Anquillare: Maybe I can just add to real quickly to the characterization, what we tried to put in place was long term contracts that had committed volume minimums. So those minimums there that gives us comfort it also gives us a long term relationship but inside those committed minimums they are full year minimums so just trying to get from our customers that capacity it's smooth over the year, it still continues to be they give it to us as they think…
Scott Stephenson: In addition to which our ambition is to outperform the minimums and in some cases substantial.
Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: And Scott, if you just take a sort of high-level view of the healthcare business given all the moving pieces, would you kind of characterize 2014 as a transition year or work in progress year because it sounds like there are some ongoing investments or adjustments that you are making at the same time that your revenue growth continues to be pretty robust? And do we think about the business perhaps evolving and maybe even taking on a more a different complexion, a more mature complexion from a margin standpoint as we get into ‘15? Is that kind of directionally the way to think about it?
Scott Stephenson: I think that we are and will remain an evolving organization for some time just by way of reference and I think most of you know this but in 2013 our healthcare business was five times larger than it was three years prior in 2010. So there has been a great deal of growth. And obviously we’re intending to continue to grow the business and growth implies that we’re going to be creating a solution that we’re going to be improving the processes and the products that we already have out in the marketplace and on top of which the really important contextual point here we have a business that is material now inside of Verisk and yet at the same time when you look at the healthcare space overall we’re still a small to midsize. There are several companies which are in the data analytics space who are larger than we’re, and so we still have a long way to go I guess it's the way that I would put it and lots of opportunities to try to continue to improve the way we do what it is we do whether it's acquiring yet more proprietary data or enhancing the automation inside of what is that we do and as our colleagues inside of our healthcare business know every time we’re together and we’re together a lot talking about the business it's basically about how can we continue to reinvent this business through data analytics and enhanced processes and so I think there will continue to be opportunities to do that over longer periods of time. It's still an evolving and dynamic business and that’s in that is where the growth opportunity exists.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Suzanne Stein of Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Can you go back to the insurance piece of Decision Analytics and the organic growth rate there? It dipped down in fourth quarter from a kind of 8% to 9% normalized range that it has been in the nine months prior. How are you thinking about 2014? Are you looking for a further deceleration in that segment or are there trends in the P&C end market that give you confidence it could trend higher?
Mark Anquillare: I think I will just try to highlight that we continue to feel very good about the opportunities insurance and that’s not just in well I call the DA businesses that goes across into risk assessment and we I think we continue to think about the opportunity being across a full spectrum of the insurance customers. We have optimism fourth quarter from your point it was down a bit in fourth quarter. I don’t think there is anything systematic there, it was really a little bit inside of underwriting as we described and we have quite the growth there that we had in past. We continue to believe that all of those businesses including risk assessment have an opportunity to expand and grow. I will highlight one thing though as you think about risk assessment. We did have that service provider, that contract that expired in fourth quarter of 2012, it's about $12 million that will continue to be in our ’14 numbers but ’13 did experience a onetime growth because of that contract expiration.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then on the buyback activity, it was bigger I think than it has been since 2011. Was there anything specific that drove that? And I guess given where your leverage is now, should we expect it to remain at an elevated level, just I guess assuming the stock remains in the range it is now?
Mark Anquillare: So in fourth quarter we kind of use our capital for the best way possible, we felt like it was good at time and a good buying opportunity which we did do. At the same time we have now placed some capital through the use of acquisitions, EVT specifically and at a minimum we’re going to buy back shares to limit the dilution into 2014 that is our plan and we have just basically consistent targets that we continue to work through.  
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: And then maybe just one more on specialized markets. You mentioned that some of the better performance this quarter was project-related. Are you expecting this to continue in 2014 or was that more of an unusual fourth-quarter item?
Mark Anquillare: So I think what I will highlight is that sometimes those special projects do kind of move revenue into a quarter and it's good news but the fact that projects are there usually leads to more opportunity, more intense relationship. So although they are a little bit one time I think it kind of has some promising aspects to it and I feel that both EH&S and from a commercial perspective the world of climate, I think, provides us some upside into ’14.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of David Togut from Evercore.
David Togut - Evercore Partners: Just piecing together your comments, Scott, and yours, Mark, as well with respect to margins; I think, Mark, you signaled that EBITDA margin would be flattish in 2014. And, Scott, you highlighted the focus on maximizing organic growth but also the operating leverage in the business. So as we look beyond 2014, would you anticipate that EBITDA margins would begin to expand again, or would you hold margins flat and max investment to continue to drive organic growth?
Scott Stephenson: So first of all going back to what Mark had mentioned before when you look at continuing ops what we said is we think that 2014 will be flattish relative to what they were in ’13 for continuing ops. So that’s kind of the near term horizon, the long term horizon is Mark did talk about the range being 45 to 47 and that we’re kind of oriented around the midpoint. And the way we think about that is we are very determined to make sure that we see the top line growing organically while at the same time making sure that EBITDA and free cash are also advancing in-line and that free cash flow it's more than keeping up with EBITDA growth. So that’s kind of the equation we’re working and the sort of the good news about where we said is that as we ask for more innovation from the organization we’re actually getting it and so we’re in kind of in opportunity rich environment is what it feels like. And so we’re leaning into the opportunities to invest. The one thing to bear in mind is that we are a business-to-business data analytics company. Our customers are sober minded, businesses who will diligence process and expect proof of concept before they buy into them and they should because they're trying to run their businesses with the steadiness and so the effect of all of that is that a great new solution can take a while to find it's way to market and so the balancing point then is we’re investing today and innovation tends to commercialize over longish periods of time in an environment like ours and so those are all the things that we will be playing with as we try to advance the business top and bottom line.
David Togut - Evercore Partners: So does that mean EBITDA margins would likely be flattish in 2015 as well, as you continue to drive higher investment to innovate?
Scott Stephenson: Well we’re still communicating the range that we talked about there, so we did talk 45 to 47 and we did talk about the midpoint being a reference for us and we’re going to actually take a count of real-time conditions on the ground basically as we move into ’15 and a lot of that has to do with just how innovative is our organization being.
David Togut - Evercore Partners: That makes good sense. I guess just drilling down into 2014 a little bit, it looks like you are getting very nice operating leverage on the risk assessment side and a lot of the investment is going into DA. Would you expect that to be the trend as well in 2014, where you get lift on the RA margin, and DA margin continues to be down as you drive a lot of investment in that business?
Scott Stephenson: So we really, one of the things that we talk about as frequently is that we really see the all of what we’re doing insurance as an as an integrated whole. When we sit down with our customers, our largest customers. We don't really tend to have when we’re having our relationship discussions they tend not to be focused on individual products whether they are RA or DA, it tends to really be the totality of relationship and so in that context what we’re looking for is the overall result, the overall organic results and therefore the, we’re certainly paying attention to what’s happening with each of the products line but we’re really looking for the overall result. All of that said I think that in DA I believe that the margins will be firm in 2014 relative to 2013. Firm plus but the exact outcome, we’re kind of, we’re adjusting as we go inside the context of customer relationships.
David Togut - Evercore Partners: Understood. A quick final question, Mark, on tax rate. What is your expectation for 2014?
Mark Anquillare: About 38.5, lot of good news one-time tax planning items are behind us and that is the new normalized lower rate going forward.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs: My first question, I was wondering if you could potentially provide an update on some of your previously discussed moves in the healthcare business to offer contracts with some lower prices in exchange for longer-term commitments. Is this something that you are continuing to pursue more widely across the business and are you finding it successful in locking in more customers?
Scott Stephenson: So I did comment earlier about for customer situations from the third quarter and for the way that that generally is played out in the fourth quarter. But we’re generally, we’re really led by where the customers are and there are some customers that are going to be more concerned about knowing that they have capacity to flex if they find that their own volumes are moving and there are others who want to try to cut it more closely in terms of sort of not really laying in capacity but rather sort of in essence taking the risk that their needs can be met even if they haven't signaled them with great precision beforehand and so in that sense we’re just responding to what it is that the customers need and want, and I can’t say that I’m aware of any sort of major trends in that area one way or the other. Our preference always as I said before would be to have the certainty that it is associated with a license agreement and a subscription but that being our preference doesn’t mean that we can necessarily make that happen in the marketplace where it can be done, that would be our preference but we’re following our customers around in this regard.
Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs: And with regard to the two existing customers in the pooling business, was there any expansion of those customers into additional geographies as I think you previously indicated that they were only doing business in certain regions? And are there any more specific anecdotes that you would be willing to provide on some of the types of savings and benefits that you've been able to provide, as you said, that the early read is that those relationships are going well?
Scott Stephenson: At Investor Day we’re going to actually talk a little bit more about what’s going on inside of the pool data initiative and I think you will benefit from hearing about that directly from our people in the business.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank: Just another question about healthcare margins. You said you'd put the Decision Analytics margins. You said you pushed out some of the investment in aerial. How much was that push out? And basically it sounds from the last question that we should expect DA margins maybe to be down in the first half and up in the second half and then maybe flattish to slightly positive year on year overall. Is that the right way to think about it?
Mark Anquillare: I’m not sure we do those conclusions, let me just kind of go back at, we did spend a little less on aerial imagery as we kind of got towards the end of the year whether it's flying conditions or flight plans. There is an opportunity you know to not gather as much information as we had anticipated that they push off and we will push off into 2014 that is a fact. As far as the margins into 2014 I’m not sure we’re going to start commenting by quarter I think we tried to give you a little bit of color for ’14, we have a view that this should be generally flattish. Scott highlighted that from a DA perspective we will see some scale there so he has talked about flattish plus and from an RA perspective I think we do kind of expect and see a little bit of some ramping investment in RA. So probably you won't see the same type of scale in RA in ’14 that probably saw on ’13 that was overall characterization.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank: And then just on that aerial push out, does that mean it is coming in the first quarter or any way to size that just so we can try to model it?
Mark Anquillare: Yeah I’m not sure we exactly know the timing of that right now, it's certainly in the first half of ’14, yes.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank: And then, finally, the 45% to 47%, I think that's a new target. Is that also going to be the target, I think your old bonus target was 43% to 45%. Is 45% to 47% the new bonus target?
Scott Stephenson: We’re always taking into account all the moving parts in the business. So we will be working on that with our Board and the comp [ph] committee et cetera to determine where the target should be put but generally we want the targets to reflect the reality of where the business is. We will definitely spend time on that.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital.
Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets: Just wanted to quickly circle back to your comments about the pricing environment and the fact that you respond to what your customers want. Was that a comment just for the healthcare business or is that something you are seeing in terms of maybe potential changes across your other verticals as well?
Scott Stephenson: So there is actually I think two questions in there Jeff so let me try and grab them both. The first thing I would say is our preference which again would be we like to be in a subscription relationship and generally our experience has been overtime that’s where our customers would like to be once they get a handle on their transaction volumes so that with confidence could know in essence what they are signing up for when they sign the subscription agreement because if you’re going to enter into an all you can drink kind of a relationship you would like to know how much you’re likely to drink and what the alternative would look like if you can get it on a per drink basis. So that’s the preference when we actually look at our business. I would say that there are puts and takes, the healthcare business has off late it has grown more on the transactional side. On the other hand, when we look at say diversified financial services, there have been some gains there with respect to subscriptions and I think that in insurance space I think it is highly committed and stable actually and actually we have made some gains in say the commercial property part of our business. So there is puts and takes but I think at the margin I would say outside of healthcare we’re probably becoming slightly more subscription oriented.
Jeff Silber - BMO Capital Markets: And can you just remind us when you think the EVT transaction will be closing?
Scott Stephenson: Well what we have put out there is by the end of the second quarter and we have mentioned that we are paced by two things one is regulatory approval and the other is just working through with the shareholders who are the current owners of EVT but that’s the track that we think we’re on. July kind of early July would actually be the very specific target.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Credit Suisse
Unidentified Analyst : This is (indiscernible) dialing in for Hamzah Mazari. Just a couple quick questions. Could you provide any color on pricing increases that you saw in the quarter and for 2014 versus how they've fared in the past?
Scott Stephenson : You mean across the entire business?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes.
Mark Anquillare: Let me take the first, I think that many of our businesses don’t really institute price increases as I think about healthcare as an example. Maybe focus in a little bit on is inside of our P&C business, some of our traditional industry standard programs we have kind of a January one invoice that comes out. I think what we have tried to do is we have highlighted time and time again and said we think of insurance customers are selling and buying a large group of products from us and those invoices around industry standard programs, we've tried to keep the approach consistent.  We haven't done anything that would cause them, you have to really think too hard about those invoices, we want them to think about new products in extension of solution across the full suite of the enterprise in Verisk. So business as usual I would say on the risk assessment side of pricing and that would be true of also our what I call claims search invoices that's inside of our Decision Analytics set of solutions for insurance.
Unidentified Analyst: And the next question that I had is just post the EagleView deal, how should we think about the acquisition pipeline and which areas you might be most looking to augment going forward?
Scott Stephenson: So first of all we remain very focused on that part of the agenda. We believe that it's been very value adding for our investors over a long period of time and as long as we continue to operate strategically inside of that agenda. We think it will continue to be a value creating for our shareholders. We see opportunities across all the vertical markets to try to support and amplify what it is that we’re doing on the acquisition front. So I wouldn’t really buttonhole it anywhere. As we have said in the past because of where we fit in the healthcare space today there are certainly a very large number of companies out there that would logically be on our radar screen and at Investor Day we will talk a little bit more also about the way that we partner in order to relate to that world. And so partnering is also sort of an early step in the M&A agenda. But we see it as a very broad based, a very broad based kind of activity. If I was to point at any trends I suppose there would be and you can just see this in what we have done the size of the deals have gotten somewhat larger and I think that’s likely to remain the case, that’s not to say that we won't do smaller tuck-ins but our deal size has gotten somewhat bigger and I think it's likely to continue to be that way. 
Operator: Your next question is from the line of William Clark with KBW. 
William Clark - KBW: Scott, I think you have kind of touched on this, but just wanted to make sure I was clear. So the three customers that were slow to switch over in the Medicare Advantage business in third quarter, they all switched over in the fourth quarter and you saw no additional issues in terms of the timing of bringing new customers on board? Is that the right way to think about it?
Scott Stephenson: What I said very specifically was we talked about four customer situations on our third quarter call. Three of them were about the timing of getting started and one of them was about volume responding to pricing and the comment that I made was the net effect of all four of those was to be performing somewhat higher than we actually expected going into the fourth.  
William Clark - KBW: Okay. And then given the February date you mentioned, a lot of the CMS activity has to be done by, now that we are past that date, is this a time when you generally see more or less activity in terms of customers thinking about changing or switching providers?
Scott Stephenson: I don’t really think of it as being bound up exactly in that. If you’re talking about existing products to existing customers, I feel like in essence we’re constantly being diligent by the marketplace and there is such a strong relationship and this is going really be highlighted when we’re with you on Investor Day by our healthcare team. There is such a strong relationship between the quality of our execution and our growth opportunity and so our customers are perpetually able to observe how we’re executing and delivering for them and I think that they are kind of constantly taking that into account as they think about how much work they want to do with us. And we talked before about the fact that we have got a wide range of solutions and a big part of our opportunity is to cross sell those solutions and so again I’m just back to if we execute and I think our execution is very evident to our customers then that is supportive of our opportunity to introduce new products. So I don’t think of it is bound up in any given moment in time.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott: I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit, I know you made the changes at the management level in healthcare. Can you talk about any processes and/or functions with the new manager in place there that they are looking at and there might be some changes in?
Scott Stephenson: We are paying a lot of attention to way that the business actually operates. Our growth opportunity is not a function of young clever resegmentation of the market that we haven't seen before or some new concept even though we’re introducing new solutions all the time but some fundamentally different view of what we’re doing. Our growth opportunity is very tightly related to the quality with which we deliver on the things that we currently do. And so essentially the very first job for our new leadership which by the way wasn’t part of the business, so it's not sort of this completely from the outside sort of a perspective but what we really ask Nadine and team to do was to just intensify the focus on the quality of your operation and the nature of our operation and that’s really stem to stern statement. So that applies to all the different lines of business we do, all the different solutions and all the different customers that we serve but what we have really tried to emphasize is we must do high quality work at these very highly elevated volumes that we have achieved over the last couple of years and that everything else follows that, our growth follows that everything is dependent upon that and I have been very happy with the amount of attention that the entire team has given to all of that. I mean it's everything, if I was to try to give it to you functionally, the categories are the same as everything that we do. We have got to extract, transform and load data, we have to interpret data, have to then analyze data. We then have to create platforms by which we deliver data and analytic back to our customers. And one of the things on top of that that we have the opportunity to do in the healthcare space particularly it's normalized the data that comes in for different reasons but to normalize so that we have one common set of data definitions and we have achieved that. But it's the all of that, it's not as if there is just one thing where if you pull on the lever all of a sudden it works the way that it's supposed to. It's a very complicated business and it's a very complicated set of steps to get the results that our customers want. So it's a big agenda, we have got a good team that’s very actively on that.
Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott: And on the insurance front, you talked about there being some stability and maybe third quarter had a little bit more business than maybe the fourth quarter and that is why the run rate moderated a little bit. How should we think about that business going forward? It looks like it had tweaked down a little bit but should we be looking more at the historical run rates or should we be looking at exit 2013 run rates for that business?
Mark Anquillare: I think I will go back to I will highlight one 2013 items that we mentioned this about $12 million item that came into ’13 it will continue into ’14 but there won't be any growth. That item was related to a service provider that expired the contract that expired in ’12. We feel across the insurance operations, very strong. So we feel good. The fourth quarter was a couple of items, primarily inside of I will call it underwriting but the DA insurance business is performing well. It was, you know 4Q is higher than 1Q it's on the right ramp it's on the right trend and I would just highlight you that there is nothing systematic in what you see there. It is over the long term, over the year. I think we will continue to deliver in insurance, I think we’re getting into the right type of conversations with our customers you know walking at the very senior levels having conversations about climate, about their book of business, around profitability. That puts us in a great position to really talk about the suites of solutions that we have to help them really profit. So I think we’re making progress.
Joseph Foresi - Janney Montgomery Scott: And very last question. Any lessons learned from the divestiture that you are carrying forward for future acquisitions?
Scott Stephenson: Well I think that what we did there certainly relates to the principles that we run the business by and I would say always have run the business by. We want to be very differentiated with respect to our intellectual property and our proprietary data and analytics and we would like to be facing markets that are inherently healthy, relatively non-cyclical. We’re very focused on competitive advantage and, so essentially our view of who we are as a business has not changed at all. What moved was just the underlying market being served by our mortgage business. I think we have talked in the past about the fact that transaction volumes in the mortgage market as recently as 2006 were about four times as large as they are today. And so we just needed to take account of that as we thought about our allocation of capital and put that in the context of all the other ways that we can deploy capital and just drew the conclusion that we had a greater number of opportunities given who we’re in other marketplaces, but fundamentally I'm very impressed with our management team and everything and I think that First American will be a very logical home for the business. So now just all of that was a part of our sort of decisioning and so I'm not sure that I could really point to any lessons that we have learned from that. I feel like it's the logical extension of what we've always been doing which is trying to behave strategically and to be very thoughtful about where our capital is deployed.
Operator: At this time we have no further questions. I will now return the call over to Mr. Scott Stephenson for closing remarks.
Scott Stephenson: Well thank you and thanks to everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your ongoing interest in our company and support, and I just want to say that I hope that all of you can be with us at our upcoming Investor Day on March the 6th, we will be as we have in the past, we will be highlighting several of our solutions. Giving you a chance to really touch them and see how they operate as well as having a live panel of our senior leadership with us to discuss the various parts of our business and so we’re looking forward to that event on March the 6th and hope to see all of you there. And thanks for your time today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Knowledge Officer, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva F. Huston: Thank you, Julie, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2013 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until December 6, 2013, on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everybody that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you, Eva, and good morning all. Before I launch into the financial results for this quarter, which were solid but shy of our longer-term objectives, I'd like to review several recent accomplishments. We are confident our long-term prospects remain excellent. Over the years, you've heard us speak about running the business with a long-term prospective. Our view on this remains consistent. Recently, we put more emphasis on our innovation agenda, which has always been an underlying theme for how we have grown while delighting our customers. Our long-term management of the business and our determination to innovate are very well aligned. Innovation works over long cycles, and we will continue to invest in a thoughtful way to support new data analytics solutions for our customers, which will result in strong revenue growth over time. We remain focused on our twin goals of organic growth through innovation and operating our business with efficiency and scalability. We were pleased to achieve several innovation milestones in the third quarter, including initial customer use of our pooled data initiative for healthcare, our first provision of Roof Insight reports using aerial imagery and the first sale of our new supply chain platform. While these initiatives are not revenue-generating in the quarter or materially in 2013, they are a good indication of future opportunity. To delve a bit deeper into what these can mean, let me take as an example the new pooled data initiative to fight healthcare fraud, which Verisk Health launched in the third quarter. With some of the nation's leading healthcare payors joining as founding members, we built a database across payor information and analytics designed to combat the estimated $300 billion that America's healthcare loses annually to fraud, waste and abuse. This initiative will turn the identification of improper or elicit billing practices from an abstract view into an actionable one and save millions in claims dollars in the process. For the first time, healthcare payors will be afforded the same comprehensive view of suspect providers and schemes that has proved so successful for the property casualty industry through our claim search platform. As another example, as the fourth quarter began, we announced the creation of the Verisk Climate division. Our customers in insurance and government and across the supply chain are increasingly voicing concern about the effects that climate volatility and environmental extremes are having on their operations and on their earnings. We formed the Verisk Climate division to introduce new weather and environmental analytics that will enable our clients to assess and plan for environmental impacts and to implement strategies to differentiate and grow their businesses despite those impacts. We and our customers will benefit as we create integrated solutions that directly leverage the data and platforms of our other Verisk operating units. While we manage the business with a long-term of view, we are mindful of the need to execute day to day, and we understand our progress toward our strategic objectives. In the third quarter, our organic growth was a bit soft for 3 reasons: first, property claims activity was low relative to historic norms leading to moderated transaction volumes on our claims estimating platform for the property and casualty industry; second, our mortgage business continues to adjust downward toward historic norms with respect to the analysis of defaulted loans; and third, we made the decision to accept downward price adjustments in the Revenue and Quality Intelligence division of Verisk Health in order to achieve higher committed volumes with key customers on a multi-year basis. Last quarter, we shared with you our forecast for our organic growth at Verisk Health, and we now expect organic growth for 2013 to be in the 12% to 14% range. The differences between our original assumptions and today were changes at 4 customer accounts. In 3 cases, work has been slow to start or ramp, and in one case, we made price concessions in exchange for multi-year volume commitments. Having redoubled our efforts to forecast this highly transactional business, we are comfortable that we can grow revenue in this business in the mid-teens in 2014. While our near-term outlook has changed, there has been no change in the market size or our opportunity to compete in the vertical. Corporately, we will remain focused on the efficiency of our operations while also elevating investment as we re-platform several solutions and acquire new data sets. In the third quarter of 2013, we delivered a good overall performance with total revenue growth of 10% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 15%. Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the third quarter was about 6%, which is below our long-term historical trend line. Organic revenue growth was over 8% in the quarter, excluding our mortgage analytics business with its macro challenges. Profitability was strong with EBITDA margin over 46% in the quarter. We expect that level of margin to be a high watermark as we continue to manage toward our innovation agenda. We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders, and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. We also remain active in looking at M&A. We continue to focus on assets with a strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth opportunities. In the quarter, we returned capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases of about $24 million. Our remaining authorization at the end of the quarter was $282 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy as we previously outlined it. And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare: Thanks, Scott. For the third quarter, we again delivered both revenue growth and increased profitability. In the third quarter, total revenue grew 10%, and organic revenue grew 6.1%. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth in the quarter was 8.2%. Let me dive into the details for you. For the third quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 11.2% of revenue growth, of which 5.2% was organic, excluding the acquisition of Argus. Beginning next quarter, Argus will be part of the organic revenue growth in the financial services category. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category revenue grew 11.5% in the third quarter. We had discussed our expectation of accelerating revenue growth of the combined insurance revenue this year and are pleased to see ourselves continue in the direction with 9.5% organic revenue growth in the quarter, including Risk Assessment. Our underwriting solutions delivered strong growth, and we saw a continued double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter. Our claims solutions also contributed to growth but not as strongly as in the past due to historical claim trends Scott referenced. Additionally, we saw a benefit of a little over $3 million related to the implementation of our solutions with a large customer. The comparison in the fourth quarter for insurance are a bit tougher as we saw in the past 2 quarters. In financial services, which includes both Argus and the mortgage analytics business, revenue grew 26.6% in the quarter. Argus has continued to perform very well since the acquisition in third quarter 2012. Argus is a very ISO-like business and serves as a trusted, neutral intermediary using a contributory data model to help create analytics, which are deeply embedded in our customers' workflows. The growth outlook at Argus remains positive, including through international expansion and partnering opportunities, as well as additional penetration of existing customers. We have seen growth of over 20% year-to-date at Argus on a pro-forma basis and feel good about exceeding our estimate of mid-teens growth in 2013. The mortgage portion of the financial services revenue declined 16.6% in the third quarter. The origination-related revenue declined this quarter, about in line with the market and the ongoing normalization of the forensic piece of the business continued. We were glad to see a slower decline in forensic revenue again this quarter. Full year 2013 results may be a little lower than the revenue decline we saw in 2012, which was about 11%. The mortgage market remains bumpy, and originations are expected to continue to decline through 2013. Healthcare revenue grew 6.2% for the third quarter, which was below our expectations. We had a few customers where we now expect transactional volumes the come through later than we previously planned. In addition, we mentioned last quarter that there was an opportunity for us to trade near-term pricing for longer-term volume commitments. In some cases, we are seeing the volumes ramp up more slowly than our customers initially anticipated. These are very good customers where we continue see these agreements as win-win for our longer-term relationships. As a result, we now expect 2013 revenue growth to be between 12% and 14%. We expect growth in 2014 to be in the mid-teens. We remain excited about the opportunity in the healthcare space, and we expect growth to remain above the corporate average growth rate in 2014. Our specialized markets revenue declined 1.4% in the quarter. Growth in weather and climate analytics was affected by lower growth in government contracts. We are pleased to see continuing traction in our efforts to re-purpose our intellectual property to meet strong demand from our P&C industry customers. We think our formation of Verisk Climate will enhance our ability to capitalize on that. Growth in environmental health and safety solutions were driven by ongoing customer agreements moderated by lower volumes from customer implementation projects. We expect to see a several million dollar sequential decline in specialized revenue next quarter due to cycling of government contracts in climate analytics prior to the ramp-up of our commercial solutions, as well as fewer environmental health and safety projects as we approach year end. We think about AER and 3E as long-term options on a -- the growing use of analytics around climate and supply chain, and see them as elements for our growth agenda in the future. In our recent launch of Verisk Climate division and with our ongoing efforts in the supply chain area, we can start to see evidence of the kind of traction we hope to gain over time. Turning to Risk Assessment. For the third quarter, we reported revenue growth of 7.8%, indicating the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 5.1% in the quarter, reflecting our 2013 invoices, which were effective January 1. Our property-specific information revenue increased 17.2% in the quarter. This increase was from new sales and higher volumes from certain customers as they commit to expanded long-term contracts, as well as incremental revenue contributions due to the exploration of a revenue sharing agreement with a technology provider in the fourth quarter 2012. Innovation is also an important component of our heritage business. We continue to work closely with our customers to innovate around international solutions and enhanced predictive analytics and commercial real estate solutions building on our P&C expertise. EBITDA for the third quarter was $202.9 million as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 10.9% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 46.3%. As Scott mentioned, we are eager to continue our investment program and are focused on doing that while maintaining a strong margin profile. We intend to accelerate our investment in aerial imagery in the fourth quarter, which will likely have a P&L impact of about $10 million. The margins in Decision Analytics were 41.4% in the third quarter 2013 versus 40.9% in the third quarter 2012. The margin in the quarter reflects good cost management even as revenue growth decelerated in the quarter. We continue to make the necessary investments in the business to support our innovation agenda. In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 55.1% versus 54.6% third quarter of '12. Our margins were helped in the quarter by good cost management in natural scaling business. We told you at the begin of the year that we expected our 2013 EBITDA margins to be flat to modestly down compared to 2012. Based on the investments discussed above and spending to support ongoing and future customer contracts, margins may be down up to 100 basis points. The net-net of all this is that we still feel confident that we'll be towards the upper end of the 43% to 45% EBITDA margin range in 2013, and we'll continue to drive EBITDA and free cash flow growth. You can expect in 2014 and forward that we'll continue to invest in new initiatives and accelerate them as appropriate, which will likely keep our margin in the current range. Our interest expense was up $0.6 million in the third quarter versus the respective period in 2012. This increase was due to higher debt balances taken on during 2012 related to our acquisitions. We ended the third quarter with total debt of about $1.3 billion and no outstanding revolver borrowings. The total debt balance reflects the repayment in the quarter of about $100 million of our long-term private placement debt in August of 2013. At quarter end, we also repaid an additional $35 million in long-term private placement debt. Our reported tax rate was 36.2% in the quarter. As discussed over the past several quarters, we've been working actively in our tax planning strategies. In the third quarter, we again saw a onetime benefit resulting from those efforts. We now expect the tax rate to be a little below 37% for the full year 2013. We expect the normalized rate to be about 38% for 2014 and forward. Coming down to the net income line. We focused on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 15% to $106 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.62 for the quarter, an increase of 14.8%. The average diluted share count was 172.2 million shares in the quarter and also at quarter end. In 3Q, we purchased about 381,000 shares for $24.4 million. We had about $282 million left under our authorization at September 30. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date generating annualized IRRs of over 25%. For 2013, we continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution. Turning to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2013, our cash and cash equivalents were $180.2 million. Total debt, both long term and short term, was about $1.3 billion. As I mentioned before, the debt balance reflects repayments in the quarter. Today, our incremental debt capacity is over $1 billion and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Also, just as after the quarter, we upsized our credit facility to $975 million of commitments, all of which is undrawn and available for general corporate purposes, including M&A. Our debt to pro forma EBITDA at September 30 was 1.7x, below our steady-state target. As you know, we're willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly. Year-to-date in 2013, free cash flow, which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $271.6 million, an increase of about $7.4 million or 2.8% versus the first 9 months of 2012. Our capital expenditures were 9.1% of revenue year-to-date in 2013. Free cash flow generated represented about 47.8% of EBITDA in the first 9 months of 2013, and adjusted for the timing of certain tax benefits mentioned previously, free cash flow represented 54.1% of EBITDA. As we think about capital spending for 2013, we are now expecting $160 million for the full year, including about $30 million of investment initiative spending. We have increased our expectations for capital expenditures due to business opportunities, as well as some timing for multi-year hardware and software purchase support growth of our business. As you think about your models for the full year 2013, we still anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $64 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $72 million and now a tax rate below 37%. We aim to keep share counts flat through our repurchase program. And at current debt balances, our quarterly interest expense is about $18 million. Overall, revenue growth remains solid, margins strong, and we are innovating for the long term. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: First, I guess, I wanted to ask about the healthcare business. And just, I guess, I apologize if I missed it, but just to make sure I heard it correctly. The weakness was mainly in RQI, and it was isolated to 4 main customers. Is that correct?
Scott G. Stephenson: Tim, this is Scott. Yes, that's correct. They're -- basically all of -- the difference between our original expectations and where the quarter came out were a function of events at 4 customers, and in all cases, that was related to RQI.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: And did you trade off lower price for more volume at each of those customers? Or was...
Scott G. Stephenson: No, no. In the comments I made upfront, Tim, I said that of the 4, 3 of them were slowdowns in terms of implementation or ramping. One of them was because we traded off price for longer-term commitments.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And do you have any sense for why the volumes slowed down, I guess, at those customers?
Scott G. Stephenson: A lot of it has to do with the ability to get implemented. And the ability to get implemented is not always fully in our control.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: But these are new -- these are not existing customers that slowed down from what you saw last year necessarily. These are new customers that didn't add as much...
Scott G. Stephenson: One thing to bear in mind about our business, Tim, is that we have a very healthy mix of new business with new parts of an existing customer, as well as absolutely new customers. And so you actually have those effects inside of what was happening. In other words, an existing customer, which is trying to implement in a different part of their operation, that actually shows up in some of those cases that I was just mentioning.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: I guess, if we want to look, is there any -- in trying to understand, was there any competitive impact? And/or was there any signs that the customers are less interested or demand is less for these solutions?
Scott G. Stephenson: No, to both questions.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then just the follow-up, did I -- on the margin side, did you say -- with the 100 basis points for the -- was that in terms of margins being down perhaps as much as that? Was that for the year or...
Mark V. Anquillare: Correct. Yes, it was for a year.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. So obviously, an even bigger decline implied for the fourth quarter.
Mark V. Anquillare: Correct.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to also ask about revenue quality intelligence, RQI. This unit primarily serves Medicare Advantage plans, optimizing reimbursements and such. And when you look at the headlines for Medicare Advantage plans at places like UnitedHealth, it seems like Medicare Advantage plans themselves have some headwinds. Do you think that has anything to do with what you described in the Verisk Health business?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes, Andrew, this is Scott. I don't actually. And you're right about those headlines, and we're aware of what's going on in the space. But the fundamental fact of our situation remains that we are still a relatively small player inside of this world. And so our opportunity is ahead of us, and it really is centered upon building out our business and acquiring business with a number of plans that we don't even work with today. And so yes, there are the dynamics of what's going on inside of the category. Although I will say that it remains the case that Medicare Advantage plans are still highly incented to get after precise measurement of their performance, both cost and quality, since their reimbursement hangs upon it so deeply, and that's the category that we're providing here. So no, I don't think that there's really any affect in what happened in this quarter nor will there be in the -- at least, in the near-term future because our opportunity is essentially to take more space starting from a relatively small position.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. And you said these 3 clients will be implemented soon, right?
Scott G. Stephenson: They are -- we believe that all of them are in the process of moving towards contracting with us and/or expanding their business with us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: So Scott, I had a couple of questions. Upfront you had described some of the innovation initiatives related -- one you mentioned related to pooled healthcare fraud from -- yes, so maybe if you could help us to -- it seemed important, potentially important that you have payers that are joining that initiative. If you could help us to understand how that rolls out and the magnitude of it.
Scott G. Stephenson: Right. So first with respect to the rollout, a lot of -- a fundamental fact is that a lot of the fraud, waste and abuse the goes on in healthcare is actually perpetrated by providers. And when you take that perspective, then immediately, you're framing on trying to get after this becomes a somewhat local one because you're actually trying to diligence providers in the way they interact with payers more on a market-by-market basis. And so the way that we've gotten started with this is the -- in the first phase of this, we've got -- we have 2 national players who have come in, but they have come in only for certain localities. And so the rollout is going to take 2 forms: one is hope -- we expect that they will bring more and more of their localities into the pooled data initiative; and then secondly, more payers will enter in to the initiative. And so just to kind of give you a sense of kind of the scale of all of this, with the providers that we started with, we're dealing with a relatively small fraction of their total business is inside of what we're doing today. And the next wave of payers to come in, we would expect it to be on the order kind of 3 to 5 additional source of plans, and that sort of pace of build over the course of rest of '13 and into 2014, is kind of what we're looking for. So it does grow. It's not growing linearly. It will be much more than that, and there is the network effect of having more and more payers in the process. So we -- that's the way that we think it'll grow.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay, that sounds exciting. And then switching gears on the aerial imaging side. Mark, you had mentioned $10 million of incremental investments. Is that -- if you -- so are you putting infrastructure into database, the images? Is it procurement of the infrastructure to get those images? Where is that $10 million going?
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure. So let me describe, the images are one thing, obviously, a lot of people have pictures. What we are actually trying to do is go one step beyond that and from those pictures derive data through a computer vision actually creating what is specific measurements of roofs and homes and information that can be used for both claims and underwriting in the P&C space. We have been on this agenda now for over a year, and we have built out the infrastructure from standpoint of the technology, the data center and the servers. However, as you actually start to collect and aggregate data in the form of images, that needs to be expensed, not a CapEx item. And so we're trying to call out some of the P&L impact associated with that initiative, and there is a bigger chunk in the fourth quarter. That's what I was trying to describe there in the $10 million.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. And then the last question, if you look at both of these, should we view them between pooled health and aerial imagery as long-term revenue objectives? Or are we going to see some waterfall sooner potentially next year?
Scott G. Stephenson: We definitely expect revenue from both in 2014, absolutely.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Janney Capital Markets.
Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: This is Jeff Rossetti in for Joe. I was wondering if you could provide some additional color on healthcare within Payment Accuracy and Enterprise Analytics, maybe how those businesses performed, excluding RQI?
Mark V. Anquillare: Let me take that one. This is Mark. The general theme is they have performed well. I would tell you that the bigger growth in the opportunity at least recently has been with RQI, and that's where we've seen some big customer contracts. I think the underlying theme around Payment Accuracy, which is the fraud and abuse case, is very strong, and we continue to have nice ramping customers in volumes. Although as the business gets larger, it's tough to grow at the same percentage rate. So what we've seen is growth extension and the opportunity to continue to add dollars. But the dollars are on a bigger base, so the percentages are lower. From an EA, which we refer to as Enterprise Analytics side of things, a little more competition in this space. I think we see opportunities there that extend beyond what as providers -- excuse me, extend beyond what are the payers and into the provider space, and we're ramping up in spending and investing there with the opportunity to kind of extend the market opportunity as what is, call, population management or the world of what we do in Enterprise Analytics can be applied to a shifting set of risks potentially inside of the healthcare space as providers probably take on some more risk in the future.
Scott G. Stephenson: And I'll just add to that, a very pleasing fact for us is that we now have a material fraction of all the ACOs, which have been launched to date as customers for our EA division, which is a really, really nice place to sit.
Jeffrey Rossetti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division: And just one follow-up, Mark, I apologize if I missed this. Did you say there was any change to your 2013 investment plans and innovation of -- or is it still tracking at around $90 million?
Mark V. Anquillare: So I think what we tried to describe, the dealer part was -- and this is more of a CapEx discussion and then I'll double back into the P&L. Our CapEx is higher right now. I want to just at least give a little color and clarity on that. And inside that, I think at least $10 million additional has been added. So now we're at about $30 million inside that CapEx because of these investment initiatives and some of that additional CapEx is really just because operational needs to get the bigger, whether it's around facilities or just it's around computing power. That's been the focus with some additional CapEx. I think that answer your question. If you're more on the P&L side, I'm happy to go into a little deeper dive there, but what we tried to reflect inside of the -- up to 5 -- 100 bps is some of the expense that we would incur resulting from the investment initiatives, which are more than $90 million today from what I'll call P&L perspective.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I know you've been asked this question a number of different ways, and I'm not sure that I completely understand this. So how significant were the pricing concessions? Because maybe I'm not thinking about this right, but if part of the disappointment in Health in the quarter was related to delays in transactional volume. And I think you mentioned that was the case with 3 of the 4 big customers. Then, why aren't you expecting growth next year to be higher than mid-teens? I mean, is the real underlying organic growth in healthcare now actually lower just given that, that mid-teens number includes some of this catch-up revenue?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes, it's not -- no, there's not a catch-up effect here. So I'm not quite sure I'm tracking your question, but let me say it the way that we see it and understand it. So we made some trade-offs in the third quarter with respect to price, which showed up in our third quarter results, will show up on our fourth quarter results. And will have the effect of relating to transaction volumes in '14, '15 and '16 in particular. Then separately, there are customers that we're finding are intending to be our customers, but the rate at which they are moving into being a part of our customer set is lower than we had originally thought it would be. And that applies in the quarter, but also as we try to think about where the business is going to be in '14, we're seeing some of that same effect. And as I think you know, a large fraction of what we do and in healthcare, about 70% of it, is transactional as opposed to the rest of Verisk, which is about 70% subscription and recurrent. And so that which we don't get in '13, it's not -- it doesn't just roll over into '14.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, and then separately, when do you expect mortgage to bottom? And then are you going to continue breaking out mortgage within the financial segment going forward once Argus is brought into organic?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, I'm sure that we would -- I'm not on the point about specifically what our reporting looks like, but certainly, we will continue to comment on mortgage just because mortgage is a meaningful part of what we're doing in financial services. With respect to the bottoming, you got to look at 2 things. One is what's happening with respect to mortgage origination volumes. And there, according to the MBA, the expectations for '14 is it'll be a somewhat softer market than '13. And then the other piece is cycling through the forensic piece, and our view is we haven't quite gotten to the bottom yet, but we're moving towards it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And just another question on healthcare. Just it looks like your fourth quarter, your guidance for 2013 would imply fourth quarter healthcare revenue growth to be about 0% to 6%. Is that what -- is that the right implication? And then on 2014, we just saw the trading pricing for volume, we start to see that pick up in '14, so why -- just maybe one more point of clarification on why we're not kind of reaccelerating back toward that 20%? Then a quick final one on the margin. Are we flat into '14 from 100 basis points down in '13?
Scott G. Stephenson: Okay, so let me take the healthcare question. So for first of all, in the fourth quarter, you talked about a 0% to 6% range. We think we're at the higher end of that range but yes. Again, the slowdown on the ramp-up is an effect which doesn't happen at just one moment in time. In other words, we're trying to be very clear and very thoughtful about what we see happening across the customer base, existing customers, as well as prospects, the ramping up at existing customers, as well as prospects. And so that effect is at work in '14, as well as '13. And then, Mark, do you want to just talk about the margin question for a moment?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes, when I was referring to the 100 bps, I was referring to full year '13. I think we've continued to have a view that we'll be in that high end of the range of 43% to 45% as we roll into '14 and beyond.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just one on healthcare for me as well. But the impact, I guess, the pricing impact on that one customer, I'm just trying to understand like can we see more of that sort of trade off that you're making on additional customers down the road that could have a similar impact.
Scott G. Stephenson: I would say that it's possible. What happened in this case was very specific to the individual customer. And -- but we're also paying a lot of attention to price realization in the category. And again, we are still sort of the, relatively speaking the new kid on the block in healthcare generally. We were -- in 2010, we did about $55 million of healthcare and you know where we are now. So our position is one that isn't -- is emerging relatively quickly. It's in a category where a lot of the product today tends to be transactional rather than long-term subscription. So we're working very hard to secure that business. But it's also the case that the customers themselves are going to have a view about exactly how rapidly they're looking to grow their own books of business and how rapidly they're looking to grow their engagement with us. And so those are essentially the moving piece parts. And in the middle of all of that, our goal is to become an increasingly relevant part of what it is that they do. So certainly, if there were opportunities to trade off price with volume, we would take a look at those because we want to be a leader. And this is a moment where we're introduced to new customers that we haven't worked with before, and we're expanding relationships with existing accounts, and all of that is -- it's very dynamic. And we're open to what the right way to go about optimizing that going forward.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay, fair enough. And then, I guess, just within the healthcare space as well, I mean, and in line with your commentary around an active M&A pipeline, can you maybe talk specifically on how you see your mix shifting towards maybe a little more M&A now that you've been a couple of years so without doing much in that space?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. Well, as you know, 2012 was actually a very active year for us in M&A. So there was a little bit of -- we needed to fulfill our commitments with respect to our leverage, and we accomplished that. But otherwise, we remain as active in them M&A process as we've ever been. We -- and I would just underline that we continue to be thoughtful about what we think is the right assets, and we're certainly looking hard at what are fair valuations. I think it's fair to say that in this time of relatively cheap money, valuations have tended to move up. There have been several transactions this year around assets that, from the headline level, at least you would have said, "Gee, isn't that really logical for Verisk." But as we looked at them, we thought very long and hard about valuation and what we thought was the right way to use our shareholders' money and in some cases, took a pass. But we're as active as ever, and we remain very committed to the M&A agenda as part of long-term value creation here.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And just, Mark, finally on the mortgage side, can you -- what is the mix between forensic and the front-end piece? And just to clarify, in your comments, you said that the front end, the one tied to originations was down as much as the market was?
Mark V. Anquillare: That is correct. So what we've seen is, at one point, the forensic was as much as 60% of the business. I think we're kind of trending towards that 50-50 at this point. And to clarify, yes, we have seen a lower or lighter decline on the forensic side. And with regard to the front end of the business, which is more closely tied to originations, it was kind of down consistent with what has been a drop in the overall market in the a number of originations there.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Could you give us a sense of, Scott, of the performance of some of your acquisitions in revenue and quality intelligence? That seems to be the area within healthcare where you've been most active from M&A standpoint, in particular MediConnect. As you look at the properties you've acquired over the last couple of years, have they performed about in line with your buy plan?
Scott G. Stephenson: They have, yes. They -- and one of the things that we talked about a couple of quarters ago, actually, when we were characterizing MediConnect upfront, was that we thought that something unique would happen when we put MediConnect together with the assets of what we used to call HRP because essentially we were now sort of fulfilling a value chain where it began with chart abstraction and ends with the analytics to support the payer in making their argument for their cost and quality outcomes. And so we had -- we were putting all of those assets together. And in fact, what we saw over the course, particularly of third and fourth quarter 2012 and first and second quarter of 2013, was that some demand was essentially liberated by virtue of our ability to provide that end-to-end solution. And you certainly saw that in our results and in the substantial organic growth that took place there. That effect continues to occur, and that's why we believe that we're going to have a very healthy level of growth in the healthcare business next year. But there was sort of a moment in time response to a capability that just was not there for us prior to the 2 assets coming together. And each of them individually has continued to do well. MediConnect has very much been operating according to plan.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Good. And just as a quick follow-up, historically, you don't provide growth rates for the 3 segments within healthcare. But in light of the slowdown this quarter, can you give us just some broad ranges on growth for Enterprise Analytics, Payment Accuracy, and revenue and quality intelligence?
Mark V. Anquillare: This is Mark. I mean, I think we tried to characterize earlier the nature of the growth there, it has been primarily driven by some of the RQI. The other 2 businesses have continued to perform nicely but not at the levels of RQI.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: So all 3 businesses actually grew within healthcare in the quarter?
Mark V. Anquillare: All businesses were strong. As we kind of think about the businesses, we think there's opportunities across the board, yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Clark with KBW.
William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Just one more on healthcare. How long is the typical implementation in RQI? So if you get those 3 customers locked in, how long would it normally take for us to see a meaningful contribution to the top line there?
Scott G. Stephenson: It's sort of weeks to months. So it's -- and it all depends on -- in many ways, it actually depends on the nature of the customer's operations. But think of it as several weeks to sort of a low count in terms of number of months.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: In the past, you guys talked about seasonality in the healthcare business. Is there anything we should be thinking about as we model healthcare for next year?
Scott G. Stephenson: I think the one thing that we are trying to do, so we get a little bit away from some of the seasonally is we have tried to work with our customers so there wouldn't be quite as much kind of second half demand so that the opportunity and their needs are spread more broadly across the entire year. I think we've been somewhat successful there, but I think you're going continue to see more in the second half of the year. Typically, that was in that 60% to 70% range. So hopefully, we're trending towards the lower percentage there as we're thinking about that in the future.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I'll now turn the call back over to Scott for closing remarks.
Scott G. Stephenson: Okay. Well, we appreciate everybody being with us for the call. We appreciate all the questions, and we certainly understand the interest in our -- the healthcare part of our business. We remain focused on making it a really very strong and important part of Verisk. It's a long march but one in which we're very confident. We're also very excited about a lot of other things happening in our business. And the agenda remains focused on innovation, and we believe that we are becoming an increasingly strong company with respect to innovation and growth. And so we look forward to being with you again next quarter, and thanks for your time today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Verisk Analytics Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer, Corporate Finance and Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Houston, please go ahead.
Eva F. Huston: Thank you, April, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our second quarter 2013 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until August 30, 2013 on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect the performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you, Eva, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot of exciting initiatives underway, and we are energetically pursuing our data analytic agenda. Before I get to the future, I'd like to talk a little bit about our results in the quarter, with which I'm pleased. In second quarter 2013, we delivered strong overall performance with total revenue growth of approximately 13% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of 17%. Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the second quarter was approximately 8%. Organic revenue growth was 9.5% in the quarter, excluding our mortgage analytics business with its macro challenges. Profitability was strong, with an EBITDA margin of over 44% in the quarter even while we continue to invest in innovations as discussed previously. Year-to-date free cash flow growth, adjusted for last year's voluntary pension payment and the timing of a tax benefit in the first quarter of this year, was about 8% as we continue to generate strong operating cash flow, while we also elected to invest some of it into capital expenditures related to our investment initiatives. We are focused on delivering value to our shareholders, and we remain disciplined in our use of capital. We also remain active in looking at M&A. There have been a few sizable assets on the market recently, which you no doubt are aware of, but none of these met our criteria. So we declined to pursue them. We continue to focus on assets with a strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth prospects. In the quarter, we returned capital to our shareholders through repurchases of $116 million. We also refreshed our buyback authorization in the quarter by $300 million. We will continue to use our authorization consistent with our capital allocation strategy, as we've previously outlined. As we look to the future, we need to continue to be thought leaders in analytics. As we've discussed, we are making significant investments in certain areas this year, including Touchstone, which is our catastrophe modeling platform; the unified platform in healthcare; aerial imagery; and supply chain analytics. All of these are going well and are in various stages of development and rollout. The first 2, Touchstone and the unified platform, are active with our clients. We're getting a great response on Touchstone, and we're seeing incremental value in our contracts with customers who have moved to the new platform. The unified platform in healthcare is also leading us to better results for customers and payment accuracy, where we have completed that phase of implementation. Aerial imagery is a wonderful initiative. It involves gathering images, but much more importantly, using those images to generate data that can be analyzed via computer vision. Initial customer feedback from pilots and evaluations have been very positive. And we're very excited about the imagery initiative, and we may choose to pull some of the intended 2014 investment forward into the second half of 2013 and the 2015 investments into next year. In addition, the supply chain platform is progressing well with very good conversations with customers on the functionality, as they're looking for it. We also are putting a lot of energy in deleveraging the value of our data and analytics across our enterprise. Everyday, we're discovering new ways in which different parts of our organization can collaborate for the benefit of our customers. We're able to do this effectively with our current leadership, and I've recently asked some of our leaders to bridge to added responsibilities that logically relate to their current responsibilities. For example, we're looking to do more work related to climate science across our AIR and AER businesses. We're also increasing our efforts to drive growth in Risk Assessment across the various categories, and we're adding to our leadership teams in the supply chain and corporate marketing areas. In this way, we have the best chance of remaining in touch with our markets and our customers, while expanding our collective ability to see and pursue our joint opportunities. Leadership is a key principle of the Verisk way, which you've heard me talk about before; and this is a natural way to ensure the development of our people. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. We're pleased with our performance in the second quarter, in which we delivered both revenue growth and increased profitability while also investing for the future. In the second quarter, total revenue grew 12.9%, and organic revenue grew 7.8%. The results reflect the continued excellent revenue performance in healthcare, accelerating revenue growth in Insurance Solutions and another strong quarter contribution of -- from Argus. Mortgage revenue growth remained a headwind to overall growth. Excluding our historical mortgage business, revenue growth organically grew at 9.5%. For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 16.6% revenue growth, of which 8.3% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of Argus and Aspect. Beginning in the quarter, MediConnect is a part of the organic revenue growth in the healthcare category. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 9.5% in the second quarter and 8.9% organically, excluding the acquisition of Aspect. We had discussed our expectation of accelerating growth in the combined insurance this year and are pleased to see results headed in that direction with 7.9% organic revenue growth, including Risk Assessment. Our underwriting solutions delivered strong growth, and we saw a continued double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter. Our claims solutions also contributed to the growth. In financial services, which includes both Argus and the mortgage analytics business, revenue grew 43.1% in the quarter. Argus is an excellent business, performing very well since the acquisition in the third quarter of 2012. You will recall that Argus is a very ISO-like business, serving as a trusted, neutral intermediary using a contributory data model to help create analytics, which are deeply embedded in our customers' processes. The growth outlook in Argus remains positive, including through international expansion and partnering opportunities, as well as additional penetration of existing customers. We have seen growth of over 20% year-to-date at Argus on a pro forma basis and feel good about delivering or exceeding our estimate of mid-teens growth in 2013. The mortgage portion of financial services revenue declined 8.9% in the second quarter. Our origination revenue continues to grow, while our overall mortgage revenue declined due to the ongoing normalization of the forensic piece of the business. We're glad to see the decline in forensics slow this quarter. In addition, while early stage, we are seeing strong growth in some product sets that are an extension of the type of work we do in the forensic side, but aimed at the underwriting market. As we've said previously, we continue to believe the full year 2013 results may be similar to the revenue decline of about 11% we saw in 2012. Healthcare continued to deliver excellent revenue growth of 21.3% for the second quarter, all organic. We were especially pleased with the growth in our RQI division, which reflects the combination of our Revenue Integrity and HEDIS Reporting businesses, as well as MediConnect, which is now organic. We continue to find traction with our solutions in the market. Our sales efforts in the quarter were strong and as we continue to add new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers. In the quarter, of the new contracts we signed, 1/2 were with new customers. We are winning sizable contracts even larger than we have won historically, with important new and existing customers, which we expect will benefit us in 2014 and forward. We continue to be excited about the opportunity in the healthcare space, and we expect growth to remain well above the corporate average rate. As we've noted previously, the growth percentages naturally will be impacted, as we grow off of a larger base. We're coming off of some tough comparisons from the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2012. There has also been some opportunity for us to trade off between near-term pricing for higher, long-term committed volumes. These are all very good customers, where we see these arrangements as win-win for our long-term relationships. To provide you with some additional visibility as you think about your models, we expect full year organic growth in healthcare to be about 20%. And given the current pipeline, we expect growth in 2014 to continue in the same range, even when our businesses has more than doubled in size since 2011. Our specialized markets revenue grew 2.4% in the second quarter. Growth in weather and climate analytics was affected by lower growth in government contracts. We are pleased to see continuing traction in our efforts to repurpose our intellectual property to meet strong demand from our P&C industry customers. Growth in the environmental health and safety solutions was driven by ongoing customer agreements, moderated by lower volumes and some customer implementation projects. We think about AER and 3E as long-term options on the growing use of analytics around climate and supply chain and see them as longer-term elements of our growth strategy. Turning to Risk Assessment. For the second quarter, we reported revenue growth of 7%, indicating the value of -- to our long-standing insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 5% in the quarter, reflecting our 2013 invoices, which were effective January 1. The acceleration from this year's first quarter reflected the one-time revenue in the first quarter of 2012, which we've talked about before. Our property-specific information revenue grew 13.9% in the quarter. This increase was from new sales and higher volumes from certain customers, as they commit to extended long-term contracts, as well as incremental revenue contributions due to the expiration of a revenue sharing agreement with a technology provider in the fourth quarter of 2012. EBITDA for the second quarter was $185.6 million, as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 13.3% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 44.1%, even as we invested in our business. Acquisitions did not have any material effect on the consolidated EBITDA margin in the quarter. As we discussed with you last quarter, we have an ESOP in place, which was approaching its final distribution date in December of 2013. In May, we extended the allocation of the remaining unreleased shares through 2016. As a result, we will not incur a non-cash charge, as there is no termination distribution in 2013 in excess of our usual 401(k) match. The DA, or Decision Analytics, margins were 37.2% in the second quarter of 2013 versus 38.3% in the second quarter of 2012. The margin in the quarter reflects investments we have previously outlined. We remain very comfortable with the margin and the modest near-term impact, as we see opportunity to drive faster and sustainable top line growth into the future. In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 56% versus 52.8% in the second quarter of 2012. Our margins were helped in the quarter, partly as a result of higher levels of compensation in 2012 related to stock compensation vested for employees over the age of 62. We told you at the beginning of the year that we expected our 2013 EBITDA margins to be flat to modestly down compared to 2012, and that is still our expectation. We will continue to invest in our business to be prepared to support our important contract wins from the first half of the year, even in advance of the 2014 revenue. Additionally, we have been discussing some of the investment opportunities, including data acquisition for aerial imagery, which flows through our P&L. We expect these investments to help contribute to future top line growth and cash flow, as customer demand is supportive of our initiatives. Based upon the positive customer response, we are considering pulling forward some investments from 2014 into this year and investments from 2015 into the next. The net effect of all of this is that we feel very confident that we'll be able to hit the high end of our 43% to 45% EBITDA margin range in 2013, and we will continue to drive EBITDA and free cash flow growth. We can expect that in 2014 and forward as we continue to invest in new initiatives and accelerate them as appropriate, which will keep our margins in this current range. Our interest expense was $2.3 million in the second quarter versus the respective period in 2012. This increase was due to higher debt balances taken on during 2012 related to our acquisitions. We ended second quarter with total debt of about $1.4 billion and no outstanding revolver borrowings. The debt balance reflects the repayment of -- in the quarter of about $45 million of outstanding long-term private placement debt that matured in April of 2013. Our reported effective tax rate was 36.2% in the quarter. As we've discussed with you previously, we've been actively working on our tax planning strategies, and we're rewarded by the benefits resulting from this effort, again, in the quarter, as well as some small-time, one-time benefits. We now expect the full year tax rate to be between 37% and 38% for the full year 2013. We expect the normalized rate to be about 38% in 2014 and forward. Coming down to the net income line. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense, less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 17.6% to $94.9 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.55 for the quarter, an increase of 17%. The average diluted share count was 172.5 million shares in the quarter. On June 30, 2013, our diluted share count was 171.7 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased 1.9 million shares for $116.1 million. At quarter end, we had about $306.6 million left under our authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized rates of return of over 25%. For 2013, we will continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution. Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, our cash and cash equivalents were about $172.6 million. Total debt, both long term and short term, totaled $1.4 billion. As I mentioned before, the debt balance reflects repayment in the quarter of about $45 million of our outstanding long-term private placement debt that matured in April 2013. We have another $100 million in private placement debt maturing in August, which we expect to repay from cash on hand or other debt. Today, our incremental debt capacity is over $900 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Our debt to pro forma EBITDA for June 30 was 1.9x, a little below our steady-state target. As you know, we're willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because we feel our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly. In the first half of 2013, free cash flow, we which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $182.6 million, an increase of about $33.2 million or 22.2% versus the first half of 2012. Free cash flow year-to-date, adjusted for the timing of excess tax benefits and the prior-year voluntary contribution of -- to our pension was $218.7 million, reflecting growth of 7.8% compared to the first half of 2012. Our capital expenditures were 7.8% of revenue in the first half of 2013, consistent with the incremental investments we discussed last quarter. Free cash flow represented 50% of EBITDA in the first half of 2013. Adjusted for the timing of items we mentioned previously, free cash flow represented 59.9% of EBITDA. As we think about capital spending for 2013, we are still expecting $115 million for the full year, including the $20 million of investment initiative spending. As you think about your models for the full year 2013, we anticipate amortization of intangibles of about $64 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $74 million and now a tax rate between 37% and 38%. We aim to keep share counts flat through our repurchase program. And at our current debt balances, our current quarterly interest expense is $19 million. Overall, our business is performing very well. We have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals, and we continue to invest for the future. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My first question was just on the comments you made on the aerial imagery investments, pulling that forward. Is there going to be any -- I guess, maybe just a little more color on what those planned investments were that you're pulling forward? And would there be any associated revenue through those initiatives that will come along with that, or is it just 1 investment for the future?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. This is Scott, Manav. Thanks for the question. So the investments we're making in aerial imagery, they really fall into 2 different categories. One is we're actually acquiring a lot of aerial images. And so, we have to pay for that, and we pay for that in 2 different ways. We work with third parties who have already sourced images. But much more importantly, we're sourcing our own images, which are much more granular and precise than what generally tends to be available. Our sweet spot is in image, where a pixel is about 1 inch to 1.5 inches. Whereas, most of what you see, for example, if you look at Google Earth, when you're looking at a building on Google Earth, a pixel is about 6 inches and not adequate for the kind of automated analysis of the image that we want to engage in. I mentioned computer vision before. That's the field of science and technology that is related to automatically extracting data from a photographic image. So, a, we have to acquire the images; and, b, we're building the capability to both house the images and the technology associated with their automated rendering. So that's the investment program. The part of it which becomes more significant, where the P&L is concerned that becomes more period expensed, is the acquisition of the images. And, yes, we definitely expect that there will be a revenue response to the images that we're acquiring. What we are working on right now is at what rate do we need to acquire the images in order to respond to what we see as the growing demand for the category. This all relates very strongly to what we do with Xactware in the repair cost estimating category. So to date, we actually do relate aerial images to all of the repair cost estimating we do in Xactware. But it's not at the level of analysis or granular detail that we're moving. And so, it's an extension of our -- it's an extension of the business that we're already in. We do generate a little bit of revenue from aerial imagery today, but we see it as a very, very substantial opportunity. So, yes, we do definitely expect that revenue will follow. But since it's a relatively new category for us, that's where the investment, particularly the acquisition of the images, may need to lead the revenue to some degree.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And you guys, I guess, maintained the full year CapEx. So does that mean that this will substitute some other investments, or is that subject to change once you guys do decide that you're going to pull forward these investments?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes. Let me just take this. This is Mark. There are parts of this initiative and many others, where there's actual programming time that could be capitalized and put on our balance sheet. However, when you purchase data, it is required to be expensed. So when we talked about the CapEx numbers being relatively unchanged, I think that's consistent with what we said in the past. This, that we're calling out, actually has direct effect on the P&L because we are expensing the aggregation of images.
Scott G. Stephenson: And do let me just clarify on one thing. Mark talked about purchasing data. In the case of aerial imagery, most of what we're doing -- we're not buying it from someone else. We're actually generating the data ourselves. But it is, as Mark said, a period expense.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And then, one more for me. Could you -- Mark, could you remind us of -- in the past, you've talked about the seasonality on the healthcare side with, I guess, the more weighting in the second half. Any changes to that mix or, sequentially, anything that you can help us model it?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes. Historically, it has always been a -- healthcare, as a whole, has been a 40-60 type of seasonal split. So 40% on the first half, 60% on the second. We continue to try to bring that, kind of, more in line over the course of the year. But that is just the nature of the business right now.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: When talking about the 20% growth in healthcare -- and thank you for clarifying your goals in that segment. Is that an organic growth initiative? Meaning, is that the organic goal? And then, additionally, since you said 20% this year, 20% next year, I just wanted to ask, is it kind of a lumpy business with new customer implementations? And so, we probably could expect some volatility quarter-to-quarter, right?
Scott G. Stephenson: So, Andrew, it's Scott. So first of all, yes, we are talking organic growth rates when we're talking about the view for 2013 and the view for 2014. I'm not sure I would say lumpy exactly, but one thing that is going on in the business is, because of our growing presence in the healthcare field, one of the things that we're finding is that the size of the contracts that we're able to sign, in some cases, are becoming substantially larger than the average contract size that has to date applied in the business. And I'm talking about sales that we have secured and sales that we're very close to securing, neither of which have actually worked their way into the P&L yet. So I'm not sure I would use the phrase lumpy when talking about it in that way, but I do think that we're finding that the scale of the opportunities that were in front of us is getting bigger.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And also, when you speak about new customers, are we mostly talking about Medicare Advantage Plans being added or new customers a lot broader now?
Scott G. Stephenson: More broader than that. It's still the case that the lion's share of our business is with the health plans. But we've actually seen some very encouraging things happen with respect to the EA suite moving into the provider world.
Operator: Your next question is from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: First, I just wanted to ask on the most recent comments about seeing the bigger contracts. Is that a reflection of seeing broader solutions being adopted, kind of, all at once by the clients? Or is it that they're taking on a bigger chunk of the claims activity or some other factor? I guess, what's driving the bigger contracts?
Scott G. Stephenson: It is both. Although, I would say that the primary effect in the contracts that I had in mind with the prior comment is a deeper penetration inside of, in 1 case, an existing customer and, in another case, an entity that was not a customer previously.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay...
Scott G. Stephenson: [indiscernible] with an existing solution side.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And as we think about organic growth for healthcare, what impact does MediConnect being rolled into that overall organic growth rate have? I don't think it was growing quite as fast as the rest of the healthcare channel...
Scott G. Stephenson: Actually, MediConnect's organic growth rate is very healthy. And the fact that it has moved into the organic category is not having any downward effect on the overall organic growth rate of the group.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And then, just 1 follow-up on mortgage is -- the lessening -- or the smaller pace of decline -- I guess, you talked about some newer solutions you see growing there. But did you see -- I guess, is the smaller pace of decline related to those newer solutions, or is it that the fraud piece is declining by a smaller amount? Or did the kind of origination side tick up? I guess, I'm just trying to...
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, it's really both effects. So it's how big was the forensic piece. And now, as we move towards absolutely smaller numbers and the smaller fraction of what we do, any further shrinkage in the amount of business that we're doing there just proportionately is less impactful on the Interthinx case. And then, on the other side of it, yes, these new solutions are finding their place in the market and definitely having an effect on the overall outcome.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. And, Mark, the 11% decline, does -- was that for the year, and does that factor in that Argus gets dropped into organic in Q4?
Mark V. Anquillare: So let me just describe the 11%. I was talking specifically about the mortgage analytics business. And what we did last year, that would be 2012 full year, the mortgage analytics business was down about 11%. What we've been saying is that the full year 2013, we think, it will also be down about 13%. So obviously, we'd be down more than that in the first quarter. And hopefully, we'll start to see some stabilization and some growth, as we progress towards the end of this year for mortgage only. That does not have any...
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. So not that overall practice, if you will? Just that piece of it? Okay.
Mark V. Anquillare: Correct. Negative 11% for both years for mortgage.
Scott G. Stephenson: And bear in mind, again, as Mark reported, financial services overall grew more than 40% in the quarter.
Operator: Your next question is from David Togut with Evercore Partners.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: It's Rayna Kumar for David Togut. Could you talk about the specific factors that drove the deceleration of your healthcare segment from 39% revenue growth in the first quarter to 21% in the second quarter? And maybe if you can just give us an update on business trends and the growth rate of each of your 3 major businesses within healthcare?
Scott G. Stephenson: So let me start off there, and Mark may want to add something there. Let me go back to second quarter of 2012 in order to kind of give you some perspective on the growth rates that healthcare -- the organic growth rates that healthcare has been turning in overall. So you'll remember that, in April of 2012, we acquired MediConnect. There's a suite of services that we provide, which are inside of the RQI division of healthcare. And essentially, what we're trying to do is to help health plans understand the quality with which they do what they do and to relate that to the cost that it requires them to do what they do. And we do that so that companies can be viable inside of the private insurance world, so that they can be viable with respect to Medicare Advantage. But that's the essence of what we're doing over there. There was pent-up demand for those services, and one of the things that we need to do to deliver the service is to access medical records. And so, we had a method. We have methods actually for doing that prior to the acquisition of MediConnect. But there was pent-up demand for those set of services. When we acquired MediConnect, what we -- and we talked about this at length, what we created was the ability to actually process faster because of the integration of the 2 businesses. And so, we began to respond to that pent-up demand as we moved into the third and the fourth quarter and even into the first quarter of 2013. And so, if you look at our growth rates inside of health, part of what was going on was that response to the pent-up demand. So I think what you're seeing when you compare, for example, first quarter to second quarter is that, that line of business is still healthy. It's still very growing nicely. But there was a particular reaction, which we expected based upon our increased capacity by virtue of bringing in MediConnect, and that was working very powerfully last half of last year and even into the first quarter of this year. And again, it's not that the effect has gone away, it's just that there was so much demand behind the dam. We don't really talk about specifically about the 3 divisions, but I'll just say that they're all important to the performance of Verisk Health. We're looking to all of them to grow. Just 2 weeks ago, we diligence-d the pipelines for each of the 3 divisions. They're all looking very healthy. And so, we have high expectations for all of them going forward.
Operator: Your next question is from Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: About Risk Assessment growth, how sustainable is the growth in the property-specific and underwriting piece of the business? I mean, do you anticipate staying at the high end of that 5% to 7% range that you have talked about in the past?
Mark V. Anquillare: So, Suzi, let me just highlight here. I think, common things that we've seen that have been reassuring inside of the property-specific is that we've been able to transition many customers from what are transactional type of purchases to longer-term contracts with higher committed volumes. So that has been a positive. I think we've found some stabilization even inside some of the transaction volumes that were causing some ebbs and flows over the last several years. So that's sustainable. That's positive. At the same time, I think one of the things that we've called out is that we did have a contract. It was a 20-year-old contract with a technology provider that came to an end in 2012. So as a result of that kind of rearrangement -- or change in arrangement, we had benefited from a new arrangement where there's more revenue for us, and we've taken over the partners of technology because we felt it's kind of core to the service. That, in 2013, will be here, will continue into the future, but we do get some benefit from the growth over what was a different arrangement in '12. So I think a good portion of the growth continues, a portion of the growth is onetime and will continue into the future. I don't want to say onetime, but it's more of a one-time growth. Okay?
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then, on specialized markets, I guess, that's been running in the low-single digits. Is there any reason to think that, that should start to pick up?
Scott G. Stephenson: I think that, in the near term, we are still working to essentially transform the categories that those phase [ph] meaning, the supply chain domain and the commercialization of climate science. And so, in the near term, no. In the long term, we think of them as options against really kind of building new categories that don't exist today. And we'll certainly work hard to keep you informed as we feel like we've reached those moments where we've actually -- we've created something substantially new and different. And we're working very hard at that.
Mark V. Anquillare: Let me just -- to emphasize, I mean, I appreciate the question about Risk Assessment. I'd just like to continue to kind of reinforce the fact that I think we kind of think of some of the way we go to market for both the Decision Analytics and Risk Assessment customers. They're the same customers. We're trying to sell a suite. And I think we continue to be effective there with some accelerating organic growth, kind of, across the 2 categories.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Good to see the uptick in your insurance business within Decision Analytics. Could you talk a little bit about some of these newer solutions, whether it's Touchstone or the -- it sounds like you're in the market with that in aerial imaging, which maybe is more of a '14 event. But did we get back to double-digit organic revenue growth within that business this year? Or is that still the longer-term expectation? Or are we, kind of, at what you think is a steady-state for the insurance part of the business today?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, I guess, I would put it this way. I -- we are excited about a number of opportunities to bring more value to our insurance customers. We are at a moment in the P&C industry where there is as much -- or more openness to technology-driven innovation in insurance as, I think, there's ever been. And I think that there's a very settled understanding now that data analytics is going to play a very important role in all of that. So we're -- we really appreciate the relationship we have with our P&C customers, and we -- it's, in many ways, a good moment to be a partner to them, given sort of how their world and, therefore, our world with them is moving. Some of the things that we're talking about, for example, aerial imagery -- just to again go back to that one for a moment, when it fully emerges, it's potentially a very large category. And so, it remains to be seen whether or not we're able to put the solutions together in such a way that they become so compelling that the full market opportunity is realized. But there's a great sense of promise there. Over on the catastrophe modeling side, to just pick another one, the businesses is becoming much more richly featured than it used to be. Basically, our customers used to be primarily interested in the stochastic models. Now equally, they are interested in the decision-support software and the ability to try to pull a lot of observations together derived from the cat modeling world and apply them even at the level of the individual risk. And so, that kind of movement, we think, naturally creates the opportunity to bring substantially more value to the customers than has been there in the past. We haven't really sort of -- a rifle shot, a number in terms of what the organic growth rate is that all of that implies. But the kinds of things that I was just talking about become material relative to the book of business that we already have. And so, we're optimistic. We're leaning into the opportunities in the P&C space.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And as far as the investment pull-forward, I know you've made some comments about EBITDA margin this year. Mark, would the magnitude of the investment pull-forwards have the same sort of impact on your out-year EBITDA margin, whereby we might see revenue growth acceleration but perhaps flat-to-down margin over next year? Is that -- are you pulling forward that much spend, for example?
Mark V. Anquillare: So I think what we would probably need to do is really think about this in terms of we're building a product today, and we wanted to make sure we have a robust product come into market because we have had customers that are excited about it. As we think about, kind of, the pull-forward that we've just talked about, a little of that has to do with, now, customer reaction and customer response. So I think the answer to your question is we have some pretty big kind of CapEx or an expense that we're kind of bringing through in the first half. We would probably continue, as we described and what we kind of hinted towards in the second half. As I get into 2014, it's a little bit tough to marry up kind of the revenue and the expense around those categories. I would see that the investment would be large. I'm not sure if it's going to be materially larger than what you'll see in '13. So from a relative margin perspective, I don't have great visibility quite yet. But I don't -- I wouldn't put margin erosion on it. I would just say we should probably maintain [indiscernible] flatter.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful color. And one more, if I may. When you look at your healthcare -- unified healthcare platform, do you think that's an offering that can start to really move the needle for you next year? Or is this -- are we talking about a multi-year effort as far as revenue incremental revenue from that?
Scott G. Stephenson: I think you should think of it as multiyear, but I do believe the effects will -- I mean, actually, we've already seen the effects. Just to kind of recap for you, we have already implemented the unified platform for large customers in the payment accuracy division. Next up is the Enterprise Analytics, and that's a '14 deliverable. And then, we move into RQID in '15. So there are already effects, and we will see more effects in '14 than we have in '13. But it is -- it's a multi-year march. So it's kind of both, really. We will begin to see more and more benefit. I think that it's really when the entire suite has been enabled that the promise of being able to go to the customer and say, "Would you like us to turn this on for you?" is really -- I think that's when we're really there. And the third of the 3 divisions is a 2015 deliverable on that plan.
Operator: Your next question is from Paul Ginocchio with Deutsche Bank.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Earlier, you said about some of the contracts in healthcare hadn't -- aren't fully up to speed yet. You've just signed them, and you've [indiscernible] larger. So as you look at your comment -- we go back to your comments about the 20% growth this year and next. Could you just maybe give us some of the assumptions behind that? How much is some of those new contracts you won just coming up to speed? How much are sort of other contracts you've won kind of scaling up or what's new contracts or new clients?
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure. I think one of the things that we tried to highlight is that it has been a very good new sales year for the first half of '13. But the way customers adopt and implement, it's not always they can go right away. So we may pick up a little bit in '13, but a lot of these things are actually priming for and looking towards 2014. And in large part, because of the nature of this 40-60 revenue split, a lot of it does actually hang on the latter part of the second half of '14. The other thing that we've tried to, at least, mention a little bit, we've had -- some of these contracts for customers have come to us, and they've said, "Let's have a conversation about us giving you bigger volumes and longer-term commitments. Is there a way to marry up kind of some price with these longer commitments?" And we're willing to do that for the right customers and for the right type of volumes. And all of that kind of plays out in a way that probably helps us in '14, and it certainly kind of impacts kind of the way we think about into the future and beyond.
Paul Ginocchio - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So I guess, if I heard you correctly, you're just communicating that your visibility is better based on some of these changes you're talking about?
Mark V. Anquillare: Agreed. I mean, I just can't get into the details of contracts except that we're feeling very good about the pipeline, and it's more of a '14 type of new sales win where we see revenue.
Operator: Your next question is from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.
Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Step back and focus on the insurance portion of the business. Can you just clarify what impact any changes in insurance premium growth has on your business and when that would occur?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. Can I -- let me talk about it generally and then maybe Mark would like to talk about where we are in the premium environment right now. But the thing that we would like you to understand is that there is nothing even close to a 1:1 relationship between what's happening in the world of insurance premiums and our revenue picture. And that's true for a couple of reasons. First of all, something like 40% of our insurance revenue references, in some way, what's happening with respect to premiums. Meaning, inside of our pricing algorithm is some reference made to premium volumes, only about 40% of our revenue is priced in that way. And of that 40%, there are 3 terms in the pricing algorithm. So there's the premium, there's a mill rate that we attach to the premium and then there's a flat fee. And we are annually assessing the 2 terms in that equation that we are responsible for, which is the mill rate and the flat -- and the flat fee. And we're very thoughtful about what we're doing with both of those. And so, it's not the case that there's a linear relationship even in that 40% between where did the premium move year-over-year, where did our revenues move year-over-year. There were actually several years where there was negative premium growth. Recently, several years where there was negative premium growth in the industry, and yet our revenues actually grew. And then, on top of all of that, I would go back to the point that Mark made a couple of minutes ago, which is we think of everything that we do in insurance as a relatively integrated whole. And so, when we think about setting the terms in that pricing algorithm, we have it very much in mind that we want to preserve and extend the opportunity to sell the other parts of our suite, which are not priced that way. And so, what I really want to strongly move you away from is a sense that the premium environment is strongly -- or, I would say, even modestly affecting what our business is doing. Mark, do you want to comment on kind of where we are right at the moment?
Mark V. Anquillare: As an example, I know that there's been some better news with regard to premium growth inside of 2012 relative to, say, 2011. The way we operate in a loose affiliation, 12 premiums would relate to some of our invoicing in 2014. But I will kind of reemphasize Scott's point. What we're trying to do is make sure that there's value to customers, and the customers are looking at the bottom line, how much the invoice is. And we want to make sure that that's fair. We want to make sure that, that is well thought of, so that we can sell other services and other solutions typically from the DA suite to them. And that's the long-term relationship building and the best way for us to win in the long term.
Jeffrey M. Silber - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. I appreciate the clarity. And then, on a different tact. I know you don't do a lot of government business, but if you can just remind us roughly what your exposure is to government business? And did you see any impact from sequestration last quarter?
Scott G. Stephenson: Sure. Government business is rather modest. It sits inside the specialized -- inside of '13, it probably hurt us to the tune of $2 million to $3 million in '13 -- or will hurt us.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: This is Jamie Friedman. 2 questions, 1 for Scott and then for Mark. First, Scott, I was just wondering, financial service, obviously, had a good print. I was wondering if you had any comments on the up-selling characteristics going on within financial service now? And then, moving over to Mark. Mark, if you could comment about the Risk Assessment margin, and your updated guidance was helpful. But specific to Risk Assessment, how we should think about the contribution margin, if you will, longer term? So first on financial service, then on Risk Assessment margin.
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. The deeper penetration of existing customer relationships is a very important theme inside of what's going on in financial services. If I look at the business we do with the retail banks around the credit card line and demand deposits, essentially, up-selling is a very major part of what's happening in that business. And it's really -- and it continues to move through 3 levels. So the first level is the thing that we just love to do at Verisk, and that is build the contributory data set and create an industry-level set of Analytics around that contributory data set. And that's how the whole business got started. The next level then is to take the analytics derived from that and to find ways to apply them more precisely on a customer-by-customer basis. And so, that's the first level of up-sell that goes on. What we found is, even beyond that, we have created such a good analytic environment for retail banking analysis that, at the third level, we actually have a growing number of customers that, actually, in addition to purchasing level 1 and level 2, they also actually want to purchase the analytic environment. They want to license the analytic environment from us, which is, in no sense, cannibalizing what we were doing at the other levels. And so, that really is the story of what's going on with respect to those product sets inside of retail banking, and it continues to be a very important part of the growth that is occurring there. In fact, not -- there's -- we are acquiring new customers partly because that part of our business is actually finding its mark in overseas markets. But if you look at, for example, the United States market, a fair fraction of our growth is moving up that cross-sell ladder from the first stage to the second stage to the third stage, and that continues.
Mark V. Anquillare: Let me jump over to the Risk Assessment. I think what we continue to find promising is Risk Assessment does turn out very nice and stable growth to the extent that, that growth is kind of the above the cost of generally people. We've been able to have some high incremental margins on that business. The operating leverage is strong, and I think we feel very good about that. The one thing I wanted to just highlight, though, is that when we talk about investment, it is across the entire enterprise. And we have high expectations for Risk Assessment around trying to find new opportunities in markets too. And inside that, they have investment initiatives that should certainly be a part of all of this and be considered in. So what you saw in the second quarter was some strength. Remember, a bit of it was the result of the way we recognize expense around options. So if you compared second quarter of '13 to '12, that is -- that piece is a one-time effect. And I just want to caution you to just remember that as you do comparisons from '13 to '12. There is a bit of one-time amount in there.
Scott G. Stephenson: Hopefully, Jamie, that was responsive to your 2 questions.
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over -- back over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you very much. And I just like to thank everybody for joining us for our second quarter earnings call here today. We appreciate your interest and your support, and we look forward to speaking to you again at the conclusion of the next quarter. Thanks very much, and enjoy your day.
Operator: Thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics First Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva F. Huston: Thank you, Christie. And good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2013 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-Q, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days, until May 30, 2013, on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. Now I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you, Eva, and good morning to everyone. In the first quarter of 2013, we delivered strong overall performance, with total revenue growth of over 16% and diluted adjusted EPS growth of about 13%. Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the first quarter was 6.8%. Our organic revenue growth was 9.5% in the first quarter, excluding our mortgage analytics business, which continues to face some macro challenges, as we've discussed with you before. Profitability was strong, with an EBITDA margin of over 44% in the quarter, even while we continued to invest in innovation, as we signaled to you last quarter. Our free cash flow growth, adjusted for the timing of a tax benefit that Mark will describe later, was also strong, increasing over 14% in the quarter. We remain disciplined in our use of capital and we're focused on delivering shareholder returns. We returned capital to our shareholders through repurchases in this quarter of about $22 million. We remain active and disciplined in looking at M&A. We focus on assets with a genuine strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth prospects. Last year, as you know, we spent about $800 million on acquisitions, principally for MediConnect and Argus, and we remain very pleased with last year's acquisitions, both from a strategic as well as a performance perspective. With those high-level results as background, let me just say I'm pleased to continue speaking with you about our strategy, as I've done since our IPO in 2009, but now from the CEO's seat. We will build on the strong platform developed and led for over a decade by Frank Coyne, who I'm delighted to say, remains with us as the Chairman of our board. These are exciting times for Verisk and our over 6,000 employees who have the task, every day, of creating value for our customers, and as a result, for our shareholders. I hope that a lot of you were able to attend or listen to our Investor Day presentations in March, where we shared with you the deep industry expertise and the innovative solutions that we deliver daily. As we've done for many years on our journey, we will continue to emphasize 4 things: first, looking for proprietary data sets and analytic methods; second, developing scalable industry-standard solutions; third, repurposing our intellectual property assets for enhanced value for both existing as well as new customers; and fourth, thinking with what we called the N+1 mindset. We continue to focus on investment opportunities and we're encouraged -- encouraging our teams to bring more forward. As we've discussed, we are funding a number of initiatives in 2013 and we plan to continue to do so into the future. Our list of investment initiatives in 2013 is very exciting and includes: remote imagery; Touchstone, which is our next-generation platform for catastrophe modeling; the unified health care platform and health care data aggregation; and supply chain innovations. Combining the power of analytics with the creativity of all of our team members, we intend to build on the strong financial results we delivered this quarter. The ongoing experience, knowledge and dedication of our employees across our enterprise positions us well for the rest of 2013. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter, in which we delivered both growth and profitability while also investing and planning for the future. In the first quarter, total revenue grew 16.4% and organic revenue growth, 6.8%. The results reflect continued exceptional revenue performance in health care, even as we cycle past strength from 2012, and good revenue growth in our current solutions. Mortgage revenue growth remained a headwind to overall growth. Excluding our mortgage analytics business, organic revenue growth in the quarter was 9.5%. In the first quarter, our Decision Analytics segment delivered 24.4% revenue growth, of which 7.8% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of MediConnect, Argus and Aspect. Next quarter, MediConnect will be part of the organic revenue growth in the health care category. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 8.8% in the first quarter and 8.3% organically, excluding the acquisition of Aspect. Our underwriting solutions delivered strong growth and we saw continued double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter. Our claims solutions, which are well penetrated, also contributed to growth. We continue to innovate in these areas, as well as others, to add to the growth. In financial services, which includes both Argus and the mortgage analytics business, revenue grew 28.1% in the quarter. Argus is an excellent business, performing very well since the acquisition in third quarter of 2012. Argus is on track to deliver at least mid-teens growth in 2013, as discussed at the time of the acquisition. The mortgage portion of the financial services revenue declined 19.1% in the first quarter. Within our mortgage tools area, we are seeing recent trends continuing. Our origination-related revenue continues to grow, while our mortgage revenue declined due to the ongoing normalization of the forensic piece of the business. In thinking about the mortgage portion of financial services for 2013, we continue to believe the full year 2013 results may mirror the revenue decline of about 11% we saw in the full year 2012. Health care continues to deliver exceptional revenue growth, 93.9% total revenue growth for the first quarter and organic revenue growth of 39%, which exceeded our expectations. Our total revenue growth benefited from the second quarter 2012 addition of MediConnect, another acquisition that has performed strongly. The performance to date continues to validate our strategy of combining our revenue integrity and HEDIS reporting businesses with MediConnect to create a comprehensive solution, which we call Revenue and Quality Intelligence, or RQI. Organically, we continue to add and implement new customers and expand our relationships with continuing customers. I think you got a great feel for the strength of the health care opportunity and the growth prospects at our Investor Day in March. We remain excited about the opportunity. We expect growth to remain well above corporate average from an organic perspective, but percentages, naturally, will be impacted as we grow off of a larger base. Our specialized markets revenue grew 3.6% in the first quarter, with modest growth from our weather and climate analytics, and from our supply chain solutions due to lower growth from government contracts and customer projects. Turning to Risk Assessment. For the first quarter, we reported revenue growth of 5.3%, maintaining the value to our long-standing insurance customers. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 3.6% in the quarter, reflecting our 2013 invoices, which were effective January 1. Excluding about $1 million of nonrecurring license fee revenue in first quarter of 2012, which we discussed last year, industry-standard growth would have been about 4.4%. As a reminder, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, we had included the actuarial services and statistical agency services categories as part of industry-standard programs. Our property-specific information revenue increased 11.1% in the quarter. This increase was from new sales and higher volumes from certain customers, as well as the incremental revenue contributions due to the expiration of our revenue-sharing agreement with a technology provider in the fourth quarter 2012. EBITDA for the first quarter was $179.7 million, as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 12.6% for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 44.6%, reflecting good expense management, even as we invested in our businesses, as previously discussed. Additionally in the quarter, acquisitions mitigated the reported consolidated margin by about 100 basis points. As you know, we have an ESOP in place, which is approaching its final distribution date of December 2013. We are evaluating the potential for extending the ESOP. If we choose not to do so, we could expect to see a noncash charge of up to $27 million in the year, dependent upon the Verisk stock price. In that case, we could also report an adjusted EBIT number, as you have seen us do in the past, to help you better understand the underlying performance of the business. The margins in Decision Analytics were 37.3% in the first quarter of 2013 versus 39.3% in first quarter of 2012. We continue to see a mix shift that impacts margins, as our faster growing businesses, like health care, have not yet scaled to the margins of the more mature businesses. In addition, the margin in the quarter reflects some of the investments that we've previously outlined. We remain very comfortable with the modest near-term margin impact when we see the opportunity to drive faster and sustainable top line growth into the future. In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 56.4% versus 55.4% first quarter of 2012. Our business continues to show scalable profitability, even while we continue to invest in developing new solutions. Also, please recall, our invoices in those increases are generally effective first quarter, and our employee compensation increases begin their impact in the second quarter, leading to higher margins in first quarter relative to second. As noted last quarter, we expect our investments, which are primarily reflected in the Decision Analytics segments, to be weighted more towards the first half of 2013, and could impact the P&L by about $10 million to $15 million in total, which should have the impact of lowering margins. Our investments are in the combination of people, data, hardware and software, some of which flow through the P&L, but some through the balance sheet as CapEx. As you know, our forecast is about $115 million in CapEx for 2013, including about $20 million related to these investments initiatives. We expect our corporate margin will be impacted by modest full year 2013, as our incremental EBITDA margins from existing solutions offset debt. Our interest expense is $3.7 million for the first quarter versus the respective period in 2012. This increase was due to the higher debt balances taken on during 2012 related to our acquisitions. We ended first quarter with total debt of about $1.5 billion and no outstanding revolver borrowings. Our reported tax rate was 36.7% for the quarter. As discussed last quarter, we've been actively working on our tax planning strategies and were rewarded by the benefits resulting from this effort, as well as an R&D tax credit that benefited us in the first quarter. For 2013, the tax rate will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter, however, 38% still seems to be about the right level for your models, perhaps, with a modest bias to a slightly lower rate for the full year. Coming down to the net income line. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 14.3% to $91.2 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.53 for the quarter, an increase of 12.8%. The average diluted share count was 172.8 million shares for the quarter. On March 31, 2013, our diluted share count was 173.1 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased about 382,000 shares for about $21.5 million. At quarter end, we had about $122.7 million left under our authorization. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generalizing annualized IRRs of over 20%. For 2013, we continue to anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution. Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, our cash and cash equivalents were $276 million. Total debt, both the short-term and long-term, totaled $1.5 billion. Today, our total incremental debt capacity is over $850 million and will grow with our EBITDA and cash flow. Our debt to pro forma EBITDA at March 31 was 2x, at our steady-state target. As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities, because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly, as we've demonstrated since our acquisition of Argus in third quarter of 2012. In the first quarter, free cash flow, which we've define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $162.7 million, a decrease of about $10.9 million or 6.3% versus the first quarter of 2012. Adjusting for the timing of excess tax benefits in the quarter, free cash flow in the quarter was $198.9 million reflecting growth of 14.5% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Our capital expenditures were 7.1% of revenue in the first quarter, consistent with the incremental investments we discussed last quarter. Free cash flow representing 90.6% of EBITDA for first quarter of 2013, reflecting our strong first quarter cash flow generation based upon the timing of our customer invoice payments. Adjusting for the timing of the excess tax benefit we mentioned previously, free cash flow represented over 100% of EBITDA. As we think about capital spending for 2013, we're still expecting $115 million for the full year, including this $20 million of investment initiative spending. As you think about your models for the full year 2013, we anticipate amortization of intangible assets of about $64 million, fixed asset depreciation and amortization of about $74 million, and a tax rate of about 38%, with a modest downward bias. We aim to keep share counts flat through our share repurchase program. Overall, our business is performing very well. We have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals, and we continue to invest for the future. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just on the health care side, obviously, you've continued excellent performance, as you talked about, and I think you had mentioned that it definitely delivered some growth better than your internal expectations. I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on where they'd be relative to what you guys were expecting? And also, I think you made a comment on sort of health care as one of the segments that hasn't yet scaled to company margins. Just thinking long term, like, how long and what sort of scale do you anticipate to get before it does get to those set of margins?
Scott G. Stephenson: To your question, the first part, we -- we're actually very pleased with how the different segments of the business are performing, overall. We see them all as very important to our future opportunities in the vertical. So it's not so much any one segment, and, as I think you all know, we're working very hard, actually, to find a way to pull together our data assets so that we can -- into a unified platforms, so that we can actually create even more value. And that capability is going to underpin all of our segments going forward. In terms of the scalability of the business, I mean, you really said it. We haven't yet arrived at a point where the business is fully scaled. Yet, it's coming along nicely. And we see this as a long-term journey as we continue to try to establish leadership inside of the category. Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything to that?
Mark V. Anquillare: No. I think, you're right on. I mean, it's really about life cycle of products. So there's some mature products inside the insurance space, as an example, but we've kind of achieved some relatively high margins. Health care, I think, we scale in each passing quarter. And each passing year, we expect to continue to move along that journey. There's probably some stronger competition in health care than in some of the insurance places where we compete, so that also factors into this space.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then, if I could just ask one more around if you could give a little more color on just what you guys see as your acquisition pipeline? I mean, you guys obviously have a pretty healthy cash balance right now. It seems like one of the highest in a while. What sort of activity is going on in the back end? Any -- just some color around that?
Scott G. Stephenson: We are as active as we've ever been. And we are always proceeding from our strategy as it relates to the M&A agenda. So our case is not really founded so much on sort of the M&A climate overall. It's much more we are proactively in the market, creating relationship and suggesting opportunities. And we continue to find that we have a very high success rate in terms of engaging with companies that -- where there's at least a belief that there may be a strategic fit. So the work of the team continues just as it has. I think we said to you in the past that we certainly see health care as one of the places where we certainly anticipate additional M&A activity. And the work we're doing right now is very consistent with that. So it's really the same picture as it's always been.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: First, I want to just ask broadly about the insurance vertical. I know they're not as much your expectations, but I think some people were hoping this year that kind of the lag impact is insurance premiums going up, as well as maybe some easier weather-related comps would help drive a pickup in the growth rate of that business. And it's more so steady right now, I guess, as we look at the numbers. Is it -- I guess, just trying to get your sense, is that -- is the business performing as you would have expected or were you hope -- is there any hope for kind of a pickup in the growth rate this year, because of those factors?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, you've got a couple of things in there, Tim. First of all, on balance, we are pleased with where we are in the insurance vertical right now. I just want to stress, as a point that we've made consistently, which is we really see -- so the totality of what we do in the vertical. That is really where our strategy lies. We end up talking about RA and DA, and we're happy to do that. But in reality, the way the business works is that we're trying to knit solutions together. It's also the case at customers look to deal with us with respect to the full suite that we're providing them. So it's an all-in-all, so we're really tracking our performance in the vertical overall. So that said, you've referenced weather-related effects, there actually was quietness. There has been quietness recently. So that does factor in somewhere. But we're really just on the sort of the long march of causing our solutions to be valuable and to be deeply embedded with our customers. The net effect of all of that is we do believe that as 2013 moves forward, that we will see acceleration in the revenue growth rate of the insurance vertical.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, thanks. And then, on MediConnect, as that rolls into the business, I think you described to us that it had a tough comp in the year ago period. I know it's not in your numbers, but if we just look -- backed into what it was. But I guess, just going forward, what kind of underlying organic growth rate, as -- just trying to get a sense, if that gets added into the organic growth rate for health care's, does that enhance it or bring it down? Or is it about the same as the rest of the vertical?
Mark V. Anquillare: So we don't give specific guidance, but as you correctly observed, the comp was a tough one because of some roll forward in the prior year. We clearly think that the MediConnect inclusion is going to add to the overall corporate organic growth rate. So happy with that, and I also want to just kind of remind you, when we keep talking about the power of the comprehensive solutions in what we're referring to as RQI, although not direct and explicit, the combined power of the MediConnect acquisition with what was a revenue integrity business, has helped us, on the Revenue Integrity, win business. So it's almost starting to contribute before it's calculated in. I think we feel very good about the opportunities in MediConnect, and the opportunities for RQI overall. And as I said, from a high-level corporate perspective, it should definitely add to the full corporate growth.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Scott, from a high-level standpoint, your businesses seem to be all performing pretty well, with the obvious exception of mortgage. And it's been multiple quarters now, at least on the forensic side. Is there -- could you just give us a sense of your strategic thoughts on that business, because there seems to be a disconnect between all of your other assets and mortgage. Do you remain committed to that? What are your thought processes as we enter '13 now?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes, I mean, the context here has to be the seismic changes in the mortgage marketplace that have occurred over the last several years. And so that's just sort of the backdrop here. And distinguish in your thinking between the automated solutions that we provide, which are aimed at supporting the underwriting process, and the forensic solutions that we provide, which are aimed at supporting the resolution of loans, which have apparently gone bad. And those businesses respond to different things that are going on inside of the mortgage vertical. And it's the latter part. It's the forensic piece that has been going through an adjustment as underwriting standards change so much. And as we move through a bubble of a very large volume of loans which were in trouble, as we begin to normalize, the forensic side of that is naturally going to pull back. The automated solutions that we have in support of the origination process, and a suite of other newer solutions that we put together, all of those are actually very promising. And they're doing very well. And we're very excited about the team that we've got that is leading for us there. And so our focus is on making a success out of the parts of that business that naturally represent the greatest growth opportunity going forward, while trying to minimize the impacts of the market adjustment with respect to the volume of forensic activity. And obviously, the net effect of all of that is what you saw in the first quarter. There comes a point where the downward pull of the forensic adjustment is naturally going to work its way through. And our focus is then on a business, at that point, which -- our aim is to see it be advanced, to -- just to run the Verisk playbook, basically. Newer proprietary forms of data, new analytic methods, a deeper reach into that marketplace. So we're dealing -- our team there is dealing with kind of a once-in-an-economic-lifetime adjustment in the marketplace, and I think they've actually done a very fine job in working their way through that.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: So your view continues to be that, at some point, as we get through this normalization process, that mortgage could have an organic revenue growth rate that's consistent with the Verisk corporate average?
Scott G. Stephenson: That would be our aim.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And one more, if I may. You've talked about the potential for better organic revenue growth and insurance as the year goes along here. I assume that will come mostly from DA. Could you speak specifically about some of the innovations you think that could drive that? Is that part of the early 2013 investment cycle or is this an ongoing process? And is it within your claims solutions set -- subset? Where do you think that pick up might come from?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes, great -- that's a great question. So we're innovating on a number of fronts, but there are a few things that stand up and stand out. First of all, we're very happy with what's going on in our catastrophe modeling business, which continues to demonstrate leadership in all sorts of ways. And it's a very vibrant category, where there are still lots of country-peril combinations to be modeled. And there's a whole new wave of software innovation, which is coming into that business, where we feel that we're at the forefront, we're very happy with that and about all of that. Our underwriting solutions continued to advance very nicely. I think we've described in the past that when you look at the different places where we serve inside of the insurance vertical, we have great strength with respect to the rating, the pricing process for the insurance product, great strength with respect to the claims process and great strength with respect to some of the sort of complex analytics, which wash across all of that, including catastrophe modeling, as I mentioned before, and fraud fighting. In the underwriting category -- so underwriting, not the -- the underwriting, not rating part of the insurance process, we have opportunities to move towards an equivalent leadership position. We're not there today, but we are actually advancing very nicely. And then, some of the investing that we're doing in first half 2013, we hope and expect will be a part of 2013 results towards the back half of the year. We're very excited about opportunities to enhance replacement and repair cost estimating with some new data sets that really haven't been brought into that process before in any measurable way. And so we do expect a contribution from that in the latter half of the year.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: About MediConnect, I think it was about $17 million in the quarter, and I wanted you to first remind us of seasonality, recalling that there was a third and fourth quarter seasonality. I believe MediConnect was down about 28%, if my math is right, sequentially. And they just reported first compared to the fourth quarter. I want to know if that is a normal seasonality for MediConnect. And also, if you're willing to, I want to know if you can give us a pro forma year-over-year growth rate for MediConnect as if it was in place a year ago.
Mark V. Anquillare: So let me answer the question like we have in the past. I think we think of the business as a whole. So let's use health care broadly. It is kind of a 40-60 split, with 40 being the first half, 60 being in the second half of the year and that, kind of including all 3 of those categories with health care. I think, so I guess what I'm trying to focus in on your MediConnect question, just one more time, Andrew, you're talking about growth quarter-to-quarter or are you trying to do year-on-year back in...
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: So, Mark, I was a little sneaky. I kind of asked both. My question is first, is the type of sequential decline that I calculated in the first quarter, which was down sequentially about 28% for MediConnect, being $17 million in the quarter, is that a normal sequential decline? Seasonally, I think it might be, but we don't have the history. And then, I said, secondarily, if you were willing to, could you give us a pro forma growth rate for MediConnect year-over-year as if it was in the quarter a year ago.
Eva F. Huston: Andrew, it's Eva. I just wanted to jump in on your question of sequential. I think it's hard to look at it that way, because the business overall is growing. And so what the sequential differences between 4Q and 1Q kind of gets blended with the overall growth in the business. So I would encourage you to look at it as sort of the front half, back half as opposed to the sequential. I think that's more logical. We had also talked to you last quarter, reminding you that the Q1 '12 MediConnect number, which I believe was the $17 million to $18 million, included $3 million to $4 million of overflow from Q4 of '11. Remember, we have this nature where our customers try to get stuff done in 3 and 4, but sometimes, it goes into January because of the CMS deadline. So just take those into account when you're thinking about it. And I think if you were to look at the numbers, you can see the growth in Q1. If you adjust for that $3 million to $4 million, you probably have something like a 15% to 20% growth rate.
Scott G. Stephenson: And typically, those deadlines for the -- working with CMS is around January 30, and how fast the customers go, whether there's a roll over into the first quarter or everything's done in fourth quarter is sometimes more of a customer-specific requirement.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Right. So if you pull it together, you'd say this was normal seasonality for MediConnect, then?
Eva F. Huston: Yes, but I wouldn't pin that on the percentage number per se, but yes, the seasonality is normal.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Organic growth in specialized markets slipped a little, and you mentioned government as an issue there. Can you talk about how big government is in that segment and what would you expect, as far as organic growth, for the remainder of this year?
Scott G. Stephenson: So, Suzi, I thought that we were going to give you specifics -- I think we feel a couple of things. There's 2 businesses that are generally in there. One is more focused on the environmental health and safety. There, I think we continue to feel good about that business, the supply chain, risk management, doing some investing around that. And I think there's some general excitement. That may have just been a little bit more around timing of the customers and use of products. So, nothing to change perspectives relative to what happened last year. Inside the other piece of the business, which is the climate risk portion, where we do work on behalf of and with the government. Two things happening there. First of all, in the quarter, it was more about a government contract that we just had some less volumes, so really more project-oriented from that government. And that's about 40% of the business. I think the second part of the question, just to kind of give you the furlough and the impact of furloughs on that government-related business, could be something that could affect us. The numbers aren't big to progress for the rest of the year. That's the only thing that's a little bit on our mind with regard to growth rates inside that portion of specialized.
Suzanne E. Stein - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Can you give us any more detail on Argus and the performance there? I guess, what's changed either on the revenue or expense side with the company under the Verisk umbrella?
Scott G. Stephenson: Let me talk about, sort of generally, how it's -- the Argus team and the Argus assets are working into what we're doing at Verisk. We are delighted to have the Verisk (sic) [Argus] team as our partners in Verisk. I would say that, if anything, the -- I would say that the business, its performance and its fit with what we're attempting to accomplish, is even better than we had anticipated and our expectations were pretty strong. The leadership team at Argus is actually already providing leadership broadly inside of Verisk as we work to find opportunities to work across verticals. And we're very encouraged that we've, even in this short period of time since we came together, we've had multiple customers who actually work with Verisk across vertical markets, particularly the insurance and the banking verticals, have actually, specifically, come to us looking for support that we can provide them in optimizing their businesses by taking a look at their books of business across these different categories. And it's just really exciting that the market is responding to what it is that we see there. Specific to Argus as Argus, apart from these opportunities to build in and with the rest of Verisk, the business continues to perform right on top of where we thought it would be.
Operator: Your next question is from Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.
Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: I think you recently had your annual user conference. Any broad themes you were hearing from your customers, anything that incrementally changes your view, I guess, on the spending environment of your clients?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. We had a really great session. And I think you're thinking about with our P&C customers, we had that customer conference last month. We actually engaged with our customers across the different verticals within the verticals. And so that -- the event that we had last month is far from the only one where we pull together with our customers. But if that's the one that you're speaking about, it was a very positive event. And I think the themes that certainly struck me from that session were, number one, that I think a lot of the companies are really leaning in to the notion that they can improve their businesses by making yet more intense use of Data Analytics. And I think that the openness to looking to a third-party like ourselves is at least as high as it's ever been. There's specific and into substantial interest in a few things. One would be the insights derived from weather and climate science. I mean, it's just, if you listen to the earnings calls of most publicly traded insurance companies, their CEOs within the first 2 or 3 paragraphs are relating the weather to last quarter's results, either positively or negatively. And we actually impaneled some senior executives to -- in a plenary session, and that was -- and when asked the question of them, what do you see as the likeliest surprises in 2013, the answers all reduced to a surprise, climactically, either up or down. Happily, between our catastrophe modeling and our climate science, we are in a great position to provide leadership on that. I would also say that the predictive modeling theme is very strong, very active. And then new data sets, which are derived either from telemetry sources or new ways of trying to observe physical assets from a distance, these are 2 themes that are really good. So we feel as if the environment is one in which, if we do our work well and we create good solutions, that the market is very open to what it is that we can do to support them.
Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Great. And, Mark, on the Risk Assessment margins strengths, it was up year-over-year, I think 100 basis points. Was that basically due to the lower pension which was reduced by thinking Q2 last year?
Mark V. Anquillare: The pension change took place last year on March 1. There was very little benefit in first quarter relative to the first quarter of '12 resulting from the pension. This is just more rampant scale inside the business.
Operator: Your next question is from Bill Clark with KBW.
William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Given the new solutions development investing you've been doing in Decision Analytics, which you kind of previously indicated would be concentrated mostly in the first half of the year, can you just give us a sense of if the 37.3% EBITDA margin in that segment is what we should expect to repeat again in 2Q? Or did more of the investment kind of fall on the first quarter and they will start to see that trend back up a little bit?
Mark V. Anquillare: So let me start with that. A couple of things to note. One, I think the factors that contribute to it, yes, investment, clearly, was a part of the 1Q, the margin in DA. The other thing that's important to note is that we talk about the product mix shift. So as you think about products mix, you have health care growing quickly. The margins there, because it's a less mature business, don't have quite the same current margins as some of those insurance products. So that draws down or kind of hurts the margins, too, a little bit. I also want to remind you about the seasonality, to the conversation we had earlier, there's a level of fixed cost inside of all of our health care business. And to the extent that you think about revenue kind of being 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half of the year, that helps for and bolsters some of the margins for health care as you think about 2 -- this 2 half as opposed to the first half. I think all of those are kind of a part of the mix for DA.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Scott Stephenson for any closing remarks.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you very much. We appreciate your questions today, your interest in our company, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you very much, and enjoy your day.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's Senior Vice President, Treasurer, Corporate Finance and Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva F. Huston: Thank you, Steve, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our fourth quarter 2012 financial results. With me on the call this morning are: Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Frank, Scott and Mark, highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the 10-K, can be found in the Investors section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days until March 28, 2013, on our website and by dial-in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And now I will turn the call over to Frank Coyne.
Frank J. Coyne: Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In fourth quarter 2012, we delivered strong overall performance of over 18% total revenue growth and 26% diluted adjusted EPS growth. For the full year, total revenue growth was 15% and diluted adjusted EPS growth was 20%. Our consolidated organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter was 6.7%, reflecting strong growth in healthcare and good growth in insurance solutions, offset by weakness in mortgage. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 9.4% in both the quarter and for the year. Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin of over 45% in the quarter and for the year. Free cash flow was also strong, increasing over 25% in 2012, even after our pension funding in the earlier part of the year. In the fourth quarter, our Risk Assessment revenue grew 5%, after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics in 2012, and also grew 5% for the year, reflecting the value to our long-standing insurance company customers of our industry-standard insurance programs and property-specific data. In Decision Analytics for the quarter, our revenue grew almost 30% and our insurance solutions grew about 10%, even as transactional claims activity related to Sandy and other storms was captured under existing contracted customer minimums. Our healthcare solutions continued their excellent organic growth, growing revenue about 28% organically in the quarter. Total healthcare revenue growth was almost 90%, including the contributions MediConnect continues to make. In the quarter, we generated over $70 million in revenue from our healthcare business. In financial services, we continue to be pleased that Argus' performance has been on target and our future expectations remain on track. Within our mortgage tools, we are seeing recent trends continuing. Our origination-related revenue continues to grow ahead of the origination market, while our overall mortgage revenue declined, although slightly less than we expected it to when we talked to you last quarter. We will continue to face challenges in mortgage in 2013 as the forensic business moves back towards normalized level. But overall, our business is now more diverse in both customer and solution set. We remain disciplined on our use of capital and are focused on delivering shareholder returns. In 2012, we spent about $800 million on acquisitions, primarily MediConnect and Argus. We find the results of our acquisitions encouraging and believe our shareholders should be pleased by this use of capital, as evidenced by strong initial results and strategic fits. Our share repurchases remained moderated in the quarter at $35 million as we continue on the path to meet our commitments to our debt holders. Total repurchase activity in 2012 was $163 million. We continue to be active in looking at M&A but also continue to maintain our discipline, focusing on assets with a true strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth prospects. In this quarter, and more importantly, for the full year 2012, we had strong financial results. The ongoing experience, knowledge and dedication of our employees across our enterprise position us well for 2013. You've also seen the announcement last week that I will be transitioning the CEO role to Scott Stephenson in April. I am pleased to continue to serve on the board as Non-Executive Chairman. Scott has been a key member of our management team for over a decade and is the right person to carry forward our culture of performance. Now I'll turn it over to Scott for an update on some of our initiatives.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you, Frank, very much. These are exciting times for Verisk, and I'm really very pleased that we will have the continued guidance and counsel that Frank will be providing as Chairman of our board. As you all know, we have strong team running our businesses on a day-to-day basis, and you'll be hearing directly from many of them at our Investor Day on March 7. Our deep industry expertise has made us successful and will continue to help us enhance and develop new analytic and data-driven solutions for our customers now and into the future. Another driver of our success is our culture of innovation and continuous improvement. About a month ago, our leadership team was together and we had a chance to talk about the ways we can continue to drive innovation and the analytic mindset throughout our 6,500 employees. Our teams are energized, and we have a good crop of investment opportunities that we will be funding in 2013 and beyond. For example, remote-sensing and imagery is one of those. We are gathering images that can be used to identify risks beforehand and then quantify them afterward. Something else that we talk about a lot is the idea of the N+1 data set. At Verisk today, we have about 5 petabytes of data, which definitely qualifies us as a big data shop. Our creativity in analyzing these data to develop new solutions will allow us to make our individual proprietary data assets into new data sets by combining them with other data sets. If there are N data sets in the world, we can have more insight by creating N+1. If our customers have N data sets, we can create more insight by creating N+1. Always, always looking to add more value. With that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover some of the financial results in more detail.
Mark V. Anquillare: Thanks, Scott. As you've heard, we are pleased with our performance for both the fourth quarter and full year 2012. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 18.2% total revenue growth and 6.7% organic revenue growth. For fiscal year 2012, total revenue growth was 15.2% and organic revenue growth was 7.3%. Excluding our historical mortgage business, our revenue growth organically in the quarter and the full year was 9.4%. For the fourth quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue delivered 28.7% growth, of which 7.9% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of MediConnect, Argus and Aspect Loss Prevention, as well as the transfer of revenue for the mortgage appraisal tools. As a reminder, in 2012, we transferred revenue related to mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment's property-specific revenue category into Decision Analytics' financial services revenue category. Going forward, in 2013, we will discuss growth rates treating the appraisal tools revenue as a part of Decision Analytics. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category revenue grew 9.6% in the fourth quarter and 9.3% organically, excluding the acquisition of Aspect Loss Prevention. We continued good growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions in the quarter and finished 2012 with 95% market share for public property catastrophe bond modeling. We also saw growth from our loss quantification solutions. As discussed in our third quarter call, we did not expect to see a bump in growth due to Sandy because many of our customers were below minimum contracted claims volumes, and that proved to be the case. Claims solutions delivered good growth. Our underwriting solutions continued to add strong growth. In financial services, which include both Argus and the mortgage business, revenue grew 41.8% in the quarter. Argus is an excellent business, and we remain pleased with the performance since the acquisition in the third quarter, which has exceeded our estimates provided at the time of the acquisition. After adjusting for the acquisition of Argus and the transfer of the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment into this revenue category, in the fourth quarter, revenues declined 19.6%. For all of 2012, revenues declined 11.3%, a result that was slightly better than our expectations as discussed with you last quarter. Consistent with recent trends, mortgage origination tools grew nicely in the quarter and reflected the growth in the mortgage origination market. But revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter by more than offsetting them. In thinking about the mortgage portion of financial services for 2013, I believe it's possible we could see a similar decline to the 11% we saw in the full year 2012. Healthcare continues its strong revenue growth, 89.1% for the fourth quarter and 115% for 2012. Healthcare organic revenue growth was 28.5% in the fourth quarter and 36.2% for the full year. Our total revenue growth benefited from the second quarter addition of MediConnect, another acquisition that has performed strongly in 2012. The performance to date validates our strategy of combining our Revenue Integrity and HEDIS reporting solutions with MediConnect to create a comprehensive solution, RQI, or Revenue and Quality Intelligence. Organically, we continue to add and implement new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers. The 2011 acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners became a part of our organic growth calculation in the third quarter. As a reminder, we do have seasonality in our Revenue and Quality Intelligence revenue. As you recall, we generally expect the first half of the year to be seasonally low with more revenue to come in the second half. This means for Verisk Health overall, the shape of our business is going to be in the 60-ish percent towards the second half of the year. Split across quarters can vary depending upon customer needs. Also it means margins are seasonally lower in the first half. And as Verisk Health is scaled, you'll see that more in Decision Analytics. If you are looking at quarters, I would also point out that the performance of MediConnect in the first quarter of 2012 includes $3 million or $4 million of overflow revenue from 4Q 2011, which you should assume won't occur in 1Q of '13. The revenue from 1Q '12 was prior to our acquisition and disclosed in our filings. We continue to feel very good about our growth prospects in the healthcare vertical. Our specialized markets. Revenue grew 4.4% in fourth quarter with good growth from our weather and climate analytics and more modest growth from our supply chain solutions due to customer timing. The revenue category grew 8.3% for the full year. Turning to Risk Assessment. For both the fourth quarter and full year 2012, we reported revenue growth of 2.9% and 5% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer we discussed earlier. Our industry-standard insurance programs grew 5.8% in the quarter, reflecting our 2012 invoices and strong growth in our premium leakage solutions. Beginning in the fourth quarter, we have included the actuarial services and statistical agency service categories as a part of industry-standard programs, that they are closely tied to, and build as a part of our same customer invoices. Our property-specific information revenue declined 6% in the quarter as reported, but excluding the transfer, grew 2.6%. Our customers have received and began paying their 2013 invoices, which are modestly higher than 2012. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $189.6 million, as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 19.4% for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 45.6%, reflecting good expense management. We produced $695.9 million of EBITDA for the full year with margins of 45.4%, including a $13 million decline in pension expense due to the freeze versus 2011, or an 80 bps margin expansion. The margins in Decision Analytics were 40.3% in fourth quarter 2012 versus 40.7% in fourth quarter 2011. Full year margins were 39.8%, flat with 2011. We continue to see a mix shift that impacts margins, as our faster-growing businesses have not yet scaled to the margins of our more mature businesses. In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were 55.4% versus 51.7% in fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year, Risk Assessment margins were 54.6%, up from 51% in the prior year. We benefited by about 180 bps in the margin due to the lower pension costs related to the freeze of our plan. Our business continues to show scalable profitability, but we also continue to invest in developing new solutions. We continue to see opportunities for investing in the future growth. And as you remember, those can create some near-term pressure on margins. In 2013, we expect to invest in remote imagery, in Touchstone, our next-generation platform for catastrophe modeling, and united -- unified healthcare platform and in several interesting data initiatives. We expect that these investments, which will be primarily reflected in the Decision Analytics segment, will be weighted more towards the first 2 quarters of 2013 and could impact the P&L in those periods by about $10 million to $15 million in total, which would also have some impact on lowering margins. However, these are very positive long-term initiatives, and rest assured, we're very happy to be able to invest behind these promising opportunities because they'll ultimately grow EBITDA and cash flow over the long term. We expect our corporate margins will be impacted more modestly, if at all, for full year 2013, as our incremental EBIT margins from existing solutions offset investment. Our interest expense was $5.9 million in the fourth quarter and $18.7 million for the full year versus their respective periods in 2011. This increase was due to the higher debt balances related to our acquisitions. We ended fourth quarter with a total debt of $1.5 billion and had repaid all but $10 million of our revolver borrowings. Our reported effective tax rate was 29% for the quarter and 36.6% for the full year. We have been actively working on our tax planning strategies and were rewarded by the benefits resulting from this effort. The lower tax rate in the quarter contributed about $0.07 to EPS. And we received a favorable state private letter ruling, which contributed about $0.04 in EPS for prior years and about $0.01 for 2012. We do expect this ruling to reduce our taxes in 2013 and future years by about $2 million annually. We also saw another $0.02 one-time benefit due to additional successful tax initiatives. For 2013, as we think about the tax rate, around 38% seems to be the right level for use in your models. Coming down to the net income line. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense less the income tax impact on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 27.1% to $108.7 million for the quarter. Full year adjusted net income grew 19% to $361.3 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.63 for the quarter, an increase of 26%. This included about 7% -- $0.07 related to the tax benefit discussed earlier. Full year adjusted EPS was $2.10, up 20% from 2011. The average diluted share count was 171.9 million shares in the quarter and 171.7 million shares for the full year. On December 31, 2012, our diluted share count was 172.2 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased about 715,000 shares for $34.8 million. For fiscal year 2012, we repurchased 3.5 million shares for $162.6 million, an average price of $46.57. At quarter end, we had about $144 million left under our authorization. As we discussed the last couple of quarters, we moderated our buyback program after acquiring Argus to ensure we meet our deleveraging commitments. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of about 25%. For 2013, we anticipate, at a minimum, buying shares to offset dilution. Turning to our balance sheet. As of December 31, our cash and cash equivalents was about $90 million. Total debt, both short term and long term, totaled $1.5 billion, reflecting debts borrowed to fund the Argus acquisition, which closed on August 31. Today, our incremental debt capacity is over $800 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Also in December 2012, we made a purchase for $27 million of technology and service application, underlying a long-standing product, as our agreement with a vendor came to an end. I'm pleased to report that our debt to pro forma EBITDA at December 31 was 2x, reaching our steady-state leverage rate well ahead of our stated goal of second half of 2013. This is down for the pro forma ratio of 2.35x at the time of the Argus acquisition. As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly. Free cash flow in 2012, which we define as cash from operations plus capital expenditures, was $388.5 million, an increase of about $81.1 million, or 26.4% versus 2011. This increase was despite the funding of our pension, which we have mentioned previously. Excluding the impact of our pension funding, net of tax benefit and certain year-over-year timing items, our free cash flow is up about 19%. Our capital expenditures were about 5.2% of revenue for full year 2012. Free cash flow represented 55.8% of EBITDA for 2012, reflecting improved conversion rate compared to the 51.8% in 2011, despite the $72 million pension funding. As we think about capital spending for 2013, we're expecting $115 million for the full year. This includes the capital related to some of the initiatives I discussed earlier, as well as the consolidation of our data centers into 2 primary locations. The special projects are approximately $20 million of that total capital spend. So you would see the steady-state CapEx closer to $95 million in 2013. Overall, our business is performing very well, and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and continue to invest in the future. With that, I will ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Togut from Evercore Partners.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Congratulations, Scott. Within Decision Analytics, the healthcare organic growth was significantly higher for the fourth quarter than what would have been implied by your outlook on the third quarter call. What differed from your expectations from late October, early November? And is the rate of growth we saw in the fourth quarter sustainable going forward?
Mark V. Anquillare: This is Mark. Let me just give you a quick overview. I mean, I think we continue to feel very optimistic about healthcare. It's a combination of new customers, as well as growth and penetration within existing. So as we think about the overall health of healthcare, seeing a combination, both increased penetration as well as new, is healthy and reassuring. So all I could tell you with regard to the interpretation from the quarter is I think what we try to do is be realistic, and our healthcare assets continue to perform very well.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I see. And then just a follow-up, Mark, related to your comments regarding pension expense. You called out a $13 million reduction for 2012. What should we expect for 2013 and beyond? Is pension expense going to come down again this year?
Mark V. Anquillare: So what we did back on March 1, 2012, we froze our pension. So that was really kind of a one-time decline because we now have, in essence -- I don't want to say off our books, but the actual increased liability is gone. So we should find steady state into the future as long as discount rates remain relatively unchanged and the stock market doesn't do anything wild that would affect our asset value. So I would suggest basically flat into the future.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: I see. And then you called out a modest increase in 2013 invoices for Risk Assessment. Can you bracket what modest means from a pricing standpoint this year?
Mark V. Anquillare: Well, I think what we've always tried to do is really focus on our insurance customers as a whole. And we don't want to think of Risk Assessment industry standard as a silo. So we've commented on kind of inflationary type of increases there with a focus more on the overall insurance customer and growth there. And I think we do anticipate increasing growth or increasing organic growth in insurance across the board. But I wouldn't attach too much to the Risk Assessment [indiscernible].
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Got it. Just a final housekeeping question. You called out a 38% tax rate assumption for 2013, which would be up from the 36.6% last year, despite the tax benefit you expect this year. So I'm curious, why would the tax rate go up, given the tax benefits that you're seeing in 2013?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes. So what we try to call out and identify is some of that tax planning strategy had the benefit of a lookback. So we gained some benefit looking back from 2007 to 2011, and we got to pick that up in the quarter, and we get about a $2 million benefit going forward. So what you see is the normalization of that amount. And the lookback is about $0.04, if that helps you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Mark, just to clarify, did you make some comments about full year reported healthcare revenue growth? I think I may have missed what you said.
Mark V. Anquillare: So full year 2012?
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: '13. Sorry, looking forward.
Mark V. Anquillare: I think we feel -- again, feel the opportunity is promising. We feel good about the growth there. But I don't think we're going to give any specific numbers around healthcare.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. I wasn't sure if you had specifically quantified anything. And with regard to the investments in Decision Analytics in 2013, you mentioned they're kind of front end-loaded. So I guess, this is kind of a two-pronged question. Should they be somewhat linear in the first couple quarters? And then Scott, how long do you think the payback is on some of these initiatives? Because it seems like this is the first time you're calling out and specifically quantifying investments in specific initiatives and really giving us a clear sense of timing and magnitude.
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. So let me ask Mark to just address the pace of the investments, and then I'll come back and talk background and talk about payback.
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes. I think one of the things that we feel good about is as we look for innovation across our businesses, we've had people step up with some interesting opportunities. So we obviously want to invest quickly around good long-term prospects. I would tell you that it's probably a little bit more first quarter than second quarter but not by much.
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. And with respect to payback, you have to differentiate among the things that we're talking about. So some of them are for efficiency. And those are going to kick in relatively sooner. So for example, the consolidation of our data centers down to 2 primary data centers is the kind of thing that should be paying off even as we do it. So that's a '13, '14 kind of an item. Some of the things we're doing that are essentially clipping more value into existing product platforms should also have relatively faster paybacks. I mentioned in my remarks upfront, making use of remote imagery. Basically, what we're doing is bringing more data into existing solutions, data which our customers have very clearly indicated they'd like access to. So again, there, you've got categories where the paybacks are pretty quick. Some of the other things we're doing are kind of replatforming existing solutions, where we're creating a much more comprehensive environment in which our customers can do their work, their decisioning work. And those are going to be a little bit longer. Those might be more kind of 3-ish, 5-year kind of windows even though benefits will start to occur closer to today. But the profile of the revenue is probably going to be a little bit further out. In all cases, we think we're talking about very strong value propositions. And I just want to comment on, again kind of following up what both Frank and Mark said, I mean, it's really great, actually, the fact that our existing businesses are generating these very substantial organic growth opportunities. I mean, it's coming from within the businesses. We're definitely asking for investment. We're definitely asking for emphasis on growth and organic growth. But it's really encouraging to see the quality of the thinking and the scale of the opportunities that's coming from our existing units.
Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And one last one, if I may. Should we expect to see the insurance theme within Decision Analytics bounce back into double-digit organic revenue growth in '13, all else being equal?
Mark V. Anquillare: So let me -- I'm not sure I'm going to quantify, but let me qualify it. I think we are feeling good about an increased level of organic growth in insurance across the board. So I'm talking about both the Risk Assessment, as well as the category of insurance inside of Decision Analytics. So I think the answer is yes to your question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.
Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Could you help us -- or just remind us again the potential runoff you talked about in Q3 for your mortgage business? And then within the forensic piece, can you help us understand the nature of those contracts? Are they multiyear deals?
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure. So let me first talk about the mortgage question. When we last got together, I think what we were talking about was 2 things. On the front end, where we talked about underwriting and kind of the analytics focused on applications, that's both refinances and originations, we continue to grow nicely and really kind of ahead of market trends. On the back end, we continue to see a more than offsetting dropoff. And at third quarter, we had talked about potentially the full year being down as much as 12% to 15%. And I think we came in at about 11%. So just to look back, one of the things that we benefited from and now kind of seeing the downside from was in that forensic review. As all these defaults hit the industry, people started to use our services in a material way. Remember, using our services helps a mortgage insurer, as an example, rescind coverage and push back that obligation to the lender. The business, when we bought it, was rather small. And it grew nicely during a time. And we've kind of gotten back to the point where we said it went up dramatically and it's kind of coming down. And we just tried to quantify what the back end looked like. So we kind of gave a range as to how big that drop could be. And that kind of is consistent with what we continue and what we've said even into '13, where we said that it could be down as much as 11% again. I think the second part of your question was about the contracts?
Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Right.
Mark V. Anquillare: Here, it's a little bit different. It's more transactional. So you do contract for multiyears with either a mortgage lender or a mortgage insurer. And you get integrated, so you're tightly integrated, you're tightly embedded inside their processes, but it is transactional. So there's no guaranteed minimums. There's nothing that would guarantee an amount. It's just you're the source when they choose to run that type of analytic.
Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then just back on the mortgage runoff again. I mean, if you were down like you projected, 11% in '13, would you kind of be back to that rate before you saw the spike in activity?
Mark V. Anquillare: I would need to actually kind of work through the details, but I believe that we're getting back to that normalized level, maybe a little bit. We're still above where we were back at that day because we've grown the business, we have more customers. One thing I want to let you know, and we've talked about this, is we used to have what was a couple very big and concentrated customers. The level and nature of the solutions now is much more spread across customers and products. So the quality of the revenue is improved, as we think about kind of into the future.
Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. Then finally, just on the overall margin. You talked about the investment in Decision Analytics in the first half. But then it may not have much of an overall impact to the overall margin. Is it fair to kind of assume a flattish type margin for '13 overall for the corporate EBITDA margin?
Mark V. Anquillare: I think we try not to give real specifics. But I think there is probably -- I think we've tried to talk about the investment kind of offsetting the scale, so I think we should be around there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington from Raymond James.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: First of all, congratulations to Scott on the promotion to CEO. And then also congratulations to Frank on taking Verisk from a monoline private company to a diversified $9 billion public company.
Frank J. Coyne: Thanks, Bill. I had a lot of help.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Now there's been talk in the industry about you guys developing an all-claims fraud database for healthcare similar to the ISO Claims database for insurance. And I'd like to ask if you could give us some color on that and also some thoughts on that opportunity in healthcare versus insurance.
Scott G. Stephenson: So we are working on that. It's extremely important for us in the healthcare space. And it's not something that actually we're going to put a lot out in the public about right now, Bill, because it's a very critical thing that we're doing and it's very proprietary to us. I will say that it builds upon 2 strengths that we've got inside of the company. One is the fact that we already aggregate claims data on the P&C side, so there's a methodology there that we can reference. And secondly, we're already aggregating medical claims in the P&C domain. And it's really quite obvious that streaming together medical claims from the P&C domain with the formal healthcare space is actually a very powerful thing to do that has not been done before. With respect to who it is that's coming into our approach and the rate at which they're coming into our approach, I mean, that really is kind of -- we're right in the middle of all that, Bill. And we're really not sharing very many -- we're not sharing very much about that right now because it is so critical and sensitive. But I will say that it is an idea that seems intuitive for the healthcare space.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then of course, I couldn't not ask a question correlated to mortgage. So I just wanted to ask one of the clarifying question on 2013, when we talk about the 11% decline. That's for the combined forensic and origination, is that?
Mark V. Anquillare: That's correct.
Scott G. Stephenson: That's correct.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Correct, okay. And then for the -- your thoughts in terms of your ability to offset the decline in the forensic piece with increased penetration on the front end.
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, I mean, basically, the work that we're doing is to look at all of the lines of service that we provide and to think about which of them are most valuable to our customers and which of them can be [indiscernible] the most. And actually, there are some lines of service that haven't even really been much a part of the business previously than in 2013, we're going -- we expect to do some merging. So it's even a little more nuanced, Bill, than just front and back end. It's also sort of multiple ways in which we can serve the originator.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then one housekeeping question, just the share count exiting the quarter.
Mark V. Anquillare: I think, exiting the quarter, give me one second, Bill, I referenced it. I want to just get you [indiscernible]. So exiting the quarter, we had 172.2 million shares.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh with William Blair.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: First, I wanted to ask about the catastrophe modeling. Can you elaborate a little more on the strength there? And how sustainable is that as we go into next year? I imagine the comps are much tougher after the improvement you've seen this year.
Scott G. Stephenson: I didn't actually understand the point you were making there at the end about the comps.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Just the comparison. I mean, it's had such a strong year. Can you continue to grow on top of that?
Scott G. Stephenson: Okay. Within our own experience. All right. I thought maybe you were referencing the market. Yes, catastrophe modeling is a very important discipline inside of the P&C space, and it is going to remain one. There, something to understand about it is that there are multiple ways that, that set of services grows. One way is by modeling new combinations of perils and geographies. And it's -- we're considerably far away from all perils and all meaningful geographies being modeled. And so there's growth there. One of the investments we're making to replatform what we do is actually inside of what we do on the catastrophe modeling side. And fundamentally, what that's about is taking the discipline from being aimed at making portfolio kinds of decisions, carriers working on their reinsurance with their reinsurers and vice versa. All of that will continue to be the case. But it's also about taking the same modeling capabilities and actually applying them on a risk-by-risk basis in the underwriting process for the primary carrier. And that also is going to represent some growth. And so there are just a number of things which are involved in it. And I just want to help everybody to understand that it's actually a very multidimensional thing that goes on there. And so we really believe that it is a -- it's a category with legs over a long period of time. And we believe that we have a very leading position. You may have noticed that we had a very, very disproportionately high share of all the cat bond issuances in 2012. We think that in many ways, that's the purest form of competition in the cat modeling space, representative of who has the best science and technology.
Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay, great. And then Argus, can you talk about it? It seems like just even on a sequential and year-over-year basis, at least what I can back into in the run rate of revenue for that business, seems like it picked up a fair amount this past quarter, or at least it was better than I expected. Is that -- is there anything special going on there? Or was it just kind of the ongoing growth of that business?
Scott G. Stephenson: You want to go ahead, Mark?
Mark V. Anquillare: Well, let me just -- I think what we've seen is -- let's do full year, I'll go kind of a pro forma basis. I think we saw greater than 20% growth at Argus. I think we see them delivering. And you're right, the actual results for the 4 months that we own them was greater than what we originally advised. Scott, let me turn it back over to you.
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. Just, it's a kind of -- I'm going to almost repeat myself what I was saying about cat modeling. What Argus does is multidimensional, and it's important that you understand that. So the business has historically been aimed at aggregating data to understand the credit card product line. There's a big opportunity to try to understand demand deposits and other products which come from the retail banks. There's a geographic expansion dimension. And then there's also moving from focusing primarily on product design and pricing considerations also to -- because of the data that are a part of what the supply that Argus receives, there's also a big opportunity to move into looking at issues of fraud. And so again, please just understand it as being very multidimensional. And essentially, what's going on is a number of those themes are active. They were active in the fourth quarter of 2012, and they'll remain active going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to talk about the status of the unified healthcare technology platform. What has been accomplished? What still has to be accomplished? And how does that lift healthcare organic growth?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. So it's something that we're very focused on. We review this very routinely with the business unit, and we're pleased with where we stand overall. We have customers who are live, being served with the unified platform, powering our solutions on the back end. That is particularly true in the payment accuracy part of what it is that we do. Next up, and importantly for us, is having the same unified platform hooked up to and supporting our solutions in the Enterprise Analytics division of what it is that we do. Ultimately, it will be all of Verisk Health. But Enterprise Analytics is up next, and that's a 2013 deliverable, so -- and where we have activated customers against the platform, we and they have both been very, very pleased with the result.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And it lifts revenues when you do that, right?
Scott G. Stephenson: Say again?
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Does it affect revenues?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes. I mean, the primary benefit of what we're doing there is that we create access to our data stores for all of our existing solutions, as well as the next one that we develop. And because of that, in effect, what we'll be able to do is to say to an existing customer -- and I think you all know how important cross-selling is to our growth. What we'll be able to say to an existing healthcare customer is, "Because you're already contributing data, you're essentially already in our environment." So if you want to turn on another solution, the cost and time to do that is extremely negligible. And we believe that, that's going to help accelerate cross-selling.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Congrats to Scott and Frank, as well. Just a quick follow-up on the Argus side. I guess, you gave us sort of what the pro forma full year revenue looked like. Can you maybe give us some color on how the margins performed there? I think you had given us the first half margins at the time of the acquisition. Was it somewhat similar to that, better? Any color on that front?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yes. I mean, the margins that you saw in the first half, or what we did as part of our filing, that continued into the 4 months where we owned. And I think we -- I think very similar to a lot of the Verisk products, that you have a wonderful brand with some real value add to the customers that will ultimately provide leverage and scale as it grows. So we feel good about the margins then. They are very strong and consistent to what you saw in the first half.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And is Argus, I guess, for the early stages, I think as you discussed some acquisitions, still is roughly going to be -- I guess, the way to put it is more a stand-alone company? Like is there -- I was thinking -- trying to think looking forward, are there any cross-sell opportunities between Argus and the rest of the businesses?
Scott G. Stephenson: It is more stand-alone, though it's not entirely stand-alone for a couple of reasons. One is, we are, at the enterprise level, looking to integrate substantially all of our data assets. And so what we should have the opportunity to do then is to make observations about consumer credit, consumer demand deposits, the personal line side of the insurance space, even potentially healthcare, make integrated observations in order to, for example, do an even more comprehensive job of rooting out fraud. And so I think Argus has a big data shop in and of itself, has something powerful to contribute on that front. And then I would also say that we are certainly exploring maybe individual product level opportunities, where Argus observations about consumers might be able to be tied into work that we're doing, particularly on the P&C side as it relates to fraud findings. But the shape of the P&L, I think, will be substantially based upon the customers and the product sets that Argus has.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And Mark, if I may, on the mortgage side, what sort of origination estimate are you using for the market in your numbers?
Mark V. Anquillare: So we're looking back. We typically focus on the MBA forecast, Mortgage Bankers Association forecast. Is that was your question is, I'll make sure.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Yes. No, fair enough. So that's what's baked in. And I guess, just related to that in terms of the overall segment, just your thoughts on sort of strategically, it seems like that's the least set of all the businesses and it has been a drag for a couple of years now on overall growth. Just strategically, how you view that unit?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, I'll say a couple things. The first one is that we apply ourselves to making the mortgage business a distinctive Verisk-like business, just as we do with everything we do, which means always trying to infuse it with higher-level analytics, with more proprietary data and a robust stream of new solutions. So we don't take any different approach in terms of the running of the business nor will we take a different approach. What I would also say is that we're just always alert to thinking about the shape of our whole portfolio. We try not to think of anything as being sacred but always putting things to the test of: Is there value? Is there increasing value? What's the nature of the external market that we face, et cetera? So in that sense, mortgage is always being reviewed in the same way that the whole business is always being reviewed. And we don't ever turn off that part of the thought process.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Flynn with Crédit Suisse.
Kelly A. Flynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: First question relates to your comments about industry-standard business, Risk Assessment overall as well. I just want to clarify what you said because, Mark, some of your comments tailed off a bit at the end. Are you saying you expect growth for industry standard to accelerate in 2013 at kind of an inflationary rate, which would mean a few hundred basis points of acceleration would be reasonable? I mean, I know you don't want to give guidance, but pulling together everything that you said, is that kind of the right picture?
Mark V. Anquillare: No. Let me just make sure. I'll say it again. I said that we expected the industry-standard program, the invoices are out, and they grew at an inflationary pace. There was an increase. It was an increase, just inflationary kind of similar path. The point that I was making was that we just don't look at industry-standard programs as a silo. What we're interested in doing is making sure we sell more to and grow our relationship broadly across Risk Assessment and Decision Analytics to our insurance customers. And we do see an increase in growth rate across the total relationship as we think about '13.
Kelly A. Flynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, got it. And then another question I have that relates to G&A and it ties in your comments about investments. Another way to look at this, your G&A was down a couple million sequentially. First of all, why was that? And how should we think about that line item in the model next year as we layer in investments?
Mark V. Anquillare: Well, I think one thing you do need to factor into this is the pension freeze that we talked about, the $13 million, is a combination of cost of goods because there's people working on product. But it's also about the people that are providing support functions. And remember, if you think about pension, a lot of those people are, in fact, retired. So that affects the SG&A number also. I would generally expect SG&A to grow slightly slower than the top line. We would expect leverage and scale there.
Kelly A. Flynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. That's helpful. And then for Argus, I know we've touched on it a couple times in the call. But just to ensure accuracy, I mean, can you actually give us the revenue number that Argus generated in the quarter?
Mark V. Anquillare: I think that is...
Eva F. Huston: Kelly, it's Eva. You can parse that out of the K. Let me just give you the specific number. I'm just getting to the right page. $16.7 million in the fourth quarter.
Kelly A. Flynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then I might be able to calculate this, too, but I'm not positive. The -- as far as the growth rate, the pro forma growth rate for Argus, I think you just said a few questions back, Mark, it was more than 20%.
Mark V. Anquillare: That's correct for '12.
Kelly A. Flynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Are we able to get any more detail on that? I mean, was it -- can you give us the exact number? Or can we calculate it from what you've disclosed?
Mark V. Anquillare: I mean, I think it's a little bit above 20%. I think what we did -- said at the time of the acquisition, that we kind of saw mid-teens growth in the future. We still feel good about that.
Kelly A. Flynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. So when you say above 20%, it's close to 20%. It's not like above 20%, could be 40% or anything like that?
Mark V. Anquillare: I think that's right, yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suzanne Stein from Morgan Stanley.
Unknown Analyst: This is Brian [ph] in for Suzi. Do you have any sort of government exposure? And is sequestration at all an issue here?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes, not very much at all. Very, very de minimis. And the effect would be just negligible on the P&L, if it did occur, I mean, we -- mostly through our weather-related analytics, we do a fair amount of work on Earth-orbiting satellites, et cetera. Apparently, these are more considered to be critical programs. But the real point is just the absolute amount of business we do there is so small that it just won't have much of an effect.
Unknown Analyst: Got it. And just from an pipeline -- from an acquisition pipeline standpoint, can you comment generally on any sort of plans for increased activity in healthcare or any other verticals that you may be kind of focusing on?
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, we remain very active in the marketplace overall. Our team is constantly proactively engaging with companies that potentially fit with our strategy. Absolutely no difference in approach from where we've been for years and years and years now. Just a general point I would make is that as we have diversified our business, as we've moved into new market segments, et cetera, we've just given ourselves a broader playing field. And we're just going to continue to pursue it. You've seen a fair amount of M&A activity in the healthcare space from us. And there's certainly no reason to expect that, that would change. But we're -- we've got our headlights out there against the whole business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: It's such an exciting time for the company, Frank and Scott. I wanted to follow up on some of your preliminary comments about the N+1 initiative that you made at the outset. Just I know you're going to go into this in more detail next week, but if you could just share with us in a minute or so, what specific end markets you envision addressing with those initiatives.
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, we've talked a lot about the fact that we feel the need to be very deep in whatever vertical markets we're serving because it is really, really important that we be intimate with our customers. In fact, we can't even -- N+1, as it relates to our data sets, is interpreted in several ways. It means that we're one layer further than our competitors. It means that we're one layer further than any one customer. It means that we're one layer further than the data assets that we've got today in terms of what we're building towards in the future. So it's a lot of -- it has a lot of different dimensions to it like that. Unless we are intimate with our customers, we don't actually know what N is, so we don't know that we're at the N+1 level. And so that's just by way of saying that we are in 4 domains right now, as you know: the P&C market, the healthcare market, supply chain and financial services. And we'll talk about this more at Investor Day. But we've got plenty of distance to run inside of those marketplaces. And we would not claim that we've achieved the very greatest amount of intimacy that we can with all of our customers. That's good work that we're still engaged in. So that's all by way of saying that while we're always asking questions about the shape of the business and where are we in terms of the markets that we serve, we have a great deal of focus on going further inside of the segments that we already serve. And I think you can expect to continue to see that from us.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. Thank you for that context. And then I have some pension-related question maybe for Mark or Eva. With regards to the pension, just so I understand, that -- the freeze is on current. Or is it current or new employees where the pension -- the movement in the pension is accruing?
Mark V. Anquillare: So just to give you a feel. We've gone through a couple reiteration [ph] of freezes. But back in March, that was put in place across the entire Verisk enterprise. So there's nobody accruing any additional benefit related to pension. Obviously, what anybody earned in the past is obviously theirs, but there's no more benefit accruing.
James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division: Okay. So should we expect significant movement in 2013 as we had in 2012?
Mark V. Anquillare: So no, what happens is we receive the benefit and what we would expect now is it would be generally flat going forward, as long as discount rates and market results or how the assets are invested don't change materially. So we would expect a flatness to that cost, which is negligible these days.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.
Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Mark, just a quick follow-up. On that lower tax rate for '13, is that something that's sustainable going forward? Or should we expect the tax rate to kind of move back up again?
Mark V. Anquillare: No. We feel that, that is a sustainable rate in light of these tax planning strategies we've taken on.
Operator: And this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll turn the call back over to Frank Coyne.
Frank J. Coyne: Yes. Thank you. And thanks to all for joining us today for our fourth quarter results. We appreciate your support, and I thank you for helping Verisk reach its current stature in the public market. This will be my last earnings call as I transition to solely a board role effective April 1. It has been an honor to serve our 6,000 employees, our customers and our investors as CEO, and I look forward to continuing to be a part of Verisk through my role as Chairman. Thank you very much, and have a good day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, my name is Brandy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Verisk Analytics Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. Thank you. Ms. Eva Huston, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, you may begin.
Eva Huston: Great. Thank you, Brandy, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our third quarter 2012 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following some comments by Frank, Scott and Mark, highlighting key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call, as well as the associated 10-K were provided on Tuesday and can be found in the Investor website of our -- Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be available for 30 days on our website and by dial in. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I will remind everyone that today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.
Frank J. Coyne: Thank you, Eva, and good morning. Before going into comments on the third quarter, I would like to say our thoughts are with all our employees and all others who have been impacted by Sandy. We have continued to be operational throughout the storm and its aftermath and are supporting our customers at our usual excellent level of service. However, due to some travel and power issues, the management participants in this call are not in the same location. In third quarter 2012, we delivered strong overall performance of over 17% total revenue growth and 20% diluted adjusted EPS growth. Overall, our consolidated organic revenue growth was 8.5%, reflecting strong growth in healthcare and good growth in insurance solutions. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 10.8%. Profitability was strong with an EBITDA margin of 45.9% in the quarter. Free cash flow was also strong, increasing over 15% year-to-date after adjusting for certain timing items and the previously discussed pension funding. We are pleased with our results in the quarter. In the third quarter, our Risk Assessment revenue grew 4.9%, after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics in 2012. This growth is a continuation of what you saw in the first half and evidence of our strong subscription model. In Decision Analytics, our revenue grew almost 30%, and our insurance solutions grew about 9%, even while we continue to face tough comps with regards to storm activity in 2011. While we certainly will see claims coming through from Hurricane Sandy, much of our claims volume revenue is contracted above current volume, and we will still experience tough comps versus fourth quarter 2011. Our healthcare solutions continued on the excellent organic growth path we have seen in the past few quarters, growing revenue above 47% organically in the quarter. Total healthcare revenue grew -- growth was almost 130% bolstered by the contributions MediConnect continues to make. In the quarter, we generated almost $70 million in revenue from our healthcare business. Compared to 3Q 2009, our first quarter reporting after our IPO, our reported healthcare revenue increased by fivefold in just 3 years, making it a meaningful part of our enterprise. In mortgage and financial services, we are pleased to have closed our acquisition of Argus. And in the first month since closing, performance has been on target, and our future expectations have been reconfirmed. With our mortgage tools, we are seeing recent trends continuing. Our origination-related revenue continues to grow in line with the market, while our overall mortgage revenue declined due to lower volumes of forensic review. We remain disciplined in our use of capital and are focused on delivering shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we have spent almost $800 million on acquisitions. We are excited about these acquisitions and believe our shareholders should be pleased by this use of capital, as evidenced by the acquisition's strong initial results and strategic fit. As we have previously communicated, we moderated our share repurchase in the quarter to about $21 million. We continue to be active in looking at M&A, but also continue to maintain our discipline, focusing on assets with the true strategic fit, a strong financial model and an appropriate valuation in relation to future growth. We also remain focused on meeting our commitments to our debt holders as it relates to delevering back to our target ratios. In this quarter, we had strong financial results, and behind the numbers are many initiatives that we expect to bear fruit in the future. The creativity and deep domain expertise of our teams is evident, as we discussed our near-term and long-term objectives. And with our diversified portfolio, we have the ability to weather global uncertainty, while continuing to build a stronger Verisk. Now I'll turn it over to Scott to give you details about our progress in healthcare and other parts of the business.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you, Frank. We have a lot of exciting initiatives going on at Verisk, and I wanted to share a few with you to give you a sense of our current customer interactions, as well as some emerging opportunities that are not yet reflected in our numbers. First, our teams at AIR and AER have been working round the clock to provide real-time updates to their forecast on the path and impact of Hurricane Sandy. These estimates are vital to our customers, as they help them to understand what to expect and what will likely be a major impact on their business and operations. While our teams may be operating remotely, they are in constant communication with customers about the storm. It's events like this that highlight our importance of our customers. Now to talk about the value we bring, away from the storm, our Healthcare business is performing very well and also exceeding -- executing on its plans for the future. We continue to make progress on our unified healthcare platform, and it is proceeding as expected. We talked about having a new customer live and on the fraud platform last quarter. And more recently, we expect to use the combined fraud platform to bring a large corporate customers' healthcare claims together to allow them to see aggregate spend across employees and coverage limits in the fourth quarter this year. We estimate that our tool could save them substantial dollars and have a very strong ROI. We are also making excellent progress in bringing together our MediConnect business with our revenue integrity platform, a lot of this work is operational and involves ensuring that we work together seamlessly, both on the sales front and also on the customer delivery front. We are finding the teams energized by working together, as well as being a part of the bigger Verisk health platform and mission. As well, we continue to see the combination of our solutions and teams resonating with customers through new sales and improving product pipelines. We also continue to work to find ways to use our numerous capabilities in data sets across multiple functions, verticals or geographies. The aggregated medical database for P&C insurers for healthcare claims is running well and bringing significant value to our customers. We are also continuing our development of the next generation platform for our catastrophe models, and we expect to launch the customers in 2013. We are also using our weather data for P&C companies and continue to make traction in that space. And with the addition of Argus, we have spent time during the first 60 days holding brainstorming sessions between the Argus team and existing Verisk businesses. These sessions are leading to discoveries around how we can repurpose the data models built by Argus to deliver solutions to other customers, including in the insurance space. Internationally, we are working on translating our substantial intellectual property into new markets, where no or limited analytics exist today. This is a long-term project, but the reception we're finding so far is very encouraging. All of what we are doing is about creating innovation within our company, as that will permit us to reimagine and enlarge our markets. We must continue to know both our current customers' value propositions, as well as relate to our customers as development partners, and we're committed to both. With that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results.
Mark V. Anquillare: Thanks, Scott. You've heard some of the exciting things that are going on in our business, and I'll share some of the numbers as the results of these efforts. In the third quarter, we delivered 17.3% total revenue growth and 8.5% organic revenue growth. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic growth in the quarter was 10.8%. For the third quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue continued to lead with 27.4% growth, of which 11% was organic, excluding the acquisitions of MediConnect, Aspect Loss Prevention and Argus, as well as the transferred revenue for the mortgage appraisal tools. As a reminder, in 2012, we transferred revenue related to the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessments, property-specific revenue categories into Decision Analytics mortgage and financial services revenue category. We will continue to provide you visibility into the apples-to-apples comparisons throughout 2012. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category grew 8.6% in the third quarter and 8.3% organically, excluding June, July acquisition of Aspect Loss Prevention. We continued strong double-digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions. We also saw improved growth in our loss quantification solutions despite continued to lower levels of storm activity in 2012 versus the same period in 2011. I knew you have a question on the impact of Sandy on our volumes through exact analysis. As you may remember, our multi-year customer contracts include an annual days number of claims to be processed that varies by client. To give you a sense, we are tracking below the contracted amounts of claims year-to-date. So we don't expect to see the transactional bump we saw last year, when clients went into overages. For 2012, we have approximately 20% more claims volumes under contract than in 2011. So we're not currently forecasting overages. Also in the quarter, Claims Solutions delivered good growth. In mortgage and financial services, we grew 10.8%, reflecting the addition of Argus as of August 31. Argus is an excellent business, and we're pleased with the performance today and continue to see opportunity, at least as large than we initially anticipated. After adjusting for the acquisition of Argus and it's transfer to the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment into this revenue category in the third quarter revenues declined 11.9%. We continue to see the same themes that we've been discussing in previous quarters. Underwriting tools grew nicely in the quarter and reflected the growth in the mortgage application to the market. Our revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter, more than offsetting that growth. To provide additional clarity on these trends, a quick reminder about the shape of our business. Broadly speaking, there are 2 types and 2 parts of the mortgage business, what we call the front end, the part that are related to originations and refinancings. It's about half of the mortgage business and is performing well. The other part is what we call the forensic piece. That's about half the business and about 4% of consolidated revenue in the quarter. The forensic business benefited from the surge in demand in the wake of the financial crisis. That demand is now subsiding. To frame the potential downside for you, before the crisis, the forensic business is about $10 million on an annual basis, with business primarily from 1 of our 2 large current customers. We are now in the process of reverting to historic levels. However, because our customers remain somewhat uncertain about where their needs will stabilize, it is harder for us to get kind of forward visibility into our mortgage revenue that characterizes most of our businesses. Based upon our latest review of the mortgage business, our current expectation is that there is more revenue likely to roll off as a part of this normalization process, including in the fourth quarter of 2012. We have projected in early 2012 that our mortgage revenue in aggregate for the year will decline similar to the fourth quarter 2010 or about 7%. Our current revenue expectation for the fourth quarter now leads us to believe the decline for the full year 2012 will be in the 12% to 15% range. The EBITDA margins in this business are below the segment average, so there is less of an impact on the bottom line than top line. Now, of course, when we aren't standing still, we continue to develop new solutions that bring value to our customers, and those opportunities will create new revenue streams in our forensic space. Healthcare continues strong revenue growth, 129% for the third quarter and 47.4% organic. Healthcare organic growth year-to-date is 41%. Our total growth benefited from the second quarter addition of MediConnect. Organically, we continue to add, implement new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers. Both the acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners became part of the organic growth calculation this quarter and have added to organic growth, although all of the businesses are growing nicely. As a reminder, we do have seasonality in our Revenue Integrity and MediConnect businesses related to the CMS review cycle. And the revenue between third quarter and fourth quarter can be a bit fluid depending on customer schedules. While I expect to see strong, continued growth year-over-year next quarter, we may see a modest sequential dip in dollar revenue. Our Specialized Markets grew 11% in the third quarter, with growth both from the supply chain solutions as well as weather analytics. Turning to Risk Assessment. We reported revenue growth of 2.8% in the quarter and 4.9% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer we discussed earlier. Our industry-standard programs grew 5.8% in the quarter, reflecting our 2012 invoices and strong growth from our premium leakage solutions. Our property-specific revenue declined 5.1% as reported, but excluding the transfer grew 4% based upon new sales and higher volumes, as well as growth in appraisal solutions. EBITDA for the third quarter was $182.9 million as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 21.1% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 45.9%, reflecting good expense management, as well as seasonal benefit of some of our healthcare businesses. We continue to see opportunities from investing in future growth, and as you remember, those can have a near-term impact on margins, but grow our future opportunity. In the quarter, the Risk Assessment margins were 54.6% versus 50.5% in third quarter 2011. We benefited by about 2% on the margin due to this lower pension costs related to the freeze of the plan in February. Our business continues to show scalable profitability, while we also continue to invest in developing new solutions. Margins in Decisions Analytics was 40.9% in third quarter 2012 versus 40.1% in third quarter 2011. Our acquisitions of MediConnect and Argus added slightly to our margins. Our interest expense was up $3.5 million versus third quarter 2011, based upon higher debt balances related to our acquisitions. We ended third quarter with total debt of $1.6 billion, including the $380 million to fund the Argus acquisition on August 31. Our reported effective tax rate was 39.3% for the quarter, which we expect to continue for the rest of 2012. Coming down to net income. We focus on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense, less income tax, except on that acquisition -- on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 20.9% to $92.2 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS, on a fully diluted basis, was $0.54, an increase of 20%, a great growth rate. The average diluted share count was 171.7 million shares in the quarter. As of September 30, 2012, our diluted share count was 171.5 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased 425,000 shares or about $21 million. At quarter end, we had about 179 million left under our authorization. As we discussed last quarter, we have moderated our buyback program after acquiring Argus to ensure that we meet our deleveraging commitments. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date, generating annualized IRRs of over 25%. Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, our cash and cash equivalents were $98 million. Total debt, both short term and long term, totaled about $1.6 billion, reflecting the borrowed funds to acquire Argus, which closed on August 31. Post-Argus, our debt capacity is over $850 million and will grow with our EBITDA and free cash flow. Our pro forma debt-to-EBITDA ratio at September 30, including a full year of historical results for both MediConnect and Argus, was 2.2x, down from the pro forma ratio of 2.35x we cited at the time of the acquisition. As we've stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of 2x debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunity, because our free cash flow is strong and allows us to delever quickly. Free cash flow in the first 9 months of 2012, which we define as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, was $264.2 million, a decrease of about $11.3 million or negative 4.1% versus the 9 months of 2011. This decline was principally due to the funding of our pension, which we have mentioned previously. Excluding the impact of our pension, net of the tax benefit and certain year-over-year timing issues, our free cash flow was up about 16%. Our capital expenditures was about 5.1% of revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2012. Free cash flow represented 52.2% of EBITDA in the first 9 months of 2012, reflecting a reduced conversion rate due to the $72 million pension funding, partially offset by the associated tax benefit. As we have indicated previously, we moderate our share buyback program as we delever following the solid acquisitions we made this year. We would anticipate that the share count in 4Q may be up about 1%. Overall, our business is performing very well, and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and continue to invest in the future. We see that both our subscription and transaction revenue is growing well. Even with our transaction revenue, while we see some variations around that revenue, the purchase of our solutions is largely nondiscretionary, and therefore, we have good visibility into the future. With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.
Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Mark, with the guidance you gave about the sequential dip in healthcare revenue and absolute dollar terms for Q4, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about this right. Would that assume a year-over-year growth rate in the single digits to the maybe the low to mid-teens?
Mark V. Anquillare: Well, I mean, I don't want get into very specifics. I didn't go over -- just trying to describe this. We see very strong growth for healthcare, both in aggregate and organically in fourth quarter. But when you consider seasonality, and if you actually look at the absolute dollars in third quarter relative to fourth quarter, we're just talking about what we see from an absolute dollar amount, 4Q relative to 3Q.
Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then starting again next year, and then '13, would you suspect the growth rates to reaccelerate then?
Mark V. Anquillare: Well, we have high hopes, and we continue to be very bullish on the prospects for healthcare. So I think we feel good about healthcare. We continue to just describe that it's a growing business. We expect growth. But over time, the law of large numbers takes over. So we would expect that it's going to be -- continue to grow. But at the percent levels of today, I think will be diminishing over time.
Eric J. Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: Okay, just one more in healthcare. In the past, you talked about being in early innings in terms of completing implementations and then being able to recognize revenue. Are we still in the early innings there or no? And then how is the pace of new integration startups going?
Mark V. Anquillare: So let me take the beginning of that, and then maybe I can ask Scott to just comment. So the first thing that we're -- are saying is a, from a back-end perspective, from a fraud perspective, we are implementing the customers. You're seeing that in the revenue now, and we have a very good and improved process around implementing customers. So there's a combination of a, existing customers rolling out more regions and states. That's good that's in, and that continues. At the same time, we have signed new customers. And that does take a little time to ramp up, and that will have kind of more of a tail to it into 2013. That is particularly true on the front end. When we sell the customer on the front end, we do require information and data from them, And then we turn around some of the models. And there, there's a little bit of a deferral until we are able to deliver the product to those customers. So that is also kind of a deferral of sorts from a revenue rack. But I think you see the trend, and you can see the opportunity, as both the pipeline and new customers come to fruition are implemented. Scott, maybe you can comment a little more on the progress.
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, I think you said it well. I would just add that this effect of catching up with respect to implementations is particularly felt in our payment accuracy business. And we're certainly not complete in that process, but we do continue to make progress, as Mark said. And I would just say that you have to account for the fact that our mix is shifting a little bit also. And all of what we do that we call Revenue Integrity is just becoming a more and more important fraction of the total of what we do in the healthcare space. So we do have a mix effect in there as well.
Eva Huston: Eric, it's Eva. I just want to add one clarifying point on healthcare. Fourth quarter 2011 healthcare revenue was $38 million. And this quarter, we did $69 million.
Frank J. Coyne: And you did have a question on how the integration is going, and we're very pleased with our progress there. And the synergies of the business are really showing enhanced opportunities in the marketplace.
Operator: And your next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Evercore Partners. Scott, could you provide a little bit more granular insight into the underlying drivers of the 47% organic revenue growth in healthcare? And to what extent is superior growth sustainable in this business? Perhaps not at the 47% level, but if you could perhaps take us out into 2013 and talk about how some of those growth drivers might play out?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yes, happy to. First of all, I think everybody's aware, but I'll just kind of refresh you that we actually do a variety of different things in the healthcare space. We do risk adjusting, which we call our Enterprise Analytics group, and all of the analytics driven off of that. We do payment accuracy, which is combing through claims flows to make sure that there are no fraudulent ways or abusive claims. And then we do a lot of work in the revenue integrity space, which is the collection of things that we do, which is fundamentally that helping plans to assure that they're being completely and properly reimbursed for the work that they do, particularly if it's in the Medicare context, so a wide variety of things. And MediConnect, our most recent acquisition, actually supports both the revenue integrity business, but also the opportunity to accumulate clinical data will increasingly become meaningful inside of our enterprise analytics. So with that as the backdrop, we're really kind of hitting on all cylinders is the sort of the first part of the answer. So I wouldn't really point to any one thing. I would say that it is the case that Verisk Health collectively has really emerged as a meaningful vendor inside of the space. We bring a number of things. We bring a lot of unique intellectual property. We bring kind of a unique positioning, because, we, I think, we're seen as, in many ways, as kind of a Switzerland inside of the space. I think it's been noticed by the marketplace that Verisk is strongly supportive of what -- of our business in the healthcare arena. And so that kind of corporate commitment, I think, does -- we're selling a lot of enterprise-level applications. And so that level of commitment really does communicate into the market, creating an even greater sense of confidence to buy our solutions. And the healthcare space remains one where there is mounting interest on the part of our customers in using data analytics to drive their decision making. So it's -- it's very broadly based, I would say. And as Mark said before, we remain very optimistic about the opportunity to continue to grow the business in the future. I mean, we have, from time to time, at Investor Day meetings and in other forums, just made the point that the space is very large. And you know what our run rate was in the third quarter. We are still relatively modest in terms of the fraction of the overall market that we represent. So it's a very broad -- and what's happening right now is very broadly based. It's not one part of our business, and it's not one team. And it's certainly not related to what's going on with respect to regulation in the healthcare space. That's sort of mildly benign from our perspective.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Bracket for us, some reasonable organic growth expectations for healthcare in 2013?
Scott G. Stephenson: I don't think we put out numbers like that. But the -- again, I'll just say that the kinds of conditions, which are underlying the performance that we've turned in recently, we don't see any changes in those. Obviously, third quarter organically was very strong, but the underlying conditions remain.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: And just a question for Mark, if I might. I just want to understand your comments on the mortgage business. For 2012, I think your updated guidance was down 12% to 15% for the year versus 7%. What's changing your thinking on the forensic side that would lead you to reduce guidance for the year?
Mark V. Anquillare: I think the short answer is, we are very much dependent upon our customers to provide us with insight as to what and how much service they need, and we just haven't seen the type of commitment from customers that we need to feel confident about fourth quarter. And specifically, we think that they're going to need less. So we are trying to provide you with as much information insight as we have. The reality is most of our businesses, those type of transactional services are very much nondiscretionary in the minds of most of our customers. The mortgage, and specifically, the forensic review, is unlike that, and we just felt that, that's the best guess right now around 4Q.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Are you signaling cost reduction actions to limit any earnings impact from that decline?
Mark V. Anquillare: Well, I think we've always been very cost conscious. So to the extent that you think about a decline in top line, we're going to be try to be as thoughtful around expenses as possible. But obviously, it's tough to pull enough expense out to offset the type of declines that we've seen on the top.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I wanted to ask about the trajectory of the RA growth, which has been mid single-digit going into next year. And I wanted to know if it's likely that Verisk's RA segment will accelerate in 2013, knowing January is a key point, asking about the lag effects of the 4% P&C premium growth in 2011.
Frank J. Coyne: Yes, Mark?
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure. Thank you, Frank. I think what we continue to see is, first of all, we like the fact that, there's a stronger market that helps our customers and, obviously, a customer that is feeling good about their business, they make it more apt to more likely to purchase services from others. when we think about, specifically, premiums, I think the way we continue to interact with customers is not just about a Risk Assessment or how our industry standard programs will interact. But more importantly, what's the best way to grow our business with our customers across the insurance space in broad term. So clearly, the harder market or at least better pricing, I'm not sure if it's going to be called the harder market, will potentially have good news for our customers. I think we're going to remain as pretty tempered in the way we think about Risk Assessment, because what we really believe is the opportunity to grow inside those insurance customers is to sell them some Decision Analytics customer -- excuse me, Decision Analytics products and our customers receive value there. And we think that's the best way to grow our business, and we continue to believe that.
Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Sure. No, I understand your answer. And surely, a broader customer sell is great, but is it there some mechanics with your RA line and the premiums that are up in 2011?
Frank J. Coyne: So I think you were talking about the industry-standard program. Those premiums are related to our invoices. But as I said, I think we've always described it as -- typically, we try to put in some type of inflationary type of increases. And I think we would continue to think about that into the future, because we really do believe there's some good opportunity to make sure that we can sell -- continue to sell more product and bigger volumes of product into those customers, as well as those industry-standard programs. So I don't see a sweeping uptake, no. I think we will be pretty tempered in the way we handle those.
Operator: Your next question comes from Kelly Flynn with Credit Suisse.
Kelly A. Flynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: I want to go back to healthcare. I was wondering if you could just be a little bit more clear in the sequential revenue decline. Do you expect that at both MediConnect and the rest of the Healthcare business? Or is it going to be more pronounced at one or the other?
Frank J. Coyne: Mark, why don't you start that?
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure. So I think we've always talked about the fact that a combination of MediConnect and the Revenue Integrity businesses are very much focused on the latter part of the year, and it's tied to the CMS review process. So what we're just trying to describe is that we continue to see wonderful growth. But as you think about those 2 businesses, which are, for the most part, the latter part of the year weighted, it's a little difficult to understand how things move between third and fourth quarter. And we have seen a good third quarter. I think we would continue to see a good fourth quarter. But in absolute dollar terms, we could see a slight dip between third and fourth quarter because of those 2 specific businesses.
Kelly A. Flynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then, I mean, just back to the comment someone made earlier about the implied growth. I mean, I think it does come in at the high single-digits organically, if you calculate based on everything you said. And I know you tried to clarify, Eva, but it didn't really change the imprint, so I'm just wondering if you want to clarify any further.
Eva Huston: Yes, Kelly, I think if you did the simple math, and you took -- again, we're not going to give you forecast for the fourth quarter, but look at the third quarter revenue, look at what MediConnect did. And if you just did that simple math and took out MediConnect, because again, where I believe you're getting too organic, you would see a double-digit growth rate, if you did that math. Now both of those pieces may move a bit, but I think that, that would be the simple math.
Kelly A. Flynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. All right. And then can we talk about Argus? I think you said -- I think maybe, Frank, in your comments that your future expectations were reconfirmed. But I was hoping you could just reconfirm them as far as the numbers. Are you still also thinking about that as a 15% to 20% organic grower? And then maybe you could comment on the margins. I think Mark said they were accretive to the corporate margin. Does that imply that it's higher than what the EBITDA margin was this quarter? And that's what we should expect going forward?
Frank J. Coyne: Yes, I'll turn to Mark for the numbers. But I would reconfirm, and Scott had indicated in his comments that as we have visited with Argus that has both great leadership and tremendous assets, we see a lot of opportunities for our entire enterprise. Beyond our original expectations, though we were optimistic that, that's what we would find. Mark, why don't you comment on the numbers?
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure. I mean, everything that we've said in the past, with regard to the growth rate that you described are -- I think we remain consistent with us. And specifically around margins, yes, I mean, the Argus has some wonderful margins. As you've seen in historic results, they're actually running ahead of the Verisk margins, and I think that will continue into the future.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair & Company.
Unknown Analyst: [indiscernible] in for Tim this morning. I just want -- I appreciate the color you guys you gave earlier on the healthcare business. And I just want to specifically ask about MediConnect. If we compare that to the rest of the healthcare practice, how would you compare that growth rate? Is it similar, is it slower or faster on a organic basis?
Frank J. Coyne: Mark?
Mark V. Anquillare: So MediConnect, once again, was not a part of our operations in 2011. And if you looked at some of the filings we did regarding the prior year, I think you'll see that MediConnect has been growing extremely well, and I think, probably, a little bit faster than the organic growth we even described for our healthcare business. So they are doing well. And it is -- it's ramped very nicely. And I think, as Scott described, a part of the power of MediConnect is not just Medicaid alone, it's a part of that overall suite of solutions. The business that is our Revenue Integrity business, in combination with some of the HEDIS reporting and the MediConnect business all in one provide a very nice suite of solutions to a set of customers. And I think it's been well received by our customers.
Unknown Analyst: Okay. And then if we looked at the acquisition environment right now, could you maybe talk a little bit about the opportunities you're seeing there? And if there are any particular sectors you guys are looking at more than others?
Frank J. Coyne: Yes, let me comment on that. There are opportunities out there. There are no particular sectors that we look at more the others. As I observed in my comments, and this is Frank, we're looking for good strategic fits at what we consider an appropriate price, given the growth profile the companies that we look at. There are certain characteristics that we particularly like that is that they have business models much like the businesses that we have. And as we look for international opportunity, that's a plus. But we see opportunities, especially in supply chain, to add to our portfolio. But we're not exclusive to just that. We look across the entire spectrum of our strategic map.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Clark with KBW.
William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Healthcare margins being modestly lower than insurance, yet you've been able to maintain and even grow overall Decision Analytics margins as healthcare has become a bigger piece of that segment. Just trying to find out if you'd say that, that's more due to the GAAP between healthcare and insurance margins closing? Or are you seeing margin expansion across all verticals and the difference between kind of product types is staying about the same?
Frank J. Coyne: Mark? Mark, are you still with us?
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure, I apologize. One of the great things about all of our businesses, there's natural operating leverage across the board. So to your specific question, we have seen an increase in the margins inside of our Healthcare business, in part, that's because we have more volumes running through, doesn't take as many people to run those volumes through to natural scale. The other thing that has happened is to the point that we're talking about earlier, we weren't able to recognize as much revenue. Implementation takes time. It takes effort. And then sometimes, that revenue is somewhat deferred. So you're seeing the cumulative effects of both of those on the Healthcare business. And also, just to be clear, across-the-board, with the exception of mortgage, obviously, we see and have seen scale and ramping margins in our Decision Analytics businesses.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Warmington with Raymond James.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: So a question for you on your long-term EBITDA margin targets. We've talked about 43% to 45% in the past, and you guys look like you're on target to actually be above that potentially this year. And with the Argus acquisition, that would seem to put upward pressure on that. So with that in mind, is that still a way we should be thinking about it? Or are we thinking that it's probably likely to move up into the 44% to 46% range?
Frank J. Coyne: Mark?
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure, so let me take that on. I think the reality is, yes you're right, right now, we are running a bit above. I think what we continue to talk to you about and make sure everyone's aware of is that we really don't think about ways that we can keep our margins high. We think about ways that we can grow cash flows, and we can grow our top line for the long term. With that in mind, we are happy to see a lot of our business units coming to us with investment ideas and investment opportunity that have started in third quarter and will continue into 4Q and into '13? So there's some costs that we feel will happen. We also expect that will contribute to the top line into the future. And although Argus and MediConnect have some very strong margins, as you noted, it is tough to find businesses to acquire that have those type of margin characteristics. So as we think about the long term, still -- we think we still remain a little bit tempered about how big those margins can be, because what we're most and first focused on is longer-term growth.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then if you could remind us the comps on the mortgage business in the fourth quarter versus third quarter, I believe, eased. Is that enough to offset some of that decline? Or are we still likely to see another 200 basis point type drag?
Mark V. Anquillare: Just to recap. I mean, I think when we talked about the range of 12% to 15% for the full year, we factored in the fourth quarter of 2011. So I think that is kind of our best guess, full year, including the comp in 4Q of '11.
William A. Warmington - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Got it. One last question for you was on the -- your -- how do you balance the -- your goal of taking leverage from 2.2 to 2? And then also the share repurchase and the M&A opportunities?
Mark V. Anquillare: Good question. I think what we've tried to do is really be very thoughtful about our capital management program. So at the time Argus came along, we were in talks and knew about Argus for a long time. It was a unique opportunity. And we said, we want to continue to be very growth oriented. That is our primary focus. And at that point, we've been telling everybody that we would go above that 2x target. I think, once that happened and we jumped above the 2x, we now have been thoughtful about the cash that goes out the door, and that comes in the form of acquisitions. We will do the right acquisitions. There'll probably be for a bit of a time, a little bit smaller. At the same time, we've also dialed back our buyback program, so that hopefully, in the near term, we'll be back towards that 2x level. And we have a little greater flexibility around acquisitions, as we kind of go into the future towards the latter part of -- in the middle of 2013.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Macquarie.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Could you remind us, how big is the catastrophe modeling business as a percentage of revenue? And with Sandy and, obviously, Katrina not that far back. While, the claims, it sounds like you're not going to get a spike there. Does it impact kind of your clients' view on overall P&C, and just bode well for the business longer-term as we think about it going forward?
Frank J. Coyne: Mark, do you want to start that with percentages?
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure. So let me -- first of all, obviously, we haven't provided you specific visibility into the cat remodeling business. It is a significant part of our insurance category within Decision Analytics. It has been growing very nicely over the last year. And I think, Frank, from the standpoint of characteristics and how the market...
Frank J. Coyne: Yes, I'll go there. And yes, sure. I'd make this observation. We -- the cat modeling business did not get recognized until we had Andrew on the heels of Hugo, '89 and 2002, I think, Andrew was. And then, since then, of course, it has had significant tick up. What will likely happen here is that we -- number one, AIR delivers great science and great products, and that's being recognized. So we're getting more opportunities to be sometimes an additional model to companies that have not been customers of ours in the past. We have done 100% of the cat bonds. We have the model within 100% of the cat bonds that have been issued this year. And we're finding that other industries are recognizing the value of these catastrophe models and their enterprise risk management. So we will see -- we'll, a, recognition of the value proposition around the product. And b, I think, that we'll see more market opportunities as risk managers understand that these cat models can be used in their organizations beyond just P&C.
Kevin D. McVeigh - Macquarie Research: Got it. And Frank, can you just remind us what other industries beyond the traditional P&C your kind of focusing on this services?
Frank J. Coyne: Well, I can point to one that we've already gotten some pickup, and that's crop, where the models have that impact. But when you think of supply chain in its entirety, the disruption associated with that, I think, is going to cause -- with Sandy is going to cost increased focus on how companies can get a better handle, enterprises can get a better handle on their exposures.
Operator: At this time, there are no further questions. And again, there are no further questions.
Frank J. Coyne: Do we have no more questions, operator?
Operator: No, sir, there are no further questions.
Frank J. Coyne: Okay, well, thank you very much. We appreciate everyone joining us. We're sorry that we had a delay, but we think it was a prudent decision. And we appreciate the value of the questions and the quality of them and look forward to speaking with you the next quarter. Have a good day.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day everyone and welcome everyone to the Verisk Analytics’ Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Verisk Treasurer and Head of Investors Relations, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva Huston: Thank you, Amber, and good morning to everyone. We apologize for the slight technical delay we had at the starting here. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our second quarter 2012 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following some comments by Frank, Scott, and Mark highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we’ll open the call up for your question. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be posted on our website and available by dial-in for 30 days until September 1, 2012. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today’s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today’s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk’s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. And information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.
Frank Coyne: Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In second quarter 2012, we delivered good performance of 14% total revenue growth and almost 15% diluted adjusted EPS growth. We continued strong performance from our Healthcare business and good performance from our insurance businesses and our emerging businesses in specialized markets. In the second quarter our risk adjustment revenue grew 4.9% after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics beginning in 2012. This growth is a continuation of what you saw in the first quarter and evidence of our sticky customer relationship based on the recognizable value we bring. In Decision Analytics, we grew revenue almost 23% and our insurance solutions in Decision Analytics grew about 9%, a very solid rate given the lower storm activity versus last year. Our Healthcare solutions continued on the organic growth we have seen in the past few quarters growing revenue nearing 37% organically in the quarter. Our total Healthcare revenue growth was over 160% bolstered by the contributions MediConnect has made to our second quarter performance. In Mortgage, we continue to see challenges in the market and our revenue declined due to the declining items of forensic review, but I would note that we continue to grow our underwriting solutions at a faster pace than the 2Q estimates for the origination market. Overall, our consolidated organic revenue growth was 6.4% as we saw both a lighter quarter per storm activity and mortgage continue to weigh on growth. Excluding all historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 8.4%. Profitability remained strong with an EBITDA margin of 43.9% in the quarter. We remain disciplined of our use of capital and are focused on delivering shareholder returns. We brought $68 million of shares in the quarter as we mange our buyback as part of our broader capital allocation plan. We continue to be active in looking at M&A but also continue to maintain our discipline, focusing on assets with a true strategic fit, strong financial model and appropriate value in relation to future growth. The first half of 2012 has been solid and met expectations overall. I remain confident that behind the numbers we are doing the right things to position our business for future growth driven by delivering quality solutions to our customers. Now, I'll turn it over to Scott to give you details about our progress in healthcare and other parts of the business.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, Frank. I'm going to briefly update you on development in several of our business with an emphasis on innovations aimed at our customers' emerging needs and ways in which we are becoming more integral to their operation. First, in the Healthcare vertical three items, the unified platform initiatives is proceeding in the first phase of integrating our payment integrity businesses has been largely completed. We are one month into hosting of large customer on the platform and then our teams are pleased with the results to-date. The efficacy of our real-time edits are increasing materially inside the new platform. In the next phase, we will leave our enterprise analytic solution into the platform as we also transition more customers to the platform. We are pleased to be meeting important milestones on time as we steam towards 2013 completion of the project. Next, we are finding great synergy between our revenue integrity business and MediConnect Business. We have been pitching business jointly and have been energized by the level of wins coming from the combined skill set. And third, we are finding great synergy between our healthcare analytics and the P&C world. Working with the group of PNC carriers, we have now processed $15 billion of work comp claims in order to suppress fraudulent and wasteful ones. We are only getting started and the early result hold great promise. In connection with all the positive momentum we are excited to have recently name Joel Portice as the new President of Verisk Health. Joel had been running our payment accuracy division, which is one of our most highly performing, and where his leadership had led us to considerably higher growth in margin as well as the integration of the unified platform I mentioned earlier. We extend the best wishes as Michael Coyne, our prior president moves on to an emergent health and traumatic company. In a different vertical, I want to highlight some work we have been dealing with our weather and analytics tool as they related to insurers. In late 2011, we announced a solution called AER Respond, which picks our weather data and overlays it on an insurance policy portfolio when a large weather event occurs in order to give them a better estimate, of both how to deploy their resources as well as what type and volume of claims to expect. We have recently been successful in selling this solution to several top tier insurers and have begun to integrate this tool into our Xactimate claims estimating tool and we are excited about this and the general future of repurposing our weather analytics in the commercial uses for insurers as well as into other domains such as the supply chain. The general themes of innovation and repurposing of our intellectual property are very alive across all parts of Verisk and they will continue to be a major part of our growth story going forward. And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to cover our financial results.
Mark Anquillare: Thank Scott. You have put some of the exciting things that are going on in our business and I will share some of the numbers that was a result of those efforts. In the second quarter, we delivered 14% total revenue growth and 6.4% organic revenue growth. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic growth in the quarter was 8.4%. For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue continued to lead with 22.6% revenue growth of which 7.6% was organic excluding the 2011 acquisitions for Bloodhound and HRP, which is Health Risk Partners and the 2012 acquisition of MediConnect, as well as the transferred revenue for the mortgage appraisal tool. As a reminder in 2012, we have transferred revenue related to the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment's property specific revenue category into Decision Analytics' mortgage and financial services revenue category to reflect a management reporting change. We will continue to provide you with visibility into the apples versus apples comparisons throughout 2012. Within the Decision Analytics our insurance category grew 8.8% in the second quarter for organic. We continued on double digit growth in our catastrophe modeling solutions as we continued to gain customers and also performed well on the catastrophe related products focused on the capital markets. We have been the model of record for all catastrophe bonds issued in 2012. We also experienced strong subscription revenue from our loss quantification solutions, but more moderate growth due to decreased transactional revenue resulting from decreased storm activity in the second quarter of 2012 versus the same period in 2011. Claim solutions delivered respectable growth. I'll note that our acquisition of Aspect Loss Prevention in July of 2012 is under the leadership of our pro-claims and crime analytics group, and we reported in the insurance revenue category within Decision Analytics. The revenue in mortgage and financial services declined 1% as reported in the second quarter and declined 9.9% after adjusting for the transfer of new mortgage appraisal tools from risk assessment into this revenue category. Underwriting tools grew nicely in the quarter and continued to outpace growth in origination markets. Corporate revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter as expected offsetting that growth. Our outlook for 2012 for mortgage remains negative as the mortgage markets continues to make it difficult to predict near-term trend for the majority of our solutions, but we remain confident in the long-term value and our relationships with the financial institutions that buy our tools. Healthcare continued strong growth, 160.7% for the second quarter and 36.7% organically, and healthcare organic growth year-to-date has been 34.8%. Our total growth continues to benefit from the addition of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners, as well as the addition of MediConnect in the second quarter. Just as a reminder for those of you who are looking at sequential revenue dollars, Q1 and Q2 are seasonally lower revenue and margin quarters for our revenue integrity business. And MediConnect follows a similar seasonal pattern. Additionally, starting in third quarter 2012, both the acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners will become a part of our calculation of organic growth. Our specialized markets grew 8.7% in the second quarter, with growth from both our supply chain solutions as well as in weather analytics. Both of these areas are delivering solid growth today, and we are optimistic about the opportunities to broaden their reach. Scott gave you an example of traction we're getting with insurance on our weather analytics and we're actively taking our 3D assets, in addition to our stream event modeling asset, in developing broader strategies around that to serve supply chain. In Risk Assessment, we reported revenue growth of 2.6% in the quarter, and 4.9% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer we discussed earlier. Our industry standard program 6.1% in the quarter reflecting our 2012 invoices and strong growth in our premium leakage solution. If you're looking at sequential revenue growth please note remember 2000, $1 million of license revenue was called out in first quarter that was non-recurring. Our property specific revenue growth, which reported declines of 7.3%, but excluding the transfer grew 1.8%, as new sales and higher volumes from certain customers offset decline from others and the appraisable solutions grew further growth also. EBITDA for the second quarter was $163.8 million as outlined in table 3 of our press release. EBIDTA increased 14% for the quarter and our EBIDTA margin was 43.9% remaining consistent with our margins in the second quarter of 2011. Although actually up if you take into account the $3.0 million benefit of the earn-out liability reduction in 2011, and the greater impact on margin of a full quarter of acquisition they are seasonally lower in the second quarter of 2012. Ex-acquisitions the second quarter of 2012 margins would have been 44.9%. As reported we're down slightly from the 45.9% in the first quarter 2012 due primarily to our annual salary increases from April 1st, and the incremental cost related to April 2012 equity work, and associated accelerated vesting on the payment of eligible retirement age by some employees. In the quarter our risk assessment margins were 52.8% versus 48.6% in second quarter of 2011. We benefited by about 2% on the margin due to lower pension costs related to freeze of plan in February. Also in April, we funded $72 million into the pension bringing it closer to fully funded. Our business continues to show scaled up profitability, but we also to continue to invest in developing new solutions. The margin in Decision Analytics was 38.3% in second quarter 2012 versus 40.4% in second quarter of 2011, and 39.3% in first quarter 2012. In second quarter 2011, we had the benefit to the margin from the reduction in earn out liability of $3.4 million. Excluding the benefit of that reduction, the margin in that period was 38.6%. In second quarter 2012, ex-acquisitions EBITDA margin will exceed 39%. Our interest expense was up $2.5 million versus second quarter 2011 based on higher debt balance related to our acquisitions. We ended the second quarter with total debt of $1.3 billion including the $150 million drawn under our $725 million revolver. Our pro forma debt to EBIDTA ratio as of June 30th was 1.9 times. Our reported effective tax rate was 39.5% for the quarter, which we expect to continue for the rest of 2012. Coming down to the net income line, we focused on adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition related amortization expense, less the income tax effects on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 13.7% to $80.6 million for the quarter and adjusted EPS on its fully diluted basis was $0.47, an increase of 14.6%. The average diluted share count was 171.9 million shares in the quarter and on March 31, 2012, our diluted share count was 171.3 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased approximately 1.4 million shares for about $68 million. At quarter end we had about $200 million left under our authorization. Our approach to share repurchases remained focused on limiting dilution and only going beyond that when we believe the share repurchase will deliver appropriate internal rates of return and not crowd out acquisitions. Our share repurchase program has been successful to date generalized annualized IRRs over 25%. Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, our cash and cash equivalents were about $97 million. Total debt both short-term and long-term totaled $1.3 billion at June 30 reflecting debt borrowed that fund the MediConnect acquisition which closed on March 30, and after our pension funding of $72 million April. Post MediConnect and pension funding, our debt capacity is about $650 million and will continue to grow with our EBIDTA and free cash flow. As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go beyond our long-term target of 2 times debt to EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities, particularly on the acquisition side. With that debt capacity available, we continue to look for the right opportunities. Free cash from the first half of 2012, which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was a $149.4 million, a decrease of about $3.3 million or 2.2% versus the first half of 2011. This decline was principally due to the funding of our pension which we have mentioned earlier. Excluding the impact of our pension funding net of tax benefit and timing (inaudible) and other items or free cash was about 18% to the positive. Our capital expenditures were 5.3% of revenue for six months ended June 30, 2012. Free cash flow represented 46.2% of EBITDA in the first six months of 2012 reflecting a reduced conversionary due to the $72 million pension funding partially offset by the tax benefit associated with that. Overall, our business is performing well, and we have a nice mix of growth from multiple vertical and we continue to invest for the future.  With that, I will ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kelly Flynn with Credit Suisse.
Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse: Great. Thanks for taking my question first. So my question relates to MediConnect and also Bloodhound and HRP. Can you give us more specific sense of what revenue MediConnect contributed to the business in the second quarter? And then also it would be helpful if you could tell us what the year-over-year growth rates were for both MediConnect as well as the Bloodhound and HRP businesses in the second quarter so we can try to figure out hopefully what impact the HRP and Bloodhound might have when they roll into organic? Thanks.
Mark Anquillare: Well, I think what we have seen is nice and solid growth in the standpoint of all of our healthcare acquisitions. We grew in double digits across the board in the first half of 2012 and MediConnect showed strength. As we described at the time of the call on MediConnect, there is a second half seasonal aspect to MediConnect similar to our Health Risk Partners business in that anywhere from 50% for HRP and maybe as much as 70% from MediConnect is more weighted towards the second half. So (inaudible) that gives you a little bit more visibility into where we are.
Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse: Well, I guess the thing is that I mean the health care business is growing over 30% organically. So, I mean when you say double digit that could be anywhere from you know 10 to 30 for these acquisitions. So, I mean could you give any more help on that? are we talking -- do you think basically when HRP and Bloodhound roll into the organic base, is it likely to have a significant positive impact on the organic growth or should we think about their growth rate is being closer to the corporate organic rate at this point?
Mark Anquillare: Sure, let me try to give up a little bit more on that. I think there is two things that you consider and just remember that I was to look back from the standpoint of healthcare, third quarter we did about $30 million last year and then we had a big step into fourth quarter we did about $38 million. So there is a tougher comp but we feel very good about the continuation of strong organic growth and I think it come into the corporate growth rate there growing faster than the corporate organic growth rate, and that should provide the lift.
Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse - Analyst: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rayna Kumar with Evercore Partners.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners: Good morning, I am calling in fro David Togut. Can you please talk about the specific factor that throughout the deterioration of mortgage results in the second quarter and do you expect these factors to persist during the next 18 months?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah, this is Scott, I will take that. I mean, as Mark said before, when you think about the different parts of our business, the tools that we sell for purposes of supporting originations were up strongly. And so, the difference in result is a function of the forensic and analysis we do of the loans that are gone bad. And what we are seeing is a variety of movements inside the customer base where there are some customers that have ramped up their volumes but there had been others that have actually ramped down their volume substantially, just particularly in the mortgage insurance world, and that's just a function of market condition in that world. So, that's a trend that we think we'll continue to work its way out in 2012.
Rayna Kumar - Evercore Partners: Okay. And just a follow-up to the previous question, do you think high 30% organic revenue growth in the healthcare vertical is sustainable, and if so why?
Mark Anquillare: I think I tried to answer that before, I mean, I think we feel very good about healthcare. The comps become more challenging as we get towards the end of year. So we still feel very good about the strong double-digit growth. And to extent that we get a little bit more refined there, I think we've been winning customers, but I don't know if we have a very specific view lines dollar and percent growth.
Operator: Your next question is from Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo: How much of an impact this, the lower storm activity have on the insurance growth rate within Decision Analytics on the quarter?
Scott Stephenson: It's a little bit difficult to parse because what happens inside of our contracts is this. If we have a customer who has exceeded their minimums and then we start to just basically charge on a transactional basis. In very large parts, it will come to us and we'll renegotiate a higher minimum. So, it's tough to do a direct comparison. But let me just at least give you this. It was definitely a drag in the tune of about 20 bps in the second quarter on overall growth. I think that's the one way we kind of think about it. So, I hope that gives you some clarity. And what we're seeing which is obviously, may be fleeting but we've seen storm activity in July start to return to normal, which I think bodes well, I mean, like any insurance cycle and insurance trends I mean, things are up and down. And I think we saw a very high activity in 2011. We've seen unusually low activity in the first half of '12 and you would think things would start to return to normal.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo: So, how should we think about then that insurance piece of the Decision Analytics business going forward? Is that really like a high single-digit revenue grower with upside to that due to whatever has happened with this storm activity?
Scott Stephenson: I just need to clarify, are you talking about insurance as a whole or you're talking about the insurance aspects of Decisions Analytics please?
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo: Within Decision Analytics?
Scott Stephenson: I think we continue to feel very strong growth there is possible. I mean, I -- we tell you that from the standpoint of insurance inside of DA, we do look at and I will just quickly digress. When, we think about insurance I mean we're servicing a broad set of customers that is a combination of those customers from a risk assessment perspective and we try to cross-sell into Decision Analytics. So, across the board, I think we do feel that that combined is a kind of high single-digit growth. But we do have a view that Decision Analytics where most of that growth is going to be. And we continue to feel strong about the opportunities there both in the second half of the year, as well as into the future.
Operator:  Your next question is from Bill Warmington with Raymond James.
Bill Warmington - Raymond James: I want to ask on the mortgage business. When you saw the cross over point was going to come, when the originations business begins to outgrow the forensic piece and also, if you could remind us again what the mix is between the two businesses?
Mark Anquillare: Well, we remained cautions about mortgage to the full year. I think we have said that if we exclude that revenue trends, so we talked about we are down about 7%. I think we mentioned early on the year that that had been and continues to be our forecast of full year. There is a customer that we described for most part that starts to normalize in fourth quarter. But just given the uncertainty inside that market and also the movement in originations which have been strong in the second quarter and subsequently in the future the risk become a little bit cautious about giving too much optimism inside of mortgage for the remainder of the year.
Bill Warmington - Raymond James:  Okay. How about the mix, if you can recall it was like two thirds forensic and third origination but that maybe dated now?
Mark Anquillare: Its now about 55% on the backend, it is a little bit greater than that 50% on the year-to-date perspective and that is obviously down from what it was because the forensic has been dropping and the front end has been increasing.
Bill Warmington - Raymond James: Okay. And then, I wanted to ask also, if you could give some additional color on how you are integrating MediConnect into revenue integrity and also for the HEDIS with enterprise analytics?
Frank Coyne: Yeah, good. So, the HEDIS part of our business actually formally reports into the MediConnect structure. So, and we actually did that almost contemporaneous with the acquisition because the overlaps are just so obvious and so great and that is really -- that is working very well.
Bill Warmington - Raymond James: Good. 
Frank Coyne: And then, the connection of that set of capability, so starts retrieval and abstraction plus HEDIS, there is a very tight working relationship really at the level of the account, because when we are selling into the individual account you actually need to present the chart retrieval and abstraction solution at the same time as you present the HDC analytics and the five star analytics and that is what, all of that is part of the bundle that many customers are buying and so, we actually need to line all that up on a customer-by-customer basis when we're actually going to market. And so we're well along on that also. And really conceptually all of that, everything you just asked about, Bill, it is in our minds, one integrated business and we just continue more and more to move in the direction of operating it exactly in that way.
Bill Warmington - Raymond James: Okay. And the last question I just wanted to ask about how exactly are you doing on a standalone basis with the XactContents module, and any thoughts on the European expansion?
Frank Coyne: XactContents continues to grow well and its growth rate is outpacing the growth rate of the market. It's one of the more highly growing parts of the Xactware portfolio. We feel the market is coming in the direction of our solutions. There is -- just for little color, there is a lot of working on content, which is very labor intense, and that's not our method. It's we're doing it the Verisk way build it once and sell it many, many times. And the market seems to be coming to that. And in Europe we continue to make very steady progress. We've actually with one customer leaped across the English Channel into Mainland Europe, and we're very happy about that and we just continue to expect more and more growth throughout Europe. And we're actually looking at other geographies as well. It's a tool, which is extensible, and what paces that primarily actually is the availability of enough local data in order to have relatively good cost factors inside the mall.
Operator: Your next question is from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: I want to ask about the P&C insurance industry. Obviously premiums were rising in 2011 to help your 2013 risk assessment growth. I wanted to go further to say when the P&C insurance industry is doing better should it just lift your Decision Analytics insurance piece through request are in other products and if so, what would be the timing of any DA lift that you get from the insurance industry?
Frank Coyne: I mean, yes, you're generally on the right path. But I guess what I want to just emphasize is the degree of one-to-one coupling of those two factors. There is a lot that goes on inside of our customers' consideration of our solutions. And the primary point is that every one of our DA solutions is going to get highly, highly scrutinized before it's purchased. I mean, our customers are very sober minded, risk bearing entities, and they usually we go through a proof of concept. And so, at the end of the day, their decision to buy a Decision Analytics solution is really based upon the value of that -- of that solution. It is true that if their results overall are stronger at the margin, I would say, their willingness to think about purchasing our new solutions that probably goes up somewhat but I really want to caution against you thinking that it’s a one for one correspondence because it just doesn’t work that way. The sales cycles are long and the considerations are very technical when they look at minor products. But yes, on balance, it is actually helpful.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: I was asking about given the sales cycle that you just talked which are probably shorter when the P&C is doing better, when and how long do you think it will take to see benefit in your DA insurance segment for just the factor that the P&C insurance industry has been doing better for over a year now?
Frank Coyne: Well, again, I don’t actually think the decision -- your premise is the one that we actually don’t share. So, I don’t think that the coupling is as tight as maybe you're suggesting it in your question, but I would say that there are long smooth cycles inside of the insurance industry and I think the industry itself sort of observes changing behavior relatively slowly. So, you should think in terms of sort of cycle thing out, it’s over a couple of years basically. And I again, the Decision Analytics decision making cycle is not really going to be respond all that strongly or all that quickly to what's going on inside of the industry overall. (inaudible). We're very optimistic about getting our solutions sold.
Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan: How long is a typical sales cycle to cross over new DA solution to insurance company?
Frank Coyne: 18 months would probably be a good midpoint.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Suzanne Stein with Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Have you disclosed the cost of the new healthcare platform, and can you just talk about how significant this could be from the cost side? And this in terms of future margin?
Frank Coyne: Sure. Suzy, I think we've described that we were talking about -- we call that two major initiatives that were taking place specifically around 2012 and it was the combination of the unified platform which is the healthcare platform in combination with our next generation platform which is the catastrophe modeling platform. Now, what we said was the two combined for '12, we're targeting towards about $10 million. Now, I think your question as I heard it was really more focused the impact of margin. So, when we talk about the $10 million a majority of that is programming cost. So, as a result that is capitalized, it becomes a part of the CapEx. As a part of the overall initiative, clearly there is a lot of cost associated with modelers and scientists to help with the catastrophe modeling science, but a good chunk of our investment in ‘12 is going to be CapEx and I would tell you that as we think about 2013 it may become a little bit more period cost but not that dramatic. I don’t think it’s going to affect margins in too negative or material way.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Okay, I guess that was very helpful the question is also should that drive margin improvement in longer term? I mean is that for cost efficiency over the long run?
Scott Stephenson:  I'm going to go back and forth, this is Scott. the answer is I think the opportunity there is to create a more robust platform and on the healthcare side it could become more efficient but the reality is we are doing this to drive top line growth. I mean it is the ability to bring solutions together to make it easier for customers to buy and make user experience more pleasing and that has been kind of a lot of the focus of these two initiatives.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great then just a quick one on share buybacks. You've done a great job of returning capital to shareholders. Do you think this will continue at a similar pace going forward?
Frank Coyne: Well as I think we have always said I mean we have a view that we are really trying to create shareholder return our first and primary focus is to invest in the business. So the extent that we have opportunities around the acquisition front that would be our primary first use of capital and then we will continue to do buybacks to eliminate dilution.  Extending beyond dilution and returning additional capital beyond that it’s really a balancing act. We try to take a look at little bit about the pipeline we want to make sure we have enough capacity to continue to execute on that growth strategy. So, I think what you have seen over the last couple of quarters is a little bit of a dialing back because of the actual acquisition activity that we have had.
Operator: Your next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Just a quick question on the international aspect. Could you tell us what the mix now is for international and, I think Scott mentioned, you are seeing some pretty growth there, I understand is coming off a smaller base, but are we talking about high double digit? So what sort of growth are we seeing there?
Frank Coyne: You got to bear in mind the base is very small, I mean, we really got only two businesses at the moment that have material international footprints. And so, inside of our revenue overall non-domestic might be about 5% or something like that. So the rates of growth are good but you are coming off from a very small base. This is a long March for Verisk.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays: Yeah, correct, okay, fair enough. And then just from a strategic standpoint I guess in the mortgage division is the, obviously you have strong set of underwriting tools and you have, like you said, customer issue on the forensic side, but is this strategy that sort of just stick with the tools and ride out the storm per se or is that thought or opportunity around acquiring volume and market share and maybe bulking up that unit a bit?
Frank Coyne: That is not where our thinking goes at this time, so the acquiring and bulking up. We do remain very interested in other forms of solution inside of the commercial banking industry, I mean, that is definitely in mind. But when you look at the mortgage vertical itself we have a very complete set of solutions. And we are continuing to try to make them better and we do believe that in normalized market conditions we would have a very nice business.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays: So I guess to follow on that could you give us some idea of I guess, the other solution as you just referred to in the commercial banking industry and would that be sort of innovation coming from internally or would you need to acquire something?
Frank Coyne: Well, we are not really talking about our plans specifically in that area and as always we remain open to developing things internally and building our platform through acquisition.
Manav Patnaik - Barclays: And last question just for Mark. In terms of the Aspect Loss that acquisition. I mean. I know this is really small, should we see or should we be modeling any sort of contribution benefit from that deal?
Mark Anquillare: I just want to describe to you that it is really very much a tuck-in acquisition to a business that is it is small but growing inside of Verisk as a whole. It is just not going to hit the (inaudible) or make any dramatic impact on revenue that you can consider.
Operator: Your next question is from James Friedman with SIG.
James Friedman - SIG: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wasn’t sure if it was Mark or Scott who was speaking, but with regard to the healthcare client that you mentioned that's coming on board in the second half how does the revenue recognition work on that?
Scott Stephenson: Hi. Do you want to take it, Mark?
Mark Anquillare: Yeah, just you'd appreciate what we are talking about was we are moving one large customer who is a pretty broad based customer, we are moving from our existing solution to our new unified platform. That is kind of a test customer. So, from a revenue recognition perspective we are providing the same set of solutions, same set of services, we are continuing to roll out maybe some additional analytics because of the new platform, but the reality is the revenue reckoned does not change it is the same customer providing and we are providing a maybe more complete set but same set of our solutions.
James Friedman - SIG: I was just trying to figure out had there been any expenses that weren't offset by revenue at this stage in the customer's adoption?
Mark Anquillare: I think there has been cost to the overall unified platform but as most of that has been capitalized, so I don’t think you can see a blip in any margin calculation that I think I tried to highlight that to Suzy so.
James Friedman - SIG: And then in addition, Mark, you had mentioned there was 20 bps, which is really helpful of impact in the insurance decision. I just want to make sure I got the denominator right. Was that 20 bps on the insurance Decision Analytics or was that on the Decision Analytics or was that on the company overall?
Mark Anquillare: Sure. So, it is on the company overall and it is about 20 to 30 bps, yes.
James Friedman - SIG: Got you. Yeah, that's a helpful number. And then, lastly, it seem like the repurchase though substantial was slightly less than the east, let me get my language right, the KSOP, so you actually had a slight increase in the share account. Is there anything to read into that or is that just a function f when the shares come on?
Mark Anquillare: Let me just remind everybody about the KSOP. The KSOP in a majority of the expense was accelerated at the time of the IPO. So we probably went it at and too much down for some investors, but that’s in large part behind it, I will come back in a minute. But all you see right now is a reserve as it relates to the KSOP is the 401K match component. So really the only thing you should be seeing is maybe MediConnect coming in there, because this is a 401K match of those employees, but the reality is it should be pretty consistent and it's consistent with kind of how we match our employees contribution to that program. The other thing that I will just highlight is the way these SOPK is handled is that we need to take all those shares and pass them along to participants by the end of 2013, so it is depended up on what the value of the shares are and how many shares are left. There could be, as we always talked about, some 2013 events that would be a non-cash one time type of item to end the ESOP plan. If you are looking broadly at our share count, and I am just trying to interpret some of your question, there were and continue to be option exercises associated with our long term incentive plans and maybe the option exercised and then number of shares coming out exceeded the buybacks we did in the quarter. So, there was may be some dilution. We try to handle that over the long term, not quarter by quarter.
Operator: Your next question from Jennifer Huang with UBS.
Jennifer Huang - UBS: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Did you guys talk about the sales implementation cycle being I guess the 18 months for the -- on the insurance side. Can you talk about that on the health care side? And in terms of the revenue growth as we have seen in health care with inside on those revenues open products that were sold, so part of the solutions that were several quarters ago, so can you just talk about the pipeline in terms of sales and implementation currently and how that compares to may be a year ago?
Frank Coyne: Yeah, well, the pipeline is stronger than it was a year ago if for no other reason that we have more solutions. And so, when -- we actually grid it out where we look at each customer and we look at which parts of our suite they buy and don’t buy. And relative to last year there is actually more white space on that grid because the solution sets are expanded even though there are -- we have filled in some of the customers on that same grid. So that definitely the sense of opportunity in the market is greater. The sale cycles vary in healthcare depending up on which part of the solution mix that we are talking about. So, when we talk about revenue integrity, those solutions actually tend to be on somewhat faster sale cycles. There are also I would say among the things that we do they have some of the most easily quantified value propositions. There is just a great urgency about getting the revenue integrity calculations right because reimbursement from Medicare, for example, literally hinges upon it, and it all occurs within the calendar year. So there is actually a genuine push on the part of the customers to get into those solutions, and I would embrace the MediConnect solutions inside of that. At the other end of the spectrum would probably be the medical intelligence analytics that we sell which are very useful for getting things like actuarial calculations correct and reserving right, etc, but those tend to sort of slightly less urgently felt sorts of the needs. And then -- so, I would say the sales cycles are longest there and probably in the 18 month plus range. And then somewhere in the middle would be our payment accuracy solution where the value for opposition is strong and quantifiable, but the amount of integration that’s required is a little bit greater and so it just tends to pace things a little bit more.
Jennifer Huang - UBS: Okay. And that's very helpful. And then I know there is still uncertainties out there around the healthcare reform --
Frank Coyne: Yeah.
Jennifer Huang - UBS: But as it stands today, I guess how do you think that -- how that impacts the healthcare business?
Frank Coyne: It really doesn’t have a lot of impact. I mean, you have to go back to the basic fast that most of our businesses with payors and the net effect of the healthcare reform would due to have more people on private or formal insurance system which on balance would just expand the size of that and so was sort of a moderate part -- a benign moderately positive basically. I would also say I think that the that there is also inside of the overall reform the government is putting a little bit more emphasis on using data analytics and emphasizing things like matching cost and quality outcomes. And those are all good for us because anybody who just get more thoughtful about how to run healthcare is going to naturally be more interested in the kind of things that we do.
Operator: Your next question is from Bill Cork with KBW.
Bill Cork - KBW: Good morning, just wanted to go back to the expense side. Sequentially, I think you had the impact of the equity awards this quarter. Year-over-year you still have the comp increases and I think also this quarter you had some impact from the pension freeze. Just trying to get a sense of where Q2 is from a run rate perspective and where we could expect the second half of the year to kind of shake out?
Mark Anquillare: So I mean let me just kind of reiterate I think what you said. So, if I was to look at the second quarter and look at it solely you know, the salary increases that were in will remain for remainder of the year. So, I don’t think you would adjust for anything there.  The items that I will call out is inside of the margins we have a long term incentive with the equity compensation because of the way claim participants who are aged 62 vest we do have an acceleration in the second quarter. That’s about $4 to $4.5 million that affected the quarter and that will kind of normalize out for the remainder of the year. So, that’s something you should probably think about. Pension, I think you would probably expect that to just continue with what you saw first half. And we did also mention that the acquisitions are a little bit seasonal. So, the margins in the first half of the year are little bit lighter than what we will see in the second half. So that’s a bit of a positive in the second half as you think about margins overall.
Operator: And we have a follow up question from Kelly Flynn with Credit Suisse.
Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse: Thanks just a couple of quick follow ups. First on the mortgage business, I know you said you expected to be weak for rest of the year but I was hoping you can help us work through how we should think about the tougher comp that the business had in this quarter and kind of should that lead to an improvement in the growth rate all else equal in the third and fourth quarter? So why was the comp down if you could remind us and what impact did that have in the back half growth rate?
Mark Anquillare: I think we have always we said right from the beginning of the year is that we are targeting sometimes somewhere around 7% decline for the full year. And I think what we view right now is we don’t think we have enough information to change that view.  From a comp perspective, we talked about a customer that has been kind of moving back to a more normalized level of forensic review that I think we saw more or less normalizing in the fourth quarter of this year. And the other thing that I highlighted was that what helped us in the first half was a kind of a pretty rich mortgage origination environment which was rather positive and I am not sure if the NBA and others expect that to continue for the second half and that works against us. So those are the things that like factoring just some of our thinking. Obviously, I talked about the macro factors. At the same time, I mean, I think we have a view that we are still winning customers and we are making progress both on the front end and call out on the back end. So, all of that is, bodes well for the future but I want to be cautious about where we are today.
Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse: Okay, but it grew, I think it grew a percent in the second quarter of 2011 and I understand you had a customer kind of rolling off but that was a much better growth rate than any other quarter in the year. Was there anything else going on there that made for that especially strong growth rate in the second quarter of ’11?
Mark Anquillare: Well, I do know that the second quarter of ’11 we were talking about that one customer, they did a lot of volume with us in that quarter.
Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse: Okay, so was that one customer okay, got it. And then just another question on the insurance part of Decision Analytics. I think clearly you guys have called out Xactware and some of the weather comps there, but could you give us a little more detail on the other businesses and I would ask it this way. Which businesses are seeing accelerating growth in line item, and which ones are decelerating aside from Xactware?
Mark Anquillare: Want to talk a little bit about cash remodeling and kind of I think that will probably our strongest --
Frank Coyne: Yeah. So I think, we have -- well, first of all, don’t overlook the fact that inside of Xactware there is actually a variety of things that get done. And some of them are related to claims and some of them are related to underwriting some of them are domestic and some of them are overseas. And so you don’t have to pick Xactware part. And the growth rate associated with that bundle of thing would have been materially different if storm activity had been equivalent in 2012 to what it was in 2011. So just that background. Other things that are going on inside of the insurance DA mix, two things I would particularly highlight. One would be catastrophe modeling Mark talked about us literally sweeping the board in terms of all the capons issued in 2012 which we actually think of as the purest test of the quality of the science inside of the model. And so, we find that a really encouraging result. Basically, there are still a lot of parallel country combinations to be modeled. And we find that the market is very open to our solutions. And all of that just compounds inside of the work we are doing, that create a new platform for serving up the models to get them even more inline with the customers workflows. That will be one thing that I would point out. Another thing I would point out is underwriting. As you know, we created an underwriting unit at the beginning of this year and its growth rate is very strong, it is greater than the growth rate of Decision Analytics overall. And as we access where we sit in the P&C world, strengthening our underwriting solutions and our position is on of our biggest opportunity. It is actually, that we are so strong in claims, we are so strong in catastrophe modeling, we are so strong in rating but underwriting is something where underwriting not rating is a place where we can still definitely gain altitude. And so far in 2012 as well, the results have been good.
Operator:  And your next question comes from Tim Mchugh with William Blair.
Tim Mchugh - William Blair: Just following up for the previous question. I want to ask a similar question about healthcare. If you can just talk about the different service lines or product lines, there they all seem to be doing well, but is there any one of them that is doing particularly better or worse relative to the others?
Frank Coyne: I mean basically, so just to kind of clarify what we do. First of all, you can really put it -- we put it in the four buckets. So, there is what we call enterprise analytics, which is the variety of medical intelligence products which are aimed at things like risk adjusting and risks scoring individual members of a population. We have also got our enterprise intelligence, which is basically the OLAP platform through which a plan can consume the analytics and apply them to their decisioning. Then, we have got payment accuracy, which is coming through claims flows in order to basically clean those claims flows, find the one the claims that are suspicious and then take them through some clinical review in order to present a very clean view of the claim. And we supplemented that with what we did what we are now doing with our colleagues at Bloodhound, where in addition to that sort of retrospective -- I shouldn’t say retrospective, later in the process analysis as we can also deal with the claims even before they are adjudicated inside of the claim system. That is the second thing. Third thing is what we call revenue integrity, which is essentially helping our customers with their own reimbursement. So, I mentioned before, HCC analytics for Medicare Advantage reimbursement. And more generally, five star kinds of analytics that also relate to Medicare reimbursement. So that is revenue integrity. And then, the fourth thing we do is, it is under the banner of MediConnect and its chart retrieval and abstraction. So, it's getting the clinical data so that you can analyze it. The first order use of that data actually is inside the things like HEDIS calculations, as well as the revenue integrity work that I just described. So, those are the four big buckets. And they are all doing well actually and I think that is really the message here. But I would say that probably, at the moment at least, we are getting a little bit more gross from chart retrieval abstraction and the revenue integrity set of things but that is detail underneath the general and/or of that we're well-positioned, its kind of everywhere really.
Tim Mchugh - William Blair: Okay. And the workers comp opportunity that you are seeing in terms of the synergy between the P&C and MediConnect.
Frank Coyne: Right.
Tim Mchugh - William Blair: Where, is that in the healthcare business or you are coming at that from the insurance platform?
Frank Coyne: That the revenue gets recognized in the payment accuracy part of the healthcare business. With a bigger assist from our P&C colleagues. We are working on claims on the P&C side. 
Operator: Thank you. I would now turn the call back over Frank Coyne for any closing remark.
Frank Coyne: Yes. Well, thank you very much for joining us on second quarter results and I would like to thank you for your interest and your questions. And we look forward to well speaking with you again next quarter. Have a good day.
Operator:  Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning. My name is [Tequila], and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Verisk Analytics’ First Quarter’s Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Ms. Eva Huston, you may begin.
Eva F. Huston: Great, thank you, [Tequila], and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for a discussion of our first quarter 2012 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Anquillare, our CFO. Following some comments by Frank, Scott, and Mark, highlighting the key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we’ll open the call up for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be posted on our website and available by dial-in as well for 30 days until June 2, 2012. And finally, as set forth in more detail in today’s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today’s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk’s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.
Frank J. Coyne: Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In first quarter 2012, we delivered good performance of almost 11% revenue growth, 17.5% diluted adjusted EPS growth, and strong free cash flow growth. We continued strong performance in our businesses, and we are seeing benefits from our 2012 invoices and the improving performance of our P&C insurance customers. In 2011, P&C industry premiums grew 3.6% versus 1.5% percent in 2010. While the 2011 industry premiums don’t figure into our invoices until 2013, we are happy our customers are doing better because that does represent new opportunities for us. In the first quarter, our risk assessment revenue grew 5.2%, after adjusting for the impact of a transfer of some revenue to Decision Analytics, reflecting the continued value we are delivering to our customers. In Decision Analytics, we grew revenue almost 17%. And our Insurance Solutions and Decision Analytics grew about 11%. Our healthcare solutions continued on the growth trajectory we saw in the last half of 2011, growing revenue over 30% organically in the quarter. And we also were pleased to have the MediConnect team join and look forward to their contributions in the future. In mortgage, we continue to see challenges in the market and our revenue declined apples-to-apples. But I would note that we grew our underwriting solutions at a faster pace than the origination market grew. Overall, our consolidated organic revenue growth was 7.7%, consistent with the expectations we discussed with you last year, as mortgage continues to weigh on growth. Excluding our historical mortgage business, organic revenue growth was 9%. We continue to have conviction around our margin and overall profitability. Our EBITDA margin was 45.9% in the quarter, and diluted adjusted EPS growth of 17.5% was along very strong. We remain disciplined about our use of capital and focused on delivering shareholder returns. We were pleased to acquire MediConnect this quarter and put about $350 million of that capital to work to generate returns. We also bought $39 million of shares in the quarter as we manage our buyback as part of our broader capital allocation plan, including acquisitions. We remain consistent in our approach to balancing uses of capital. As I look towards the remainder of 2012, I am excited about all the verticals we face and the teams we have in place to deliver growth from our markets. Now I’ll turn it over to Scott to talk about our progress against some of our operational goals.
Scott G. Stephenson: Thank you, Frank. We have a number of things on our plate that we believe set us up for future growth, both from a sales and technology perspective. First on sales, we continue to ensure that we have the best teams facing our customers, and we have made some new hires in that area. We are also ensuring that our holistic solution sets are being sold to decision makers. One of the powerful elements of our organization is solutions that can interoperate. Our competitors typically do not have this advantage. For example, our Verisk Insurance Solutions underwriting team has been in operation for a full quarter now, and we are getting good feedback from customers on this approach. On the technology side, we’ve recognized the importance of technology and are continuing to invest behind our platforms, in particular, to deliver better solutions to our customers. We’ve talked earlier about the unified healthcare platform, and we are on track for that to be completed in 2013, with a series of interim deliverables. As we mentioned when we talked to you about the MediConnect transaction, that acquisition does not impact this initiative, and we have other investments including our next generation platform for catastrophe models, which many of you saw as a part of our Investor Day. And then we have host of new claims tools including mobile tools, which can be used to settle claims via smartphones and tablets, while standing with the customer next to their damaged property, as well as Aerial Sketch, which can be used to calculate the cost of repairing a roof without the timer hazard associated with having to climb onto the roof. We remain focused on data and analytics, and recognize that the way they are consumed is tied to evolving technology. The power of marrying our long history of data with forward looking analytics by our customer friendly technology is unparallel. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Mark to talk about our corporate financial results.
Mark V. Anquillare: Thank you, Scott. As Frank noted, in the first quarter, we delivered 10.7% total revenue growth and 7.7% organic revenue growth. And excluding our historical mortgage business, organic growth for the new quarter was 9%. For the first quarter, our Decision Analytics segments revenue continue to lead with 16.9% revenue growth, of which 9.6% was organic and excludes the 2011 acquisitions of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners, as well as the transferred revenue. I want to remind you that beginning 2012, we have transferred revenue related to mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment’s property-specific revenue category into Decision Analytics’ mortgage revenue category to reflect a management reporting change. The appraisal tools related to insurance customers will remain in the property-specific underwriting category in Risk Assessment. Because the amount is small, $2.9 million of revenue in the quarter, we have not restated historical numbers, but we’ll provide you with an apples-to-apples comparison. As a final note, we closed the MediConnect deal on March 30, so second quarter 2012 will be the first time its revenue and EBITDA will report in our financial results. Within Decision Analytics, our insurance category revenue grew 10.5% in the quarter, all organic. We continue to benefit from the growth in our loss quantification claim tools, with double-digit growth from customers and new solutions. Even after a year of almost 30% growth in 2011, catastrophe modeling solutions continued good growth, due to new customers and expanded use of our models, including out catastrophe bond projects in area in which our market share remains very strong. Our insurance fraud claims solutions also continued good growth in the quarter, driven by 2012 invoices for certain solutions. The revenue in mortgage and financial services grew 4.8% as reported in the first quarter and declined 4.1% after adjusting for the transfer of the mortgage appraisal tools from Risk Assessment into this revenue category. Underwriting tools grew in the quarter ahead of the approximate 5% growth in the origination market. The revenue from forensic solutions declined in the quarter, as new customers and increased usage by existing customers were not sufficient to offset a large customer whose volumes have been trending down in 2011. Our outlook for 2012 from mortgage remains negative, as the current market makes it difficult to predict near term trends for the majority of our solutions, but we have confidence in the long-term value. Healthcare continues strong growth 95% in the first quarter and 32.9% organic. Our total growth continues to benefit from the addition of Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners in 2012 and starting second quarter 2012 will benefit from the addition of MediConnect. Just a reminder for those of you looking at sequential revenue dollars first and second quarters are seasonally lower revenue and margin quarters for our HRP businesses and MediConnect followed a similar seasonal pattern. We are 30 days into our ownership MediConnect and excited about the prospects for the business. Our specialized markets revenue grew 9.4% in the quarter from both our supply chain solutions as well as our weather analytics, both of these areas are delivering solid growth today, and we are optimistic about the opportunities to broaden their reach. Examples included repurposing our weather analytics into the insurance market, and building on our capabilities of 3E in conjunction with both internal and external tools to broaden our supply chain offerings. Turning to risk assessment, we reported revenue of 3.1% in the quarter and 5.2% after adjusting for the impact of the transfer. Our industry-standard programs grew 6.8% in the quarter reflecting our 2012 invoices in good growth from our premium leakage solutions. As you know, we put up new invoices in December, and begin recognizing the new level of the revenue on January 1, and throughout the year. I will note that we had about $1 million of revenue in the quarter related to the license fee which is non-recurring. Our property specific revenue as reported declined 5.6%, but excluding the transfer grew 2.8%, as new sales and higher volumes from certain customers offset (inaudible).  Our 2011 industry premium will not affect our invoices until 2013, as Frank noted, it is nice to see the commercial premiums for 2011 almost 4.4% to the positive versus the decline of 1.6% in 2010. EBITDA for the first quarter was $159.2 million, as outlined in table three of our press release, the increase 14.5% for the quarter and our EBITDA margins was 45.9%, an increase versus the 44.4% in first quarter of 2011, and 45% in fourth quarter of 2011, it’s nice to see the scale in the margins. Please remember, as you model that our invoice increases and risk assessment comes through on January 1. But our annual salary increases come through in April. So annual salary increases will be effective in the second quarter, and the increased corporate expenses by about $3.3 million per quarter beginning in the second quarter. Additionally, we expect incremental cost of about $4.7 million in second quarter related to our April 2012 equity loss, primarily resulting from an accelerated vesting upon obtainment of eligible retirement age by some employees. About 70% or 75% of this option impact will be seen in this assessment. Finally, we do not anticipate much impact in 2012 margins resulting from the MediConnect acquisition, however because of the seasonality of its revenue MediConnect margins in second quarter are lower than the full year margins and we would expect to see an impact when the revenue and EBITDA are first reported in next quarter. In the quarter, our risk assessment margins were 55.1%versus 52.8% in first quarter 2011. We benefited by about 1.4% on the margins due to the lower pension costs, on February 29, we froze our pension plan and in early April funded $73 million, bringing it closer to fully funded which will limit the growth in that expense going forward. Our business continues to show scalable profitability, while we continue to invest in developing new solutions. The margin in Decision Analytics was 39.3% in the first quarter 2012 versus 37.7% in first quarter 2011, and 40.7% in fourth quarter of 2011. Improvement in the underlying margins of several of our businesses including healthcare, as they scaled the revenue benefited us in the quarter partially offset by the adverse impact from the mortgage business. We also capitalized a few more dollars in this quarter, some relating to the technology initiatives that Scott had mentioned. Our interest expense was up $1.6 million versus fourth quarter 2011, as the increased interest expense associated with our bond offering in December was fully reflected in the first quarter. We carried excess cash in most of the quarter from the bond offering and our free cash flow. But use them to fund part the MediConnect transaction bringing our cash balance closer to normal levels at $115 million at quarter end. We ended first quarter with total debt of $1.2 billion, including $125 million drawn for the MediConnect acquisition, and a pro forma debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.9% times. In early April, we drew an additional $75 million for our pension funding leaving us at about our long-term target capital structure of two times debt-to-EBITDA on a pro forma basis. Our reported effective tax rate is 39.4% for the quarter. For 2012, we are expecting rate in line with our historical rate of approximately 40%. Coming down to the net income line, we’re focused on adjusted net income and non-GAAP measure, which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition related amortization expense less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 12.4% to $79.8 million for the quarter, and adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.47, an increase of 17.5%. The average diluted share count was $171.4 million in the quarter, and on March 31, 2012 our diluted share count was $171.9 million shares. In the quarter, we purchased about 900,000 shares for approximately $39 million. At quarter end, we had about $216 million left under our authorization. Our approach to share repurchase remained focused on limiting dilution and only going forward, when we believe we can purchase, we can deliver appropriate IRRs and not crowd out our acquisitions. Our share repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs of over 25%. Turning to the balance sheet; as of March 31, our cash and cash equivalents were about $115 million; total debt, both short-term and long-term totaled just north of $1.2 billion on March 31, reflecting the debt borrowed to fund the MediConnect closing on March 30, and was about $1.3 million after our pension funding in early April. Post MediConnect and pension funding, our debt capacity is about $600 will continue to grow free cash flow. As we have stated before, we are willing to temporarily go above our long-term target of two time debt-to-EBITDA to take advantage of unique opportunities, particularly on the acquisition front. With that debt capacity available, we continue to look for the right opportunities. Free cash flow in first quarter 2012, which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $173.7 million, an increase of $46.8 million or 36.9% first quarter of 2011. Free cash flow grew faster than EBITDA bolstered by the timing of cash interest payments on our bonds to our certain customers paying invoices in first quarter this year, then paid in second quarter last year. Our capital expenditures were 4.6% of revenue, we continue our strong free cash flow conversion of EBITDA, which was 109.1% in first quarter 2012, reflecting the typical first quarter pattern in which a good portion of our customers pay their full year quarterly bill in advance. Overall, our business is performing well. We have a nice mix of growth from multiple verticals and we’re continuing to invest in future. With that, I’ll ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Thank you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Eric Boyer with Wells Fargo.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo, LLC: The Insurance vertical within your Decision Analytics business, I think it was the first quarter since you’ve been public where you didn’t have your quarterly reported growth, can you help us understand the dynamics of going along within that segment, and when you think the year-over-year organic growth rate should reaccelerate in the drivers of that?
Mark V. Anquillare: Yeah, this is Mark. I appreciate the question, couple of things to note, first of all as you think about the verticals, a relative to fourth quarter of 2011 severe storms, and the seasonal weather patterns were pretty harsh in 2011. So there was a lot of storm activity that did help us specifically on the claim side of things. We are kind of now into a normal or lower time of year with regard to the storms and those claims that are associated with severe weather. The other thing that typically happens at year-end or there so, I will call it more of the one-time project type work that typically falls inside of our catastrophe modeling solutions and those projects, which are usually completed for and focused on year-end we’re also helping and historically helped the latter part of the year specifically for the quarter. So those are a couple of dimensions that helps what is fourth quarter. I think we feel good about first quarter, where we were but to answer your specific question, it was a little bit about well over topic.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo, LLC: Okay, great. And then, I think you said you benefited in risk assessment, the revenue growth by $1 million for non-recurring benefit. I didn’t catch what that was from. Could you just drill that again?
Mark V. Anquillare: Sure. Some of the insurance programs are licensed by vendors. So they incorporate our programs in their solutions. Their software solutions, as an example like Policy Admin Solutions and we had in most part fee that was paid in first quarter. That is a normal fees but it’s a non-recurring type of item in the first quarter.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo, LLC: Okay. And then just with the MediConnect, could you help us better understand the ramp there, we’re looking at more like a 30% first half or 70% the back half for revenue and EBITDA?
Mark V. Anquillare: I think that’s a good approximation. It’s a little bit tough to have that level of visibility, but we continue to believe that’s about right.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo, LLC: All right. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore Partners.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.: Thank you. Good morning.
Mark V. Anquillare: Good morning.
Frank J. Coyne: Good morning.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.: Frank, you highlighted a sharp acceleration in direct written premium growth at your P&C customers in 2011 that will impact your own Risk Assessment revenue growth in 2013. Given that acceleration in direct written premium growth how you’re thinking about pricing – how you’re thinking about pricing for 2013 and can you get into the bottom of your long-term organic target range of 10% to 12% with that pickup in direct written premium?
Frank J. Coyne: Well first on the pricing, we look at our pricing every year based on enhanced value that we bring to our customers plus their actual growth for the year that we have in reports that they submit. So it’s too early for me to really applying on what our pricing might be for 2013. But as you saw with our – on the second part of your question, I mean we’re optimistic because we are you know we add that wind at our face now for few years and now it’s turning, so it certainly gives us more flexibility. And on the second part of your question, I’m pleased that extra mortgage we had a 9% organic revenue growth for the quarter and that’s a good sign and I like the assets that we have and I like the potential that we have for organic growth going forward. So, we still hold on to our aspirational targets.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc: We’ll put in other way is there any reason to believe that you wouldn’t have at least CPI type pricing in 2013 in the risk assessment business?
Frank J. Coyne: You know, as I said I really it will be premature for me to talk about pricing, but that’s a reasonable assumption.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.: Okay, thank you very much.
Scott G. Stephenson: All right, you’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Raymond James.
William Warmington – Raymond James: Good morning everyone.
Eva F. Huston: Hi.
Mark V. Anquillare: Hi, good morning.
William Warmington – Raymond James: A couple of questions for the – the first is in 2010 and in 2011, the second quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was the trough for the year and then third and fourth quarter margins were at or above the first quarter margin levels, and would it be reasonable to assume that pattern repeats in 2012?
Scott G. Stephenson: Bill, thank you. Let me just kind of recap a little bit what you’re trying to get to there are two things that affect us in the second quarter. First of all, relative to first, we do have salary increases coming through, those salary increases as I mentioned is about $3.3 million. That's an item that we’ll continue obviously into second, third and fourth, so that’s something kind of model through the year. 
William Warmington – Raymond James: Okay.
Scott G. Stephenson: The vote of on equity awards that were just granted in April because of the nature of accelerated vesting on determined age; that does cause a bit of a one-time item that affects second quarter. So a, the 2012 equity awards are bigger than the 2009, that’s kind of rolling off and these are rolling. So we talked about the 4.7, but a good majority of that 4.7 relates to this accelerated vesting. So that item will affect second quarter and then it will go away for the third and fourth very similar to last year or so.
William Warmington – Raymond James: Okay.
Scott G. Stephenson: To that point those are couple dimensions along the MediConnect that I mentioned that should probably cause a little bit of trough in the second quarter as you noted.
William Warmington – Raymond James: Gotcha, okay and then another question for you would be, you had very impressive growth in the Xactware segment 2011, over 20% and it’s still delivering strong growth against that. And, can you talk a little bit about the new products and new customers in that segment that you’re targeting, and what kind of growth you think you can deliver from the 10% level?
Scott G. Stephenson: Yeah, this is Scott, Bill. There is quite a few things that we’re doing on the Xactware in front of you that rise to the top of the level would be, we’re very excited about the content side of the business. You may know that Xactware historically has been about estimating the value of the structure, but something on the order of 40% of the value overall is in the contents. And the use of automated tools for estimating contents really has not emerged yet fully in the same way that it has on the structural side. And so, we’re very excited about that. Second thing is, the business is finding its way into overseas markets. We sort of have our launching pad into Continental Europe, pretty well established now in the UK and via existing customer relationships, we’re actually reaching over there. And it’s going to be a long march, but we’re encouraged by what we’re seeing. Third thing is, the tools that we use on the insurance side are also useful in the OREO market where the property owner has to keep track of what a cost to maintain a property that’s moved into OREO status. And so, we’ve actually just introduced a line of solutions into that marketplace, and again it’s kind of early days, but we’re encouraged about that. And then, I think you know that the kind of the syncopation inside of the business today is that, our tools are now being used for the adjusting of well over 80% of all residential claims. On the underwriting side, for ITV calculations our share is not that high, but it continues to go up and carriers find it very compelling to think about using the same analytic engine and same dataset for both underwriting the policy on the front end and adjusting the claims on the back end. So we find that the market continues to come to us on that approach. So, a variety of things that are working side of the business, and we do remain optimistic about the growth potential for the business over longer periods of time. There were some exciting things that happened in 2011 that contributed to that 30% plus growth rate, some very large customers coming over into our column. And so, there were something a little bit extraordinary about 2011, but we do remain very optimistic about the business.
William Warmington – Raymond James: Excellent. Thank you for the insight.
Scott G. Stephenson: Welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Mcveigh with Macquarie. 
Kevin Mcveigh – Macquarie Research Equities: Thank you. Wonder, if you give a sense of how much acquisitions impacted the margins in Q1?
Scott G. Stephenson: I will tell you. We have not spent a lot of time on it, because I don’t think it was much of an impact. Remember we’ve always been talking about the acquisitions of [property] in 3E, because they were purchased in December of 2010. So now as we go forward, 1Q '12, 1Q '11, we have an apples-to-apples and the combination of the newer acquisitions, MediConnect and HRP not affect the margins to bigger degree.
Eva F. Huston: Yeah, I think in Decision Analytics, it’s about 60 basis points.
Scott G. Stephenson: Yeah, in just DA.
Kevin Mcveigh – Macquarie Research Equities: Great, thank you. And then, just as kind of the P&C market starts to firm a little bit, does that impact the selling process at all in terms of the type of product, your clients are looking at and just any derivative impact on the business from that?
Frank J. Coyne: Yeah, it does. It frees up opportunities for our customers to look at additional products of ours that they have and interest in, but didn’t have budget for. And the selling cycle shortened somewhat when our customers are growing.
Kevin Mcveigh – Macquarie Research Equities: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Riggs with William Blair.
Robert Riggs – William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. It’s kind of an extension of the last line of question and you’ve highlighted roughly $1 billion opportunity, additional opportunity in the P&C space. What are going to be the key drivers to seizing on that opportunity? Have you made any adjustments in terms of your sales force and in terms of driving that cross selling, and maybe where are you doing? Feel like you’re doing a good job of pursuing that and where is there still some work to be done? Thanks.
Frank J. Coyne: Yeah, thank you. That’s something we spend a lot of time on. One thing I would point to is you may have noticed that last year we reorganized some of our P&C assets. We pulled assets from actually five different operating units to create various underwriting. And part of the purpose of doing that is to present a more unified coherent face to our customers in the underwriting space. If you look at our position in the P&C marketplace overall and you think about the different disciplines that are at work there, we’re very, very strong with respect to rate making and all of the associated process that goes on in front of the regulators. We’re very strong in the claims function; we’re very strong in catastrophe modeling. In the underwriting discipline, where a presence of the relative strength of our competitive position is not as great and so one of the things that we’re emphasizing is just that and so the reorganization, the naming of a talented executive to run that business for us. All of that really reflects our ambition to become bigger, stronger in the underwriting function and it’s early days, but we do think that this new approach is beginning to yield what we’re hoping it would.  Another comment would be that, we’re just very focused on the cross-selling opportunity and so we’ve done what we have done for sometime and have to really make sure that account management is a very strong function for us and basically representing the full range of solutions that we have for our carrier customers. And those are the kinds of things that we do, there is nothing, I mean the reorganization was obviously a point of time thing, but a lot of it is just as long steady approach presenting all of our capabilities to the customer base and being a good partner. 
Robert Riggs – William Blair & Company, L.L.C.: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suzi Stein with Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: Hi. The pro forma financials with MediConnect in spite of the revenue growth in Q1 was about 67%. Is there anything unusual there that would cause it to be so high and should we expect this rate of growth for the rest of the year?
Mark V. Anquillare: So, Suzanne, this is Mark. I appreciate the question. The first quarter, as we said, there is a little bit of seasonality to it. When we talked about seasonality at year-end, year-end also kind of rolls into January. So there is a little bit of positive wind that still flows through. I think that we are still comfortable with the discussion we had. I don’t know if we have any optimism about second quarter or view too much into what we saw in the first quarter. So, hopefully it’s a little bit of a positive, but I would not change anything we described relative to the Mediclaim call where we talked about growth consistent with the past.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then, the organic growth rate in specialized markets have been very volatile, what do you think is a normalized growth rate for that business?
Mark V. Anquillare: Well, let me just describe. Last year, well, we did run into, inside of the specialized was government and budgetary constraints, but that caused a little bit of a downturn towards the end of the year as government kind of shutdown for a piece. The other thing that I will remind you is that we want a very sizable contract. It grows our contract (inaudible) so we had that growing very quickly until we got to a point where we had this growth on that contract. So you saw last year towards the quarter, the fact that the contract did come, of course through the full year. I think what you’re seeing now in first quarter, feels like a reasonable growth rate and I think we’ve (inaudible) and I would call normalized, I think we found some consistency.
Frank J. Coyne: The climate and science part of our business is actually starting to find a little bit more traction in the commercial markets, which should overtime both get bigger as a percentage of the total and be somewhat steadier with respect to the revenue profile.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then, just one final question on the mortgage business. What are you expecting as far as declines for the rest of the year, and how far along is the customer that you singled out, just in terms of winding down the business?
Frank J. Coyne: So let me describe. I think what we said during the year-end call is that we can see the mortgage business declining similar to what we saw in the quarter, which was a 7% decline. We said we could see the negative aspect of the market being to that level throughout the course of '12. And to your point, I mean, what we’re seeing is our business on the front end, just would relate to the underwriting side of things, growing faster (inaudible) build on the customers and that is growing faster than mortgage relation bonds as a whole, but, unfortunately the one customer trending down is more than offsetting some of that good news that we’re seeing on the existing customers. So we think we are well positioned. I think we remain very optimistic for the future because we are improving our position inside the market, but it’s a challenging one at this point.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: So I guess, just to clarify on that customer that’s trending down, are you kind of getting close to the tail end of that or will that continue for the foreseeable future?
Frank J. Coyne: It’s going to continue through third quarter.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: Okay. 
Eva F. Huston: Okay.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Huang with UBS. 
Jennifer Huang – UBS: Thank you. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about the healthcare business, the growth was obviously very strong there. I was just wondering, how much of that do you think, maybe attributable to your efforts to integrate the healthcare platforms into just one? And then, maybe as a follow-up, I think you guys have mentioned investments in the integration process of about $10 million over the course of two years. Maybe you can quantify how much of that you saw in the first quarter or how much of that impacted the EBTIDA margins?
Scott G. Stephenson : Yeah, let me take the first part of that, this is Scott, as it relates to healthcare. We are working hard on integration. I just would like everybody to understand that there are actually two different forms of integrations that are now working inside of what we’re doing in healthcare. The first is that we’re trying to unify the data analytic platform, off of which the individual solutions are built. And that has to do with coming up with normalized data models and creating a data warehouse structure that can serve all of the different aspects of what we do, whether it’s trying to add value to claims or it’s trying to engage in risk adjusting, et cetera. So that’s one thing which is ongoing. I mentioned earlier that that’s a project, which continues through 2013 and that will hopefully and should and we plan for it to work to the benefit of all of the different sets of solutions that we provide into the marketplace. There is the second integration, which we’re now undertaking, which is related to the MediConnect acquisition and basically there is, and we are going to feature in a way that we operate, a strong linkage between three things that we do. One is chart retrieval and abstraction, which is what MediConnect does, HEDIS reporting, which we already do, and risk adjusting on behalf of plans that are seeking Medicare reimbursements. Those three businesses actually have a lot of, logically relate strongly one to the other. And so, we are at work even now to try to pull those operationally together so that we can present yet more integrated and streamline solutions to our customers. I guess what I want to emphasis with respect to result is that we are just in the process of integrating right now. So I would not really attribute anything in our first quarter 2012 healthcare results to the integration work that we’re doing.  On your second question, which is the investing we’re doing to achieve these new platforms. There’s actually two major streams of investment, which are going on. One is the unified platform in healthcare, and the other is the next generation platform supporting our catastrophe models, and that’s the number that you’ve heard us reference before. It’s not all just been healthcare.
Jennifer Huang – UBS: Okay, great. Thanks.
Scott G. Stephenson: You’re welcome. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman with SIG.
James Friedman – Susquehanna International Group: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mark, the cash flow from operations was up almost or above 30% year-over-year. It seem like some of that was related to a reduction in working capital. I was wondering how sustainable that is? 
Mark V. Anquillare : Sure, well, thanks for the question. We did have very good first quarter, so two things or a few things that factored into it. First of all, let me remind you, in first quarter of last year, we talked about a refresh of our technology environment here in New Jersey City and that was a little bit about periodic thing. So we have a drop in CapEx in first quarter 2012 relative to 2011, so that helped us. The other things that, we highlight or want to highlight is that the semi-annual aspect of bond interest did not run through the P&L in the first quarter, so that helped us sort of on catch up in second quarter, so that’s about I think about $6 million. And the rest of it, I will call out maybe about $7 million, $8 million where we can point to customers who seem to be paying in first quarter of this year and paid may be in second quarter last year.  So when I normalize all that, I think we’re still seeing free cash flow growth about 20% which is very strong, very positive, since we have everyone in the call, I do want to remind you that second quarter we did make this $72 million funding of the pension for that $72 million will have to just normalize next quarter that will be considered in operating cash flow and reduce it, but the underlying trend in underlying seems quite positive and we’re pleased with the first quarter results there.
James Friedman – Susquehanna International Group: Okay, thank you and then Scott just for a clarification attribution perspective, the HEDIS reporting, the charting and the risk adjustment solutions that you described earlier, how were those going to be categorized between analytics and assessment? 
Scott G. Stephenson: Well, we’re going to have to look at that, I think that – structure needs to follow function and I don’t know that we’ve actually sorted that out, I mean the HEDIS is inside of enterprise analytics today, this is our own structure and then the other piece the Medicare is revenue integrity but will, we’re working first on the organizational integration of those so we will see. 
James Friedman – Susquehanna International Group: Okay, thanks for taking my question.
Scott G. Stephenson: Welcome
Operator: And there are no further questions at this time.
Eva F. Huston: Great.
Frank J. Coyne: All right. Well, thank you for joining us on our first quarter results, and we look forward to speaking with you again and we continue to thank you for your support.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is [Kaneesha], and I’ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to the Verisk Analytics’ Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Ms. Eva Huston, you may begin your conference.
Eva Huston: Thank you Kaneesha, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following some comments by Frank, Scott and Mark, highlighting the key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investor section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be posted on our website and available by dial-in for 30 days until March 29, 2012. And finally, as set forth in more detail in today’s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today’s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk’s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. And information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of the press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Frank Coyne.
Frank Coyne: Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In the fourth quarter 2011, we delivered strong performance of almost 20% revenue growth and over 25% diluted adjusted EPS growth. Our performance for the fiscal year was also strong with 17% revenue growth and 25% diluted adjusted EPS growth. These results are evidence of our discipline in execution. We are pleased that the market has recognized this through the strong performance of our stock price in 2011. We performed well in many of our businesses and our recent acquisitions also contributed. Risk assessments grew 3.9% for the quarter and the full-year, as our continued value to customers is reflected in our revenue growth. We also saw improvement in property specific revenue growth in the quarter. In the quarter Decision Analytics revenue grew almost 35% and our insurance solutions in Decision Analytics grew almost 15% organically. For the full-year Decision Analytics grew almost 30% with similar growth from our insurance solution. Our healthcare solutions revenue grew almost about 37% organically in the quarter as we continued on the double-digit growth trajectory we started to see in the third quarter. Overall, our organic revenue growth was 7.6% in the quarter and for the full-year. Decision Analytics organic growth in Q4 was 11%, driven by both strong growth from insurance-facing solutions as well as the accelerated growth in healthcare. The mortgage market remained challenging with the macroeconomic conditions continuing to work against us. We continue to have conviction around our margin and overall profitability. We are pleased to deliver 25% growth in diluted adjusted EPS for 2011 and over 16% growth in EBITDA, while expanding margins to over 46% excluding the recent acquisitions. As always, we remained focused on delivering shareholder returns. We remained determined to find attractive M&A opportunities to take advantage of our substantial balance sheet flexibility. We bought $41 million of shares in the quarter, a lower amount than in previous quarters as we managed our buyback as part of our broader capital allocation plan including acquisitions. We remained interested in using our capital as appropriate for buybacks is evidenced by our $300 million new authorization announced in January 2012. As I look forward to 2012, I see a consistency in our business plan, but also new opportunities on the horizon. I have confidence, we can continue to execute on that plan and realize attractive growth from the insurance base. We have set our healthcare business on a positive path to continue to grow and expand its footprint. I also think 2012 will bring more opportunity in our supply chain business as we work to leave our solutions in analytics together and also continued to pursue acquisitions in the space. Mortgage is likely to remain a soft spot for 2012, but we are also ensuring that we use our skill sets in ways that meet the evolving needs of the mortgage market as well as across the broader financial services sector. Now I’ll turn it over to Scott to talk about the progress we are making in a number of our business areas.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, Frank. I talked about innovation and it remains a key focus of our execution plan. Innovation means a lot of things to a lot of people, but to us it is about both staying ahead of the market as well as meeting your customers where they want you to be. We continue to invest in new products and we’re committed to this as a constant insight of our plan. While our margins continue to expand and we must also ensure that margin expansion does not come at the expense of future growth. One great example is the investment we’re making in our unified healthcare technology platform which will be a 2012 and into 2013 project and we will provide simplified workflow for our customers. We’re leveraging the platform we acquired in the Bloodhound acquisition and are consolidating our fraud and abuse analytics and creating a data submission standard that will power both the front-end underwriting and back-end fraud solutions, thereby improving our customers ease of use and facilitating our ability to cross-sell. We're working to move closer to clinical data; it will be very useful inside of our overall analytic approach. Another example of investment is our next generation platform and the expanded parallels for our catastrophe models which will help our customers use our tools in broader ways than in the past including in making underwriting decisions. We're investing over $10 million between these two projects, both of these projects are a result of us seeing our customers needs and pinpoints and working to make our solutions not just the best analytical tools, but also the ones that are easiest to use. Another focal point for us is integration, which is quite important as we grow. The unified healthcare platform I discussed is an example of how we're quickly moving to bring our recently acquired HRP and Bloodhound assets together with the rest of Verisk health. And the creation of our underwriting solutions group also shows our ability to successfully pull together relevant parts of our organization. The underwriting team has brought together a number of our underwriting tools with a particular emphasis at this point on personal lines to provide a more holistic view of our customers underwriting process and create efficiencies. The formation of this group which was announced in January will not change any of the financial reporting structures you see, but our team will be rewarded for their success. We expect that continuing to evolve our business organization as needed, will further align our customer success with our own. For those of you who are going to attend or listen to our Investor Day on March 8, you will hear more about these projects and initiatives as well as hearing directly from our business unit leaders whose passion and creativity and discipline are what will drive our company forward. These are the people who are looking to expand and re-imagine our position in the market to enlarge our growth opportunity and I hope you have the opportunity to spend time with them. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Mark, to talk about our corporate financial results.
Mark Anquillare: Thank your, Scott. As Frank noted in the fourth quarter we delivered 19.9% revenue growth and 7.6% organic revenue growth. And for fiscal 2011, we delivered 17% revenue growth also with 7.6% organic revenue growth. For the fourth quarter and fiscal year our Decision Analytic segment revenue continued to lead with 34% and 28.9% growth respectively. The Decision Analytics revenue growth organically, which was 11% in the quarter and for the fiscal year excludes the acquisitions of Crowe Paradis, 3E, Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners. For 2011, we've converted our Decision Analytics revenue categories to those we previewed with you in the supplemental revenue data provided in the third quarter. We've received positive feedback from the market on the transparency of this financial data. Going forward we’ll use the vertical categories to report within Decision Analytics. We've not changed any of our historic financial results and our segment reporting remains the same. Last quarter we provided historical information in these same categories back to 2008 full-year reference. As a reminder, we’ve grouped revenues by the primary end-market of the various parts of our businesses. In insurance, key solutions include insurance fraud solutions, including claim search, our catastrophe modeling solutions from ARR worldwide, and our insurance loss quantification solutions from Xactware. This grouping is the same as we’ve referenced in the past as insurance-facing solutions and Decisions Analytics. In mortgage and financial services, we include our Interthinx underwriting and forensic audit tools facing the mortgage market as well as our strategic analytics businesses which also serve other consumer finance markets. Starting in first quarter of 2012, we’re also including our ACI, property appraisal tools facing the mortgage market in the mortgage and financial services category to reflect a management reporting change that split the mortgage appraisal tools from the appraisal tools used in the insurance space. These mortgage appraisal tools represent about $11 million in revenue 2011 with lower margins in the remainder of risk assessment. These financial contributions which were previously reported is part of property’s specific revenue grouping in risk assessment. Healthcare includes all of the Verisk’s health tools including DxCG, [Suremed], D2Hawkeye, HDI, Bloodhound and Heath Risk Partners, and specialized markets includes our Climate Risk Analytics provided by our AER business as well as the 3E component of our supply chain risk management solutions. Within Decision Analytics our insurance category grew 19.5% in the fourth quarter and 14.6% organically. For the fiscal year, revenue from the insurance category grew 21% and 14.6% organically. We continue to benefit from the growth in our claims tools as well as the cumulative effects of higher claims volumes due to 2011 weather events, which drive additional transactional revenue when customers exceed the maximum contracted claims volume totals. We also had some benefit from custom work for large customer, and continue to see growth in underwriting tools and newer solutions, such as content type information within loss quantification. We’re generating revenue from our international expansion. We plan to grow its contribution over time, to help procure model transition to our new categories inside Decision Analytics. Our revenue formally reported its loss quantification grew 27% in the quarter. We’ll not be reporting this separately going forward. In the quarter, catastrophe modeling solutions continued double-digit growth due to new and expanded customer relationships from our core catastrophe model products. When we observed the market share over the past year, we’ve increased for both the commercial and personal lines primary carriers, evidence of the cross-sell success. We also had a good quarter for both our core catastrophe models for investors as well as for catastrophe bond projects in area, which our market shares are over 85% in 2011. Our insurance fraud claims also continued good revenue growth. The revenue in mortgage and financial services declined 7.2% in fourth quarter, and declined 1.9% for fiscal year 2011, reflecting a weak macro-environment originations and the downward trend in the number of loans that are delinquent, defaulted, or in foreclosure. Based on those trends, revenue from both underwriting and forensic solutions declined in the quarter and in the fiscal year as new customers and increased usage by existing customers was not sufficient to offset the double-digit decline in origination versus 2010. On the forensic audit side, revenue continue to decline as new customers were not enough to offset the lower volumes of large customer, we’ve previously discussed. Our outlook for 2012 from mortgage remains negative, as the current market makes it difficult to predict trends for the majority of our products. It is possible the trends seen in the fourth quarter on revenue continue throughout 2012. However, we remain focused on building our skill-sets for opening solutions such as contract underwriting and other tools to respond to current and long-term trends in the market. Healthcare continues to prove out the opportunity we’ve spoken about, with total growth of 170.2% for the quarter, and 37.3% organic. This shows nice progress building on over 25% organic growth in third quarter of 2011. Our total growth continues to benefit from the additions of Bloodhound and HRP in 2011. Our organic growth is also benefiting from our consolidated approach to selling our tools. We deliver about 20% of organic growth for all of 2011. Our HRP revenue is weighted about 70% to the third and fourth quarters as the season from Medicare Advantage reviews kicks in that. So, I’d expect that the portion of healthcare revenue would be at lower levels in first and second quarter than in fourth quarter, but at a high-level than the related period in 2010 prior to the acquisition. Our specialized markets revenue grew 134% in fourth quarter, and 181.3% for the fiscal year 2011. Total revenue growth included the acquisition of 3E in December of 2010. Organic revenue growth declined 1.6% in the fourth quarter as a result of government contracts for weathering analytics that began in 2010 as it reached its full quarterly value as well as governmental budgetary delays in 2011. Organic revenue in this category grew 12.4% for the fiscal year 2011. We continue to look for ways to repurpose our weather analytics into the insurance and supply chain markets, and we’re excited about the ability to continue to build on our capabilities of 3E to broaden our supply chain offerings. Turning to risk assessment, we grew revenue at 3.9% in the quarter and for the fiscal year 2011. Our industry standard programs grew 4.9% in the quarter, a continued reflection of the value-based price increases in January 2011 in the moderation of premium declines at our customers as well as new customers in 2011. Our premium linkage solutions also continued to add growth. Our property specific information revenues return to modest growth of 0.5% in the quarter as lower transaction volumes with certain customers were offset by increased use of property appraisal tools. About 85% of our revenue in risk assessment is based on subscriptions and long-term contracts, with 99% renewal rates recurring in fairly predictable revenue for a vast majority of the segment. As we think towards 2012, we expect to see the benefit in risk assessment due to our new invoices, although premium growth remains negative in 2010. And we try hard to be sensitive to our customers as well as to position ourselves for cross-sell opportunities. Overall, we’re comfortable with our enterprise performed even in the face of specific market issues from the mortgage business. Excluding the mortgage business, organic growth was 9.6% in the quarter and over 9% for the full-year. EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $158.4 million and $592 million for the full-year as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 20.5% for the quarter, and our EBITDA margin was 45%. Our consolidated EBITDA margin increased in the fourth quarter, compared to 44.4% in the third quarter of 2011. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, EBITDA margin was 46.6% in the quarter, and also excluding the benefit of the reduction in earn-out provision 45.8% for the fiscal year 2011. In the quarter our risk assessment margins were 51.4% versus 51.3% in the fourth quarter of 2010, and 50.5 in the third quarter of ’11. Our business continues to show scaled profitability while we continue to invest in developing new solutions. The margin in Decision Analytics was 40.7% in fourth quarter versus 40.1% in third quarter of 2011. Improving the underlying margins of several of our businesses as well as a mix shift to higher margin solutions benefited us in the quarter partially offset by the impact from the mortgage business. Our interest expense was flat in third quarter – flat with third quarter of 2011 as the increased interest associated with the bond offering December was reflected in only part of the period, and was offset by decreased borrowings under our credit facility as a result of the refinancing we completed in early 4Q. Our $250 million bond was our second public bond issuance and was closed on December 8th with a 4.875% coupon and maturity of January 2019. With the bond proceeds we repaid the entire outstandings leaving $725 million available on our revolver. We continue to be opportunistic in the debt markets, and in 2011 created valuable committed debt capacity and public market access that can be used as a part of our strategic acquisition program. We ended fourth quarter with total debt of $1.1 billion and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.87 times, leaving us a bit below our target capital structure of two times. Our run rate interest expense for 2012 based upon our debt outstanding trend, all of which was fixed rate is approximately $65 million. Our reported effective tax rate was 35.5 for the quarter down due to favorable audit settlements and resolutions, the continued execution of our tax planning strategies and the benefits associated with R&D legislation. For the full-year our reported effective tax rate was 38.6%. For 2012, we are expecting rate inline with our historical rate of approximately 40%. Coming down to the net income line, we focused on adjusted net income and non-GAAP measure which we defined in the current period as net income plus acquisition related amortization expense, less income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 22.2% to $85.5 million for the quarter and grew 16.3% to $303.6 million for fiscal 2011. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.50 for fourth quarter 2011, an increase of 28.2%. The average diluted share count was a 170.5 million in the quarter and on December 31, 2011 our diluted share count was 170.9 million shares. In the quarter we repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $41 million. At quarter end, we had about 7 million left under our authorization. In January we announced additional 300 million to be added to that. In fiscal 2011 we repurchased 11.3 million shares for a total purchase price of 381 million. Our approach to share repurchases remained focused on limiting dilution and only going beyond that we believe the purchase will deliver appropriate economic returns and not prior to acquisitions. Our share repurchase program is successful to-date generating annualized IRRs of over 20%. Turning to our balance sheet as of December 31st, our cash and cash equivalence were $192 million, reflecting the remaining proceeds from a bond offering in December that were not used to pay the bank debt. Total debt both short-term and long-term totaled just north of 1.1 billion at December 31st, up slightly from third quarter 2011 as we funded share buybacks largely with cash on hand and cash from operations. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 1.87 times at year-end, well within our covenant. Our debt capacity is about $675 million and will continue to grow as our free cash flow generation and as we had EBITDA of acquired companies. We intend to use somewhere between $70 million to $90 million of our cash on hand in the first half of 2012 to fund our pension plan above the required funding levels to bring it closer to a full funded status. Free cash flow in 2011, which we defined as cash from operations, less capital expenditures was $307.3 million, an increase of $12.3 million versus 2010. Free cash flow increased 4.2% in 2011 and the 11.8% increase in cash from operations partially offset by increased capital expenditures which totaled about $68.4 million for the year including capital expenditures related to our acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were 5.1% of revenue as a result of the investment period and a periodic upgrade to our computing environment as well as continued investment in the business. We continued our strong free cash flow conversion of EBITDA which was 52% in 2011. In our 10-K we stated that we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $75 million in 2012. Overall, we had a good year with strong growth in both revenue and earnings reflecting both our discipline and execution on strategy. With that, I’ll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator:
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc: Can you quantify the price increase that you invoice to your customers in the risk assessment business in January of this year?
Mark Anquillare: Well, I don’t think we typically provided that level of detail. But I think what we -- we have always said that we want to try to put in place some type of inflationary type of increases. We think that’s reflective of the value that we add. And in the center premiums which are a component of that invoice start to harden up, which remember our 2012 invoices are really reflective of 2010 premiums is still a difficult time for our customers that will add and certainly provide a little bit of a tailwind in the future, but that will be more into 2013 than ’12.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc: Do you have a specific expectation for the record premium growth for 2011 as a whole and 2012 based on the trends you see with your customers?
Frank Coyne: Well, we don’t have a specific number expectation. All the signals and information indicate that the soft market has bottomed out and we’re going to have a gradual increase in premiums going forward.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc: And then can you be a little bit more granular about the underlying drivers of the accelerating growth within the healthcare vertical and to what extend would these be sustainable in 2012?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah, there is a lot of different things that contribute, some of the things that would sort of rise to the top would be we have had a lot of success in selling new business and I suppose the acquisition of new customers as well as the penetration of newer parts of our portfolio into existing customers. So the cross-sell themes that we talk about a lot is that work in the healthcare business as well as in insurance. And then in addition to that we have actually streamlined some of our processes which have permitted us to actually accelerate the rate at which we implement. Some of what we do in healthcare is transactionally priced. And so getting the implementations ramping faster is – has benefited the revenue. There is no reason why our process will change, so I think that the efficiency of our implementations will stay high and we still think we have a very large cross-sell opportunity in front of us in healthcare.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc: Scott, you highlighted 10 million of incremental investment for 2012. Can you give us a little bit more insight into potential operating leverage for 2012?
Scott Stephenson: Well, we continue to do the things that basically have gotten our margins to the point that they are at right now. So the first thing is just to run the business with a great deal of discipline. I’d say on top of that a very powerful and a very long-term trend inside of our business is just the -- the way in which cost related to computing storage and network are always moving in the right direction. And so we are always looking for opportunities to change our internal environment as it relates to automation and we are going to continue to do that. So it’s – I don’t think there are new themes there. We are just going to continue to press them into our business.
David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc: Just a final question if I might, for Mark. Could you talk about capital allocation priorities for 2012? You have highlighted a 307 million left in your share repurchase authorization. I mean how do you compare value of your current stock versus acquisition and your pipeline?
Mark Anquillare: Well, first of all -- I think we try to highlight that. We did go to a larger authorization in January that does not change our approach in anyway. We remain committed to investing our business first and foremost, that is with other -- in total investment which typically takes the form of expense inside our P&L. But acquisition would -- will be at top of that list. We have committed to buying back shares to limit dilution, and to the extent that we have the ability to buy more, it’s probably because we are trying to for the most part balance between acquisition and buybacks. Our continued commitment is to make sure we deploy that in a disciplined way. And I think we’ve been successful in trying to make sure we think about it in the right economic way before we deploy capital.
Operator: Question comes from Eric Boyer from Wells Fargo Securities.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Margin question again. How should we think about the margin moving forward, the pace of acquisition slowed in the back half of 2011 and you exited the end of the year at the top end of that longer term guidance range. I guess the question is will you manage the margins moving forward if the pace of acquisitions are slower or reinvest to keep the margins in that longer term rage or could we see the margin moving up above on an annual basis?
Mark Anquillare: Let me start with that. I think the first answer to your question is we are thinking about the long-term. So we are going to make the right investment if we think we are going to be able to generate cash for our shareholders and grow the business in long-term. That’s our foremost. So, managing margin is not something we think about day to day. We think about trying to find the right investment and deploying capital the most effective way possible. So that’s a broad perspective. More specifically we do think there is natural operating leverage inside the business, we would imagine that should scale and remain – continue to scale offset by some investment. The other thing is a little bit of product mix shift. Obviously, the risk assessment business and some of the insurance-facing solutions have some nice margins as healthcare grows there’s a product shift there or about product mix shift there. We have good margins in healthcare, not as high as some of the healthcare – some of the insurance-facing, and then clearly offsetting some of the margin expectations in the future is, what's going to happen with mortgage and those are a couple of the variables that we think about as we continue to hope to drive growth and cash flow into the future.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Along the same lines, you talked about the acquisitions that you did in 2010, and ’11 having an impact of 160 basis points. Now where are you in the progression of improving those margins for those acquisitions and how should we think about that impact in 2012?
Mark Anquillare: So, let me give you, maybe at a high-level some of the numbers and maybe Scott, to talk integration. So I think that’s a great theme. First of all, what we tried to highlight is because of the size of both 3E and in Crowe Paradis back in December, we knew that it was going to hurt us to the tune about 1.8%, just because they were very profitable or just the margins were not as high as. We continue to believe and we’ve seen natural scale and operating leverage in each of those businesses. So as you now look forward, I think we are on kind of a run rate that we don’t have to worry about any adjustments and each of those business in and of themselves do have natural scale to them. Scott, maybe …?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah that’s – on top of that, there’s two themes with respect to integration. The near-term one is the less powerful one as it relates to near-term margins, but there is an effect there and that is, we consolidated account management functions and selling across the different parts of Verisk Health, so we do get a little bit of efficiency there. Much more importantly, we’re more coherent in front of the customers, and that’s the primary reason we did it. The longer-term drive to efficiency post-acquisition has to do with the creation of this unified platform that I mentioned earlier which will allow us to essentially have one definition of data regardless of which of our solution sets we’re talking about, and so the creation of our data assets, the warehousing of the data, and the use of the data inside of the analytic engines, all of that will respond positively and become more efficient as we get that put in place. And I think I mentioned earlier that, the creation of the unified platform is a 2012-2013 initiative.
Frank Coyne: It is often the case when we do these acquisitions that we see opportunities to invest in these companies once we own them for them to realize their full potential. So it could take a while depending on the particular acquisitions to start achieving the scale that we see in the acquisition when we buy it.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: And then just finally on cash flow conversion, the year was below your usual range, you did some technology upgrade in the CapEx related acquisitions, you talked about continued investment. Where do you expect that range to be for 2012?
Mark Anquillare: Let me just give a little bit of a clarification, and I agree to your point, the first is that, from an operating cash flow perspective we delivered about 12% or less than 12% from an operating cash flow. Remember the pension works against us. We've been funding the pension, and that increase probably hurt us and in fact that out would be a little less than 14%. So going forward, I don’t think we've anything that would preclude us from thinking differently about kind of that operating cash flow. I think what has happened, we gave you some guidance as to what we think CapEx would be in 2012, which was $75 million that in our K. Other point I want to make, as you think about all this, we’ve talked about funding some of the or I guess accelerate funding, some of the liabilities inside the pension to the extent that we did that, it would be kind of a one time hit to operating cash flow the way it works, but then that would be behind us. We think it’s a thoughtful and good investment. So that is the one exception there or one item I want to just call out for 2012.
Eric Boyer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next question comes from Bill Warmington from Raymond James.
William Warmington - Raymond James: Good morning and congratulations on a strong quarter.
Frank Coyne: Well, thank you.
William Warmington - Raymond James: It seems that insurance companies are becoming increasingly concerned about renewals and their property insurance books, because the market value is below replacement value for some of the properties and the velocity that new sales is down so much. I want to ask, how that – what opportunity that presents for you guys?
Frank Coyne: Well, one of the opportunities it presents is that, our 360 value tool, you the concern is getting insurance to value and which is totally different than market value.
William Warmington - Raymond James: Right.
Frank Coyne: So, the use of our 360 value tool is very important and useful to these companies as they’re trying to distinguish between those two issues and make sure that they’re getting the proper, what’s called coverage A amount. So we think it just opens up an opportunity for us to, well further penetrating in that area.
William Warmington - Raymond James: Okay. And Mark, you mentioned the guidance on the $75 million for CapEx for 2012. I just wanted to ask what you -- when you look at that as a percentage of revenue, what parameters you’re thinking of? It’s been moving up, and I wanted to know if that’s a short-term phenomenon or whether that’s going to be kind of the level, about 5% of revenue going forward?
Mark Anquillare: Well, I think what we have seen is in 2011 we did do some periodic upgrades to our computing platform both here and in Salt Lake City area. So those are two items I’d guess primarily because of the volume and the growth and exact where that’s probably ongoing, the Jersey City was periodic which is kind of a one-time. Other point I'll make is, Scott, talked about the unified platform and some of the things we’re doing to kind of bring these things together, and to bring those things together it does cost us some money. So I think 2011 was for the most part, a little higher than the norm, and $75 million I think is kind of more inline with, just kind of moderate growth. So I hope that’s clear enough, but I’m just not going to comment on this.
William Warmington - Raymond James: All right. One more question for you is, I just wanted to ask how the M&A pipeline was looking. You guys had been sort of quiet in that front.
Frank Coyne: Quiet on -- perhaps quiet on finalizing, but not …
William Warmington - Raymond James: On public – exactly, your public announcements, right?
Frank Coyne: Yeah, not quiet on our activity and evaluation of opportunities and it’s -- it’s an ongoing process.
William Warmington - Raymond James: Okay, excellent. Thank you very much.
Frank Coyne: Yes, sir.
Operator: Next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust.
Andrew Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc: Hi, good morning. Nice quarter guys. Healthcare within DA was clearly a bright spot in the second-half of the year, and it seems like you reached a tipping point either in the delivery of your products, introduction of products, customer uptake, maybe some combination there of. Can you just talk about sort of the steepness of the curve as we go into to ’12 recognizing as you said, Mark that it’s kind of going to be more back-half weighted. I mean, did we see sort of the kink in the curve in the second-half of ’12 and we’re at a sustained or ’11, we’re at a sustainable level or does that trajectory or the slope of that curve remain pretty steep as we go into ’12?
Mark Anquillare: Let me open it, and maybe, I’ll let Scott flip. Let’s focus separate from the acquisition, just focus on the organic growth. I think …
Andrew Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc: Right, that’s what I’m referring to in particular.
Mark Anquillare: .. we’ve been talking about the fact that we were signing contracts and that was about implementation. We saw 25% organic growth in 2Q. We saw 30% organic growth in 4Q. So it has been the implementation and sales that had been realized. Now I would not keep that curve growing like you would, but I think it is sustainable and its good news. This is just kind of an opening.
Scott Stephenson: Right. I mean, rate of customer adoption is something that we live and die with every day and our customers are sophisticated and they go through long evaluations of our solutions, but – sort of the context here is that, if we were to fully penetrate our – and we’ll talk about this more in Investor Day. We were to fully penetrate our existing customer base with all of the solutions that we got in the healthcare universe, is that represents multiples of our current run rate revenue. So it’s really on us to present our solutions and help the customers, find a value and then be efficient in getting them implemented. But in general, we’re still essentially in the same position we were later half of 2011, in terms of the amount of opportunity we’ve got relative to the book of business we currently got.
Mark Anquillare: And just to cap that point, the fact that and we do add any acquisitions, the HRT nature of the business is all that were back-end loaded, we talked about 70% of that revenue being moved towards third and fourth quarters as opposed to first and second. So that’s the next layer of healthcare modeling they need to do, so I just want to make sure we’re clear there.
Andrew Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc: Right, right. Now that’s helpful. And then with regard to the insurance solutions cross-sell where you’re clearly also enjoying success. Was there, -- should we think about an acceleration in momentum in the back-half or is that, and something that can carry on into ’12 or is that more of just steady grind-out the cross-sell and sustain above average or above company average organic revenue growth in DA as a consequence. I am just wondering if we reach a similar kind of tipping point insurance or if that’s less -- looks less like healthcare?
Frank Coyne: I don’t think we see it as a tipping point. There are good things happening inside of the business. We referenced earlier that the catastrophe modeling category has been performing strongly for us. In our view that’s basically the market responding to the depth and quality of the science that we've been bringing to this marketplace forever basically. We've always felt that our science was distinctive. We seem to have come to a moment in the marketplace where the customers are even more aware of that and maybe more waiting their buying decisions according to that. And then we have referenced, we continue to reference the fact that some of what we do in the DA side of insurance is related to climate conditions, and 2011 was pretty robust in terms of not mega catastrophes, but a lot of storm activity that just raised the demand for some of the estimating that – as [estimatics] that we provide. So, there were some factors that work in 2011 that we see as much more sort of we’re building strength for the long time and we think that the strength is being recognized, but to call it a tipping point, I think with over – sort of overstate what happened in the latter half of 2011.
Andrew Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc: Okay, let’s not hope for too many mega catastrophes, right?
Frank J. Coyne: Yeah.
Andrew Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc: And then one last one if I might, again, just to drill down and make sure I understand, in the DA margin you’ve three quarters in a row north of 40%, are the investments you’re making in ’12, will they be expensed, should we think about that 40% level is maybe the right long-term margin, but in the short-term look for it to potentially come down a little bit?
Mark Anquillare: So, let me take that for you, so two things. First of all, our investments primarily kind of focused on Decision Analytics is in people. Some times it kind of gets into hardware and software for the most its people. A majority of that people cost is expensed inside of our P&L. So, there is a piece of that that you’re already seeing in the margins, and as we continue to ramp that investment, yeah, that will kind of have an offset. The other part of that is in CapEx, okay? So as you think about CapEx, you’re seeing that number go up, that’s capitalized in terms of software. So I think in most of our businesses, you’re going to see kind of a consistency to the margins offset by what is happening in mortgage and probably some margin erosion there.
Andrew Jeffrey – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc: Okay, that’s helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Next question comes from Michael Meltz from JPMorgan.
Michael Meltz – JPMorgan: Yeah, thank you. Three questions, Mark, just – can you just tell us simply margin was 44.4% in ’11, do you expect it flat, up or down in ’12, please? And then I’ve two follow-ups.
Mark Anquillare: I think we feel that we’re going to continue to drive strong margins. I think we feel that we’re going to continue to drive earnings as we’ve faster than top-line growth and all of that factors into how much investment and what kind of acquisition happens. So, our people feel comfortable at where we’re. I feel we’ve demonstrated somewhat nice operating leverage and margin improvement over time. And I think we’re on path to continue to execute.
Michael Meltz – JPMorgan: And then you grew, organic growth was 7.6% in the second half and for the full-year, as you look to ’12, given all the moving pieces, where are you – how should we think about organic growth relative to that rate? I know there is only a tail of the acquisition; potentially all are mostly organic anyway.
Mark Anquillare: Well, as I say, we don’t typically give a lot of specificity. I think we feel good with our business. I think -- we think we’re feeling good about the margin we’ve seen -- the organic growth that we delivered over the course of the 2011, I think there is some strength there offset by some unknowns with regard to mortgage. And that’s the one thing that probably is a little bit more difficult to predict.
Michael Meltz – JPMorgan: And then on mortgage, are you at a point where mortgage – or when do you get to a point where mortgage is evaluated as a divestiture candidate?
Scott Stephenson: Well, our first priority is to take the fine assets that we’ve got and try to make some as market-ready and valuable to our customers as we possibly can. And that’s the focal point.
Frank Coyne: Yeah, Michael, as we observed in some of our remarks, we’re and have been working to maximize the capabilities we’ve within mortgage, not just for our mortgage customers, but for a broader sect section of the financial services industry. So we think we’ve got valuable assets there that have potential.
Michael Meltz – JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you for your time.
Frank Coyne: Yes, sir.
Operator: Next question comes from Suzy Stein from Morgan Stanley.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Hi. In the specialized markets business, you noted that government budget delay is affected Q4. Should we expect that to reverse in Q1 or are the delays continuing?
Mark Anquillare: Suzy, this is Mark. The budgetary delays I think have been generally worked out. It was kind of more of a – towards the end of second quarter into third and a little bit into October. So I think we’ve worked through those now.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Okay. And I know the risk assessment business is sensitive to the P&C cycle, but how sensitive is the insurance piece of Decision Analytics, would you expect a substantial pickup in new business as the cycle improves?
Scott Stephenson: It’s not as sensitive. The general climate of the industry certainly sort of conditions customers to – and their willingness to make investments in new solutions, but if there is not the same direct link as that there is end of the pricing mechanism, that’s a part of risk assessment.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: And then, can you just address your plans for hiring in 2012?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah, kind of steady as it goes, I mean basically inline with the growth that we see in the business. I mean we’re pursuing the same business model, which is a highly leveraged approach where we’re creating industry standard solutions and selling them hopefully many, many times. So, we’re extremely alert to how much we’re adding to our team and the places where there will be growth -- will essentially be inline with where the growth in the revenue is going to occur. But I mean there is nothing fundamentally changing inside of our business model.
Suzanne Stein - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Flynn from Credit Suisse.
Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse Group: Thanks for taking my question. I just have a couple, so, I’m just trying to figure out how optimistic we should be that risk assessment growth will accelerate in fiscal ’12 due to the improvements in P&C premiums? I recognize that your pricing changes depending upon what goes on with premiums. So, if industry standard did 4.9% growth, which is pretty decent this quarter. So in what type of growth can the subscription portion of risk assessment put up in fiscal ’12 as it benefits from P&C premiums improving?
Mark Anquillare: Kelly, let me first just make sure, I remind everybody of the timing. I think what we started to see towards the end of 2010, but really in 2011, that’s were some hardening of the market happens. So some prices started to increase and hopefully the premium had an increase in ’11. Those ’11 changes won’t affect us until 2013. It’s basically a bit of a two-year lag. So in 2010, industry premium was still negative, better than, but still negative. So I think what we’ve always tried to do is, is try to keep things more moderated with regard to increases because we’re sensitive to customer needs and we also want to make sure that we’re first and foremost, they thinking about us for buying other products. So ’10 was not a great year from an industry standard and from a premium perspective in the industry. It will be really ’11 which will have kind of future benefits for us.
Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse Group: Okay. But I guess, what I’m getting at is, I mean, 5% growth for industry standard is pretty good growth. Its – and it’s not that different from your historical norm. So, I mean, as the market – as you start to benefit from the hardening of the market, lets say, potentially in fiscal ’13, do you expect that to be more or like high single digit growth or will kind of your pricing decisions to offset that, and that will continue to be mid single?
Mark Anquillare: I think historically our pricing decisions has moderated some of that.
Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse Group: Okay. That’s fair. And then just a second question, I know Michael Meltz asked about organic growth for fiscal ’12, and you didn’t get into a lot of detail, but I mean last quarter you made a very helpful comment about Q4 organic growth expectation. So I was wondering can you at least talk about Q1 organic growth, I mean, if we ex-out mortgage, do you think something similar to the 9.6% is what we should be thinking about or there are some incrementals that could weigh on growth a bit versus Q4?
Mark Anquillare: Kelly, I’d love to answer your question, but I mean we really do try to think more a long-term than we do next quarter. So, I think we feel good about where our business is, I think we feel that we have the right type of momentum and its not I’m not answering, but I hope you respect that our view and our vantage point is what’s really create the value long-term and that’s we preferred to follow.
Scott Stephenson: I’ll just add that in the external environment there is nothing that’s moving around that would cause us to think differently about our business or our opportunity.
Kelly Flynn - Credit Suisse Group: Okay, that’s fair. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Next question comes from Robert Riggs from William Blair.
Robert Riggs - William Blair & Company, LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to Mark’s comment about the international expansion. I know there are certain things you do, for example, like healthcare that are little tougher that translates into international markets, but it would seem like supply chain would be something that on a global basis would fit pretty well, is that kind of a key element of growing the international part of the business or are there other things that we should kind of keep an eye on?
Frank Coyne: Yeah, that’s a good question. And you started out in the right place also. Supply chain is just born as a global business, and even today, a fair fraction of what we do in the environmental health and safety space inside of the supply chain is non-domestic. And we do have focus on that. We’ve made some changes in terms of our go-to-market strategy in Europe and Asia in that part of our business. So, yes, that is a focal point. Its hard work, but we’re up for it. There are two other parts of our business that I’d point to, one is the catastrophe modeling discipline is also by its very nature global. One big customer said, is the global reinsurers, they’re thinking about apparels anywhere that there are assets that have risk, and in fact one of the things that we’re looking to do is to leverage some of the business development resources that have sort of growing up inside of our catastrophe business, but perhaps can represent other parts of our product mix. And then thirdly, while sort of the idiosyncratic nature of markets means that some of what we do doesn’t travel all that well across national boundaries. It’s more of a case that the claim is a claim and so, some of our businesses which are claims-oriented, I think for example, the [estimatics] business, we actually have plans of the flag over in Europe and we’re looking for opportunities to spread that out. So, we’ve a lot of attention on it. I think that the amount of energy that we’re going to put into it is probably going to exceed the rate at which it shows up in the P&L for some time because it’s just that -- it’s a long development sort of an activity, but we’re purposeful about the overseas markets.
Robert Riggs - William Blair & Company, LLC: Great. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up on cross-sell in healthcare, it’s got in the path, I think you’ve broken out the solutions across the buckets around population management and performance measurement and then kind of compliance and payment integrity. But also know that you kind of compete with different players in each one of those buckets. As you get some scale in bulk of all three of those capabilities do you get a competitive advantage by offering your clients kind of a comprehensive solution that will enable cross-sell or there are other things as the unified platform, is that kind of key to the cross sum?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah, again a very fine question. So just a couple of things one is, each of the solutions needs to be excellent on its own and we give that a lot of attention. And the performance and the results that you’re seeing are primarily a product of each of the solution sets being on their own highly valuable and very competitive against other offerings. But that said, yes, we do get advantage as we penetrate more broadly. I mentioned before a unified account management approach which definitely is meaningful in front of the largest accounts. And then again I’d point back to the unified platform which we really do believe will make us unique in the sense that the vision is once you are using one of our products since the underlying data infrastructure is common across all the solutions, it’s relatively easy for a customer to then turn on the next solution. And we do believe that that capability will make us unique. So it’s a great question and so in the near-term, yes, the whole is greater than some of the parts, I think particularly as it relates to facing off with the customers and in the long-term we can stream together more of the intellectual property assets to be flexible and more inventive.
Robert Riggs - William Blair & Company, LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Macquarie. Mr. McVeigh, your line is open.
Kevin McVeigh – Macquarie Research Equities: I apologize. I wonder if you could just give us a sense with the economy firm in a little bit. Does it change kind of the multiples you’re thinking about in terms of acquisitions, in terms of what people are looking versus what you are willing to pay, how we should think about that on a go-forward basis?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah, it doesn’t change our method for assessing acquisitions one bit. We are using exactly the same methodologies that we’ve used in the past. And what – and actually what we start with and we’ve mentioned in the past that we really are very disciplined on the acquisition side. The stream of opportunities that we assess versus the ones that we ultimately execute against is – the first is much larger than the second and that’s always been the case. In the current environment I’d say that probably marginally sellers are a little more inclined to perhaps going to processes. But it’s not really very different than it has been over the last several years, and in any of that we are not -- we are not referencing the macro environment when we are thinking about what it is that we are looking to do which is to derive from our strategy or what we are willing to pay which is really related to our evaluation methodologies. None of the -- none of the assumptions, none of the parameters inside of our models have changed, and I don’t believe they will.
Kevin McVeigh – Macquarie Research Equities: That’s helpful. And then is there a way to quantify what the impact of the acquisitions on an overall margin basis will be in 2012? As we think --.
Mark Anquillare: The ones that we’ve already done?
Kevin McVeigh – Macquarie Research Equities: Yes.
Mark Anquillare: I don’t think you will see comparing ’12 to ’11 I don’t think there is any adjustments that need to be made. I think we just simply roll forward and we are normalized on a go-forward basis. That may answer your question properly.
Kevin McVeigh – Macquarie Research Equities: Yes, thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Bill Clark from KBW.
William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc: Hi there. The color on seasonality in HRP revenues was helpful. Just as far as in annual run rate at the time of the acquisition you talked about 15 million to 20 million number for that business in 2010. Could you just give an idea if we’re still in that range or 2011 was significantly above that?
Mark Anquillare: Well, not substantially. But we did experience like we expected growth there, so which was reasonably strong growth, nothing outrageous. And I think then take about 70% of that and allocated towards the latter half of the year.
William Clark - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc: Okay, great. Thank you.
Mark Anquillare: Sure.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Frank Coyne: All right. Well, thank you very much. I want to thank everyone for joining us today for our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011 results. We appreciate your support and we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day Conference or visiting with you again next quarter. Thank you and have a good day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Verisk Analytics Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I’d like to turn the call over to Verisk treasurer and head of Investor Relations, Ms. Eva Huston. Ms. Huston, please go ahead.
Eva Huston: Thank you, Tequila, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our third quarter 2011 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Frank, Scott and Mark, highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions. The earnings release referenced on this call as well as the associated 10-Q can be found in the Investor section of our website, verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be posted on our website and available by dial-in for 30 days until December 2nd, 2011. Finally, as set forth in more detail in today’s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today’s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk’s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of the press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. With that, I will turn the call over to Frank Coyne.
Frank Coyne: Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In third quarter 2011, we delivered strong performance of 18.4% revenue growth and 25% diluted adjusted EPS growth. We performed well in many of our businesses and our recent acquisitions contributed as well. Risk assessment grew 2.7% for the quarter and 3.9% year-to-date, as our continued value to customers is reflected in our revenue growth. Excluding the property specific category risk assessment growth in the third quarter was closer to 5%. We faced some challenges in our property specific revenue, which we will discuss on this call and that weighed on risk assessment growth in the quarter. In the quarter, Decision Analytics revenue grew over 30% and our insurance-facing solutions and Decision Analytics grew almost 17% of organically. Our health care solutions revenue grew over 25% organically, as we implemented our solutions for clients. Supply chain remains an area of focus and promise for us. Overall, our organic revenue growth was 7.6% in the quarter and also year-to-date. Decision Analytics’ organic growth in Q3 was about 12%, driven by both accelerated growth from insurance-facing solutions as well as the strong growth in health care. The mortgage market continues to represent a challenge for us as well as other companies in the space and our revenue declined in the quarter. We are keenly focused on our mortgage business and managing it through the volatile macro environment while not losing site of the 90% of our business that has both near-term and long-term growth opportunities. We continue to have conviction around our margin and overall profitability. We are pleased to deliver 25% growth in diluted adjusted EPS and 16% growth in EBITDA while expanding margins excluding recent acquisitions to almost 46%. As always, we remained focused on delivering shareholder returns to growth in our business, disciplined acquisition, and our share repurchase program. While no new acquisitions were announced in this quarter, we are seeing the benefit of both financially and from a customer perspective of the 2Q acquisition. We also continue to hunt for the right opportunities. In share repurchases, we bought a 123 million of shares, a lower amount in 2Q as we continue to manage our buyback as part of our broader capital allocation plan including acquisition. As we move through the final quarter of 2011, we are focused on positioning our business to perform both through challenging times as we have for the past few years as well as into the future when we see our economy return to a better growth environment. While our strong performance in a weak environment is notable, we believe we will perform even better as our clients see better performance in their businesses. Improvement at our customer’s hand in the economic outlook, we’ll make it easier for them to spend incremental dollars of new solutions and re-engineering processes that may have been delayed in a weaker environment. Our customers have thrown their interest in new solutions during our customer conference n October, when we met with about 150 executives from leading P&C insurers. Now, I’ll turn it over to Scott to talk about the progress we are making in a number of our business areas.
Scott Stephenson: Thank you, Frank. As we further our growth agenda, we remained focused on innovation as an important part of our business process. As you hear about new developments such as our claims tools for REO properties that is real estate owned by the lenders through a foreclosure process, or our vehicle symbols as part of our risk analyzer suite were nucleus, which is our new delivery platform for Verisk Health (inaudible) Solutions or our expanding insurance catastrophe modelling solutions. You should know there are many other ideas behind those that we are working to develop and eventually commercialize. It’s important for us to be innovative as none of our markets stand still. This also requires the commitment to invest which we continue to do. Speaking of growth, the pieces of our health care strategy are coming together nicely and the traction we’re feeling in that business is positive. While you can see our quarterly results in our supplemental data, we’re pleased with 25% organic revenue growth in the quarter and important point to me is that we’re seeing the synergy of bringing Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners into the fold. We’re going to market today as Verisk Health, which is being well-received by our customers. With tools for population management, performance measurement and compliance and the payment integrity, there’s a lot of opportunity to grow. And while our business with a run rate of over $100 million of revenues reaching a meaningful scale for us, the size of our revenue today pales in comparison to about $2.5 trillion of annual health care spent. I’m optimistic and our team is optimistic that we can do more. We continue to be encouraged about 3E and our supply chain team as it develops. We’re seeing many areas of crossover with solutions we provide in weather and catastrophe analytics, cargo solutions and others. And we believe that interesting acquisition targets as well as organic growth exist in this space. Let me turn it over now to Mark to talk about our financial results.
Mark Anquillare:
 : This quarter, we have introduced supplemental revenue within Decision Analytics segment to help you follow the changes as they relate to the vertical hand market themes, in addition to the (inaudible) loss prediction and loss quantification. We have not change in any of our historic financial results. We hope this transparency helps your understanding of our historical performance and opportunities going forward. A few days ago, we provided historic supplemental data back to 2008 for your reference. That data was filed in 8-K and it’s also available on our Investor Relations website. The third quarter release contains the data in the same format for this quarter. In our supplemental data, we provided you Decision Analytics (inaudible) theme insurance, mortgaging financial services, health care and specialized market. We have grouped revenues by the primary end market of the various parts of our business. In insurance, we have our insurance fraud solution including claim search, our catastrophe modelling solutions from ARR worldwide, and our insurance [Audio Gap] Decision Analytics. In mortgage and financial services, we included our (inaudible) underwriting and forensic audit tools facing the mortgage market as well as strategic analytics business which should also serve our consumer finance markets. This grouping is the same as with mortgage on previous calls. Health care includes all of our tools for Verisk Health including the DxCG, Share Med [ph], D2Hawkeye, HDI, Bloodhound and Heath Risk Partners. And finally, specialized markets include our Climate Risk Analytics as well as 3E component of our supply chain risk management solutions. I will reference somehow on this supplemental data. They died into the second performance. Within Decision Analytics, our loss quantification solutions continue to standout in this quarter with 29.8% revenue growth all organic. We continue to benefit from our 2010 new contract on the claim side. Also, all the storms you read about including Hurricane Irene helped as many of our customers submitted higher than usual claim volumes. We also continue to see growth in our underwriting tools and newer solutions, such as content estimations with in-loss modification. In the quarter, we had launched XactPRM, our property repair and maintenance tool, which is aimed at the REO market, and we’re seeing interest from potential customer. The revenue growth in fraud identification detection was 16% in the third quarter and 4% organic. We continue to see solid performance in our insurance fraud and related solutions in the quarter and Crowe Paradis contributed to the total growth. Our health care fraud assets performed well, with double-digit growth, as we implemented signed contracts for our health care fraud solutions. Health care fraud growth was also bolstered by the addition of Bloodhound in the quarter. Also within fraud, our mortgage business declined 4.9% in the quarter in comparison to the peak quarter for mortgage revenue in the third quarter of 2010 as the mortgage remained bumpy. We were not able to fully offset the more than 20% decline originations versus 2010 with new customers increase usage of origination tools. Forensic audit revenues also declined in the quarter as increased volumes from certain customers was more than offset by declining volumes from one large customer. We continue to be in constant conversation with our customer in ways we can help. We’ve seen a good pickup from our undisclosed (inaudible) tool and continue to work on new solutions to meet customer needs. However, we expect the mortgage market will remain hard to predict for the remainder of 2011 and, perhaps, beyond. In loss prediction, total growth was 69.9% from the third quarter and 14.2% organic. Our catastrophe modeling solutions performed well in the quarter as we continue to add customers and sell new solutions. Large catastrophe events in 2011 have caused insurers and reinsurers to reassess their modeling needs and we’re seeing benefit. In health care, we had double-digit growth in the third quarter and we’re seeing a positive response from customers on our new solutions from health risk partners as well as our existing solutions. We remain focused on generating new sales in health care. Our climate risk analytics business growth float as we cycled through a large contract we won in late second quarter of 2010 and as the government – the US government that is – looks to stretch out implementations of the contracts due to budgetary constraints. In 2011, our total growth has benefited from the addition of 3E and Health Risk Partners in that grouping. Turning to risk assessment. We grew revenue 2.7% in the quarter. Our industry standard programs grew 4.8% in the quarter, a continued reflection of the value base price increases from January and a moderation of premium declines at our customers, as well as new customers in 2011. Our premium linkage solutions also continued to add growth. Our property specific information revenues declined 4.1% in the quarter because of lower volumes at certain customers we’ve discussed previously. The reasons behind the decline of property specific revenue are mix of a generally weak business environment as well as some changes in processes at certain customers driven by expense control. We have not lost any customers. About 85% of our revenue in risk assessment is based upon subscriptions and long-term contracts, with 99% renewal rates, creating recurring in fairly predictable revenue of vast majority of the segment. Overall, we are comfortable at enterprise performance even in the face of some specific market issues for the mortgage. Excluding mortgage business, organic growth in the quarter was over 9%. We also continue to manage the expense side of the business very closely. EBITDA for the third quarter was $151 million as outlined in the Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 16.2% for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 44.4% as our consolidated EBITDA margin increases in the third quarter compared to 43.9% in the second quarter of 2011, and 42.9% excluding the benefit of the acquisition related liability earn-out. In the quarter, our risk assessment margins were 50.5% versus 48.7% in the third quarter of 2010 and 48.5% in second quarter 2011. As we discussed in the second quarter, we had some accelerated stock option expense related to employees who attained age 62, resulting in less expense in the third quarter. We have to reduce certain cost, including the add-in of another cost which benefited the margin. And margin in Decision Analytics was 40.1% third quarter versus 38.6% in the second quarter of 2011, excluding the acquisition liability adjustment benefit. Improving underlying margins for several of our businesses as well a mix shift to higher margin solutions benefited us in the quarter, partially offset by the impact from the mortgage business. Our interest expense was up a little more than $6 million versus third quarter of 2010, kind of about flat with second quarter of 2011. Also, just after the quarter ended, we closed on an amendment to offer credit facility, which increased the facility by $100 million to a total of $700 million, while also reducing the pricing, extending maturity to October of 2016. With the public bond we completed in the second quarter and our upsized revolving credit facility, we have significant debt capacity available to execute on our strategy. We ended third quarter with $160 million of our revolving credit facility drawn. Our reported effective tax rate was 39.2% for the quarter, down a bit due to favorable audit settlements, adjustments for actual state filings in the quarter, the continued execution of our tax planning strategies, and the benefits associated with R&D tax legislation. Coming down to the next income line. We focused on the adjusted net income and non-GAAP measure, which we defined, in the current period, as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense, less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 14.7% to $76.3 million. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.45 for third quarter of 2011, an increase of 25%. The adjusted diluted share count was $171.2 million in the quarter, and on September 30th, 2011, our diluted share count was $170.1 million shares. We were active in the quarter with our share repurchase program, purchasing approximately 3.7 million shares. As of quarter end, we had a little less than 50 million left under our share repurchase authorization. As we have purchased approximately 340 million worth of shares year-to-date, I don’t anticipate us going beyond the remaining authorization in 2011. Turning to the balance sheet. As of September 30, our cash and cash equivalence were about $53 million. Total debt both in short-term and long-term were just north of $1 billion at September 30th, about flat the second quarter of 2011, as acquisition closings were quite and we funded share buybacks largely with cash on hand and cash from operation. Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 1.8 debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA at quarter-end, well within our covenant, in the zone with our target leverage level of two times. Our debt capacity is about $700 million and will continue to grow with our free cash flow generation and as we add EBITDA from acquired companies. Free cash flow in the first nine months of 2011 which we defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures was $275.5 million, an increase of $57.9 million versus first nine months of 2010. Free cash flow increased 27% year-to-date. We’ve benefited from strong profitability and also a temporary deferral of a third quarter tax payment resulting from a federal disaster declaration due to Hurricane Irene for certain countries in New Jersey, including where our corporate headquarters is located. We’re still (inaudible) the tax payment in the fourth quarter so you’ll see the benefit reverse itself then. Without the tax deferral and related impacts, our operating cash flow would have been up about 17% and free cash flow would’ve been up about 8%. As you remember we discussed major upgrades for our mainframe environment and related software earlier this year, which increased our CapEx year-to-date. Our CapEx in the third quarter was lower as a percent of revenue than the second quarter, about 4.1%. But we’ll finish the year in an elevated level versus 2010 due to those investments. We continued our strong free cash flow conversion of EBITDA, which was 64% for the first nine months of 2011. We are pleased with the results in the quarter. And with that, I’ll ask the operator to open the line for questions.

And with that, I’ll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator instruction) Your first question comes from the line of Michael Meltz.
Michael Meltz – JPMorgan: Thank you. I think I have two questions for you. Can you talk a little bit about the expectation going forward? The organic growth rate in the third quarter, I guess, is on par with the year-to-date. What’s the expectation going forward? You talked a little bit about within analytics, mortgage remains tough, and I guess you’re saying AER might moderate. But what should we expect for this?
Mark Anquillare: Hi, Michael. I think what we feel is strength throughout the business. So I think we continue to believe that organic growth will continue to move kind of down the path that we’ve seen over the first nine months. The caveat to that is mortgage that’s still really difficult to predict. So we don’t have great visibility into that, which could be slightly lower than what we’ve seen for the first time.
Michael Meltz – JPMorgan: Okay. And then, just a follow-on question to that. I think you had closed one, maybe two of the acquisitions fourth quarter last year. So there’s some cycling. Can you just remind us what to expect on the inorganic side for the upcoming quarter versus a year ago?
Mark Anquillare: So, in the upcoming quarter, the fourth quarter, we acquired both 3E and Crowe Paradis in these very latter stages of fourth quarter 2010. There were only a few days in December where we owned both those entities. So you won’t see too much of a grow-over as you think about the fourth quarter. There’s just a few days, maybe a couple of weeks in 2010 without revenue associated with those two entities.
Michael Meltz – JP Morgan: And then the other question for you, just on the property specific rating business, the fire suppression data. Can you talk a bit more about what’s going on there? I understand what you’re saying about certain customers you’re not – you haven’t lost contracts. That being said I don’t think you’ve had a downed quarter of revenue there in years. So, can you just give us a little bit more detail, please?
Frank Coyne: Yes, Michael. This is Frank here. It’s really a mixed bag that we’re seeing. Part of it is the economy as less business is being written, as we’ve got vacancies in some of the commercial properties. Some of it had to do with customers repositioning their portfolios. And we’ll see some return of that business as they work through that. Some of it has to do with process changes within companies where they basically have cut back on their commercial writings for a period of time. And we would expect to see that return once they’ve cycled through their process changes. And some are just redesigns of their own internal processes as a result of expense controls. So, the positive is it’s a whole mixed bag of things and not a trend that we’re seeing in the use of our products.
Michael Meltz – JP Morgan: Okay. All right, thank you for your time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Warmington.
Bill Warmington – Raymond James: Good morning everyone.
Frank Coyne: Good morning.
Bill Warmington – Raymond James: I want to see if you could comment on how – see where the insurance premiums are trending on commercial PNC side. You mentioned you saw some benefits there this quarter?
Frank Coyne: Yes. I think as we have observed in the past, our sense was that the market has bottomed out and we were seeing some positive trends. The surveys would indicate that that is what is happening. I think more importantly the results that are being announced by the industry, all of which are our customers, would indicate that premiums are on the rise. And specifically with regard to our line of business, we are certainly seeing that. So, there are positive trends going forward.
Bill Warmington – Raymond James: And I wonder if you could comment on – a little bit about what’s behind the strong pick-up in health care. I think you’ve reach some sort of tipping point in terms of how companies are looking at health care spending?
Frank Coyne: Well, I would make a couple observations there and maybe Scott would add. And that is that we’re seeing growth in both our frontend and backend – the fraud solutions and the underwriting analytic solutions that we have there. So, we’re seeing positive signs in both parts of our business. Also we had commented in the past that we had written contracts that we were in the process of implanting. And we are seeing that implementation complete now and just beginning to be able to recognize that revenue.
Bill Warmington – Raymond James: Okay. And then final question was that you had mentioned some – well, it sounded like pent-up demand and the insurance companies coming out of your customer confidence in October. When do you think that that starts to flow through for you in terms of revenue and what segments do you think benefit from that?
Frank Coyne: Well, what we specifically saw is that as we introduced our – some of the ideas that we have around new solutions – we saw a receptivity to understanding the value of those solutions. So, it is hard to tell when the purses will open back up, as clearly as the industries health returns, so the results aren’t bad to the industry. But as premium writings begin to increase, we would expect to see a pick-up in the new solutions that we’re offering.
Scott Stephenson: I will just add to that, that one of the strong themes that seem to have caught the imagination of a lot of the insurance companies is the opportunity to better understand the weather and respond and prepare for it. And between climate science and in our capacity modeling, we really have a very unique set of capabilities. To Frank’s point, it’s not a spike, it’s more a moving that intellectual property into that processes, which I think will occur steadily but I don’t think it’s a step function so much as just a kind of a gradual expansion of what it is we do with the company.
Bill Warmington – Raymond James: All right. Well, excellent. Thank you very much for the insight.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Flynn.
Kelly Flynn – Credit Suisse: Thanks. A couple of questions, just first on mortgage. I know you’ve said several times it’s very unpredictable but you said that last quarter and then it’s declined. So, I’m wondering if you can just, maybe give us a little bit of guidance on how you would advice us to model it. You think that business declines over the next couple of quarters or is it really so unpredictable that you have absolutely no idea at this point in the quarter?
Frank Coyne: Well, I would say a couple of things and certainly my colleagues could add to it if they desire and that is that, yes, it is unpredictable. Because you see what we see happening the macro environment, so you never know what might come out of Washington, for example. But as we look at our business – I mean we do have some sense of customer uptake on some of our new products. We just do not know what an individual customer would say. So, I’m not expecting a decline up from this quarter but it’s really hard to predict.
Kelly Flynn – Credit Suisse: Okay. And then, just going back to the issue someone else asked a couple of questions ago about the commercial premiums. I know you said that there’s a positive tone there but the Q2 commercial premiums, they grew, but they grew at a slower rate, I believe than they did in the first quarter. So, I’m wondering what you make of that. Do you think it’s possible that this macro weakness may be causing a deterioration there? Or do you just feel like that data tends to jump around and positive is good in general?
Mark Anquillare: So, let me first talk about the tangibles like (inaudible) business. I mean, the way our invoices are prepared it’s really the full year. So, we would begin our 2012, we’ll be looking a full year of 2010 premiums. And a full year of 2010 premiums rolled through to 2009, it is better news, okay? Not great news but better news. And so you think about 2013, you’re relating to 2011 premiums full year and that’s better news. So, clearly the trend is improving. I think your questions was more industry specific and with the fact that the trends in the industry itself almost appeared to kind of regress a bit or digress a bit. The third quarter – excuse me, the second quarter premium growth was not as great as what we’ve seen in the first quarter. And I’m not sure we have great visibility into why that was. So, you think about some cash fees, there was some activity. That usually puts some pressure. You also kind of see, hopefully, a function of a competition heating up and sometimes that helps us. But the market economy, it can be poor and I think that’s pulling down some of the ability of insurers to increase premiums to their customers. I’m sure (inaudible).
Frank Coyne: Yes. And I think actually some of these things tied together as we had a severe cash season as you know. And so that when you have that it – in particular it impacts the property business. So, as we see some of our customers reacting to that and I mentioned that repositioning of their property portfolio, that is some of the answer behind our specific property as well.
Kelly Flynn – Credit Suisse: Okay, great. I’ll leave it at that. Thanks guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Suzie Stein.
Suzie Stein – Morgan Stanley: Hi. Just a follow-up on Michael’s question on the spy [ph] database, should we expect that weakness to continue in Q4 or do you have kind of a sense of timing of should when you expect a recovery there?
Frank Coyne: Yes. Good morning, Suzie. I would not expect a further decrease in Q4 in that business. And it’s hard to say when it will turn, but we’ve got confidence in that business, in the value proposition associated with.
Suzie Stein – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And also, when you’re in public you talked about 5% to 7% as being kind of a normalized rate of growth in risk assessment. As we hopefully near the end of the cycle, do you expect that we can get to the high-end of this over the next couple of years?
Frank Coyne: Well, as we transitioned out of the cycle we would expect our organic growth in the risk assessment to increase.
Suzie Stein – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then just a final question, can you just talk about how the health of the mortgage insurance market impacts your back-end mortgage business?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah, well, that part of our business is transaction-based as you know. So the volume of the folks that are foreclosing loans is basically what drives our revenue there. And a couple of the mortgage insurers have been somewhat constrained in their ability to source new business because of state regulation where the regulators are looking at capital adequacy. So if mortgage insurers are fundamentally suppressed in their ability to write a business, that will eventually express itself inside of our business.
Suzie Stein – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Got it. Okay, thank you.
Frank Coyne: Yeah. And just to follow-up on the mortgage question. We observed that we had a peak in premiums there in the third quarter – revenue on that premium in the third quarter of 2010 and our second highest quarter with the fourth quarter of 2010. So I want to make sure that I was clear in my earlier answer, expectations filling into the fourth quarter, a little difficult to assess. We know we’re doing better than others. We know where our front-in solutions are catching some traction. But it’s hard to tell what mandates that might come out of governments that it could impact any of our customer’s performance. So it is very difficult to project what will happen there in the fourth quarter.
Mark Anquillare: And just to clarify I think – I know Frank made a comment about where we would be in fourth quarter, I think he was referring to it as kind of a year-to-date or full year, not in the quarter itself with regard to growth year-over-year, so just to clarify.
Eva Huston: Operator, do we have additional questions?
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Boyer.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo Securities: You talked about some of the implementations within health care converting to revenue. Are there more large implementations underway or is the line shared of those large implementations now included in the revenue?
Scott Stephenson: We’re midstream on all of that, Eric. So there is a lot of it still ahead of us, actually. Just to be clear for those who may be a little bit newer to our story. What we’re referring to here is the work that we do to suppress fraudulent claims flows and we basically have to go through a process of getting our engine or analytic engine hooked up to the customer’s data stores and then go through an ETL process to get their data flowing. So that’s the implementation cycle that we’re talking about here. And with some of the large national health plans having sold many of their regions, there’s a stage implementation across their system. So that’s the part of our business that we’re talking about when we talk about these implementation cycles. And actually I think relative to the 40-odd implementations we were looking at, what we were reporting on this earlier in the year, we’re not even quite halfway through that. Yes. So there’s a lot more to come.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay, great. And then can you talk about just, I guess, the positioning of the company today compared to if we were to enter another recession compared to how you were positioned entering the last recession?
Frank Coyne: Well, I think one of the strengths of our revenue stream is that it’s well diversified and though we are impacted by this economy, I think we’re stronger today in terms of our diversification than we were before. I think we’ve got assets that are not really impacted by the recession – more assets that really aren’t impacted by the recession, an example in the health care area and even our 3E acquisition would be a strong contributor in spite of the possible second dip. So I think we’re in a better place.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Riggs.
Robert Riggs – William Blair & Company: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Scott, a couple of quarters ago you had mentioned looking to or any implementation stage of looking at streamlines and processes around the acquisition integration process, could you just give us some update kind of on where you stand with that?
Scott Stephenson: Yeah. I think that we’ve made considerable progress. And that issue exists at multiple levels. One level is trying to harmonize technology platform so that the next acquisition is a little bit more plug-and-play into what we’ve already got. And that has been a theme particularly in the health care vertical. And we’re very encouraged by the progress that we’ve made on that front. Some of you will remember that we referenced the fact that there’s a wonderful platform that came along with the Bloodhound acquisition and we’re kind of re-purposing that to serve other parts of our health care business. Some of the other pieces of it would represent – right now, we’re well-along in observing our opportunity to engage in data center consolidation across the entire enterprise. We have designated a function inside of the company which is solely given over to post-acquisition, post-merger integration. And all these things are kind of clicking ahead.
Robert Riggs – William Blair & Company: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Friedman.
James Friedman – Susquehanna Financial Group: Hi, good morning. First, let me say I appreciate the supplement revenue data. It’s very helpful with our analysis. I wanted to ask about in terms of the health care solutions and Decision Analytics, are there different margin characteristics of that business at this stage relative to the overall Decision Analytics product line?
Mark Anquillare: Well, I think at this time the answer is, we'll refer to it as strictly the front end, is experiencing some better margins in the backend. And I think that's really a function of disimplementation, as Scott was highlighting before. On the backend, we need to make sure we're integrated with the inside of our customer so we can get claims and information and pass them back potential fraud instances. So, that upfront implementation does take time and does cost us money and does weigh our margins until that customer is up and running. What I will call in steady state, I think you would see margins of both being good nature, high, but probably not at the risk assessment type levels.
James Friedman – Susquehanna Financial Group: Okay. And then with regard to some of the specialized markets, would you say the same that you need that, same infrastructure and place in order to commend in streamline processing?
Scott Stephenson: To a degree, yes. So when I was talking about enterprise level, data center consolidation, that definitely applies where the specialized markets are concerned. But with respect to the applications that are at work, they are distinctive. So, to a degree, yes.
James Friedman – Susquehanna Financial Group: Great. And then the last question is with regard to the compensation increase. So that was primarily in the Q2 and seem to have extended in the Q3. Is that going to sunset for the Q4 or will that continue this quarter?
Mark Anquillare: Let me clarify it. Some of those parts, we issue equity on April 1st every year and the way the plan is written is that if you’re age is 62 and you were to leave, you definitely have no shares. So what that does is it causes us every year, every second quarter to expense the cost associated with those equity works for those people who have attained age 62. So there's always a spike in second quarter relative to first third or fourth quarters. This year in particular the amount in second quarter is a little more than even last year second quarter. And that’s because of some other people who are now aged 62. The last point, I think, you brought up and I just want to highlight is, once we have that accelerated amount, the cost associated with the equity does go down and has gone down in third quarter and will continue at that lower level into fourth quarter.
James Friedman – Susquehanna Financial Group: Got it. Thank you for the clarification.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Richard Cheever.
Richard Cheever – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Hey. I'm on the line for Andrew Jeffrey. I just wanted to, I guess, first of all, reiterate my thanks for the additional disclosure. It is a really big help. Can you talk a little bit more about, I guess, the positive mix shift in Decision Analytics and how much of that is being driven by, I guess, the increased contribution by health care and specialized market? And talk maybe a little bit about the sustainability of that mix shift.
Mark Anquillare: Sure. Let me just try to take that on. I think you get this in the underlying fundamentals. Mortgage is down in the quarter. We have been effective in trying to cut cost there, but clearly margins there are kind of weighing on the profit margins and DA, Decision Analytics, a little bit. But sending out with this mix shift we're referring to is the health care business is improving and the margins are improving as we discuss. And we talked about cast a few modeling as well as just the typical claim search business, the claims fraud business. As they grow, great scaling opportunity leverage to those businesses. So, as we grow the top line, a good chunk of that falls to the bottom and that's what we continue to see. And I will, obviously, as kind of Scott mentioned, the wonderful results in loss quantification has the same (inaudible) scale characteristics. So, as we add and continue to grow organically in a very significant way, loss quantification, we continue to invest on business, but there's not a lot of additional cost associated with those new customers and new volumes.
Richard Cheever – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: As those acquisitions specifically in health care in the specialized markets, as they anniversary, is there some additional lift there as you get past on the integration cost?
Mark Anquillare: So I think from an integration perspective, I think that's true inside of Verisk scouts. We are doing quite a bit, as Scott highlighted, to integrate those assets. And we're spending money to make that happen, maybe less sell in the other businesses because I don't think we've been able to, for the most part, pull some cost out as we try to integrate them into what is the Verisk family. But there was a lot of upfront cost there.
Scott Stephenson: Were you asking specifically about 2011 accusation, the two and a half year space?
Richard Cheever – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Right, if there are some additional lifts.
Scott Stephenson: Yes. Of those HRP, the integration task is kind of simpler and has the shorter timeframe. Bloodhound as I mentioned before has technology that we are really excited to reuse not just inside the payment integrity, but across the entirety of the health care vertical. And that's a large project that we'll continue to bring forward, I think, through the better part of 2012. But we're encouraged by the progress we're making. It's just a big thing to get it done.
Richard Cheever – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: Okay. I appreciate the color.
Frank Coyne: Thank you.
Richard Cheever – SunTrust Robinson Humphrey: All right. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
Frank Coyne: All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today and we appreciate your ongoing support, and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.
Operator: This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q2  (2011-08-03 09:30:00) =====
Executives: Eva Huston – Treasurer and Head of IR Frank Coyne – Chairman and CEO Scott Stephenson – President and COO Mark Anquillare – CFO
Analysts: Jim Kissane – Bank of America Robert Riggs – William Blair Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan Kelly Flynn – Credit Suisse Bill Warmington – Raymond James Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley Matt Otis – KBW James Friedman – Susquehanna 
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Verisk Analytics Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Eva Huston, you may begin.
Eva Huston: Thank you, Latoya, and good morning to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for the discussion of our second quarter 2011 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Frank Coyne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott Stephenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mark Anquillare, Chief Financial Officer. Following some comments by Frank, Scott and Mark highlighting key points about our strategic priorities and financial performance, we will open the call up for your questions. The earnings release referenced on the call as well as the associated 10-K can be found in the Investor section of our website at verisk.com. The earnings release has also been attached to an 8-K that we have furnished to the SEC. A replay of this call will be posted on our website and available by dial-in for 30 days until September 3rd, 2011. Finally, and set forth in more detail in today’s earnings release, I will remind everyone that today’s call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk’s future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. And, with that, I will turn the call over to Frank Coyne.
Frank Coyne:  Thank you, Eva, and good morning. In second quarter 2011, we delivered strong performance at 16.2% revenue growth and 24.2% adjusted diluted EPS growth. We performed well in many of our businesses and our recent acquisitions contributed as well. We were pleased to see Risk Assessment growth at 4.6% for the quarter and 4.5% year-to-date, as our continued value to customers is reflected in our revenue growth. Our insurance-facing solutions in Decision Analytics grew over 20% and 14% organically. Our healthcare solutions continued to show growth and we are working hard to implement our sold solutions for clients which will allow recognition of contracted revenue. Supply chain remains an area of focus and promise for us. Overall, our organic growth was 8.8%, a meaningful improvement versus first quarter 2011. We improved Decision Analytics organic growth in Q2 to almost 13%, driven by both improved growth from insurance-facing solutions as well as a return to positive growth for our mortgage solutions. The mortgage market continues to represent a challenge for us as well as other companies. Mortgage insurers continue to confront difficulties achieving sufficient capital requirements, resulting in a major insurer recently announcing its potential inability to write new business without receiving an extension of a capital waiver. It is unclear at the moment how that may affect the broader mortgage market. We are clearly focused on our mortgage business and managing it through the volatile macro environment. But even with the uncertainties in the mortgage marketplace, we believe the strength and diversity of our solutions across multiple verticals will lead to strong overall performance. I said on our first quarter call that we expected to see improvement in total organic growth for full-year 2011 compared to first quarter results and we delivered improvement in the second quarter. Additionally, we continued to have strong conviction around our margin and overall profitability. Excluding the recent acquisitions, our EBITDA margins in Q2 were almost 46%. Speaking of our acquisitions, we were excited to integrate both Bloodhound Technologies and Healthcare Partners into our various health solutions. We were making client calls with all these tools in hand and receiving good response. In the quarter, we were also able to continue to drive what I believe is most important to delivering shareholder returns, EBITDA and free cash flow. We grew our total EBITDA by almost 16% and converted a large portion to free cash flow. In the quarter, we grew our diluted adjusted EPS by about 24%. As always, we’ve remained focus on delivering shareholder returns through growth in our businesses, disciplined acquisitions and our share repurchase program. In the quarter, we invested a $141 million in new healthcare assets and purchased over a $140 million worth of shares, while also adding a new $150 million authorization. This level of repurchase was higher than in previous quarters as we saw opportunity to buy shares at an attractive price, bringing ourselves closer to our target capital structure. We believe our repurchase program has been successful and liked the flexibility it provides to ensure we can deploy our capital when prices are appropriate. For the rest of 2011, we will remain focus on executing on the plan I laid out at our last call, namely growing insurance revenues through new solutions and cross-selling, further penetration in the healthcare space, managing our mortgage business in the face of a challenging macro environment, and creating shareholder value. Scott has been spending a lot of time with our new partners Bloodhound and Health Risk Partners, who we call HRP. So I’ll ask him to share some perspectives on our newest addition HRP as well as our acquisition program and other corporate initiatives.
Scott Stephenson:  Thank you, Frank. As you all are aware we’ve been busy on the M&A front, we’re very excited to add Bloodhound Technologies and HRP to our suite of healthcare analytic solutions. I spoke about Bloodhound on our last call and we continued to see the value in its real-time claims editing solution as well as the benchmarking tools and the end-process ROI available to their customers. In June, we added another healthcare asset, Heath Risk Partners, who provide solutions that optimize revenue, ensure compliance and improve quality of care for Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans. Recent data states that the United States will spend about $4.6 trillion on healthcare by 2020 and about 50% of that will be paid by the United States Government. By expanding our footprint to include more payment integrity solutions and tools that help health plans operate profitably, we are positioning to help with these daunting numbers which are obviously a challenge for our nation. We have aspirations to continue to grow HRP at a nice pace from the base of around $15 million to $20 million of 2010 revenue. Although the margins are lower than the Verisk enterprise, we expect to drive higher margins in the future due to the operating leverage which is inherent in that business. Talking more broadly about our acquisition program, we’re pleased to see good opportunities across multiple verticals and at a variety of sizes. We are open to transactions in all the verticals as well as the supply chain domain. We’ve just spent a few days with all of our business leaders and innovation was a very strong topic of conversation and remains right at the top of mind for all of us. We continue to focus on making sure our investment dollars are being spent effectively and that we are aiming at transformational innovation for our customers as well as important incremental innovation to keep our products at the leading edge. Let me turn it over now to Mark to talk about our financial results.
Mark Anquillare:  Thank you, Scott. As Frank noted, in the second quarter, we delivered 16.2% revenue growth and 8.8% organic growth. For the second quarter, our Decision Analytics segment revenue continued to lead with 26.7% growth. Decision Analytics organic revenue growth, which was 12.5% in the quarter, excludes the acquisition of Crowe Paradis, 3E, Bloodhound, and HRP. Within Decision Analytics, our loss quantification solutions continue to stand out in this quarter with 34.7% revenue growth, all organic. We continued to benefit from our 2010 new contracts on the claims side. Also all the storms you read about helped our Xactware revenue as many customers submitted higher than usual claim volumes. We continued to see growth in underwriting tools and numerous solutions such as content estimation within loss quantification. The revenue growth in fraud identification and detection was 17.5% for the second quarter and 7% organic. We continued to see solid performance in our insurance fraud and related solutions in the quarter and Crowe Paradis contributed. Our healthcare fraud assets continued to perform and their growth was bolstered by the addition of Bloodhound in the quarter. We remained focus on implementing signed contracts in our healthcare fraud tools. The mortgage business delivered about 8% growth in the second quarter; a distinct improvement from the first quarter. Forensic audit revenues grew in the quarter based upon increased volumes from certain customers as we told you we expected last quarter. We continue to be in constant conversation with our forensic customers and prospects about their needs for the rest of 2011. Underwriting solutions revenue declined in the quarter as mortgage originations in the market declined about 20% versus the second quarter of 2010. Year-to-date our total growth in mortgage was approximately 2%. Meaning, it will be a challenge for us to reach the 10% plus growth rate for 2011 we discussed last quarter. Uncertainty continues in the mortgage market with the latest news of certain mortgage insurers potentially being unable to write new business, because they do not meet minimum capital requirements. However, as Frank stated upfront, we are comfortable with other parts of our business will perform in 2011, leaving us optimistic about our overall business growth and profitability. We also continue to manage the expense side of our business closely. In loss prediction, total growth was 39.3% for the second quarter and 7.7% organic. Our catastrophe modeling solutions continued to perform extremely well in the quarter and revenue from climate risk analytic solutions continued to grow nicely. In healthcare, we had continued growth in the second quarter and we are seeing a positive response from customers under new solutions from HRP. We remain focused on generating new sales in healthcare. In 2011, we will benefit from the addition of 3E and HRP in the grouping. As we discuss Decision Analytics, we have attempted to be responsive to investor questions that seemed focused on the vertical markets we serve. We currently show our Decision Analytics revenue in three themes, fraud identification, loss prediction, and loss quantification. In the future we are considering ways to provide even greater visibility into our vertical related groupings of insurance, mortgage and financial services, healthcare and specialized markets. We believe this will help our investors better understand the markets and how our customers profit from our information. Turning to Risk Assessment, we grew revenue 4.6% in the quarter, a continuation of the growth we saw in the first quarter. About 84% of our revenue in Risk Assessment is based on subscriptions and long-term contracts, where our renewal rates are 99% recurring in fairly predictable revenue. Our industry standard programs grew 5.7% in the quarter, a continued reflection of the value based price increases from January, and the moderation of premium declines at our customers, as well as customers expanding their use of industry standard programs in ancillary solutions. Our premium linkage solutions also continued to add to the growth. Our property specific information revenues grew 2.2%, reflecting new products, offsetting the lower volumes of certain customers we discussed in the first quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter was $143.6 million as outlined in Table 3 of our press release. EBITDA increased 15.7% for the quarter and our EBITDA margin was at 43.9%. Our EBITDA includes a $3.4 million benefit from the reduction and earn-out liability for two of our acquisitions, Strategic Analytics and D2Hawkeye. The way we structure our announce is that they are paid for performance significantly above and beyond our internal forecast for those businesses at the time of the acquisitions. While the acquisitions both performed well, we do not believe they will exceed our 2011 earn-out targets to qualify for incremental payouts to sellers. While the year now has caused some unusual accounting beginning with acquisitions closed in 2009, we continue to believe that benefits out waive the negatives. The structure provides a bridge between our internal expectation for a business versus those of the seller, while helping align the goals of our new management team with the Verisk corporate objectives. Our consolidated EBITDA margin was lower in the second quarter as we told it would be during our first quarter call. This is in large part due to our annual salary increases and higher stock option expenses resulting primarily from accelerate investing at age 62. Salary increases are an annual event, but I were to adjust for the increase in the option expense, the recent acquisitions and the reduced earn-out liability, the margin would have exceeded 45%. While the salary increases are obviously ongoing we will recruit some of the stock option expense later in the year as the accelerate investing means that we don’t have to expense those later. In the quarter, our Risk Assessment margins were at 48.5% versus 49.3% in second quarter of 2010, and 52.8% in the first quarter. As we discussed in first quarter, we had incremental cost related to our annual salary increases beginning in second quarter as well as some accelerated stock option expense related to employees who attained age 62. Absent those items, the margin would have been over 52%. And margin in Decision Analytics has improved to 40.4% in the second quarter. The benefit of the earn-out liability adjustment which was all reflected in Decision Analytics was offset by increased salaries and option expense. Additionally, the margin was adversely impacted by 2.8% by the new acquisition in the second quarter. Our healthcare, loss quantification and weather analytics businesses led to improvement in the underlying margin in the quarter. Our interest expense was up a little more than $6 million versus 2010, as we increased our borrowings to fund acquisitions and share repurchases. Also, in the quarter, we closed on a new 10-year $450 million bond offering, which was at a fixed rate of 5.8%. We used the proceeds from the bond to pay down the full $295 million outstanding on our revolving bank debt, which remains available for re-borrowing, and the remaining cash of approximately $150 million was used to fund the Bloodhound acquisition, and we pay a maturing private placement. We’re very pleased to have tapped the market for long-term capital at historically low rates. We ended second quarter with $90 million of our $600 million revolving credit drawn. Our reported effective tax rate was 39.9% for the quarter. For 2011, we continue to expect our tax rate will be between 40% and 41%. Coming down to the net income line, we focus on adjusted net income line, a non-GAAP measure, which we define in the current period as net income plus acquisition-related amortization expense less the income tax effect on that amortization. Our adjusted net income increased 13.4% to $70.9 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.41 for second quarter 2011, an increase of 24.2%. The average diluted share count was a 174.6 million in the quarter; and on June 30, 2011 our diluted share count was 172.8 million shares. We were active in the quarter with our repurchase program, purchasing approximately 4.3 million shares. Turning to our balance sheet, as of June 30, our cash and cash equivalents were about $52 million. Total debt, both short-term and long-term, totaled just north of $1 billion at June 30, up about $200 million from the first quarter, reflecting our acquisitions totaling approximately $141 million as well as our share repurchases of a $144 million, partially offset by cash flow from operations Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was about 1.89 times debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA at year-end, well within our covenant levels of 3 times in approaching our target debt leverage of about 2 times. Our debt capacity is about $500 million even after executing our acquisitions and our 2Q share repurchases. Our capacity will continue to grow with our free cash flow generation and as we add EBITDA of the acquired companies. At quarter-end, we had a 170.4 million remaining under a share repurchase authorization including the additional $150 million authorized by the Board in July. Free cash flow in the first half of 2011, which we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was a $152.7 million, a decrease of $3.5 million versus six months of 2010. Operating cash flow increased 8.1% year-to-date despite an incremental pension funding of about $3 million in the first half of 2011. As you remember, we discussed a major upgrade to our mainframe environment and related to software which increased CapEx in the first half. Our CapEx in the second quarter was lower as a percent of revenues than in the first quarter about 4.8%, but still a little higher than our historic levels as we’re making new investments from slight increases in client volumes and next-generation software solutions. We continued our strong free cash flow conversion of EBITDA which was 54% in the first half of 2011. With that, I’ll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Jim Kissane of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Jim Kissane – Bank of America:  Thanks and good job, guys. Was the improvement in mortgage primarily a function of resolving the bottleneck or do you see some of the stepped up volume from the GSEs and benefits of new contracts? And, maybe, just following on that, what’s a reasonable target for growth in mortgage this year? It sounds like you’re stepping off the 10% which very reasonable given what’s going on. But what’s the reasonable target?
Frank Coyne: Scott will take the first half of that and I’ll take the second.
Scott Stephenson:  It was really two – well, you kind of answered your own question, Jim. The GSEs have been stepping their demand for our services and the bottleneck issue associated with the mortgage insurers also subsided, and that was the effect that we’re reciting as you know kind of fourth quarter last year, first quarter this year. So those are really the two things that principally explained where we came out in the second quarter.
Frank Coyne:  Yes. And we’re obviously pleased with the second quarter 8% growth in the mortgage business, that’s a nice turnaround from the first quarter. But it is a 2% year-to-date, so it required an extraordinary performance in the second half to get to 10% for the year. The only thing I can say about mortgage at this time with certainty is that the uncertainty has increased as opposed to decrease since last we had spoke. But the value of our products is being demonstrated to our current customers and to new customers, so we like our business. But it would be I think a disservice to all of our stakeholders to try to predict what our growth is going to be for the rest of the year.
Jim Kissane – Bank of America: And then what kind of exposure do you have to these insurers to have some capital issues, is it material?
Frank Coyne:  Jim, I think in the short run – in the short-term, the impact of the mortgage insurers’ inability to write new business if it comes about could be a positive to us as opposed to a negative. And, over time, I think all – the policymakers believe that mortgage insurance is important to a healthy real estate market and we know a housing market and we know that’s important to our economy. So it’s hard to predict where that’s going to turnout, but we don’t expect an immediate impact.
Jim Kissane – Bank of America: And, Frank, in the press release, you sounded a positive tone around P&C premiums.
Frank Coyne: Right.
Jim Kissane – Bank of America: Can you take a stab of where you think growth in P&C premiums can trend over the cycle?
Frank Coyne:  Well I think Jim; I think it’s a continuation of what I observed last time. I think I said that we – at a minimum we had bottomed out. And I think what we’re seeing now is, is that by a line those that are in negative territory are less negative and there is more positive. So I think we’re going to continue to see the trends that we’re seeing in P&C which is positive for us.
Jim Kissane – Bank of America: Okay. If you don’t mind if I can get one last one. Just on D2 – D2Hawkeye and Strategic Analytics, it sounds like you have pretty aggressive earn-out targets, but would you say that those two companies are achieving your, let’s say, target for a 15% organic growth as I think about Decision Analytics?
Frank Coyne:  What we’re seeing in those companies is they’re achieving our expectations. Our earn-outs are designed to pay for extraordinary performance and within a certain timeframe. And those companies did not achieve the extraordinary performance, but we think they are in track to satisfy the predictions that we put into our model.
Jim Kissane – Bank of America: Okay. Thank you very much.
Frank Coyne: Yes sir.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Riggs of William Blair. Your line is open.
Robert Riggs – William Blair:  Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned you are going through the implementation process on some of your recent wins in healthcare. I’m assuming in the early straight stages that’s a bit of a drag on profitability. About how long does it take to get to breakeven and to a more full run rate for those healthcare wins?
Mark Anquillare: Yes, the implementation phase it varies little bit by customer. But the right range to think about there is sort of 60 days to 90 days and that’s once kind of all the parameters of the implementation have been described, and so we are in the middle of a great deal of implementation activity right now, and I think that you should expect therefore that. And your observation is right that the – all the effort proceeds the revenue. So you should expect that we’re going to be in that mode for substantially all of 2011. There are 50 plus implementations that we’re working on right now just in the payment and integrity space. And so that will predominate for the rest of the year. 60 days to 90 days.
Scott Stephenson: And just to give a little more color. I mean this is in a large part of the fraud side of things where we go as fast as customers want to go. In some cases they operate by state or regions and they have rollout plans that span years because of – they intend to kind of rollout in a disciplined way. So don’t think of it is the rollout takes that long, it’s just that’s how it’s planned and phased by our customers in many cases.
Robert Riggs – William Blair: Okay, great. And then could you just comment on how the new business pipeline for healthcare looks maybe versus six months ago? And any notable examples where having Bloodhound and HRP are bringing new deals to the table?
Frank Coyne: Absolutely. Yes so the pipeline has definitely improved. Basically we’re just standing up even taller as a provider of a lot of the solutions that a healthcare payer would require now that we have got payment integrity, we have got medical intelligence, we have got enterprise analytics. So when you actually look at the landscape of healthcare data analytic vendors, we actually have a broader portfolio than many of – many of the others. So that positioning is helping us for getting additional attention. With respect to the integration, we have live examples of customers who have observed that the range of things that we can do in payment and integrity all the way from pre-adjudication to the backend of the process has actually caused them to ask us to effectively integrate our solutions that on their behalf and it has led to some pretty substantial expansion of some of our largest relationships inside a healthcare. So the early returns are very good on what we have done.
Robert Riggs – William Blair: Great, thank you. Nice results.
Frank Coyne: Thank you.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Boyer of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo:  Hi, thanks. I think Frank from your comments, it seems like you’re still expecting margins to be up year-over-year excluding the impact of acquisitions. Is that correct?
Frank Coyne: Yes.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo: And then, is it your expectation for organic revenue growth to continue to accelerate into the back half of the year, yet a nice pickup this quarter over the first quarter that you talked and you called that out last quarter?
Mark Anquillare:  I’ll take that real quick. I think we talked about the organic growth accelerating from first quarter. Obviously mortgage does factor into that. But generally we do see some acceleration in the latter part of the year adjusted for some days and things like that from a transactional perspective that do affect us.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo: Okay. Then, within your healthcare portfolio products, could you just give us a sense of the type of organic growth or the pace of it expanding is it pretty much been stabled or slowing at all?
Frank Coyne: Yes. It’s – again we certainly think that the profile of organic growth for our business is improving. There is a lead time issue with respect to some of the implementations and the pipeline is getting stronger very quickly. So kind of when all of that – when all of that converges to actually goose the organic revenue growth rate is a little bit hard to predict, but it definitely is moving in the right direction.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo: Okay. I think you just said 2011 expect you have an implementations in 2012, I guess maybe something more a revenue.
Frank Coyne: We’ll get the benefit from the ’11 implementations that we’re driving.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo: Okay, great. And then, Mark, is there anything in the back half of the year we should be aware of as far as modeling?
Mark Anquillare: I don’t think there is anything material. I think – we think of days from an expense perspective as an example. Second quarter had an extra day from first quarter. And I believe that if were to look at the back half, we would see another day or two in the second half relative to the first. I think you’re also aware of the option expense that accelerate investing that we did experience in the second quarter, kind of dissipates a bit in the third and fourth quarter. Everything else is just kind of investment in adding any – adding bodies to kind of support growth as we progress through the year.
Eric Boyer – Wells Fargo: All right, thanks a lot.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Meltz of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan:  Thank you. A couple of questions for you. Just the last guy – sorry for guy – the last analyst asked about an organic revenue acceleration. Mark do you – just to clarify your expecting acceleration versus the nine you did in Q2 or the eight you did in the first half, what’s the reference point, and the answer might be both, but I just want to be clear on that.
Mark Anquillare:  Sure. I think what we are seeing is 6.6 in the first quarter, the 8.8 in the second which is about 7.7 overall. That – we have limited visibility on mortgage from the standpoint of pinpoint. I think that number for the rest of the year I think it feels about right. That’s – I’m not sure we have a greater visibility with regard to organic growth.
Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan: So you think that 8 is a run rate is what you’re saying.
Mark Anquillare: Yes, as I said, I’m not going to get into the specifics. I think you asked – I think the question was whether we like to ramp whether we saw the expect – we expect organic growth to continue, we like where we are year-to-date. I mean that’s the direct comment.
Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan: So you don’t – we shouldn’t be expecting an acceleration from the 9 in Q2.
Mark Anquillare: Not off the 2Q. I think we were – we were talking – I was talking about from a year-to-date perspective.
Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan: Okay, okay. And then the question about mortgage, your – just to be clear, I know you don’t have the visibility you’d like, but you do expected to grow for the year.
Frank Coyne: Well, we don’t have the visibility we’d like, but – and I’ll tell you we spend a lot of time with our customers obviously, but an extraordinary amount of time whether the customers are trying to map out where they’re going. And what we’ve learned is they cannot predict where they’re going. So it’s very difficult for us to say what’s going to happen there in the mortgage business and that’s – it gets to the question that you were just asking Mark, the organic growth is impacted by our mortgage business. But it is 10% of our business and we’ve got a lot of confidence around the other 90%.
Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan: Okay. And so to your question to Jim’s – or your answer to Jim’s question where you said the mortgage insurer that’s asked for the capital waive likely won’t hurt you. Is that – that’s just implying that they are not a large customer of yours, is that what you’re saying?
Mark Anquillare:  No. What it really is implying that the services that we provide for them right whether they’re writing new business or not or still a valuable services that will continue and may even increase.
Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan:  Okay.
Frank Coyne: What we do for them Michael is more related to their existing book than the book that they’re building at any given moment. So we’re worked – we are working with them on issues that are currently there inside of mortgage insurance that they originated some point in the past. Yes, thanks for that clarification.
Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan: Yes. And then – and so your point on mortgage that new originations are weak, they’ve been weak all year and that’s the uncertainty rather than a new wrinkle on the mortgage insurers side.
Frank Coyne:  Yes. I think that certainly is our point currently, but the entire environment around mortgage and even the pressure on the originators and the banks on how they deal with their delinquencies is – it has an impact on timing, et cetera as to how quickly they may get turned over for – to us for auditing works. So there is a lot of moving parts there. But, yes, even though originations are down say 20%, our business is not – our business for originators is not down 20%. I mean we’re gaining new – we’re gaining new customers, we’re writing – we’re developing new products, our value proposition is strong. So though we’re going to go through a period of time with some bumpiness, we think it’s a very good business.
Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan: Okay. And then my final question, I think with the recent acquisitions your pro forma, say roughly $100 million of healthcare revenues, can you just – given the – just talk a little bit about the mix. I mean how do you – I know – I’m not asking about fraud versus loss prevention, but if you think about it, I don’t know how you want to describe it, payment integrity versus benchmarking versus fraud or – or what buckets, how should we think about the buckets as to what your portfolio is right now?
Scott Stephenson: I think we – we just think of the frontend which is the loss protection side of healthcare being the combination of what has historically have been our operations that operate out of Waltham, it’s a Massachusetts based business that we’ve had for sometime, and HRP is more closely aligned with that side of the business. Separate and apart from that, we’ve talked about HCI which is our healthcare insights business which is on the fraud side of things, that’s being reporting fraud and fraud protection. And Bloodhound are too on the payment and integrity that claims editing business is probably more aligned with that backend and that [inaudible] inside of our themes, inside of Decision Analytics.
Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan: And so frontend versus backend, what would be the rough revenue split?
Mark Anquillare: Yes. I think we’ve given you the HRP is in that – on an annual basis is between 20 –
Frank Coyne: 15.
Mark Anquillare: 15 and 20. We’ve also said that HRP is in that – excuse me, Bloodhound is in that $10 million range from backend. It’s about equally rated today and that’s the best way to describe it. Probably a little bit more on the frontend I think. Probably maybe 60/40.
Michael Meltz – J.P. Morgan: Okay. Okay, thank you for your time.
Mark Anquillare: Sure.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Kelly Flynn of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Kelly Flynn – Credit Suisse:  Thanks. A couple of questions. Well, I think you guys mentioned weather benefits during the quarter. Can you just give a little more detail on I guess quantifying that as possible and also just describing what went on and then how does that relate to how you think about the organic growth rate over the next couple of quarters, because exactly you’re using for flattening out or slowdown next quarter?
Mark Anquillare: Well, let me describe where it comes in. Inside loss quantifications, specifically the Xactware business is a piece of the business where people exceed in the most part minimums on volumes or claims coming through our tools. We do charge per transaction. So there was some severe storms that hit in the quarter and did drive revenue inside of the loss quantification. Typically, storm activity takes place in that third and fourth quarter, so this was I wouldn’t say unusual but were heavier than usual, and that that did help us in the quarter. It’s a little difficult to estimate and predict storm activity into the future. I think third quarter and fourth quarter of 2010 were about average, I don’t think there was anything out of the ordinary so. And it’s tough to predict what will happen in 2011 going forward. But, hopefully, I think that helps you understand little bit about the nature of those revenues.
Frank Coyne: But we’re not assuming any significant climatic instability in our organic growth numbers.
Mark Anquillare: Right.
Kelly Flynn – Credit Suisse: Can you probably – can you quantify the impact on the organic growth for the quarter?
Mark Anquillare: Yes. I mean it’s difficult to tell relative to last year. You know that it was probably a couple million dollars of revenue.
Kelly Flynn – Credit Suisse: Okay. All right, that’s helpful. And then, again switching gears to go back to the mortgage business, I know that you’ve gotten a lot of questions about organic growth expectations. But I just – I want to clarify the – are you seeing anything and particularly related to the capital extension issue you mentioned that makes you fairly confident that the mortgage growth rate will decelerate over the next couple of quarters or are you just saying so far so good, but we are just calling out the uncertainty?
Frank Coyne: It’s more the latter that we’re calling out, which is, we’re observing the same macro environment that you are and we’re observing our own knowledge based on dealing with our customers that their plans change on – pretty depending on circumstances and so the predictability is very difficult.
Kelly Flynn – Credit Suisse: Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.
Frank Coyne: You’re welcome.
Mark Anquillare: Sure.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Warmington of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Bill Warmington – Raymond James:  Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about what you are seeing in the way of M&A opportunities and whether you plan on you think pursuing them aggressively given that you read about 1.9 times gross debt to EBITDA, you have about 2 times target, although of course you could go up to 3 times. But what is your appetite for that now?
Frank Coyne: Very high. Mark was referencing our dry powder before, Bill, and that is a fact about our business. There are assets out there that fit our aspirations in terms of where we want to take our business thinking particularly about the healthcare and supply chain domains, those are likely to be the two places where the greatest amount of acquisition activity occurs, and we’re seeing good assets to fit where we’re trying to get to. Between the dry power and the ability to be flexible in the moment, we are very focused on the M&A agenda going forward.
Bill Warmington – Raymond James: Okay. And then, there were some references in the opening remarks to benefits in the insurance side from cross-selling. Just want to know if I could ask you to expand on that a little bit.
Frank Coyne: Well, I mean the cross-selling is a committed agenda on our part. And, basically, we are doing a variety of things to support the cross-sell. We take a holistic view of a customer, our sales teams are incentivized to try to get our whole suite sold into the accounts. We have executive ownership of our largest accounts. And, basically, if you take a look at that strong organic growth in the insurance part of Decision Analytics, most of that is the effect of cross-selling into the existing Risk Assessment customer base. So it’s a high focus, and to achieve that double-digit organic growth in Decision Analytics, that’s essentially the cross-selling.
Bill Warmington – Raymond James: Okay. And then, I wanted to ask also about risk analyzer and how that stands in the regulatory process and whether it’s too early to start talking about revenue generation for that in 2012?
Frank Coyne:  It’s probably a little early to talk about that, but just to note a couple of things, we’re up to 28 approvals on risk analyzer for personal auto. Again, I think that’s kind of a – sort of a threshold for us will be when we are up to around 40, 45. Most of the premium across the country is embraced in the analytic. We’ve also started to get approvals on our risk analyzer for homeowners when where we’ve got – we’ve – we’re moved in two states, and we actually now stand really for the first time having made sales of the three lines that we have modeled. We’ve now made – we’ve now got sales into lot – real customers for written for personal auto, for homeowners, and for commercial auto. So that’s a bit of a milestone in the build. But we’re still a bit – our value provision is tied strongly to the notion that our analytic is industrial strength and has been approved by the regulators. And, obviously, we are still in process on that. But there is a lot of interest in the marketplace. And as we get more regulatory approvals, we just think that the result will follow. But it’s – we can’t predict how quickly the state departments of insurance will respond, that’s the X factor here.
Bill Warmington – Raymond James: Excellent. And thank you for the insight.
Frank Coyne: You’re welcome.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Suzanne Stein of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley:  Hi. You touched on the government’s impact. Can you just maybe quantify what percent of your revenues is exposed to the government and has there been notable change in this part of your business?
Frank Coyne: Yes. Less than 3% of our revenue is government contracts. And, no, there has not been any notable in the current contracts that we have with government. We believe based on information that they’re fully funded and so we don’t really expect any short-term issues.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then in healthcare analytics, one of the – I guess a large competitor announced its intention to exit because it doesn’t think it can scale the business. Why do you think you can and have you seen any change in asset prices helped your acquisitions?
Frank Coyne: In reverse order, the prices for healthcare acquisitions have always been high relative to sort of what we see across all the vertical markets that we’re in. I wouldn’t say that there has been any change there, but they’ve always been premium priced assets. And I think that – I would point to two things about our position. One is we do have a distinctive intellectual property operating inside of our business whether it’s on the payment integrity side with the only solution that allows you to get after the claims on a pre-adjudicated basis to our grouping methodology which stands inside of our medical intelligence analytics, the competitor that you’re referencing I just don’t think could make either of those claims. And then, secondly, the healthcare is a place where it’s actually good to be a newer competitor. The value of incumbency is high in a lot of the things we do, but it’s much less so in the healthcare space, because customers are not only opened to, they’re actually seeking new solutions. So to be kind of an old form competitor with a big embedded base and a lot of investment in sort of yesterday’s methods is actually kind of a tough place to be. And that’s not our situation.
Suzanne Stein – Morgan Stanley: Great, okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Frank Coyne: You bet.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Otis of KBW. Your line is open.
Matt Otis – KBW:  Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess not to believe the mortgage side of the business, but just a couple from that side. There has been some talking about consolidation in the mortgage insurance sector. Is that something since you guys look at the book of business, is that something that it could actually provide upside for you as well as if there was consolidation and some of the market players were looking at other companies from what’s in their current book of business?
Frank Coyne: The most likely impact would be positive.
Matt Otis – KBW: Okay, fair enough. I guess, simple question on the mortgage side. Can you give maybe a little bit of color on what percentage of mortgage goes directly to the mortgage insurers?
Mark Anquillare:  I think we’ve always talked about frontend and backend. So the frontend audit, that presents good chunk of our business, it’s probably about 67% these days.
Matt Otis – KBW: Okay.
Frank Coyne: That is not all mortgage insurers.
Mark Anquillare: That is not all mortgage insurers, yes, in place.
Matt Otis – KBW: Right, right. And then, I think there was mention of, I know you were talking about from an M&A standpoint healthcare and supply chain being priorities, but I thought I heard you say that all vertical markets would be considered. Is that inclusive of mortgage?
Frank Coyne: It is, although, which means that the Sonar is banging away in all of the markets that we serve. I would just tell you that I just don’t think that there are a lot of distinctive assets that would provides the kind of reliable growth that we’re looking for so. And actually our portfolio of solutions is relatively more complete and the things that aren’t there, Matt, we would really be looking more to build than to buy. But, yes, we bang away, the Sonar bangs away in all cases. I would also tell you that part of the thought process around mortgage is that I mean fundamentally we’re dealing with financial services organizations, and one of the things that is in the thought process is other lines of business that our customers are engaged in, and whether and how we could do business with them there. So if you’re defining it as mortgage narrowly, I think we actually cover the waterfront reasonably well. But when we extend out to a financial services definition, then the M&A opportunities actually open up a bit.
Matt Otis – KBW: Okay, great. And then, just lastly, I think I don’t know if you did earlier, but maybe Frank starts on the PMC pricing going forward in the back half of the year and into 2012.
Frank Coyne: Yes. I think it was probably Jim Kissane who had asked me early on. As I had observed in the past that I thought the market was bottoming out and beginning to turn in certain lines and we’re now seeing that trend, the trend is coming through in various survey and reports from various companies and we expect to continue to see that. And it could be accelerated by various factors. One is a continuation of climatic instability in the second half of the year which is normally when we see it if we have an active hurricane season and if inflation brings its head up then that will clearly have an impact.
Matt Otis – KBW: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.
Frank Coyne: Yes sir.
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.
James Friedman – Susquehanna:  Hi. I had a couple of model related questions. For the SG&A, it was up about 200 basis points. How much of that increase is due to the acquisition impact versus the increased compensation?
Mark Anquillare: So the – let’s talk about the piece parts. First of all I will highlight that we talked about the stock option expenses specifically accelerate investing, so that – a chunk of that does affect the SG&A side of things. From a salary increase perspective to answer your question directly, that’s more across the board. It’s kind of inflationary in every place. I think of that 3.5% to 4.5% range. And inside SG&A to yield, you’ll have some cost associated with the acquisitions if you think about they’re in the acquisitions but I believe cost transaction fees that no longer are capitalized inside of the purchase accounting. So we need to expense that immediately and we saw some of that in the second quarter in the SG&A side of things. Last item, I did mention earlier there was an extra expensed day in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. So if you’re doing a comparison not to last year but a comparison first quarter that is another element of it.
James Friedman – Susquehanna: That’s helpful, thank you. And then also related to the model as we go forward, what should we think about the impact to the recent acquisitions relative to the margins in the – the margins in the second half and into next year?
Mark Anquillare: Well, I think we – just trying to give you a little – let me give you some more visibility on HRP which is probably the number one [ph], Scott mentioned the $15 million to $20 million of revenue. You are going to see in the world of HRP they do have the lower margins think of 20s. Over time, we would expect that to ramp. But that will have some decrement on the margins within DA for the remainder of the year. We think it’s pretty nominal, but it’s something you would want to consider.
James Friedman – Susquehanna: Got it. Thank you very much.
Frank Coyne: Yes sir.
Operator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions).
Frank Coyne: All right, well, I want to thank everyone for joining us in the call of this morning and for your continued interest and for the quality of your questions, and looking forward to visiting with you again next quarter.
Operator:  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.
