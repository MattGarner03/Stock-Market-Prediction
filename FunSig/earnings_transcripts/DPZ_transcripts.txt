===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-28 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Domino's Pizza's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Greg Lemenchick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. Today's call will begin with our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner, followed by our Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. The call will conclude with a Q&A session. The forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q, both of which are available on our IR website, also apply to our comments on the call today. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. This morning's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. We want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such, we encourage you to ask one question only. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Russell.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. As I reflect on the first quarter, I'm proud of how our team effectively executed our Hungry for MORE strategy. Against the backdrop of consumer and industry headwinds, we drove market share gains across both our US and international businesses. Sustained market share growth reflects the company's ability to control what's under its control, a key to long-term success. Our team is achieving what we set out to do when we introduced Hungry for MORE late in 2023. When you look at our accomplishments over the last year-and-a-half with insight into some of the unlocks for the remainder of 2025, you can see how our Hungry for MORE strategic pillars are working together to set us up to drive more sales, more stores and more profits over the long-term. The M in Hungry for MORE stands for most delicious food. We will continue to drive deliciousness with at least two new products every year. In early March, we added arguably the biggest new menu item in our history, Parmesan Stuffed Crust pizza. This launch is the epitome of what we mean when we talk about our "innovation with intent" approach. There's a clear purpose behind any product we bring to market, and stuffed crust pizza is one of our best examples. We went from this being the largest gap in our pizza portfolio to having what we believe is the best stuffed crust product in the industry. While timing of the launch meant stuffed crust didn't have a meaningful impact on Q1, we couldn't be happier with how the launch has gone so far. To date, customer satisfaction scores have been very good, and we've also seen a high mix of orders coming with a stuffed crust pizza. Although it's still early, performance has been tracking to our expectations. We're excited about the impact this product will have not only this year, but as a market share driver for years to come. Prior to this year, the operational complexity of stuffed crust and our high volumes kept stuffed crust off our menu in the US. Launching an innovation like this required us to lean into our second strategic pillar, operational excellence. Innovation with intent requires operations with intent. On our Q4 call, I talked about the improvements in our service, driven by significant training programs implemented by our operators and franchisees over the last couple of years. These programs work together with improvements in our Dom.OS technology to make Parmesan Stuffed Crust a reality. Domino's stores are doing an incredible job executing this product. I want to thank our franchisees and operations teams for their continued effort to achieve operational excellence. This remains a point of difference for Domino's. Our third Hungry for MORE pillar is renowned value. This has been a key strength for Domino's. We're driving renowned value through national promotions, Domino's Rewards and by growing on aggregator platforms. In the first quarter, we had several value-driving initiatives such as our Best Deal Ever promotion that we believe broke through industry clutter. We have a strong slate of initiatives primed and ready to go for the rest of the year as we will continue to give customers what they want, which is more value in this challenging economic environment. While providing value through our own channel is one part of our renowned value barbell strategy, tapping into the aggregator marketplace for pizza delivery is the other. We recently announced a partnership with DoorDash, the largest aggregator in the US. We began piloting in a small number of stores and are expecting to commence our national launch in May. We expect this rollout to be complete by the end of the second quarter with a meaningful impact from this new partnership anticipated in the back half of the year. So, in the second half of 2025 and beyond, we'll be competing on the biggest aggregator platform in the US, with one of the biggest pizza crust types in our industry, two things we could not have said only a few months ago. I wanted to quickly touch on our expectations around incrementality for DoorDash. We're going to need to learn and provide updates on this, but our initial expectations are that it will be approximately 50% incremental. And that would be our expectations for aggregators as we move forward now that we're on multiple platforms. Everything we do at Domino's is enhanced by our best-in-class franchisees. We also see this pillar as our responsibility to be a best-in-class franchisor. In the first quarter, we made some changes to our organizational structure, which you may have seen with the announcement we put out in March, where we elevated Joe Jordan to Chief Operating Officer and promoted Weiking Ng to Head of Domino's International. We also made changes below the executive level for a faster, more efficient structure that aligns with our Hungry for MORE strategy. Our focus at simplify included the difficult decision to eliminate certain roles and Sandeep will share some additional color on the financial implications. Moving forward, we believe this new structure will allow us to be quicker to market and we will continue to prioritize investments that have the greatest impact on our customers, franchisees and the brand. In summary, we are laser-focused on delivering against our Hungry for MORE goals. I believe this will enable Domino's to capture additional market share gains in 2025 and beyond. And this will be how we drive best-in-class results and long-term value creation for our franchisees and shareholders. I'll now hand the call over to Sandeep.
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter financial results continued to be impacted by a challenging macro backdrop. And despite that, we delivered operating profit that was in line with our expectations. Income from operations increased 1.4% in Q1, excluding the impact of foreign currency. This increase was primarily due to gross margin dollar growth within supply chain, as well as higher international franchise royalties and fees. This increase was partially offset by higher G&A, primarily related to severance expenses, driven by the organizational realignment Russell noted earlier. Excluding the approximately $5 million impact of these expenses, our income from operations would have increased 3.6%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 4.7% in the first quarter, primarily due to positive international comps and global net store growth compared to a year ago. In Q1, retail sales grew by 1.3% in the US, primarily driven by net store growth. This growth paced ahead of the QSR pizza category, which was roughly flat to start the year. Same store sales declined 0.5%, which was slightly below our expectations. We benefited from 1.8% of pricing, which was inclusive of high-single-digits in California. This was more than offset by negative traffic and a slight decline in our mix due to a higher carryout business that carries a lower ticket than delivery. Our carryout business comps were up 1%, while delivery was down 1.5% in the quarter. Our delivery business continues to be impacted by macro pressures that are impacting the low-income consumer. Shifting to US unit count, we added 17 net new stores, bringing our US system store count to 7,031. International retail sales grew 8.2%, excluding the impact of foreign currency in the quarter. This was driven by net store growth over the last year and same store sales that came in ahead of our expectations at 3.7%. In the quarter, we saw strength in Asia that was due to strong comps in India and in our Americas region, which was driven by Canada. Net stores were down by 25 in Q1 and this was primarily coming from closures from Domino's Pizza Enterprises, DPE, which is our master franchisee based out of Australia. DPE previously announced that they expected to close 200-plus underperforming stores, primarily in Japan, and substantially all of those closures took place in the quarter. Moving to capital allocation, we repurchased approximately 115,000 shares at an average price of $434 for a total of $50 million in the first quarter. As of the end of Q1, we had approximately $764 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Now, turning to our outlook for 2025, we continue to believe that global retail sales growth should be generally in line with 2024. As part of that, we expect the following. First, we continue to expect our US comp to be 3%, and that it will be lower in the first half compared to the back half due to the timing of our initiatives. In the event that macro pressures persist, it could put pressure on achieving this number. Second, we continue to expect 1% to 2% international same store sales growth as there continues to be macro and geopolitical pressures that exist around the globe and we believe this could impact our business. We expect operating profit growth of approximately 8% excluding the impact of currency and approximately $5 million in severance expenses related to our organizational realignment. A couple of points of additional color. While we are expecting some savings as a result of the organizational changes that have been made, we are planning to reinvest most of these savings back into the business. In our US business, we source most of our food products from within the country. So, we're not expecting tariffs to have a material impact on our operating profit. Thank you. We will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your question, please.
Danilo Gargiulo: Thank you. I was wondering if you can comment a bit on your statement of potential international geopolitical pressure impacting brands. So, specifically, are you starting to see any pockets of consumer weakness in international markets or international boycotts against US brands elevated specifically for Domino's? Thank you.
Sandeep Reddy: Hi, Danilo, this is Sandeep. Good morning. Yeah, so I think in terms of geopolitical pressure and risk that we see out there, it's more with what's been going on in the last few months. We want to be very careful and mindful that there's a lot of volatility from a geopolitical perspective. Then, there could be a potential downstream impact on demand, and that's incorporated in our guidance of 1% to 2% for the year, and that's really the meaning of the statement.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Thanks very much. Good morning. You talked about how you expect DoorDash and other third-party platforms to be about 50% incremental. Can you talk about what type of mix you do anticipate to come from DoorDash, maybe relative to what you saw with Uber Eats? So, maybe we can all start to think about how you are thinking about potential contribution to comps. Just trying to understand maybe what's required from the DoorDash launch in the second half to get to your guidance of 3% in the US.
Russell Weiner: Good morning, Brian. Yeah, right now, if you look at the DoorDash pizza sales business on their platform versus Uber, it's about 2x. So, we're not going to put out specific goals by quarter like we did with Uber. We were just starting with aggregators at the time. Think about the aggregator business now as part of our delivery business. As far as contribution, you should expect about 2x DoorDash from what we saw with Uber. And as Sandeep said in his remarks, we're really expecting this to be kind of the second half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your question, please. Q - David Tarantino Hi, good morning. My question is on the stuffed crust pizza platform. You mentioned it did not have much of an influence on the first quarter, but at the same time, you're pleased with what you're seeing and it's in line with expectations. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what that platform is doing relative to sales mix or what you're seeing in terms of the lift to the comps or anything else you could offer there. Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Thanks, David. Yeah, we were talking about as far as performance is we launched it with three weeks to go in Q1. So, it just -- it didn't have an oversized impact in Q1. What I can tell you is as we look back to the launch so far, we're really pleased with how things are going. Significant amount of orders are going out with stuffed crust pizza. The consumer feedback on the quality is really where we wanted it to be and our stores are performing very well from an ops standpoint. So, all in all, we're pleased and it's hitting our expectations. You'll recall, it's about 15% of mix of our competitors, and so, we'll see where that falls in for us, but that means it's a big opportunity. It's the biggest crust type we weren't in. So, we're very excited.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.
David Palmer: Thanks. Russell, just to follow-up on that, on the soft crust, you mentioned it's 15% of competitors. I would imagine you wouldn't be targeting that mix overnight, but sometimes we see new products or even have a honeymoon period where the trial is extremely high. So, I'm wondering what is your expectation. Any comments about the mix initially and the incrementality of that mix, and how you see that product perhaps evolving on those two scores?
Russell Weiner: Yeah, thanks, David. We have lawyers on the other end of the table poised to jump in front of me if I give any forward-looking information. But look, you talked about exactly what we look at with new product launch, especially one of this magnitude is, it's not just going to be the percent of mix, it's going to be the incrementality both in orders and in dollars. And as soon as we get more information on that and we want to look at repeat, we'll be able to give a better sense of what that looks like. I think, for me, what's important about stuffed crust in addition to how many stuffed crusts we're going to sell is when you think about our first pillar of most delicious food, it's not just about launching new products. It's about launching products to give a halo to the brand on deliciousness. And I think what we're going to see from stuffed crust is not only stuffed crust sales, but a nice halo to the brand on the deliciousness pillar.
Sandeep Reddy: And Dave, I'm just going to go back to, I think, a question that Brian asked earlier on DoorDash and now on stuff crust, and essentially all of the initiatives that we talked about in the February call and again, we're talking about them now on this call, all of this is incorporated in terms of our expectations in the 3% guide that we have on same store sales for the year and the back-end loaded comps reflect the timing of initiatives. So, it's all contemplated and that's there. While we don't want to get into specifics at this time in terms of where we are so far in the second quarter, just know that we know what our -- that assumptions are based on what we are seeing.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your question, please.
Dennis Geiger: Great. Thanks, guys. Sandeep or Russell, I wanted to follow-up on the comment, Sandeep, you just made on that US sales outlook and the reiterated 3% comp guide. Specifically, if any additional thoughts on key initiatives to accelerate and help you get there, you touched on stuff crust and DoorDash, of course, but just anything else on some of the other initiatives as we think about loyalty, maybe another new item coming, promotions, marketing calendar, just how impactful some of that can be and you expect it could be as you work through the year? Thank you.
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah. Thanks, Dennis. Every year, we go into the year strategically with the same intent to execute against Hungry for MORE. So, again, without giving too much forward-looking information, we can look through our guidance, which says two new products a year from a value standpoint, pretty much the same amount of Boost Weeks as we did prior year. What I get really excited about too is just the value that we're going to be bringing forward, the renowned value platform. We talked about in 2023 when we launched Hungry for MORE that we felt for a couple of years -- a few years that, this is really going to be a platform that was going to be important for all of QSR. And while QSR has been really kind of driven by price, what I think has been great about our value is that our value creates what I call talk value, it's not just a price point, it's things like carryout tips, it's emergency pizza, things that folks talk about. So, I can't get into the initiatives. What I can tell you is the strategy is an open book. And I think if you look at the last couple of years, what you'll see is, yeah, we don't tell you the initiatives in advance, but they absolutely fit with the strategy and that's going to continue.
Sandeep Reddy: And, Dennis, I'll just add, you mentioned loyalty specifically, and look, we've said before and we'll continue to say that it's a multiyear driver. It's been there -- that way in the past and we expect it to be that case over here as well. In particular, I think this new loyalty program is structured around the carryout customer, getting light users coming in and really those are going to be massive frequency builders for us as we go along. Literally, last year, we grew by 2.5 million active members in our loyalty database and we continue to see good traction from that. I think where we expect to see momentum is future sales from those acquired customers as staying loyal to our brand.
Russell Weiner: Yeah, I think that's important, Sandeep. The first loyalty program we introduced in 2015, we had that around for seven years and it was seven years of -- really seven-and-a-half years of really nice growth. And then, what we did when we updated it, we said, "Okay, what are the couple of things we need to do to make it even better?" We've had the price for points kind of lowered, so that really helped with carryout customers with their tickets lower. And we also really pushed to make sure that the program activated against lighter users. So, you used to have to buy six times and now you could buy as few as two times. So, it's important, and I say this because we've done it before to understand that things like loyalty are really a multiyear driver. Things like the aggregators, once we're on the aggregator platform, we intend to grow our business on that platform just like we grew our business outside the platforms. And so, it's really important to see certainly while we're leaning in here, these are drivers that are going to continue for years to come.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your question, please.
Peter Saleh: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the domestic unit growth. I think the prior guidance was 175 net stores in 2025. Just in the impact of tariffs on construction costs, can you guys give us a sense on what you're thinking there? And are you seeing any availability issues on some of the critical components that you need for unit development? Just trying to understand the confidence behind the domestic unit growth guidance given the tariff impact. Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah, Pete. Thanks for the question. Look, I mean, I think from a domestic unit growth guidance perspective, no change. We're expecting the 175 stores that we talked about on the last call. And frankly speaking, the more we actually went through the cycle of earnings in the fourth quarter, it was really apparent that the economics of our franchisees are best-in-class and the returns are really compelling for them. And we continue to drive market share to Russell's point earlier. The pipeline is very robust. The appetite from our franchisees is very good. And I think from a tariff perspective, if there is any impact, it should not be material enough for it to actually impact demand. And so, the enthusiasm that the franchisees have to continue to grow the stores is very strong and we are very supportive of what we need to do to make sure that we harness this growth.
Russell Weiner: Yeah, Pete, the pipeline for the US is better than it was at this point last year. So, we're very excited about what we've got in front of us.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. Your question, please.
Gregory Francfort: Hey, thanks for the question. Russell, maybe I'm curious, just on the aggregator platforms you've been on for a little over a year, what are you seeing from customers in terms of either frequency or average check size. I'm just curious how that customers behave now with some time versus customers who are coming through your other channels. Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. I think the biggest difference to me is more the group size. There's probably a little bit smaller group, maybe a single or one or two customers versus when folks go to our website, it's probably for a bigger party occasion. So, Greg, I think that probably would be the biggest piece. Obviously, this platform still is, even though the higher-income customers on it, it still is promotionally sensitive. The best deals for customers are still on dominos.com, but they are promotionally sensitive as well. So, I think the biggest thing I think would be that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your question, please.
Chris O'Cull: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Russell, the US ran the Best Deal Ever, I guess, for a significant amount of period -- significant number of weeks during the quarter. Just given the strength of that offer, I was hoping you could provide some more context around how it impacted your sales trends and maybe how it performed relative to the segment during the period?
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. And I'll give you a little background about the name of that Best Deal Ever. The team came in and showed Sandeep and I what the deal was and our reaction literally was, "Wow, that's the best deal ever." So, here you go, that's renaming research there, how we came up with it. I want to talk about the strategy of Best Deal Ever, because I don't think we spend enough time doing that. The insight for us is within the QSR industry right now, obviously, there have been couple of years of pricing taken. And so, what you're seeing with a lot of restaurants is they're dealing it back. But they're dealing it back really maybe not necessarily to things that folks want. Maybe you want the big item, but you can get the little item or the side item. So, other than the price being really good with Best Deal Ever, it was any crust, any topping, no limitations. And I think that to me other than just the price point was a big way of us leaning into customers and saying, "We hear what you want. You just don't want something that is low in price. You want something that's fair in price for what you want." And so, that was a big deal for us. I think that's a big category insight. It only ran for a few weeks and there are obviously headwinds for the remainder of the quarter. So, it's kind of hard to break that out. But what I can tell you is I'm really pleased with the performance and the statement that we made by doing it. On top of that, I'm really proud of our franchisees, because they leaned into this. I mean, the last time there was a close to a $10 any offer out there in pizza was a long time ago. And so, our franchisees -- it does two things. One, it talks to the confidence they have in the analytics from our team, but also it talks to the profitability they have and their ability to lean in probably when other folks can't. And that -- we're going to have to sustainably lean in for a while there. And I think this is a great example to prove that our franchisees are up for it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Sara Senatore: Thank you. I wanted to ask, I think, about a comment that Sandeep made with respect to the US outlook, and just that if macro pressure persists, that would have implications for that same store sales number. I guess, I have struggled a little bit with trying to figure out what's happened in the first quarter just because there's been weather and calendar shifts and I think even something like Valentine's Day would affect you. And so, to the extent that the guide kind of requires an acceleration in comp, I'm just trying to understand what it is that you're seeing in the macro backdrop if it's softer than it was at the end of last year. And does that require an improvement from here to hit that 3%? And I guess, what are you looking at to get that? Because, again, some of the macro data actually look pretty, I would say, solitary to me. So, any kind of insight into that comment and kind of what the underpinning expectations might be?
Russell Weiner: Yeah, Sara, I'll start off, and then, I'll kick it off to Sandeep. I think part of it was just looking at the calendarization we had for the year. And so, we knew our initiatives were a little bit kind of back-half loaded, and that's part and parcel of it. And then, also, what we're overlapping in Q1, if you remember last year, in Q1, we were coming in strong with loyalty. We had brought back carryout special for the first time. So, a lot of this was really kind of the calendarization of how things were going to fall and how we think we're going to get to that 3% in US.
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah. And I think Russell is exactly right, and really the first quarter came in pretty much at our expectations, maybe a little bit off, but we knew the macro was going to be tough and we expect the macro to be tough this year. But what we're actually saying is, if there's a further deceleration of the macro environment that could put pressure on the business. And I think that's really what we are pointing out over here. But other than that, I think the starting point is it's a tough macro and that's how we built our budget.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. And I would just add and I think kind of common sense here, when we talk about those macro headwinds, this is not Domino's specific. We think these are QSR headwinds, which is why in addition to hitting our algorithm, what we were happy for the year on US same store sales of 3%, while Q1 wasn't what I had hoped it would be, we still grew market share, right? And so, at times where maybe there are extra headwinds, if you're continuing to grow market share, it gives you a sense of when things open up, you're going to continue to grow that market share and then the QSR category grows and their benefits. So, when Sandeep is talking macros, these are not ones that are specifically the Domino's. And I would argue, we're probably in a better space better capability to compete than many others within those macros.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Wanted to ask, you talked about 50% incrementality now for just third-party delivery in general. As you prepare to launch DoorDash, how do you ensure this doesn't dent the incrementality of Uber? If it were to essentially, is this going to be challenging to get to that 3% comp for the full year?
Russell Weiner: Yeah, Andrew, it's -- this is now -- all of this is encompassed in our overall delivery business and we want to be where customers are. And so, if a customer decides -- I know they love Domino's Pizza, but now that we're going to be on both of these big platforms, I don't think the decision to go on a DoorDash or an Uber is going to be based on Domino's, it's going to be based really on their loyalty to that platform. Again, we're going to try to do everything we can to bring them back to Domino's. But if they want to buy us on DoorDash, that's because of their natural behavior on that platform. And I don't really think there's anything we can do here, which is why we're okay. That's why we've priced the way we have and that's why really our strategy for aggregators has been to meet customers where they are, whichever app they're on.
Sandeep Reddy: And Andrew, I'll just add on. I think we've mentioned this in the last call, but I want to come back to this. We are looking at our delivery business and our delivery business includes our own channel, it includes the aggregator platforms. And as we look at the business overall, we're just going to talk about it very holistically. I think last year, we gave a mix, because it was first year on Uber and we wanted to actually give that visibility. But I think as we move forward this year, we're not going to be talking about mix. We're going to be talking about our overall delivery business and we're telling you strategically what aggregators are coming onto the platforms, just so you know what's coming in, but I think overall delivery business is how I would analyze us.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your question, please.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. The question is on the overall delivery same store sales and especially in the context of franchisees beyond '25 that do have a plan to put more assets in the ground to basically serve more delivery customers even if delivery overall has been relatively choppy over the past couple of years. So, I just wanted to get your sense, maybe there's been some evolution of how franchisees think about putting more new assets in the work -- in the ground, excuse me, especially if new stores are largely getting their delivery sales at least initially from other nearby outlets.
Russell Weiner: Yeah, good morning, John. The interesting thing when you think about the store growth in the US, about two-thirds of the stores we have to build are going to be splits, about one-third are going to be green space. And the interesting thing, one would think, I know Sandeep and I had this argument when he first started and now Sandeep, now he's seen the way and he's preaching on high to everybody. The interesting thing is when we split a store, 80% of the carryout customers are incremental. So, even though you're talking about the same kind of polygon for the store, customers just like delivery drivers don't want to drive as far to pick up their pizza. So, believe it or not, the impetus in a store split has nothing to do with delivery, well, not nothing, but a lot to do with carryout. And now, our carryout volumes are such that the store essentially pays for itself, it breaks even from carryout. Then is when the delivery business starts to become significant, because what happens is you just like customers get closer to your store, your delivery customers -- your delivery drivers get closer to your customers. And so, their route times are shorter, they're more efficient, they're more predictable. So, you get hot predictable deliveries, which we know that's what drives reorder, tips are higher. And so, delivery actually gets more efficient. But the reason for the split, first off, is carryout. We've also talked about -- obviously, you've seen our carryout business grow, but our carryout share isn't where our delivery share is. And so, I still think there's lots for us to go there and a lot of that is going to be due to -- is going to happen from store growth.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christine Cho from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Christine Cho: Thank you. So, I think you've called out Canada as a region of strength in the quarter. Has that trend sustained throughout the quarter, or have you seen any meaningful shift through the quarter? And my real question is with most of DPE plant closures largely behind and you're seeing some improvement in the international markets in first quarter, do you think there's a room or path to international unit growth, reacceleration in the next few years? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: I'll take the Canada one. I'll have Sandeep talk to the international store algorithm. We're really proud of what they're doing up in Canada now. I think what you're seeing is they've really embraced Hungry for MORE. Some of the drivers there in the first quarter for them were ones that we're doing here in the States, renowned value being a big piece of it, launching with aggregators being a big piece of it. Obviously, now this gets into a little bit Q2, but they've launched the stuffed crust pizza. And so, what Canada is proving that we think more and more of our international master franchisees are going to recognize is that Hungry for MORE really is a global strategy that kind of impact positively in all of our markets. Do you want to talk about store count?
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah. So, I think, on the store counts, like, we were expecting the DPE closures that happened in Q1. I think DPE themselves have signaled that they were expecting to have about 200-odd stores closing in Q1 and mostly from Japan, which happened. But I think what's been pretty consistent all along and in the more recent quarters is very strong trends in India and Japan, and that has continued to be the case. Then, I think outside of DPE, India, Japan, all of the markets broadly are tracking to our initial expectations. So, things are very healthy. And frankly, when we looked at the '24 profitability, the paybacks still were pretty good when they looked at all the international markets across the board. So, we feel pretty good on everything except for the Domino's Pizza Enterprises pressures that they were -- that they're working through. As we said, we think that the DPE closure should be mostly behind us as we get into 2026. But I think their CEO and their team are working on the opening plan to make sure that whatever stores they do open are sustainably profitable stores, so that we don't have to go down this path again and having to close stores that are unprofitable stores. So that's kind of where we are. We sit in the wait-and-see mode. I think we'll have to get through this year and see how DPE makes updates to the algorithm.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you very much. So, I just wanted to clarify and then I have a question on carryout, but the clarification is on 3P incrementality. Do you expect incrementality of 50% now is you're Domino's Direct customers, or is the lower incrementality a function of multiple partnerships? And then, my actual question is on the carryout comp. So, a bit of a deceleration to 1% in the quarter and I know there's a lot of noise just broadly in the industry. You guys didn't talk about softness over the last few quarters primarily with 1P delivery. So, can you just expand on what you're seeing with the carryout customer this quarter relative to recent quarters? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yeah, Lauren, you answered your own first question, so we'll give you that second question as well. But yeah, absolutely, once we're going on more aggregator platforms, that just brings -- especially DoorDash, which is 2x Uber as far as pizza orders, that's what's driving the incrementality closer to 50%. And then, on the carryout business, it was a little bit of what I was talking about earlier. It was more due to kind of the timing of the calendar. So, if you think about last year, in Q1, we brought back, hadn't done it for a long time, carryout special. And so, we were lapping that and we were lapping really part of the introduction of our new loyalty program that came in and leaned really hard into carryout customers. So, I think a lot of that was really more due to timing and calendarization than it was anything specific to carryout. We expect to grow both carryout and delivery businesses this year.
Sandeep Reddy: And Lauren, I'll go back to something I said on the Q4 call. As we look at the 3% comp, we expect it to come pretty roughly equivalently from delivery and carryout. So, this was not hugely different from our expectations in terms of the split of comp that we saw in the first quarter. And I think with DoorDash now announced, obviously, that's going to be a bit of a tailwind on delivery as we get through the year. And so, overall for the year, that's our expectations.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower from Citi. Your question, please.
Jon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Clarification, I hate to beat a dead horse, and then a question. On the Dash, just to make sure we don't come away with the wrong expectation for Dash. So, 2x the size, 50% incremental, so 3% contribution run rate is the way we should think about that. That's the clarification. Then, the question is, on the stuffed crust pizza, I know it only came out in a medium size and I believe that's the only size that's available today. Can you speak to why that's the case and if and when you plan on expanding to different sizes across the system in the US?
Sandeep Reddy: So, I think, I'll talk first about the size and the modeling question that you had. Correct. Yeah, it's 2x the size of Uber and 50% incrementality. You can take the gross number as being two times the size of Uber, but the incrementality at 50% would actually create a little bit less than 2x in terms of the incrementality from DoorDash.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. And with regard to stuffed crust, I think there are a couple of things. One is, and we haven't really talked about this a lot. We use a completely different dough for our Parmesan Stuffed Crust than we do our regular hand tossed. And that dough right now comes in a medium size. It's more kind of buttery flavor dough. But the reason we want to lean into that particular one is also because of the price point it allows. It allows us to have an upcharge to our mix and match promotion, which is about a $4 upcharge. So, it's not only an order driver, but it's a ticket driver. So, yes, stuffed crust, it was really more for that reason because of the unique dough and the desire on price points, but we're going to continue to watch and see what consumers are looking for.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Harbor from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Brian Harbor: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Sandeep, so just on the international side, is your expectation on units that any closures going forward therefore be just more normal course, so you still feel good about sort of the previous comments you made, kind of similar net unit openings this year versus last year? And then, just on kind of the macro impact on international same store sales is, I mean, you've embedded, I guess, a little bit of sequential deceleration. Is that reflecting that there probably could be some macro pressures there? Have you actually seen that sort of more recently? Or can you clarify that piece of it?
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks, Brian. So, I think there's two parts to this, right? First of all, on the units, yeah, I mean, with the size of the portfolio that we have and the store count that we have, some normal closures would be very normally in cost and that we'd expect to see that the remaining three quarters of the year. All that's already in the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year to be roughly in line with last year from a net store perspective. So that continues to be our expectation. And then, in terms of the macro impact, and I think there's two things; there's a macro and the geopolitical both. And I think, when we actually take a look at what's going on, there's a lot of volatility in the global marketplace. And I think just from a macro and a consumer sentiment perspective, that can have an impact on consumer demand. And I think in addition to that, there's also the geopolitical volatility that's ongoing around the tariff conversation that's happening right now. So, I think when you take it all into consideration, all of that's incorporated in the 1% to 2% expectation that we have for the year. And obviously that bakes in some level of sequential deceleration relative to the first quarter that we just experienced.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.
Andrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about reinvesting some of the savings from the restructuring. Where is that reinvestment going? What are you prioritizing in terms of the reinvestment? And if you're able to quantify it, that would be helpful as well. Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Andrew, yeah, I think -- to us, I think I've talked about the areas of the P&L that we've been consistently investing in since the time we talked about it at Investor Day. And it's really consumer technology, store technology, capacity investments. And we continue to focus on making sure that we're making investments in those areas to drive the business in the future. So that's really what I would actually give you. We're not going to get into specifics in terms of the amount of savings we invested and that I think it's all incorporated effectively in the guide of profit growth that we gave you, both in terms of this year, and there's no change in expectations to the 8% profit guide that we provided last time as well for 2026.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Your question, please.
Jeffrey Farmer: Yeah, good morning and thanks. I'm just curious what your exposure to both the lower-income and Hispanic customer demographic is in the US. And I guess, more specifically, if you could share anything about the relative same store sales performance of those demographics, again, specifically lower-income and Hispanic in the most recent quarter?
Russell Weiner: Yeah, Jeffrey, the lower-income customer is not just a Domino's customer, it's a pizza customer, it's a QSR customer. So, it's something that's I think a big part of this category. When we look, I think specifically in our 1P business, what -- how they're being affected is not really necessarily them leaving Domino's to go to another brand or leaving Domino's in general. It just may be an occasion here or there and what ends up happening and it's kind of similar for the consumer breakouts you talked about is they'll just be eating at home, which really does maybe gets me to a bigger point that I just want to make sure I make with everyone today, which is, I believe significantly and we believe that starting in '23 when we launched Hungry for MORE, that the QSR business over the near term is going to be pressured, pressured into sustained -- offering sustained value because that's what customers are looking for. And that's a pressure I don't worry about. I think our franchisees say bring it on. We want to be the ones to offer that value for customers because we are set up to do that. We've got a bigger kind of supply chain purchasing abilities than anyone in pizza, which allows us to give our franchisees who can then give customers really good value. Secondly, when you have low prices, you want to drive a lot of volume. How do you do that? You do that with advertising. We've got a $0.5 billion-plus advertising budget that nobody else has. And then, we also have franchisees with best-in-class economics that can see this through over the long term. And so, I think when we talk about that customer, you should know, I don't think that's going to change anytime soon. And I also -- what I know we can do is we can sustain that. And what we'll do, I think is actually come out of this even stronger. So you'll see what we're going to, I believe, continue to grow share and that we're bringing in these customers to a Domino's Pizza that from a service perspective, from a digital perspective, from a new product perspective is a better Domino's Pizza than we were two years ago.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. Your question, please.
Jeff Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Russell, in the press release and a couple of times in the call, you referred to the market share gains, so seemingly growing share despite in the US, at least modest negative comps. I would think that demonstrates perhaps ongoing maybe pizza category fatigue that you've talked about in the past impacting the entire category. And I guess that's compounded by more challenging macro. So, I'm just wondering how you see the category in terms of whether that fatigue persists or whether now it's more just a challenging macro. And as you just mentioned, if you're able to still grow market share gains in coming quarters and years despite at least near-term negative comps, assuming that's all unit growth led? So -- and I think Sandeep reiterated the unit growth guidance for US and international for this year, but was just confirming. Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yeah, Jeff, I definitely I would not call it pizza fatigue at all. I've been in this business almost 17 years now and essentially pizza grows 1% to 2% every year. We maybe have been on the lower side of that in Q1, but retail sales, because you're right, it's same store sales plus store opens for us, was positive. And so, this is a category that's been very, very consistent. I want to be clear, there's nothing really happening with pizza that hasn't happened over prior year from a growth perspective. And that's why the continued share growth is really important. And I'll point out that folks, if you think about us because we are the #1 pizza player, we're still slightly short of one in every four pizzas sold in the US as a Domino's Pizza. If you think of other categories, burgers and Mexican and coffee, other #1 brands are significantly higher. And so, this is not a short term thing that's going on here. There's significant share growth to continue to happen in the category that's going to continue to grow, we believe, like it has that 1% to 2% over time. I think lastly, the interesting dynamic within pizza is about 40%-plus of the competition are locals and regionals, which don't have anywhere near the capabilities to lean into value long term like we do. And so, when we look forward, we see lots of run room for growth on this US business.
Sandeep Reddy: And Jeff, I think you're right and Russell -- sorry, Russell was right, sorry.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Get it right, Sandeep.
Sandeep Reddy: So, 1% to 2% is historically and as we look forward to the future, the average rate that we're expecting for the pizza category, but specific to Q1 actually more than on the low end, I think we're actually looking at roughly flat for the quarter, but it's for one quarter. So, I don't think we read into it too much, but I think in those circumstances, our 1.3% retail sales, we feel really good about because we gained share in a very tough environment.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Slagle from Jefferies. Your question, please.
Alexander Slagle: Thanks for the question. Wanted to ask on DoorDash and the initial announcement sort of called out tapping into the incremental customers, I guess, especially in the suburban and rural markets. And I don't know if there is anything to that, just if there are specific implications on the development opportunities, maybe further from the core, and maybe that gets a bit to what John Ivankoe was asking, but -- and also, I guess, what does that mean for your delivery efficiency as you perhaps have drivers fulfill orders a bit further?
Russell Weiner: Yeah. We are not going to be changing our delivery kind of drive times in order to bring this on. So, I want folks to understand that this is not -- we're not going to be driving any further because we know the number one thing that deals -- that is currently with repeat -- or a couple of things are the consistency and delivering hot product. And so, what does -- this does do though is it helps our kind of rural and suburban stores, whereas maybe Uber helps a little bit more on the urban side. And so, by being on both aggregators now, I think we're going to see really more of a uniform hit one-two punch across all of our stores because of that.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your question, please.
Zach Fadem: Hey, good morning. I know you're not giving Uber mix, but just curious if it's still improving quarter-over-quarter or perhaps reaching a stabilization level. And then, separately, could you talk a bit about the performance or take rate on Boost Weeks today versus last year and in the past? And considering the macro dynamics today, just want to gauge the appetite or opportunity to consider stepping up Boost Weeks later this year?
Sandeep Reddy: So, Zach, I think on the Uber mix, like I said earlier, we're not going to really be talking about mix anymore going forward. And let's just say we were very happy with our Uber business in the first quarter. So, I'll leave it at that. And in terms of performance of Boost Weeks, I'm just going to go back to the strategic imperative that drives the Boost Weeks. These are customer acquisition vehicles. And as far as we're concerned, it's doing a great job in terms of being a customer acquisition vehicle and it continues to be something that we look at and whether it's a 50% online-only or the carryout special Boost Weeks, those are still very, very compelling opportunities for us to acquire customers into the brand. So, that's how we're looking at it. And we said roughly in line with what we did last year for Boost Weeks, that statement still holds.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. And just, to your point, I don't -- while we'll be roughly in line, I don't see a significant increase in Boost Weeks. We wouldn't want to start training our customers to look for that long term. There's value, and for this thing to be special on a 52-week calendar, we're always offering value, we need to be really thoughtful with where we put.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Logan Reich from RBC. Your question, please.
Logan Reich: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just had one question on the competitive intensity in the space. I think you guys called it out last quarter. Just curious how that sort of trended in Q1. And then, any sort of impact you guys are seeing from the burger QSR elevated discounting starting in January? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yeah, Logan, in Q1, interestingly enough, within the pizza competition and it's probably due to the fact that folks were knowing that we were coming out with stuffed crust, we had two of our three competitors come up with a stuffed crust. So, you've got that happening as well as just discounting throughout all of QSR. I think, just, in general, customer -- consumer disposable income is down and their confidence levels, I think, are also down to kind of 2022 levels. And so, just, in general, right now, there's a headwind on the total business, but specific to us within pizza, those two stuffed crust promotions.
Russell Weiner: And the one thing I want to add on this, Logan, is, with the economics that we have, if the competition tries to keep up with us in terms of promotional intensity, there's going to be pain in those P&Ls for their franchisees. And it's just going to be really working more and more into our favor if that intensity is very high, and over time, Russell has talked about it previously. We've opened up over the last 10 years, 1,900 stores. The big national players have closed just slightly less than those. And I think that's really just shows what happens when you try to promote very intensively when you don't have the economics to be able to promote.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Todd Brooks from The Benchmark Company. Your question, please.
Todd Brooks: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just kind of putting a point on scale and market share gains, Russell, if you look back to the announcement and launch of Hungry for MORE, can you talk about how much share Domino's has gained in both the carryout and the delivery channel since that program has been launched?
Russell Weiner: Yeah. I guess, I'll even talk broader than that because what I'm really excited about is just how we've consistently been able to do it. And we're about 1 share point a year, kind of give or take, over time in the pizza business. So, we got a track record for doing that. And I think we're actually better poised to do that moving forward because of the market share we have, the advertising we have, the franchisee profitability we have. And maybe just to kind of loop back around to the prior question, we keep talking about the profitability of our franchisees, which we're really proud of, and what we feel pretty confident are that there's the profitability of some of the national and regional local competitors. I'd have folks maybe look at the AUVs, which are something that you can calculate and just that will give you a sense of what we're talking about. So, even if there are profitability numbers for competition, if you look at the AUVs of the Domino's, which has more stores than any other concept, it will give you a sense of what Sandeep was talking about. Meaning, if folks are going to compete with us with less volume going through what is substantially a similarly outlet cost to kind of keep up rent all that kind of stuff, it's going to be very, very difficult.
Greg Lemenchick: Thank you, Todd. That was our last question of the call. I want to thank you all for joining our call today and we look forward to speaking to you all again soon. You may now disconnect.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-24 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Domino's Pizza Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during this session, you'll need to press star one one on your telephone. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Greg Lemenchick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Good morning, everyone.
Greg Lemenchick: Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year results conference call. Today's call will begin with our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner, followed by our Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. The call will conclude with a Q&A session. The forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Ks, both of which are available on our IR website, also apply to our comments on the call today. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-Ks earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. This morning's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. We want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such, we encourage you to ask one question only. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Russell.
Russell Weiner: Well, thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. I'd like to start with a look back at 2024, the first full year executing our Hungry for More strategy. When we introduced Hungry for More at our December 2023 investor day, we knew consumer spending would be pressured in 2024. We believe the QSR brands that offered the strongest value would win. And we made the right call to focus on this as we've seen more market headwinds than anticipated at the time. At Domino's, leaning into our strategic pillar of renowned value was key to our success to help drive market share gains in QSR Pizza of about 1% in the US, consistent with our average annual share growth in 2015 and proof that our Hungry for More plan is working. As we look ahead to 2025, we believe the combination of pressured consumer spending and a value-driven QSR marketplace will continue. In these challenging times, the best measure of a company's success will be the market share gains it achieves. Domino's is well-positioned to do just that because we have the right strategy in place. We grew retail sales in the US by 5.3% in 2024. Importantly, something that continues to be unique in the industry, we drove meaningful, positive order count growth. Order count growth has been the key to delivering best-in-class economics for our US. These strong economics continue to drive store growth, which was a tailwind to market share in 2024. Orders grew on the strength of our revamped Domino's rewards program and our entrance into the aggregator channel with Uber. In addition, we continue to see significant same-store sales growth in our carryout business, up over 6% for the year. I want to illustrate how we drove these results through the lens of our Hungry for More strategy. The M in Hungry For More stands for most delicious food. Domino's has the most delicious food in the industry, and in 2024, through our two successful new product launches,
Operator: New York style pizza?
Russell Weiner: And mac and cheese pasta. These launches reflect the commitment we have to our innovation with intent approach. There is a clear purpose behind any product we bring to market. We brought news to an existing non-pizza platform with mac and cheese, and we added a new pizza crust type for customers who prefer an offering we didn't have in our portfolio with New York style. In 2025, we plan to continue to build on this momentum by launching at least two new products, which is our annual goal. An important component of our strategy is how we showcase our food.
Operator: We've enhanced this through the food photography and our creative
Russell Weiner: and upgrades to our existing e-commerce platform where our team made meaningful changes in 2024. We've also completed the development of our new e-commerce platform in the US, which we intend to roll out during 2025. The new site and app provide an improved user experience for our customers while highlighting the deliciousness of our food. The O in Hungry for More stands for operational excellence. This is how we deliver on our promise to have the most delicious food by consistently driving a great experience with our product and service. In 2024, we rolled out our new service program called More Delicious Operations. This program was a series of three product training sprints focusing on deal management, how we build and make our products, and how we bake them. These product sprints work together with our Domino's technology to drive improvements in our delivery times. In fact, our average delivery times decreased by two minutes over the last two years. Operational excellence also brings focus and innovation around making our stores easier to operate. This is an area where we've made significant strides. We've enhanced our Dom OS operating system and have found ways to roll technology out across our system much more quickly than we have in the past. We've now rolled out 1,600 DJ dough stretching machines across the US, more than a 50% increase from where we were at the end of Q3. Demand continues to be high for this equipment because of the impact it's having on our product consistency and the speed to competency for new team members. I want to thank our franchisees and our operations team for their continued effort to achieve operational excellence. This is a point of pride and differentiation for Domino's. The R stands for renowned value. From tipping our delivery customers to launching more inflation and bringing back emergency pizza, through the industry clutter in 2024, we launched several brand-building value initiatives that broke. We will continue to drive renowned value in 2025 through national promotions, Domino's rewards, and by continuing to grow on aggregator platforms. In 2025, Domino's will give customers what they are demanding from their QSR brands: more value. We have a strong slate of initiatives, primed and ready to go. You can expect a similar cadence of boost weeks and value-driving promotions as we believe it's going to be another challenging year ahead in the industry. Domino's rewards program had a great first year and continues to bring members back for repeat purchases. We grew our overall active members significantly in 2024, finishing the year at 35.7 million users, up approximately 2.5 million versus 2023. Part of this growth was delivering more light users and carryout customers who were the primary target of the redesign. This strong base of users will allow us to engage more customers and drive frequency, targeted and personalized marketing while providing value through our own channels is one part of our renowned value barbell strategy. Tapping into the aggregator marketplace is the other. In 2024, we successfully entered the aggregator space with our partnership with Uber, achieving our goal of exiting the year at 3% of sales coming through this channel. And importantly, incrementality has continued to track as expected, and we remain focused on tailoring our offers and programming to optimize it for it. In 2025, we know that aggregators are a meaningful sales-driving opportunity for us. And we have yet to join the largest aggregator platform in the US. We've extended our exclusivity arrangement with Uber until May 1, in the meantime, begun negotiations with additional aggregator partners have the ability to begin piloting with other partners in a small number of stores. It is our intention to further penetrate this channel in 2025 with a meaningful impact expected in the back half of the year. We believe that this channel represents an incremental sales opportunity of a billion dollars over time. The aggregator marketplace is the fastest-growing segment within QSR Pizza and we are just getting started. Everything we do at Domino's Pizza is enhanced by our best-in-class franchisee. In 2024, we added almost 60 new franchisees to the system and have a pipeline of 120 future franchisees waiting for their opportunity. Every one of these new franchisees started as a Domino's team member. In summary, we're laser-focused on delivering against our Hungry for More goals in the US. With the plan we've developed, I believe we will deliver US same-store sales growth of 3% or more annually along with 175 net new stores. This would only enable Domino's to continue to capture additional market share in 2025 and beyond. Now shifting to our international business. Domino's international showed strong improvement in the fourth quarter and has now delivered a remarkable 31 straight years of same-store sales growth. We're pleased with how most of our franchisees internationally are navigating the continued macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical issues across the globe. Our team continues to work with our international master franchisees to create momentum in their markets even in the face of these headwinds. We know what works in today's challenging environment and its renowned value. As we noted on our last call, we're engaging with our master franchisees, with a focus on three key areas. These areas are around consistent value messaging, maximizing orders from aggregators, and driving additional growth in carryout and dine-in. The good news is that we've begun to see some results due to this focus. Canada ran an emergency pizza promotion in Q4 and that's been a strong traffic driver for them. In India, Jubilant has driven sales through increased delivery orders after eliminating their delivery fee. The UK and Canada have launched with Uber and this has provided a tailwind to their sales. Lastly, Mexico saw a nice increase in their carryout business in 2024 as they provided a premium product in pan pizza at a compelling price point driving consistent value for customers. Our international business has so much potential and by focusing on our Hungry for More strategies, we expect to create sales momentum that will produce the same kind of market share gains and net store growth we've achieved in the past. In closing, I want to reinforce the same message I repeatedly share with our team. We have always been in the business of creating our own tailwinds and driving share growth. That has been and will continue to be how we drive best-in-class results and long-term value creation for our franchisees and shareholders. I'll now hand the call over to Sandeep.
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Well, our full-year 2024 financial results were impacted by a more challenging backdrop than we had initially anticipated. We still delivered profitable growth of 8%. Income from operations increased 6.5% in Q4, excluding the impact of foreign currency, which was in line with our expectations, despite lower US same-store sales than we expected. This increase in profits was primarily due to gross margin within the supply chain driven by procurement productivity, as well as lower general and administrative expenses which were driven by the retiming of investments. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 4.4% in the fourth quarter from positive US and international comps and global net store growth. For the year, global retail sales grew approximately 6%, which was in line with our updated guidance. In Q4, total retail sales grew 2.3% in the US, driven by net store growth and same-store sales of 0.4%. These comps were driven by carryout up 3.2%, and delivery down 1.4%. The delivery comp was impacted by continued macro and competitive pressures that put pressure on our low-income customers. We benefited from 2.3% of pricing, which was inclusive of high single digits in California, and our sales mix from Uber was 2.7% for the quarter. Our tailwinds were partially offset by a higher carryout mix that carries a lower ticket than delivery. Traffic was flat for the quarter, which was partially driven by a slight headwind as a result of New Year's Eve timing. For the year, delivery represented 46% of our transactions, and 57% of our sales, while carryout represented 54% of our transactions, and 43% of our sales. The rate of sales and transactions shifted slightly more to carryout in 2024, because of the strong carryout comp we had of 6.2%. The full-year delivery comp was up 1.1%. Our estimated average US franchisee store profitability in 2024 came in at approximately $162,000, which we continue to believe is best in class. After a strong start in the first half of the year, the combination of macro and competitive pressures that impacted our sales in the back half weighed on this result. Shifting to US unit count. We added 84 net new stores in Q4 and opened our 7,000th store, bringing our US system store count to 7,014. Our Q4 openings were negatively impacted by some of the hurricane activity that took place late last year. Moving to international, where total retail sales grew 6.4% excluding the impact of foreign currency in the fourth quarter. This was driven by net store growth and same-store sales that came in slightly ahead of our expectations at 2.7%. In the quarter, we saw improvements in Asia that were driven by strong comps in India and broadly across Europe. Despite a challenging macro backdrop that impacted our international business, our franchisees grew their average first store profitability in 2024 and slightly reduced their average new store paybacks as a result. We also continue to see strong paybacks in our two largest growth markets, which are China and India. As we look ahead to 2025, we continue to believe that global retail sales growth should be generally in line with 2024. Now to give some color. We are expecting our US comp to be in line with our 3% long-term guide as a result of our expected traffic-driving catalyst in aggregators and loyalty. In the event that macro pressures persist throughout the year, it could put pressure on achieving this number. We also expect that based on the timing of certain initiatives, our comp will be lower in the first half compared to the back half in the US. We continue to believe planning for approximately 1% to 2% international same-store sales growth in 2025 is the right expectation before we return the business to a more normalized level in 2026. Shifting to net stores. We continue to expect 175 plus net stores in the US and we have a strong pipeline heading into the year to achieve this. Internationally, we are expecting our net store growth to be in line with what we have in 2024. This is primarily due to impacts from Domino's Pizza Enterprises, DPE, which is our master franchisee based out of Australia. DPE continues to make meaningful progress into what they need to do to their business as they work through their strategic plan under their new CEO. They recently announced that they are expecting to close an additional 200 plus underperforming stores, primarily in Japan. They're also planning to be more disciplined in their new store openings by prioritizing locations where they can drive sustainable profitable growth. For the long term, we believe that the meaningful impacts from DPE's closures will be behind us as we head into 2026. On profits, we continue to expect an operating profit growth of approximately 8% excluding the impact of currency. A few additional points of color on the P&L. Any metrics we are providing today exclude any impacts from the proposed tariffs. In our US supply chain business, we source most of our food products from within the country, so we are not expecting this to have a meaningful impact if tariffs are put in place. We are expecting our food basket to be up low single digits. We expect increases to be higher in the first half than the second half, primarily driven by cheese prices. We are expecting our supply chain margins to expand slightly year over year due to continued procurement productivity, the team continues to do an incredible job executing on.
Russell Weiner: We are expecting our G&A as a percentage of retail sales
Sandeep Reddy: to be approximately 2.4%. Starting at the beginning of Q1 2025, we have increased the technology fee by two cents to 37.5 cents per digital transaction to fund our future tech initiatives to drive growth. We are expecting operating income margins to expand slightly in 2025, primarily driven by supply chain margins. We expect margin growth to be lower in the first half of the year than in the second half. At current exchange rates, we are expecting foreign currency to be a headwind of approximately 1% to 2% on operating income growth. We continue to plan for our debt maturity in October of this year, and at current interest rates, it would result in some pressure on interest expense. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%, which is generally in line with where it has been historically. Our belief in the long-term algorithm of what the Domino's business can and should achieve has not changed. We continue to expect that our algorithm of 7% or more annual global retail sales growth and operating profit growth of 8% or more is the right one. However, the anticipated impact from DPE's additional net closures in 2025 will put pressure on our 2026 global retail sales and profit expectations, which we now expect to be in line with 2025. To close, I wanted to note that this morning, we announced a 15% increase in our dividend, which was done in line with our capital allocation priorities. We also repurchased approximately 259,000 shares at an average price of $433, totaling $112 million in the fourth quarter. As of the end of 2024, we had approximately $814 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Thank you. We will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Certainly. And our first question for today comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your question, please.
Dennis Geiger: Greg, good morning. Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask a bit more on the 2025 guidance for the US same-store sales. I guess specific to the comments around
Russell Weiner: lower first half versus back half and then I think commentary around the aggregators and loyalty being the biggest drivers. Could you just kind of unpack some of the sales initiatives, you know, those two in particular,
Sandeep Reddy: and maybe how you're thinking about new product innovation in 2025 at a high level excitement first is prior years with those two items that you called out. Thanks, guys.
Sandeep Reddy: Hey, Dennis. Good morning. How are you doing? So, Dennis, I think on the question on the guidance, and the back half versus the first half cadence, I think we in Russell's prepared remarks, we talked about the aggregator platform specifically that we started negotiations with potentially other partners and that the meaningful impact would come more on the back half from aggregators, I think. So that's one piece of it. In terms of the weight. And I think the other piece of it is really we have a bunch of initiatives that we have in our marketing calendar. And as you've seen, we weren't shy about rolling out a whole bunch of them in 2024. Similar plans in 2025, you know, best deal ever, has just been launched earlier this quarter. So there's all much more that we're waiting to surprise our competition with. So I'm not gonna give you more details on that, but that's kind of how the backup versus fund half commentary was built.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. I think just in general, you know, when we're asked by the way, good morning, Dennis. Sorry. You know, when folks talk to us about what drivers are in the business, I see we're not gonna give, you know, specific information. But if you wanna know what our recipe is, it's Hungry for More. And so, for example, if someone were to ask me in, last quarter, what are you gonna do in Q1? What's gonna be different? Well, I wouldn't tell them we're doing, you know, a 9.99 any best deal ever promotion. But that idea really came out of the strategy of Hungry for More. So the are gonna change. We need to keep you guys on your toes. But the drivers behind them are gonna be born out of the Hungry for More strategy.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer and Company. Your question, please?
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. As it relates to the 2025 guidance, it does still assume softer international expectations with you established on last quarter's call. What international same-store sales in that 1% to 2% range instead of the 3% plus, long-term range. And you did reiterate this view in your prepared remarks this morning, but I'm curious if your international thoughts for 2025 have changed at all over the last several months. I mean, your Q4 comps were stronger than expected. We're also seeing better international trends out of a lot of your peers. So I'm just curious if this is starting to tilt conservatively possibly. Or anything else you can add.
Russell Weiner: Good morning, Brian. I'll start off on Sunday. Feel free to feel free to add. You know, like you said, the Q4 for the competition as well, some of the headwinds seem to be dying down a little bit. We're not gonna make a flip after, you know, one quarter we were pleased with with our quarter as well. What I look at are the things that we can control, and there, I am pretty happy. You know, we gave a bunch of I'm not gonna go through them again, but it might in my opening remarks, I gave a bunch of examples of how around the world we're taking the renowned value part of Hungry For More and we're translating it into some of these international markets. And we're seeing results. We've talked about having to do three things. To drive international same-store sales, and I think we're really beginning to do that. First is making sure that our price points are at or below CPI. Second is making sure we're leveraging aggregators. And the third, just like we've diversified beyond delivery, while still driving delivery in the US, we need to do that international markets. So happy with Q4 and as we get more, if we we'll update that number, we'll let you know.
Sandeep Reddy: And what I will add, Brian, is, I think in terms of the guidance on same-store sales in particular, wouldn't say this stills conservatively. It is a very tough macroeconomic environment out there. There is a lot of volatility that's out there. And that's all been taken into consideration both in terms of what we said at Q3 on the Q3 earnings call as well as what we're seeing right now. So we'll continue to drive into the renowned value initiatives that Russell talked about. But I think the expectations really have not shifted materially. Since the last call.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your question, please.
David Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. My question is on the US unit growth. That number I guess, missed your target for 2024. And I was just wanting to ask your degree of confidence in getting to the target for 2025, I guess, was any way you can frame up the pipeline or your degree of guess you know, assessment of enthusiasm in terms of building new units, which Great. Thanks, David. Yeah. I think Sandeep, in his remarks, talked about
Russell Weiner: some of the hurricanes at the back part of the year impacted our net openings. Otherwise, we would have been essentially there.
Sandeep Reddy: What I'm really happy about is
Russell Weiner: Also, just how we've done relative to the kind of competitive pizza places even in a year maybe we where we didn't hit. And so if you look at, you know, our competition as far as public companies. You know, you add up the number of stores net stores that they opened, and we were a multiple several multiples higher than that. So we've got more to do. The hurricanes hurt us a little bit. But net net, we're still gaining more share in the US, and that's what this game is all about.
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah. And I and I would just add to that, David. Our economics are still very much best in class. The paybacks are extremely compelling. The demand for new units continues to be very strong. And with the share that we continue to build, we are in a stronger and stronger position not just against the national competitors whose data you actually hear about, but against the regional competitors and the local players as well. So we are super confident that the pipeline is that we see is very realistic.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JP Morgan. Your question, please.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. There's, you know, obviously, been, you know, a lot of attention around price points under ten dollars. You know, six ninety-nine specials and, obviously, what's, like, you know, currently pretty incredible large unlimited topping for nine ninety-nine. So, you know, the question was really, you know, kind of around that ten dollar price point. Is the brand in a position know, to where you can drive significantly interest, you know, promoting a pizza at
Russell Weiner: Yes.
John Ivankoe: Whatever the number might be. Twelve, thirteen, fourteen dollars or for whatever reason, then know, you know, Mike, the brand has some kind of natural cap around the ten dollar number where consumer really getting a lot of interest around a higher nominal price point, not value, but higher nominal price point that might otherwise constrain them.
Russell Weiner: Hey, John. Yeah. You know, one of the things that you'll see in this promotional environment, and we knew this when we said I'm hungry for more and we said we were gonna dive into, renowned value is that it's that price is important. And, you know, frankly, there are a lot of folks doing similar promotions that we do. You know, we had six ninety-nine and other folks have done stick you know, six ninety-nine. We had emergency pizzas. There have been BOGOs. You talk about price points. For me, the thing and Sandeep talked about this before. Is for us, it's sustainable. When you look at the economics for our franchisees, able to sustain these types of price points and we saw same-store sales for other pizza players, which were not in line with where Domino's are. So if you if you if you got similar promotions and you've got you know, lower same-store sales, the economics are not gonna be good. And so we've got when you look at the scale of Domino's, our ability to drive volume through our high share of voice and drive cost down through our supply chain. That's what enabled us to do that. Ten dollars or nine ninety-nine is a good price point right now. We're gonna continue to pivot to keep consumers you know, interested in Domino's, but the big thing that's different about us is that this is sustainable as part of our strategy.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.
David Palmer: Thanks. If I had to summarize perhaps what investors are excited about and concerned about, I'd say they're excited about the potential on this on the DoorDash expansion of marketing there. Excited about stuff crust, potential to roll that out, but they're concerned about the long-term same-store sales growth beyond these types of initiatives. Given what they would back out from Uber Eats from the fourth quarter and they think, gosh, the underlying trends are troubled for pizza delivery, particularly one piece. So I'm wondering if when you think
Operator: beyond twenty-six or
David Palmer: know, through twenty-six and beyond about your three percent domestic comp growth target or thereabouts. You know, what are some things that you think might ramp up
Operator: in terms of its growth contribution that would give people comfort at this point that you could do that without some of these other things
David Palmer: perhaps, in that given year. Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, David. Yeah. You know, we get that question a lot, which is, hey. What's come up in future years that makes you think that you could sustain you know, what you've done do what you're doing. And, obviously, we're not gonna go into particular programs. But this brand has a track record. This team has a track record, and you know, kinda one SharePoint plus a year is is is is been what we've delivered. Without sometimes getting into the specifics of what we're doing for a competitive reason, I don't think you'd want us to. I said this earlier. I'll bring it up again. If someone were to ask me, hey, last year, what do you got coming in Q1? I wouldn't be telling them we've got best deal ever. But I'd be telling them the answer would come out of our strategy of renowned value. And so I've been with this company sixteen years, you know, and essentially, the track record has been pretty solid without us, you know, giving forward-looking information. So if you wanna know what we're doing, obviously, you talked about some of the big ones, you know, expanding on the aggregator platforms, is a big one if you think about what our Q4 number would have been had we been on all the aggregators. You know, you're completely right there. Loyalty is a multiyear gain for us, like we showed with the first loyalty program. But you're gonna see a company that continues to bring you know, best-in-class ideas that are differentiated based on our strategy, and we've got a track record of doing that. So not gonna get into specific members other than to say or specific names or programs, other than to say, you know, we've done it, and we're gonna continue to do that going forward.
Sandeep Reddy: And, David, just to add over here, like, when we talk about the aggregators and aggregators specifically, when you think about twenty twenty-six, Russell talked about the long term. All the things that we can do. If we're talking about really looking at something post-May one, and we have a meaningful impact in the backup, obviously, there's an annualization impact. That comes from the aggregator platform if we actually do that. And then I think there's Walt Hillman, the fastest-growing segment of the Pizza QSR space is the aggregated end. And to Russell's point, we weren't on there fully in Q4 of 2024, and there's a lot more growth to come from there. And I think given loyalty that Russell talked about the multiyear compounding impact, the really cool thing about loyalty two point five million dollars increment two point five incremental loyalty members that we've gained, these are light users and carryout users, and that becomes a huge flywheel because now we've captured them into a database, and we can start marketing them to drive incremental compounding impacts. So this is going to be a big flywheel and we're really thrilled about the carryout mix in the business as well. It's very compelling. It's very strong. You combine that with the number of loyalty members that we again, more growth to come. And so the catalyst that we talked about are very consistent and they're multiyear drivers.
Russell Weiner: And I think to just add is when you when if you've listened to what we've been able to sustain some of the commentary we've got over why we're able to sustain know? Over the last decade plus, it's we've talked about building scale. Right, and the scale we've got in share of voice, the scale we have in supply chain, that gets grown through same-store sales. Right? So in another year where we're winning on same-store sales, another year where we're winning on stores. Stores let you drive more markets there. Stores let you keep competitive stores from opening. All of that actually kinda snowballs and drives more momentum for the future. So all the stuff that we said has worked for us by continuing this flywheel essentially, becomes more offense for us in the future.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your question, please.
Danilo Gargiulo: Thank you. Stanley, I think you are you are showing some you know, you're displaying some very solid cost discipline also in 2024, you know, both on the supply chain as well as on the G&A side. You were talking about some shift in timing of some of these investments can you help us understand which investments have been put out and then to the extent that the retail stores were still coming a little bit softer in 2025, softer than your expectations, do you still have room for optimizing G&A or do you think that you know, the guidance that you gave today already includes the opportunity that you have over there. Thank you.
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah, Danilo. Thank you for the question. I think it's a really good one. And terms of how we're thinking about the business and how we've pivoted. You go back to the prepared remarks, we said that 2024 was a year when sales didn't really track toward what we initially expected at the beginning. Beginning of the year. And despite that, we found agility in the P&L to actually drive the 8% operating income growth that we'd that we were targeting. And a couple of things that actually helped us in 2024. We're careful with productivity, fantastic from the supply chain. All organization. They've done a really terrific job. And that supply will continue to run. We expect more of that in 2025. We look forward to that. And then I think in terms of timing of investments, I talked about this even earlier during the third-quarter call, I think, where we had three different buckets of investments, specifically in G&A. We have consumer technology, store technology, and capacity investments. Think on the capacity investments piece, we I think based on the way the volumes were going, we're able to retime that a little bit, and actually that's part of what's in the numbers. When we look at how 2025 is built up, we actually do have that framework as we're looking at it. But we wanna make sure that we are pacing our investments appropriately with where sales are going. We've demonstrated through 2024 that we're able to pivot if there is a shift a little bit in terms of what the sales momentum is we have a lot of confidence in doing that in 2025 as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from B. Your question, please.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the third party. I mean, you exited 2024 near the 3% target. On Uber Eats, are you still on track for the billion dollars of incremental revenue by the end of 2026? And what, if anything, have you learned from the Uber Eats partnership over the past, call it, year, five, six quarters now that maybe informs how you'll do things differently when you expand to another third-party partnership, in 2025. Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah. Thanks, Peter.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. We're still bullish on this being a billion-dollar opportunity for us. The timing may have is gonna be pushed out a little bit, and that's really because we have purposely managed this for, you know, as high of an incremental volume as we can. And so, you know, once we get on some of the other platforms obviously, we'll continue to grow there. I think what we've learned with Uber it's a couple of things. One is how to optimize the marketing. So one of the reasons I've talked about kind of the billion maybe taking a little bit longer to get to is, you know, we've learned how to optimize incrementality, and so we're not going after all the volume right away. We want this to grow over time and be, you know, incremental and accretive to the profitability of our franchisees. So we've learned how to do marketing better, I think, on this platform. And then just technology integration, I would expect that if we were to go on another platform that the tech integration would be quicker than it was, you know, when we were doing it from scratch.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from TD.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the $162,000 of US store level cash flow in 2024. It trailed the initial $170,000 target issued at the December 2023 investor meeting. So I'm curious if the shortfall was versus the original expectation, was that strictly sales or some other driver there? Then, Russell, can you also address to just franchisees' conviction and prioritizing renowned value to properly go to sales just given the shortfall in 2024 of franchisee store level cash flow?
Sandeep Reddy: So I'll start on the first part on the full cash flow. Andrew. So look. I agree. I mean, I think when we started the year, we were 2024, we're expecting around $170,000 of store cash flow, and we finished up at $162,000. And candidly, on the first half of the year, we were tracking. We were tracking where we were expecting. But as we kind of moved into the second half, you saw the sales softness that came in in the third quarter. We talked about it, the macro environment plus the competitive pressures really started weighing on sales and then profit. So and then when you got into Q4, it just accelerated in if we look at the comp trends went, and the intensity we had a 4.4% food basket in the fourth quarter. So that actually didn't help from a cash flow perspective either. So all that is to explain what happened in terms of the cadence of the cash flows. However, the important thing, and this was really critical, we grew by a point of market share. In the year, and that is critical because you take that market share growth. You take the loyalty membership, which grew by 2.5 million members, and then you look forward into 2025, with the scale and products that we have, whether it's in marketing, whether it's in digital, whether it's in the supply chain side, we have a lot of catalysts to drive continued growth not only in cash flows, but I think overall in terms of share growth as we move into 2025.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. And, Andrew, I guess I'd add to that, you know, our franchisees are pretty special. You know, they're fully invested in Domino's. They don't run any other, you know, restaurant chains. This is their business, and they are competitive folks. And, actually, they're in it for the long term because of, you know, this being their primary business. And so what they saw this year was I'm sorry. This year meeting in 2024. I apologize. 2024. Was similar promotions right, with some of the competitions. But sales higher for us, stores higher for us, share higher for us. And so they know what the P&L looks like on lower volumes. And they're in it for the long term, if you know, you're holding your own on profit and you know you're negatively impacting the competition, that's a good thing. And this is not me just talking about sentiment. I'd say the franchisees are talking with their actions because one of the things that they approved well into the quarter so they knew where things were going was this nine ninety-nine, you know, any promotion? This best deal ever. And so they're gonna they had any qualms about continuing to lean in, you wouldn't see literally what is our best deal ever. In market. And similarly with store growth, the store growth signs up. Are there. So it was a it certainly wasn't a year where we delivered what we said we would, but I think they're in it for the long term. We're in it for the long term. It was still a win, 2024 for Domino's Pizza.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower from Citi. Your question, please.
Jon Tower: Hey. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Good morning. I was just curious if you could dig a little bit into the international unit growth, and I understand the headwinds that the business will be facing in 2025 from the Australia master franchisee closure. But what you know, can you speak to maybe the confidence you have in this reaccelerating at 2026 and specifically you have any other global master franchisees where you see potential for potential market consolidation, in store closures? The next twelve months or so.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Let me so why don't I start and you continue? Look, I think, you know, the 200 closures by DPE by the end of the year, I think both those closures will be behind us. What I wanna make sure that I focus everyone is our two largest growth markets, China and India remain on track, China opened up 240 stores last year, they're talking now. Three hundred to three hundred and fifty. And so the growth in the rest of the system is really strong, and the DPE closures by the end of the year, I think, will be behind us. Anything to ask?
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah. And I think what I will say is it you probably heard of the prepared remarks at Optimize International store profitability improving slightly despite the pressures that we're talking about on DPE. And paybacks improving. The paybacks are obviously very, very compelling in China and India that Russell just talked about. But they're very good outside of China and India as well. Even if you look at the portfolio outside of DPE. And even DPE, I think we're looking at all the actions that are being talked about by the DPE organization. To prune the portfolio, the two hundred plus stores that they're gonna close this year, the commentary from their CEO is to be very focused on profitable, sustainable growth from their portfolio. So all of this augurs very well for 2026 and beyond. Because I think we're looking at very healthy growth. And invariably, store economics are gonna be the leading indicator of what is gonna happen with unit growth we're definitely on the right path on this.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christine Cho from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Christine Cho: Great. Thank you for the chance to ask questions. So I think you mentioned 1,600 dough stretchers at the end of your fourth quarter, which is up meaningfully, but still in roughly a quarter of your Jordan, the US. So I'd like to understand what are some of the key inhibitors on a more accelerated rollout and any metrics that you can share on the impact to the overall store operational efficiency.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Sure. Right now, really just the The impact on why we don't have more is we're just we're trying to ramp up supply. Demand is higher than supply, and that means the thing is working. I'm you know, metrics you know, the one that I'd like to point on is usually, if we bring somebody new on board, it takes them about 25 shifts in the store to get to kind of call it comp speed of competency to stretch dough. With a DJ, it's two chefs. I don't even think it's that long, but that's all that Sandy's letting me say is two shifts. So but I what I wanna do is take a step back and make sure you guys understand dough stretcher is just one piece of it. You know, what we did, and this was really coming out of COVID, we said, we gotta get better at what we're doing. We have to reinvent our circle of operations. Both the physical plant, but also technology. So you look at what we've done, which is improved OMOS, reinvent our circle of operations. Two straight years of programs concentrating on training our franchisee. We had summer of service two years ago, and then last year, we had most delicious operations, you know, that's raining. Net net, a couple of things. One is our delivery times have improved. By a couple of minutes. And secondly, in our team USA stores, turnover turnover is lower. So if you've got a new circle of operations that makes it better for your team members, and you're delivering better your customers, I think that's a win-win. So I know the question was about DJ, but I just wanna take a step back and say, DJ is part of an overall approach we've had over the last three years to improve operations.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your question, please.
Chris O'Cull: Platform Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Russell, you mentioned the rollout of a new e-commerce this year including new app and site. Can you just provide some more information on what those changes will entail both from a consumer-facing side and then also kind of the back end for the business side. And then are you expecting a meaningful improvement, let's say, in conversion rates following these changes? Yeah. Chris, so let me talk to you about how we're doing the rollout. First is the site build. Finished building it last year. And you talk about conversion. That's kinda what we're doing now. And so we're slowly showing more and more people the site, lending them order on the site. And then what we do is when there are pieces of conversion that are flat to positive, we'll roll that. If things we need to change you know, we'll go back and fix that. This is obviously it's a huge website, and so, you know, a tenth of a percent of conversion loss is an issue. And so what we see in 2025 is this is gonna be a year where we're rolling this out. At a fast pace as we can to make sure we're continuing to support the business, you know, in the right way. Alright. Probably the apps will be a little bit later than the website, but all should be out this year. If I were to highlight a couple of things on what consumers will see, it is it takes most delicious food up. A level big time. I mean, we've already fast-forwarded some of the new food photography onto the old website, but just the layouts and all that are, you know, people buy with their eyes first, and so I'm excited about that. A lot of the user flows are just we've taken steps out of the user flow and things are much more intuitive. Know, the app was brought up a long time ago. A lot of things have changed. A lot of things that were frankly common among other apps we didn't have. Also, our carryout business is much bigger than it was when we developed the original website. And so that which was kind of an also afterthought, in our first website won't be there. In this. This will be a great carryout experience. And then on the back end, when you talk about integration into our systems, when you talk about personalization, when you talk about speed, all of that is the reason we're confident. About the new website.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Brian Harbour: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Since you've talked about kind of carryout versus delivery share, was the point gain consistent across both of those in you know, in 2024. And I guess just we sort of implied earlier, right, excluding kind of the Uber contribution, I mean, underlying delivery is obviously still kind of the softer spot. Is your expectation that that doesn't change too much into this year or know, is there some pickup there? And where do you think kind of that business is going to?
Russell Weiner: Yeah. So, Brian, first, we market share gains were both in carryout and delivery. And, you know, we continue to think we're gonna have balanced growth moving forward. You're right about one p being a little bit where the softness was. You know, there it's people switching to eating at home. And so, you know, three p for us is new. Once we get into that, obviously, all those consumers in those marketplaces are new. But, you know, delivery is a tougher value right now in this value-conscious world. And so, you know, the choice though isn't going to, you know, another restaurant most of the time. It's eating at home.
Sandeep Reddy: And, Brian, I think you didn't specifically ask this, but I think you brought up which I think is super important. As we think about 2025, expect balanced growth between delivery and carryout. We expect balanced growth between ticket and transaction as well. I think that's super important to actually think about as you're putting together your models. And we will continue to stay very disciplined on pricing. You saw in spite of actually taking the high single-digit pricing in California, we really were in the low single digits in 2024 in pricing. Expect much the same in terms of pricing disciplines in 2025. So we continue to build on our manage on Renown value and drive for more market share.
Russell Weiner: You know, Yeah. Brian, yeah, one of the things I should have said as well is looking forward, especially when we're on all the delivery platforms, our delivery business is going to be that's how we're gonna report on delivery business. Our delivery business is gonna be one p, you know, and three p. And if you remember the way we priced and the way we're managing profitability on some of these new channels. We wanna meet consumers where they are if this is where they wanna be, it's gonna be a profitable transaction for customers. So I understand the questions on one p. I really would, though, especially as in the back half of the year, start thinking about our delivery businesses as one business. That's how we're approaching it.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Lauren Silberman: Thanks for the question. So it's been reported that you plan to launch stuff across soon. I think most investors expect it in the next month or so. I guess, how are you thinking about balancing the timing of a high volume LTO with potential additional delivery partners? On that point, it sounds like you may not willing to you know, confirming a specific LTO. But can you help us understand, you know, whether this is already the 3% guide and what you're expecting in the first half being a little softer. Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Sure. Few questions there. I think, you know, in general, your first question your first sentence, you talked about LTOs. I'm not saying we'll never do LTOs, but, you know, we do a lot of work. I talked about innovation with intent in my opening remarks. Yeah. Our desire when we launch something is to get the long-term ROI. You need to keep the thing long-term. If you look at what we did last year with New York Style Pizza, on the pizza end, we brought in a crust type that we didn't have. And then with mac and cheese, we brought news to pasta that we in two thousand nine. And, by the way, that news helped us keep positive volume while we took a couple of SKUs out of the cleanup that business you know, a little bit. You're not the first person, believe it or not, who's asked Stuffed crust, and I look, I'm not surprised we're number one pizza company in the world and it's one of the biggest crust types out there, and we don't have it. We don't have it in states. We do have it in other markets. So we're not gonna comment on future products, but I think maybe the way to answer is your last question, which is to say, hey, look, guys. You're trying to build volume here. What's your capacity to deal with that? And I guess I'd say a couple of things. One is think about the number of orders we were putting through during COVID, we are still not at that level. Number two is if you think about our operations, since then, it's at a much better level. Well, I won't go through it again, but we've changed our circle of operations, Dom OS, all of that stuff. So there's still volume upside in a more efficient Domino's. Than we've ever had since I've been here. And, Lauren, I'll just add to what Russell said because you asked specifically what's in the same
Sandeep Reddy: store sales guide. So couple of things. I think on aggregators, it was pretty clear in the prepared remarks that we're expecting a more meaningful impact in the back half. So, yes, that is included in the 3% same-store sales guide. And I think apart from that, we have a slate of initiatives that we're not gonna talk about for competitive reasons. But they're all in the same-store sales guide because we know what those are. And that's part of our expectation. Including two new products. Obviously, we say we're gonna two new products every year, and so there will be two new products. This year. Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your question, please.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Wanted to talk about Domino's positioning. That within that renowned value in the US that you speak about. Clearly, it looks like you're assuming comps reaccelerate to reach the 3% in 2025 versus the looks like, forty basis points in the most recent quarter. And there's already lots of focus on value in the pizza and broader QSR segment. So I'm just wondering you think about two things, one, the delivery side of your business, I would think it's less about value with the surcharges and tips. And at the same time, your QSR competition is aggressively pushing five dollar meals. I would think both those things maybe eat into your value leadership. So just hoping you could talk about the delivery segment's resilience in a challenge macro and your thoughts on the broader non-pizza QSRs pushing a whole lot more value than they were doing twelve, twenty-four months ago. Thank you. Hey, Jeff. You know, the way I think about value, it's relative value. And so relative to ourselves in carryout, delivery is certainly more expensive. You got the fees, you know, hopefully tips for our drivers.
Russell Weiner: Still, when you look at delivery to delivery, it we're very competitive down to the delivery fee and the price, not only to other pizza but really other items you get delivered. If you think about getting a pizza delivered to your house two pizzas delivered to your house, you know, for six ninety-nine each, that's sixteen slices. You're feeding a lot of people. And so when we talk about value and delivery, being a little pressured, especially with the lower-income customer, it's more value compared to our carryout than it is to other delivery choices.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from the line of Jeffrey Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Your question, please?
Jeffrey Farmer: Thank you. You just touched on a little bit of it, but with some of the restaurant earnings calls over the last two weeks, your peers have clearly suggested that the demand headwinds that had largely been isolated to the lower-income cohort for most of 2024. We are beginning to sort of expand beyond just lower income. So how do you see that as you move through 2025 in terms of demand headwinds that might be expanding beyond the lower-income cohort.
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah. I think for us, a couple of things. I'll talk about Domino's then I'll talk about larger restaurant. I mean, we're seeing the cross-income cohort. Be really more of a pressure on one p. Within, you know, within pizza, one p delivery. But if I was just talking about overall QSR Business? And what seems to be happening is there's a new dynamic. You've always heard me talk about kinda down switching. So in a tougher climate, economically, you're gonna see customers maybe go down from more expensive dining options into QSR or pizza. That's continuing to happen. And you've always heard me talk about out switching, right, which is at some point, especially with delivery, when consumers' pressures are assessed that, you know, maybe they want more affordable options deleted home. What we're starting to see now, and this is maybe a little bit less so in pizza than in other parts of QSR what I'll call upswitching. Where the price gap between, you know, let's say, a burger at QSR versus you know, casual dining or fast casual, the price gap those other areas may be more expensive than QSR. But the gap maybe isn't as big as it used to be, and so a customer would be saying, hey. You know what? I'm willing to pay a little bit more because the occasion's gonna be different or maybe the food's gonna be a little bit different. And so there are lots of dynamics that we're following now with customers, the down switching, the out switching, the up switching. Clearly, though, they're looking for a value but maybe I'll maybe this is a good way to end the call. I think one of the things that I keep reiterating with the team is this thought that value is not value. If a customer doesn't value it. What do I mean by that? As folks are driving more value into the marketplace, just because there's price off a certain item, customers don't want that item, then it's really not value. And one of the strengths I think we have at Domino's Pizza is that when you think about our pizza and every single platform we have all of those you can get as part of our mix and match. And I think that's something that's unique to us. It's something we've had for, you know, fourteen, fifteen years, and in the long term, if a customer's having to buy something they don't wanna buy, for the right price, it's gonna start to affect their frequency at a restaurant. So that's why I think long term, I really like what our strategies have brought forth.
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, Jeff. That was our last question of the call.
Russell Weiner: I wanna thank you all for joining our call today, and we look forward to speaking with you all again soon. May now disconnect.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-10 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Domino's Pizza's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Greg Lemenchick, Vice President, Invest Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Lemenchick: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our third quarter conference call. Today's call will begin with our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner, followed by our Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. The call will conclude with a Q&A session. The forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q, both of which are available on our IR website, also apply to our comments on the call today. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. This morning's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. We want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such, we encourage you to ask one question only. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Russell.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. What I'd like to do is begin today's call by giving an overview on the restaurant space as I see it across the globe. When we introduced our Hungry for MORE strategy back in December, we knew consumer spending would be pressured in 2024 and that the QSRs that offered the strongest value would win. That proved to be right, and had Domino's leaning into our strategic pillar of renowned value has been key to our success in 2024, especially in the US. As the year has progressed, competitors have followed our lead, and we've seen increased intensity around value within QSR pizza. I believe value will continue to be in demand from customers around the world and know that you're hearing the same thing from my peers as macroeconomic and geopolitical issues continue to pressure the industry. In these times, I believe the best measure of a company's current and future success are the share gains that it achieves. In Domino's US business, we are doing just that, gaining share. Our team and franchisees are delivering incredible results despite a more challenging environment. Through the first three quarters of the year, our retail sales are up 6.6%, in the QSR pizza category that's growing at less than 2%. Hungry for MORE is driving the critical metric to long-term success in this business, more market share. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth since launching Hungry for MORE, proof that our strategy is working. Importantly, and something I think continues to be unique in the industry right now, it was also our fourth straight quarter of positive order count growth. Profitable order count growth is the key to improving what are already best-in-class economics for our US franchisees. These economics have been a proven driver of store growth as well, which, of course, is another way we drive market share. For example, from 2015 to 2023, Domino's opened approximately 1,750 stores. If you look at our top QSR pizza competitors in aggregate, they closed almost as many stores as we opened during that same time period. Today's order count growth drives tomorrow's order count growth as well, because the strength of Domino's Rewards brings members back for repeat purchases in the future. Domino's Rewards continues to perform well and was a key driver of our US comp performance in Q3. We've officially passed the one-year anniversary of the program, happy anniversary, Sadeep. And I expect it to continue to play a critical role driving the business for the next several years. That's because Domino's Rewards is achieving our goals of driving more light users and carryout customers. In addition, we have grown our overall active members significantly in 2024, allowing us to engage more customers and drive frequency with targeted marketing efforts. Looking to Q4, Domino's will give customers what they are demanding from their QSR brands, more. We opened the quarter with our more [inflation] (ph) deal. At a time where consumers are feeling that they're getting less and paying more, more inflation showed them that Domino's was in their corner, giving them more for less. We follow this up with a 50% off boost week. And next week, one of our biggest renowned value promotions ever will go back on air, Emergency Pizza. While providing value through our own channels is one part of our renowned value barbell strategy, tapping into the aggregator marketplace is the other. In Q3 we saw a nice acceleration as we grew our percentage of US sales coming through Uber to 2.7%. Importantly, incrementality in this channel has continued as expected since these customers have been less sensitive to the economic pressures that I discussed earlier. As you know, Hungry for MORE drives more, though, than just renowned value. New products are an important way that we can bring to life the most delicious food pillar of our strategy. We launched our new mac and cheese in late September. This offering in our pasta lineup is available in five cheese and spicy buffalo, and for those who care, I add a little bacon to mine. We originally launched our pasta platform in 2009, and this is the first time we brought product news to the line since then. I'm excited at what this can mean for mac and cheese and frankly the entire pasta portfolio. A year into Hungry for MORE, I hope our innovation with intent approach to new products is becoming clear to all of you. With mac and cheese and last year's pepperoni stuffed cheesy bread, we're bringing news to reignite our existing non-pizza platforms. And with New York style pizza, we brought in customers who preferred a pizza offering we didn't had in our portfolio. In summary, we're delivering against our Hunger for MORE goals for both sales and stores in the US. With the slate of initiatives we got out in front of us, I continue to believe that we will deliver US same store sales growth of 3% or more annually. And that's why I expect Domino's to continue to drive additional market share gain. Now, I'd like to talk about our international business. Retail sales were up 6.5% through the first three quarters of this year. While that growth is inline with the global pizza category, it is not in line with our expectations, nor our historical performance. Recall, Domino's International has averaged more than 10% global retail sales growth over the past decade through 2023. And while we remain on track for a remarkable 31st straight year of international same store sales growth, the combined impact of macroeconomic pressures, geopolitical issues, and the underperformance we are experiencing is creating a drag on our international sales. Given this performance, we believe planning for approximately 1% to 2% same store sales growth for 2024 and 2025 is a more realistic expectation before we return the business to a more normalized level in 2026. As you know, our international business, which is approximately half our global retail sales, represents less than a third of our profits due to our asset-light master franchising model. As a result of this dynamic, shifts in international sales have less impact on company profits. Therefore, I don't expect the softness in our international business to significantly impact our operating profit goals. And Sandeep will go more into this during his remarks. You should know our team is hard at work with our international master franchisees to create momentum in their markets, even in the face of headwinds. We know what works in today's challenging environment. It's evident in the results that we're achieving in the US. So we're engaging with our master franchisees to implement the strategies and tactics we know will drive incremental sales and profits. In some cases, they've simply been a little bit too slow to react to shifting consumer behaviors. So we're focusing on three key areas, all of them, are centered around renowned value. First, more aggressive promotional pricing that drives a consistent value message to customers. Second, maximizing orders from aggregators, where many of our markets have opportunities remaining to gain their fair share on these platforms. These orders continue to be incremental due to the higher income customer that uses them. And finally, taking a page out of the US playbook, diversify beyond delivery to drive another growth lever in carryout or in some places, dine-in. Our international business has so much potential, and by implementing the plans and strategies I've outlined, we expect to continue to create sales momentum that will produce the same kind of market share gains and net store growth we've achieved in the past. In closing, what I want to do is reinforce with you the same message that I repeatedly share with our team. In the 16 years I've been at Domino's Pizza, we have always been in the business of creating our own tailwinds and driving share growth. That has been, and through our Hungry for MORE strategy, will continue to be how we drive best-in-class results and long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, I'd like to hand it over to Sandeep.
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Russell noted, while our third quarter financial results were impacted by a more challenging backdrop, we still delivered profitable growth. Income from operations increased 5.7% in Q3, excluding the impact of foreign currency of $1.4 million. This increase was primarily due to higher franchise royalty revenues resulting from global retail sales growth and supply chain profit dollar growth as a result of increased auto volumes and procurement productivity. This was partially offset by higher G&A, which was primarily driven by higher labor expenses. Year to date, our operating profit growth, excluding FX, is up a strong 8.6%, which is in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 5.1% in the third quarter from positive US and international comps and global net store growth. Let's take a look at the details. During Q3, total retail sales grew 5.1% in the US, driven by same store sales that came in at 3% with positive order counts for the fourth consecutive quarter. These comps were driven by another strong quarter for carryout of 5.4% and delivery of 1.3%, fueling continued market share gains. We did begin to see macro and competitive pressures impact our results in August, and particularly the low-income customer. Our US same store sales continue to be fueled by transaction growth from Domino's Rewards and our marketing programming. We also benefited from 1.6% of pricing, which was inclusive of high single digits in California. Our sales mix from Uber grew to 2.7% for the quarter. Our comp tailwinds were partially offset by a higher carryout mix, which carries a lower ticket than delivery. Shifting to US unit count, we added 24 net new stores, bringing our US system store count to 6,930. Moving to international, where total retail sales grew 5.1%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. This was driven by net store growth, which was in line with the updated 2024 guidance that we provided on our last call. Same store sales were up 0.8% in the quarter, with a slowdown beginning in August. In the quarter, we saw pressure in our Asia, Europe, and Middle East markets. In Europe and Asia, we continued to see macro impacts in addition to comp impacts in Japan as DPE continues to work through the plans they discussed in their August trading update. Softness in the Middle East was driven by an increased impact from geopolitical tensions. Now turning to our outlook, let me start off by saying that the long-term algorithm of what we believe the Domino's business can and should achieve has not changed. We continue to expect that our algorithm of 7% or more annual global retail sales growth and operating profit growth of 8% or more is the right one as we look out to 2026 to 2028. In evaluating our business in light of increased macro and competitive pressures over the last quarter, we now believe that our global retail sales growth will be approximately 6% in 2024. I'm very proud of how the team has come together to manage our P&L, which is allowing us to maintain a very strong operating profit growth outlook of approximately 8% excluding FX. As we look ahead to 2025, we expect to be slightly below our long-term guidance algorithm, driven primarily by our international business. Our expectations for global retail sales growth are generally in line with our updated expectations for 2024, while still delivering an operating profit growth of approximately 8%. As we noted in our disclosures this morning, we repurchased approximately 443,000 shares at an average price of $429 for a total of $190 million in the third quarter. As we continue to plan for our debt maturity in October 2025, the lower interest rate environment was the driver of the increase in share repurchases in Q3 as we now have more certainty on where we believe the interest rate range will be. In closing, our resilient asset-light model has delivered outsized retail sales and extremely profitable growth over time. I am confident that this model can continue to drive outsized returns for investors. Thank you. We will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Certainly. And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, please limit yourselves to one question each. Our first question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your question please.
David Tarantino: Hi, good morning. My question first is on the unit growth update you gave. It came down for the second straight quarter and I assume most of that's related to international, but could you just maybe explain the moving parts related to the change versus what you shared last quarter? And then, I guess, more importantly, how are you feeling about the ability to kind of ramp back towards your targets in 2025 and beyond?
Sandeep Reddy: Good morning, David. So yes, I think from a guidance perspective, we've updated to 800 to 850 in terms of global net store growth, relative to what we had last time of 825 to 925. I think the biggest driver, honestly, of this was working more closely with DPE and getting much better visibility that enabled us to do two things. One is, tighten the range, and the other is, as we actually get better understandings of what the expectations are in the fourth quarter. I think it made sense to actually update it to a little bit lower than what we had previously, but our visibility continues to get better as we move forward. And this is the kind of effort we'll continue to make as we move into 2025 and continue to update on what our expectations are in 2025 as well as we come into next year.
David Tarantino: And maybe just to follow up. 2025 retail sales being a little below your outlook longer term, is that related to the carryover impacts of the unit growth from this year. I guess the shortfall from unit growth, or are you expecting something lower on the comps and unit growth for next year? I guess I just wanted to clarify that.
Sandeep Reddy: So David, really good question. I think a couple of things going on there. I think Russell talked about in the prepared remarks as well, same store sales expectations for 2024 and 2025 for international we think is somewhere in the 1% to 2% range, which is below what we had initially talked about back in December at the Invest Day. And that's really given the macro pressures that we're dealing with and that we're seeing right now. And that's, I think, a big driver of that lower retail sales expectation. The other driver, of course, is definitely unit growth that we actually are seeing in 2024 that will rollover partially into 2025. And I think as we continue to work through where unit growth is expected to go in 2025, that will have a partial impact in 2025 as well. So, all this is in the consideration set, but really 2025 is really driven by the international business primarily, and that's what we talked about in the prepared remarks.
Russell Weiner: And David, I think I'll maybe just add a little context on how I think about international. And to me that business is judged when you look at three things, when you look at the past, the present, and the future. So in the past, we've got a business that has averaged more than 10% retail sales growth over the last decade. We're about to hit our 31st straight year of positive same store sales. When you think about the present, not a year-to-date that Domino's normally has, but actually in line with the category. We normally do better than the category. We expect to do better than the category, but when there are headwinds, including ones that are self-created, and that's a low point for us. It says a lot about who we are. And the great news is, we're focused on turning things around. We know what we need to do with our master franchisees, really three things. It's all about renowned value, getting that right. We need to make sure that our promotional prices are consistent and they don't go above the CPI in a market. We need to make sure we're getting our fair share of aggregators, the delivery business. And then reminding everyone, we're more than just a pizza delivery company and there are carryout opportunities, there are sit down opportunities and so those are all part of the renowned value strategy that we've been discussing. Which then is why I'm so bullish about the future, a future where we've got 10,000 stores to build in our top 15 international markets alone and we've got these great franchise partners who have a really tremendous history together. So I just wanted to give that aspect, that opinion of our international business to start off.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.
David Palmer: Thanks, guys. I want to ask about the fourth quarter, and really I'm asking about the fourth quarter, but I really have my eye on the general question of your confidence and ability to drive same store sales, excluding these third-party marketing. It looks like your guidance implies 3% US same store sales growth in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can confirm that that's roughly true. And I know people are going to be curious about your confidence in driving that same store to -- that sort of same store sales growth. And just to level set, people see the 3 points tougher comparison on a one-year basis. Obviously, Loyalty launched last year, Emergency Pizza, and I think people are also looking at data, whatever third-party data that they see out there that speaks to a slower start to the quarter. So you clearly feel like you have some growth drivers ahead, so I wanted to get your feeling about that. Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, David. I can tell you, I am so excited about what we are doing for Q4. All you can do is control what you can control. And when I think about our lineup for Q4, it's one of the strongest quarters of marketing since I've been here. You talked about Emergency Pizza. We've got Emergency Pizza 2.0 coming back. We've got the pasta launch. Loyalty is just getting started into its second year. We had a boost. We've got so many things going on here. And that's all you can do is you can lean in with all your marketing programs and with your franchisees. And like I said, I cannot imagine having a better quarter of -- or a better lineup in a quarter than we have right now.
Sandeep Reddy: And I think, David, I'm just going to add on to that, because I think you asked a question on the full year guide for same store sales. As Russell talked about in the prepared remarks, yes, we expect to do on a full year basis 3% or more, and that's specifically what we're talking about. And we aren't talking specifically to Q4. All the initiatives that Russell just mentioned are definitely going to be drivers, and we're really confident in this not just for this year, but across the next five years with the five-year plan. That's why we're reiterating that we're expecting to be 3% or more over Hungry for MORE.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.
Brian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning. Your Uber sales mix grew to 2.7% this quarter, which is very encouraging. It seems like you're on track with your original projections. And I know you have not made a firm decision on DoorDash yet, or at least publicly made a decision, but it does appear it's a matter of if not when. That's what you guys have said. And the question is, do you believe DoorDash has the characteristics and the ability to be a stronger mix than Uber? And number two, is the launch of DoorDash contemplated at all in your 2025 outlook?
Russell Weiner: Yes. Thanks, Brian. As we've said on prior calls, the $1 billion that we think is out there for us contemplates us being on all aggregators, and so that's absolutely on our future. The Uber exclusivity, it's our decision at the end of Q1 what we'd like to do there. You're right though on DoorDash. DoorDash is bigger than Uber, so that would certainly be an incremental and most likely more significant impact on our business than Uber, but we'll take one step at a time. I'm just excited that we've essentially achieved our goal of the 3%. That's our fair share, and our goal remains to exit the year at 3%.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your question please.
Dennis Geiger: Great. Thanks, guys. I want to ask a little bit more on the 2025 guide, specific to the US where it sounds like not a whole lot has changed, and it's really more that international business that has tweaked the 2025 guide. Russell, you just mentioned a bunch of initiatives that you have for 4Q. Can you touch on those some for 2025? I guess you just touched on third party. But I guess thinking about some of those other drivers, loyalty, which I think you have said is a multi-year driver, as well as just high level thinking about marketing and new products next year, any color you can give there specific to the US? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yes, thanks. I mean, obviously I can't go into -- for competitive reasons, I'm not going to go into the specifics, but I guess what I would do is, I'd point you to our Hungry for MORE strategy, which is really the -- kind of the roadmap. And so, we're going to be leaning into renowned value with programs we certainly have in our pocket like, Emergency Pizza, more [inflation] (ph), all those kinds of things can come back, carry out tips if we wanted to. But we also have a really creative team that's inspired by Hungry for MORE and I'm sure they're -- they've got a bunch of other things in their pocket. On products, we talk about having two new products every year, so you should expect that. I think -- I understand why there's the desire to talk about specific programs for next year, but I guess what I would just do is just think about the track record of this team, especially since Hungry for MORE came out, and the roadmap is going to be pretty similar as far as the M, the O, and the R to where it was this year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your question please.
John Ivankoe: Hi. The question is on US unit development. And I do want to ask this context in terms of a slower overall delivery business, the majority of new US stores would open in existing delivery trade areas. So is there any kind of rethinking or maybe repositioning from previous US unit development expectations, especially in 2025. I think the average number was something like 170 or so per year, correct me on that, that's not the true number, but around 170 units per so, is that the number that we should still be kind of thinking about on a year to year to year basis going forward.
Sandeep Reddy: Yes, John, I think we talked about 175 to be precise on the US unit development and I think we're committed to that plan. I mean, we continue to go for the 175. And I think you're right about the delivery was this carryout business and kind of like how that informs the location decisions. But I think Russell is going to add a bit more on that.
Russell Weiner: Yes, John. Hi. Store growth is a critical part to us gaining share. I talked about the first three months -- I'm sorry, first three quarters of this year, essentially us being up 3 times the category in the US. You know what our same store sales are. That means for us to be growing that high, we're getting significant contributions from new stores. And that's a key part of our strategy. When we open up a new store, a significant part of that volume is incremental on the carryout side, especially when we split a store. And then that new store helps us get more efficient on the delivery business. So new stores are absolutely positively part of our overall share growth plan, and I love the progress we're making.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your question please.
Peter Saleh: Great, Thanks. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the weakness you saw by income cohorts, maybe more specifically on the lower income guests. And then just when you think about Emergency Pizza last year, can you just talk about how that resonated with different income cohorts, just so we have an idea how we trend going into 4Q? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yes, Peter. We had another great quarter of not only same store sales growth, but order count growth. Where we saw maybe a little softness was with lower income customers on the delivery side. So just to help give some color there. On Emergency Pizza, you're right, Emergency Pizza 2.0 has some big shoes to fill. But what I'd say is, I've seen the program and if we have big shoes to fill, the program has big feet, maybe with a little bit nail polish on it as well. And so you're going to be more exposed to that, but we're excited about how we're going to lap, I think, one of the better programs in our history.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Sara Senatore: Great. Thank you. Just, I guess, one clarification on a question. The clarification is just on the lower income consumer. I'm trying to understand if things got worse from an aggregate spending perspective or if it's just there's more competition and maybe from other categories pursuing that consumer. And then the real question is this, if I look at the US and like your retail sales growth over the last, call it decade, it's been sort of like $600 million a year in growth. And trying to understand how to think about that in the context of market share and a slower growing category, kind of 2% as you said or less than 2%, you're growing 6%. Should I be thinking about this as like kind of dollar increases every year or is there a reason to think you can accelerate those dollar share gains so that you maintain kind of the market share gain growth that you've seen over time? I know there's a lot in there, but as your store base gets bigger it's just it's harder to sort of grow at that same pace, given the slower growth industry. Thank you.
Russell Weiner: I think there -- what I'll do is, I'll take the first question and maybe have Sandeep lean in on the second one. I think on the lower income customer we're going to have to continue to watch, but my guess is, it's a little bit about both of what you talked about. It's going to be softness on spending. We see what's happening with credit card debt and payments are taking a little bit longer to go through. But we also saw more competitive activity, particularly in August. And I think it was both external and internal. So in August, we saw really through two of our competitors, major competitors, one of them had free delivery. The other one did their version of our Emergency Pizza, obviously qualitatively my preferences for ours. But those were two really good value promotions. Now at the same time, and I know this wasn't part of your question, but I think it's important to explain to everyone on the call, in August we did what we intended to do, which was -- actually we went with a quality message. You remember the [Simon Cowell] (ph) spot that we put on there. And we wanted that quality message for a couple of reasons. One, with Hungry for MORE, in order to deliver on our promise on the M, which is that we're going to have the most delicious food, we have to continue to beat the best, which is us, in operations. And so you'll remember last year we had Summer of Service. This year we've got three product sprints. And so the intent of that ad in August was not only to tell consumers, you know what, we've changed our stores, we've got these quality captains here now to make sure the product is great before it goes in the oven. But it was also the bar was raised for our franchisees. We let them know last year, hey, when we're all done with this training, we're going to go on and we're going to make a promise to customers. And I think that was a little bit added motivation. So in August, what you saw is steps of competitive activity. We went a little bit more towards product quality, but then we very quickly, after about three, four weeks, went into more inflation back to value.
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. And so, I think, Sara, I'm going to just add on the second question that you had on the assumptions in Hungry for MORE. So let's go back to what Russell talked about in the prepared remarks. We are on track for Hungry for MORE. Everything we talked about in December for the US business is very much on track. And what is that? We talked about 3% same store sales annually, which we have again reiterated on this call. We talked about 175 stores annually, which we're again saying is there. You take the math of that, that's roughly mid-single digits growth annually, that's embedded in that. And we talk about a category that's growing 2% that implies significant market share annually. If you run the math based on these assumptions versus let's say a 2% or less category growth, you will see that the rate at which we are going to be increasing market share calibrates very much to what we achieved 2015 to 2023 as you look forward into Hungry for MORE. That is our plan. That's what we're going to be doing.
Russell Weiner: Yes, I agree. Just maybe there's a little bit more context on the category. I think this is achievable not only because of our track record and the programs we have and the franchisees we have, but it's also part and parcel to how the category is made up. So you know, when you think about all the share we've been gaining, we're still slightly south of one in four pizzas delivered in the US. When you think of other categories, the dominant number one player is potentially twice that size and I think we have every right to be there. And then you think, well, about half of the competition in pizza are the independents and some of the regional brands that don't have the marketing budgets we have. They don't have the supply chain efficiencies we have. And so, I think the past, but also the composition of the present, gives us a really nice sense of what the future can look like from a market share perspective.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. Your question, please.
Gregory Francfort: Hey, thanks for the question. Just to move from 7% retail sales growth with 8% operating profit growth to 6% and 8%, maybe can you talk about where you're finding cost efficiencies? I mean, do you expect more out of the supply chain? Do you expect more out of G&A? And maybe what are you looking at for G&A controls? Thanks, appreciate it.
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks, Greg, for the question. Look, I mean, I think when we look at the business and everything we talked about in the remarks earlier, the US business is very much on track. And I think if we look into what's actually happened from a performance perspective, that's actually a significant part of our profit that Russell talked about earlier. And so, where we have seen softness in relative terms is both international business, which obviously is going to have a profit impact, but we've done a lot already during the course of the year to find procurement productivity and supply chain, which we talked about through the first three quarters. And I think as we move into the fourth quarter, we're still very focused on making those critical investments. So we talked about consumer spending, store technology -- sorry, consumer technology, store technology, and capacity investments. All those three buckets are going to be priorities for us, but within that, some may be more urgent from a timing perspective, some may be less urgent. So we're just adjusting our phasing a little bit, and we have levers to pull that we actually have not only pulled in 2024, but also expect to continue pulling in 2025 and that's why we feel very confident that we get to the 8% with the expectation that we have on retail sales in 2025 as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes to the line of Jon Tower from Citi. Your question please.
Jon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was just curious, it looks as if at the current moment consumers are really pivoting aggressively to deal activity within the category and broadly across limited service. And I'm just curious, you mentioned earlier in the US that the category is growing at about 2% or so, and you're growing your retail sales north of 6%. And I was wondering if you could comment on the category and specifically Domino's pricing power over the long term and how you're thinking about that trickling into that 3% annual comp number that you outlined?
Russell Weiner: Yes, Jon, that's a great question. And I think really speaks to our ability to continue to do what we're doing. If you think about having to lean into value, what do you want to make sure you've got? You've got a system with capacity in advertising to get the word out there, right? Because if there's a little bit of a squeeze in store margin, well, the way to make that up is through volume. The way to drive volume is through great advertising. You're going to want to have a great supply chain and make sure that when everyone else is trying to deal the same way, look, I'll be frank [indiscernible] if you look at the competitors' marketing, it's very similar to our marketing, which, I guess it's the serious form of flattery is what they say. But I know our budget is bigger than them from a marketing perspective. I know our supply chain has got fantastic efficiencies on food costs. And most importantly, our franchisees are a really good place from a profit perspective. We ended last year at 162. We're continuing to drive that. And so if you're going to have to lean into value, you want to have the biggest voice, you want to have the best food basket, and you want to have economics that's sustainable through these times, and I think we've got that.
Sandeep Reddy: And Jon, I'm just going to add something, which I think we talked about on previous calls, but I think the question had come up on pricing and what are we doing about pricing. I think what's been incredible about the journey from 2023 to 2024 has been exceptionally smart pricing. 2023 was all about getting the flow through back, after 2022 was very tough year, but 2024, the best pricing we did was almost no pricing, which is inclusive of California, we're at 1.6% in the quarter. This is why we're winning on value, and this is why we'll continue to win on value because not just is it what we've done, this is our intention to be highly disciplined on pricing as we go forward into the rest of Hungry for MORE.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your question, please.
Danilo Gargiulo: Good morning. I have a question and a quick clarification. So, expanding on a previous question, bearing any brand specific leaders that you're deploying to gain market share, why do you think that in a decelerating macro environment the pizza category wouldn't be as resilient despite the fact that it's considered the cheapest product per category? So, in other words, why is the category not growing relevance in the low income consumer because of and not in spite of the macro challenges?
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. So I think, Danilo, what we're seeing is the low-income customer definitely has been impacted by the accumulation of all the pricing that's been taken across multiple years, as we've come out the last couple of years at least. What we are seeing is, we continue to win, but I think we definitely are winning clearly in the carryout business, where our value is very, very compelling. We're definitely winning in 3P, because we've been newly entered over there, and as Russell said, it's a different consumer, a different income cohort potentially where we see good incrementality. What happens with the 1P customer is, you will see some impact when this general pricing levels get high to compress 1P in general. And I think that's one thing we saw in early 2023. We are seeing some of it right now as well. And we acknowledge it, but I think over time, as long as we stay to our principles of continuing to price very well for value to those customers, they will come back and we need to keep focusing on that.
Russell Weiner: Yes, Danilo, I'll just add to that. I think our category does respond to value. I just talked about how in August there was a lot of value and we saw consumers lean into it. I think what we're able to do that other folks can't do in the category is sustain that value. And our ability to sustain that value is why we're significantly outgrowing the category.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christine Cho from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Christine Cho: Yes, thank you so much. So I wanted to double-click on the international markets. I think you mentioned Asia, Europe, and Middle East as pressure points. But I was wondering if you were able to provide a little bit more color on the same store sales growth slow down. So any particular markets that have dragged on overall growth, and how do you expect the trajectory to evolve in the next few quarters? And just on unit growth, outside of what is happening at DPE, is it fair to say that you're seeing mostly inline trends versus your expectations earlier? Thank you so much.
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks for the question, Christine. So, look, I think with same-store sales in the third quarter, as we said earlier in the comments, it was really a slowdown that happened starting in August. And I think we saw just macro pressures in Europe and Asia in particular that we actually called out. We're not going to get into specific market by market trends because so many of our markets are public masters where they're going to have their own disclosures later. But overall across these regions, that's what we saw. And what I will say is, from an expectation standpoint, Russell talked about in the prepared remarks, we're just resetting our expectations for the next 15 months essentially, to say 1% to 2% same store sales growth, because we don't see this macro environment necessarily ameliorating in a very rapid pace. And so that's kind of what's built into our expectations when we talk about lower retail sales growth as well. So coming to your second question on unit growth, look, I think for the -- we talked on the last call about the adjustment and net store guidance being primarily DPE. Essentially, the story hasn't changed. So I think ex DPE, the story is not that much different. And I think really when you think about our overall guidance, DPE is the primary driver.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your question, please.
Chris O'Cull: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. I had a follow-up on the 2025 outlook. The full-year comp guide for this year seems to imply flat-ish comps in the fourth quarter, but I believe you mentioned targeting 3% comps for next year. So I'm just curious, what gives you confidence that comps could accelerate in 2025 from the current trend or what you're currently targeting?
Sandeep Reddy: Yes, so just a clarification before I get into 2025, Chris. We are saying 3% or more on a full year basis for 2024. And so, we aren't being specific on what that means for Q4. Russell gave you this Freedom initiative that we got lined up. The decks are stacked. I mean, we've got every week spoken for, and I think there's a ton of initiatives that we've got going on. And I think to Russell's point on the fourth quarter, our marketing team is already working on 2025. We can't get into very much of the specifics on exactly what all those things are, but we will have an amazing slate of initiatives in 2025. And all that's embedded in the expectations of same stores sales that we have for next year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Salera from Stephens. Your question, please.
Jim Salera: Yes. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to drill down maybe a little bit on -- we talked a lot about the low-income consumer and some of the competitive QSR values that have been in the channel. But anything you can talk about from grocery, we've seen some increase in promo from kind of like frozen pizza and grocery pizza. Just any comments on how that might pull people with the lower income and anything you can think about to kind of retain those consumers?
Russell Weiner: Yes, Jim, I can tell you even when we were seeing some of the macro headwinds back kind of post-COVID against that segment, there really wasn't a lot of interaction with frozen pizza. I think what happens is, at least on the delivery side, a customer will just opt to eat at home, but it has nothing to do really with a frozen pizza promotion. It may be cheaper for them to make the meal at home.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Logan Reich from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.
Logan Reich: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a quick follow up on the 2025 outlook. Is there any sort of assumption on the consumer either improving or maybe just stabilizing into 2025? Or is there sort of expectation that the softness could continue to get worse? I just sort of wanted to get your sense on expectations on the consumer and underlying operating environment in the US for the 2025 guide.
Russell Weiner: Yes, I'll tell you, we really always are leaning in to all the pillars of the Hungry for MORE strategy, no matter what the consumer environment is, because sometimes it's predictable, sometimes it's not predictable. And so, yes, that's what you should expect from us the rest of this year and through next year.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander Slagle from Jefferies. Your question, please.
Alexander Slagle: Hey, thanks. Just on delivery, just with the transactions seemingly turning negative and all the headwinds you're facing there in the first party channel, does this alter your view on where you really want to put your focus, where you're getting the biggest return and share gain? And does it make more sense to really expand the carryout share gains and growth that you're seeing there, even if first party delivery does continue to get weaker?
Russell Weiner: Well, part of our Hungry for MORE strategy was to compete in the full delivery segment, right? We don't do that, or we didn't do that a couple years ago. And so now that we're competing in that area, I really, I kind of look more globally at how are we doing in delivery, First Channel and Uber and about to be others kind of moving forward. But you're right too is no matter how delivery is doing, we're going to be leaning into carryout. Carryout is bigger than delivery for pizza in States. And so, it would make no sense, especially when every other concept seems to be coming towards delivery. Us really leaning into carryout is -- there are not a lot of people doing the opposite. So we're really bullish. We've seen the results in the US. And as I said earlier, now we're taking those results and we're working with our international master franchisees because there's a lot of non-delivery volume out there, whether it's carryout or in places like China and India, sit down. We're a pizza company, and so we're going to compete in every occasion.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Mullan from Piper Sandler. Your question, please.
Brian Mullan: Hey, thank you. Just a question on the menu innovation pipeline. I just want to ask about the potential for a stuffed crust pizza product in the domestic business. If that were a product that Domino's wanted to launch one day, what are some of the operational factors considered at the store level that you'd want to see before you would be ready to launch a product like that? Definitely, do you think a product like that would be well received from a Domino's consumer? Any thoughts would be great.
Russell Weiner: I think it's interesting, Brian. We're the number one pizza company in the world, and we don't have one of the most important, or sorry, one of the larger crust types. So I understand the reason for the question. And just in case you didn't know, we've got stuffed crust in Domino's markets all around the world. So it's not that we're adverse to doing it. It's just -- US got really significant volumes going through the store and operational excellence and quality is a big pillar for us. And so we've chosen so far not to do stuff crust, but that doesn't mean it's off the table. We just need to make sure that the circumstances would be right in the store.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your question, please.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of comments you made about the international system. And I know Russell, you mentioned that you've got kind of three big initiatives that you're working with those franchisees on. Just wondering how you find you're able to influence their behavior. I mean, obviously you're in a hundred international markets, six publicly traded franchisees, just their acceptance or willingness to work with you to kind of presumably reaccelerate that comp trend? And then just to clarify, did you say anything about the 2025 unit outlook? I think you had pulled kind of the long-term component of unit growth and you had said it wouldn't necessarily apply yet in 2025. I'm just wondering whether you've said directionally whether you think 2025 should see more openings than the 800 to 850 that you've now reduced to in 2024. Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Jeff. And you know, you're right, obviously the US, we directly run these international markets. We work with those markets to influence them. And I think when you look at our US results under Hungry for MORE, essentially that started here in Q4. We started rolling out Hungry for MORE at our rally, which I think is pretty much five months ago. And so folks are already in line with their plans for the year. And one of the things they're also going to be looking at is, is this successful? And the beauty is, it is successful in the US. And that's why you're seeing markets, for example, India just talked about on their last call about how they've leaned into value specifically around their delivery fee and how that's really turned the business. I point out to Mexico who's doing a really, really good job leaning into renowned values. So, it's going to happen over time and it's going to happen because we're proving it works.
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. And this second add-on that you had, Jeff. We didn't specify a 2025 store outlook, but we'll get through Q4, come back in February, and then we'll continue to have incremental visibility at that point.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Brian Harbour: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. Could you just comment on -- is franchise store EBITDA for this year still kind of on track with your expectations And if I look at kind of corporate owns store margins, you're kind of back to nice year-over-your growth there, is that directionally consistent with what your franchisees are seeing still?
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. So Brian, thanks for the question. I think when we talk about corporate store margins and corporate store profitability, I think we've addressed this a couple of times before as well. The sample size is so small on corporate stores. It's really not necessarily an analog to what's going on in the franchisees and the franchisee P&L. But we're happy with how much progress we've made on the corporate stores and we expect to continue to make progress for the rest of the year on the corporate stores. But in terms of the franchisees, look, coming into this year, we had best-in-class store profitability and best-in-class returns for franchisee stores. And as we've gone through this year, we've actually continued to do it really well, and franchisee profitability is expected to continue to grow. But I think as far as we're concerned, we're committed to continuing to drive profit growth not just in 2024, but beyond.
Russell Weiner: Yes, I'd also point to, we never stop thinking about franchisee profitability, and we work with them together to do that. So actually next week, you should know we have something we call an economic summit where we bring our franchisees that are part of all of our committees, our marketing, our technology, supply chain operations. And we talk about their business and how to drive the top line and the bottom line. And I think that's really important to be working together so they understand and we can share all the data that over time has proven to be true on how together we can drive their profitability. And I think it's important, I know, I hear from franchisees that it's important that they see us acting in partnership with them and next week's economic summit is going to just do that -- do just that. I'd like to, if you don't mind, since you talked about franchisees, just for a moment, given all that's going on with Hurricane Milton, and we've got franchisees, and stores, and team members in some of these affected areas that we are thinking about them. And Domino's is there for our customers, and we are there for each other. We come together in times like this. We've got this saying at Domino's for decades that this line is, we are the last to close, and we're the first to open. And sometimes when we reopen in times like this, it's not just the heroics of an individual franchisee. It's about the entire Domino's system coming together. So in North Carolina, we have stores that had no electricity and we have franchisees all over the country sending people, sending generators, sending mobile trucks. And so we are there thinking about our team members, our customers. And I'm just so proud of how our team comes together during times like this.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.
Andrew Strelzik: Hey, and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had something along the same lines as the prior question, and it's on labor specifically. As a percent of sales, labor was favorable year-over-year for the first time in a while, so I'm curious what drove that shift, if you're expecting that to continue, if you'll continue to see leverage there. And if you think your franchisees are also seeing that benefit, I know you said it's hard in small sample to draw those lines between your profitability and the franchisees, but labor may be a little bit more in your control, so I'm curious what's going on there. Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks, Andrew. I think you answered the question yourself, which is, I think it's so difficult because there's so many legislative rules in different DMAs and states that I don't think there's a one size fits all in terms of what's going on. Now I'll talk about company stores specifically and if you have been looking at our quarterlies, which I'm sure you have, you've been seeing that we've been dealing with labor pressure for quite a few quarters, but I think now we've started lapping some of those increases that we have to take on labor, and that's why you kind of saw it stabilizing. So there's nothing more to read into that besides we've kind of lapped some of the big increases that we took. But overall we're committed to continuing to drive profit dollar growth on our company stores and I think including any one-time things like insurance, etc., we expect to actually continue to drive margin over time as well.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jeffrey Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Your question, please.
Jeffrey Farmer: Thank you. You did touch on the competitive environment in the US with a couple of questions, but do you expect to see the peer promotional and value efforts sort of further intensify as we get through the balance of 2024 moving into 2025. Meaning, are we sort of in the middle of this surge of promotional activity for the peer group, or do you think it's going to further intensify?
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Jeff. And I'll tell you, first it's funny to see your name pop up there only because we have a franchisee named Jeff Farmer whose brother Pat was actually in the more [indiscernible] I have no idea if you're any related, but it's always nice to see the name Jeff Farmer up on the screen. As far as the competitive activities for the rest of the year, I mean, it's funny that you see a lot of talking about kind of the burger wars. I think we're in the pizza wars right now and again clearly we are winning that. And what the competition is going to have to do to keep up with us is to continue to lean into value. So I'm not sure what they're doing. Obviously, we don't have their plans, but I know what we're doing, and if they want to match us, they're going to have to continue to do that.
Greg Lemenchick: Thank you, Jeff. That was our last question of the call. I want to thank you all for joining our call today, and we look forward to speaking to you all again soon. You may now disconnect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-18 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to Domino's Pizza's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Greg Lemenchick, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Lemenchick : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call will begin with our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner, followed by our Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. The call will conclude with a Q&A session. The forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q, both of which are available on our IR website, also apply to our comments on the call today. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. This morning's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. We want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such, we encourage you to ask one question only. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Russell.
Russell Weiner : Thank you, Greg. And good morning everybody. Our second quarter performance demonstrated once again that our Hungry for MORE strategy, is delivering positive results. For the second straight quarter, we drove US Comp performance in the healthiest way possible through profitable order count growth. Positive order counts in our delivery business, positive order counts in our carryout business, positive order counts across all income cohorts. We also continue to see improvement in our international comps and generated earnings that were in-line with our expectations. As a result of our strong results year-to-date and expectations for the back half of the year, we remain on track to achieve our guidance for annual global retail sales growth of 7% or more and operating profit growth of 8% or more. I want to provide an update on our net store growth guidance, which we temporarily suspended this morning. First, I want to reiterate that our US Pipeline is strong and it continues to grow. We continue to expect 175 or more net new stores annually in 2024 through 2028 in the US. We now expect to fall below our net store growth target for international in 2024 by approximately 175 to 275 stores, primarily as a result of challenges in both openings and closures faced by Domino's Pizza Enterprises, DPE, one of our master franchisees. We're partnering closely with DPE, as they work through this process. Now, it's important to note that our largest expected growth markets of China and India remain on track to deliver on their growth potential. In China, DPC Dash, announced they'll open store number 1,000 by the end of this year, and then they'll increase their net openings per year to between 300 and 350 starting in 2025. Back in May, Jubilant, our master franchisee based out of India, increased its total store count potential to 5,500 over the medium-term in the six global markets in which it operates. When you think that it took Domino's over 60 years to open 5,500 stores in the United States, Jubilant's goal exemplifies the Hungry for MORE mentality, our global system is taking on. Now let's look at our second quarter results through the lens of our MORE, Hungry for MORE pillars, which continue to drive our business. As you know, M stands for the most delicious food. We know we've got the most delicious food in the industry and are focused on showcasing that with more mouth-watering food photography and all of our marketing and our sales channels. We launched our New York Style pizza in Q2, and it's what we call innovation with intent. When we launch a new product, it's got a specific role, and it's intended to stay on the menu permanently. New York Style pizza is another example of that. It's got a crust that's thinner and more foldable than our traditional crust. It was designed to appeal to pizza lovers, whose idea of deliciousness is a little bit different than Domino's Pizza Offerings in the past. The result has been a high mix of sales within our pizza offerings. In addition to being a product that showcases deliciousness in a different way, New York Style Pizza is available as part of our mix-and-match offer. Domino's Rewards members can also redeem 60 points for a free medium two-topping New York Style pizza. This new offering drives more than just deliciousness. It drives value and it drives more customers into our loyalty platform and that's why we call it Innovation with Intent. The O in Hungry for MORE stands for Operational Excellence. This is how we'll deliver on our promise to have the most delicious food, by consistently driving a great experience with our product. As I shared on our last earnings call, in 2024 we're rolling out a new service program we're calling MORE Delicious Operations. This is a series of three-product training sprints focused on our dough, how we build and make our products, and then how we cook them. In Q1, we embarked on our first sprint, which focused on our dough, and are now rolling out our second sprint around ingredients and product builds. These product sprints and last year's Summer of Service, are working together with our [DMOS] (ph) technology to drive improvements in our delivery times. In fact, estimated average delivery times were nearly 10% better in Q2 of 2024 than they were in Q2 of 2022. And we're doing all of this while our stores are handling more orders. So I wanted to congratulate our franchisees and operators, whose commitment to service allows us to deliver on the promise we are striving to make in our marketing that Domino's has the most delicious food. Our third Hungry for More pillar is R for Renowned Value. As I said before, it's not just about having the lowest price in the market, it's about providing value that's innovative and memorable. Renowned Value breaks-through the sea of standard discounts you see in the marketplace. Now Domino's Rewards is an example of that Renowned Value. It continues to perform well and was the key driver of our strong US comp performance in Q2. You will recall our objectives for the program were to drive new users, particularly carryout customers, and increase the frequency of light users. I'm happy to report that Domino's Reward continues to deliver on those objectives. Our active members are up significantly year-to-date through Q2, showing that the program is continuing to build. Redemptions across both the delivery and carryout channels are also increasing, which is contributing to the transaction growth you're seeing in each of our businesses. For example, in our carryout business, orders with a loyalty redemption in the first half of 2024 are twice as high, 2 times, as they were in the first half of 2023 under our old loyalty program. So the Americans continue to look for value Domino's is providing Renowned Value and doing it profitably for our franchises. National promotions are another way we're driving Renowned Value. In Q2, we had two Boost weeks, both of which were very successful in driving transactions and customer acquisition. As it relates to our promotional cadence in 2024, you can continue to expect around six Boost weeks. While providing renowned value through our own channels is one part of our barbell strategy, tapping into the aggregator marketplace is the other. And our launch into this space remains on track to exit the year at 3% or more of sales coming through Uber Eats. Everything we do at Domino's is enhanced by our best-in-class franchisees. They're the E in our Hungry for MORE strategy. In early May, we hosted our largest worldwide rally with almost 9,000 franchisees and team members in attendance. This year's event was appropriately themed Hungry for MORE. We brought the strategy to life across our global system and the results showed. This was our most highly rated rally of all-time. To close, I couldn't be more energized by the future of Domino's Pizza and seeing the excitement of franchisees at our rally really brought that to life for me and the leadership team. Our results show that our strategy is resonating with customers and our system. All of this gives me great confidence that we can continue to drive significant long-term value creation for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn things over to Sandeep.
Sandeep Reddy : Thank you, Russell, and good morning everyone. Our second quarter financial results were right in-line with our expectations. Our strong start to the year has resulted in profit dollar growth versus 2023 for our US Franchisees. We remain on track to achieve our target of $170,000 or more average US Franchise store profit for 2024. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 7.2% in the quarter due to positive US, and international comps and global net store growth. US Retail sales increased 6.8% and international retail sales grew 7.7%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. During Q2, same store sales for the US came in at 4.8%, which was in-line with our expectations. Our strong comps in the quarter for carryout of 7.9% and delivery of 2.7% were once again driven primarily by transaction growth. Our US same store sales continued to be primarily driven by transaction growth from our new loyalty program and our strong marketing programming. We also benefited from 1.5% of pricing, which was inclusive of high single digits in California. Our sales mix from Uber grew to 1.9% for the quarter. The incrementality of Uber sales continues to be in-line with our expectations. Our comp tailwinds were partially offset by a higher carryout mix, which carries a lower ticket than delivery. Shifting to US unit count, we added 32 net new stores in-line with our expectations. This brings our US system store count to 6,906. We remain on track to achieve our 175 or more net store growth target in the United States in 2024, and we anticipate opening our 7,000 store by the end of the year. Shifting to international, where comp results were generally in-line with expectations for the quarter. Same-store sales, excluding foreign currency impact, accelerated to 2.1% in the quarter. The improvement from Q1 was broad-based, as we saw improvements in our Europe, Asia, and Middle East markets. Store counts increased by 143 net stores as we finished the quarter with more than 14,000 international stores. Our net store openings were impacted by softness in DPE, on gross new store openings and closures. Income from operations increased 1.7% in Q2, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency of $2.7 million. This increase was primarily due to higher franchise royalty revenues, resulting from global retail sales growth. This was partially offset by higher G&A, which was primarily driven by higher labor expenses, as well as the company's worldwide rally expense, as communicated on our last quarterly call. I expect the return on this expense to be extremely high, as everyone across our system left engaged, inspired, and ready to drive our Hungry for MORE strategy. Lastly, our margin rate was impacted by 0.3% headwind in Q2, from the tech fee being reduced to [$0.355] (ph) and our ad fund contribution rate increasing back to 6%, as previously communicated. Now turning to our outlook. We continue to expect 7% or more global retail sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, based on the following key items. First, our 2024 US Comp to be above the 3% or more long-term guide, as a result of catalysts in Uber and Loyalty for the full year, and we expect comps to be 3% or more in Q3 and Q4. Specific to Q3, we expect comps to be slightly below what we saw in Q2, on a one-year basis, as we're expecting one less Boost week, partially offset by a continued ramp in Uber. Second, sales for Uber to increase, as marketing and awareness grow and we're expecting to exit the year with an overall sales mix of 3% or more. Third, international comps to accelerate to 3% or more long-term guidance in the back half of the year. As Russell noted, we now expect to fall below our 1,100 or more net new store number for 2024. This is due to challenges in our international business, primarily related to DPE. As we get further visibility into the full effects of DPE's store opens and closures, we will provide an update on the impact to our long-term outlook for 2025 and beyond. We continue to expect an 8% or more year-over-year increase in operating income, excluding the impact of foreign currency. To highlight some of the components. First, for the year you can expect operating income margins to be relatively flat compared to 2023 and to be down slightly in Q3. As a reminder, we are not expecting to see cost leverage in 2024, primarily due to investments we are making in consumer technology, store technology, and supply chain capacity to support future sales growth. Second, we are now expecting supply chain margins to expand compared to the prior year, due to some favorability in the food basket and slightly higher procurement productivity. We are forecasting to come in below the midpoint of our food basket range of 1% to 3% for the year. In Q3, expect supply chain margins to be roughly flat compared to the prior year and down in Q4. Third, the favorability in supply chain margin is being partially offset by pressure within G&A, due to slightly higher investment levels. We continue to expect our G&A as a percentage of global retail sales to be approximately 2.4%. And lastly, we are now expecting the impact of foreign currency to be approximately 1% of operating profit dollars in 2024. We expect this will impact our year-over-year operating profit margins by roughly 20 basis points. As was noted in our disclosure this morning, we did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter. We continue to maintain flexibility due to the volatility of the interest rate environment, as we evaluate our upcoming debt maturity in October of 2025. Thank you. We will now open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your question, please.
Dennis Geiger: Great. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Appreciate it. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the loyalty, what you're seeing there and sort of as we go into the back half of the year. And maybe even into 2025, how are you guys are thinking about that Loyalty program, given the contribution you've seen already this year and what you're expecting kind of again balance of the year -- in the year to how you think about marketing it, promoting it. Thank you guys.
Russell Weiner: Good morning Dennis. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I'll tell you Loyalty for us this year has just been tremendous. If you think about the objectives that we outlined in our Investor Day, we said with the new Loyalty program we wanted to drive light users and frequency there, check. We wanted to continue obviously to drive our delivery customers, obviously we're doing that, but we also wanted to engage our carryout customers, check there. So it really is doing every single thing that we had hoped it would. We'll give a number at the end of the year, as far as new users, but I can tell you the number of new users is increasing. I gave a number in my opening remarks that just to me is indicative of how this is going. So remember, one of the things we said we were going to do is, really use Loyalty to drive carryout. So orders from a carryout perspective, orders with Loyalty redemptions in the first half of this year are twice as high as they were under the old program in the first half of last year. Sandeep talked about how our carryout business is doing and this is one of the big reasons. So just really on all of the objectives, the Loyalty program is delivering what we had hoped.
Sandeep Reddy: One thing I'll add to that, Dennis is we've talked about this previously, but this is a multi-year driver of comps for us. So this year is just the beginning, and as we did in Piece of the Pie Awards when we launched it in 2014, we saw over three years or four years, continuous compounding of comps based on the launch of the program. We expect a similar kind of cadence, as we go through this program as well.
Russell Weiner: Yeah, and when you think about the health of this quarter and how order counts came in so strong. All of those customers are going into the flywheel of this Loyalty program. So today's orders are really tomorrow's sales. And that's why we're so excited about how the Loyalty program is working with everything else that's firing on the business right now.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. As it relates to the unit growth guidance, I understand that the shortfall is primarily related to pressures you're witnessing at DPE, but can you dive into this dynamic a bit more? It just seems like a lot has changed versus when you initiated the long-term outlook at the end of last year. So just trying to better understand how the surprise came about so suddenly versus what you were expecting seven months, eight months ago?
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah, Brian, it's Sandeep. And so I think when you go back to the Investor Day back in December, I think one of the process that we went through was working with all of our master franchisees, including DPE, on the expectations that they had for the business. And we basically calibrated to that for both 2024 and the five-year horizon as well. And at that time, we were completely aligned. So then actually we got into the end of the Q1 call and then we got into the second quarter and we started seeing that relative to our expectations and cadence, both new store openings as well as closures, really started increasing from DPE. And as we saw that, we continued to engage with the DPE team to validate the forecast that we had for the year. And it became pretty clear as we actually went through that conversation and discussion that there was not only the risk to the second quarter that we were seeing, but clearly the outlook was going to be impacted as well. And in fact, just yesterday I think DPE put out a release with a number of closures that they outlined in the Japan and France market in particular, which they're targeting for their first half, which is our second half, which therefore will land in this fiscal year. So apart from what we've seen in second quarter, we expect to see more pressure in the second half of this year. So I think when you take the collective of all of that, It was a pretty material update that we were going to see in the numbers for this year, and we felt it appropriate to update our guidance for 2024. And also you will notice the range is 175 to 275. Why is the range that big? Because I think as we go through the process of not just the closures but the potential openings, the timing of it could potentially shift between our fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. And that's why we're temporarily suspending guidance on the long-term outlook as well apart from this year. So that's kind of what went on in the background, Brian, so you understand that. But I think one of the things I want to just come back to is when we look at our long-term guide, I mean, we're talking about maintaining our GRS growth of 7% plus and our operating income guide of 8% plus. And the reason for this is the store closures that we're talking about are very low volume stores. So when you actually put it all together, the aggregate impact to operating income is really immaterial in the grand scheme of things. And so that's why we're very confident in our operating income guidance. And we are reiterating that as you saw this morning.
Russell Weiner: And Brian, I would just add to that. I think what this shows me is how many levers we have to grow this business. And so, you know, certainly we're working with DPE, but let me just put some of this in perspective. So our sales and stores are still on target for the 7%, I'm sorry, our sales and non-profit for the 7% plus and the 8% plus. And with those headwinds in DPE, that means we have a lot of other things firing. And so just maybe I'll start with development. So at the same time as we have this DPE news, we have news that China and India are increasing their outlook. We've got today 14,000 stores, half of those stores we've opened since 2015. And so the momentum we have on our way to 40,000 stores, which is a lot more room for us, is tremendous. Then when you think about our development in the US, obviously we're, as Sandeep said in his remarks, 175 plus is still our target this year that we're going to hit. And when you think about the strength of development, openings are really important. So are closings. And in the trailing 12 months in the US, we've closed only seven stores out of a total about 7,000. And so development I think overall is pretty healthy and like I said we've got these other things firing at the same time, which is why our sales and profit numbers are still coming in at forecast.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your question, please.
David Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. My question is a follow-up, Russell on your comments about the outlook for the year being unchanged. I guess we've seen signs that consumer spending is slowing certainly in parts of the restaurant industry. And it feels like the degree of difficulty in the US has increased. So I just wanted to ask you to give some commentary on why you're so confident in holding those targets for this year? And whether you think the degree of difficulty is higher or unchanged versus what you were thinking previously. Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yeah, thanks, David. To me, the best predictor of the future, even though I have a lawyer in the room, who probably tells me I can't say this, is what's happened. And you're right about consumer spending slow, but let's think about what's happened with that as a backdrop. We've grown orders in our delivery business, our carryout business, every income cohort. We haven't talked about international, but we've grown order count in international. And so that's what's going on in an economy where folks are kind of maybe struggling to decide what to buy. And so if order counts are positive in that scenario, then as the momentum swings eventually, I expect our momentum to continue. So what you do when times are tough, to me that talks about the strength of the brand and that's why I just could not be more excited about how we delivered the results for the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Sundeep, you talked about how the 3Q comps in the US, are expected to trail 2Q levels, and just given these are comparisons, I'm curious if that reflects what you're observing so far this quarter, or if it's more just forward-looking around your expectation just given one less Boost week in 3Q.
Sandeep Reddy: Andrew, thanks for the question. I think, no, it's more about what I talked about in the prepared remarks, which is we do have one less Boost week. We do have the ramp in Uber, but on a net basis it's slightly below what we saw in Q2 as our expectation for Q3. But I'll go back to Russell's previous answer. We are seeing tremendous performance in terms of transaction growth for the entire first half, and we're expecting to see that same performance in the entire second half. And so we're very confident in the ability of our business to deliver the kind of momentum that you've seen already in the first half, in the back half, including Q3.
Operator: Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore. Your question, please.
David Palmer: Thanks, Good morning. I guess the question is about, I'll make it a kind of a two-parter. It looks like the sales trends are pretty volatile in the US from the data that we see for example, things look like they were weaker in April, when you didn't have sort of a value forward-message like Emergency Pizza where the $3 tip. Could you kind of reflect on the quarter and what you are seeing in terms of the consumer response to stuff? And maybe give us a sense of what you think is working and not working in the US? And then separately I think people are going to be concerned about the fourth quarter if the third quarter is worse than this quarter, maybe let's say, you do a 4% in the third quarter, I think people are going to be concerned about you holding that 3%-plus in the fourth quarter given the comparison. So maybe you can address both of those. Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yes, sure, maybe I'll give it a shot and Sandeep if I miss anything. As far as the volatility in the short-term, I think we look at quarters not days and obviously, years as well. And there are always some balancing news based on everything from weather to what we put out there. And so I like your -- the second part of your question was just kind of big picture, what's working and what's not working. What's working is the Hungry for MORE strategy. And I'll give you an example, maybe using one of the things we are doing this year, as we talked about was we are going to launch two new products. So we just launched the New York Style Pizza. New York Style Pizza is all about the most delicious food. It is an Innovation with Intent. There are believe it or not, some people out there who don't love our traditional crust. So this is an incremental crust, more foldable hopefully bring new people in the fold. At the same time that new product is delivered in better delivery times than it was two years ago. That's Operational Excellence. It is part of our Mix & Match promotion. It is also part of our Loyalty program, Renowned Value. And so what we're doing, David is really tethering all these things together. There is never anything that's firing one cylinder on its own. There truly is a Domino effect of connectivity between all the programs we have going on right now. From a [non-working] (ph) perspective, I mean, we're always Hungry for MORE. That's kind of the bumper sticker of this company. But I've been here 15 years, 16 years, and I know what drives the business. It is orders, it's stores, it's market share. And the orders that you've seen, the stores that you are seeing are -- just think about what traditional growth has been for the pizza category. We are going to be big winners from a share perspective. And once you do that, everything grows, your franchisee profitability grows, your advertising fund grows, you get a moat and our moat is filled right now with orders and stores and franchisee profits.
Sandeep Reddy: David, I'll just try to answer -- just clarifying a couple of the points. I mean you talked about volatility in sales spend in the US, we didn't see any volatility. We saw a very steady cadence. And the steady cadence of sales is really driven by the flywheel that Russell talked about on the Loyalty program and the frequency that's continuing to build from there. We've seen that pretty consistently across the year frankly, including the second quarter. So we don't see the volatility at all. And I think the other question that you asked was the confidence in the Q4 comp, and as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect both Q3 and Q4 to be above the 3%. So -- but I just explained that Q3 maybe slightly below Q2 because of the timing of the Boost -- of the number of Boost weeks offset by Uber's ramp. Now going to Q4, one of the things we talked about earlier was that loyalty is going to be a multi-year driver for us. So sure, we are lapping in Q4, the Loyalty program launch, but we still expect to be seeing tailwinds in the compounding impact from the Loyalty program in Q4. In addition, Uber continues to build. And so with both those drivers, there is every case to look at 3% or more is very, very much within reach in the fourth quarter, and we always Hungry for MORE. So the more we do, the better it is. So we're really confident. And because this is all transaction driven, it's really driving very strong economics. So franchisee profitability continues to grow. And I think that's actually driven by a significant performance on the supply chain side also, which is you are seeing on the supply chain financials that's going into the franchisee profits. So overall, very confident of our outlook for the back half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the value strategy. So you talked about the one Boost week in the third quarter that leads to I believe, one in the fourth quarter, clearly driving strong performance. Given the value focus in the industry, what flexibility do you have to further increase promotional activity? And then are you seeing any increase in value mix and how much is going through deals?
Russell Weiner: Yes, Lauren thanks for the question. I think what we're doing in value is very special, and it is very different than what you are seeing in the industry right now, which I think folks, it is clear that there's been price taken. And folks are dealing back kind of individual items, telling customers, hey, this is what you can get on value. What we've done, and we've done this since 2009, when we launched Mix & Match. Our Mix & Match offer, value is two things. Value is the price, but it's the price for what you want. It's the price for what you want is high and the price for something you don't want is not high, that doesn't really do much. And so when you think about all of our platforms, you think about pizza, you think about pasta, sandwiches, desserts, salads, breads, chickens, all of those things consistently have been part of our promotional value play since the end of 2009. And having that consistency when people wake up in the morning and decide where they want to order, they know that they can trust Domino's. That trusted value is leading to the order count you're seeing. And then they become part of that loyalty flywheel. And so I just -- I think it's important to make sure we explain our approach to value is not just price. It's about price for what people actually want to order. And that's, as you've seen over this time period, a very sustainable way to grow.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. Your question please.
Gregory Francfort: Hi, Russ, I love the Domino effect reference there. But I just had a question on the incrementality of Uber and just some of the commentary there. I think you've had it for about nine months. Can you talk about what you've learned and maybe how you are changing some of the marketing message over the last maybe three months or six months? And then any update on thoughts on DoorDash in the next year? Should we still expect something on that and maybe what the timing would look like? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Greg, and we are going to send you the Domino effect bumper sticker after this, so you want to look after that. Uber is performing as we thought it would. It is doing so in a little bit of a different way. And I talked about it last quarter, but I think it is worth bringing up again. So first, from a sales perspective, it's about 1.9% of sales. And our – we are tracking towards our goal this year of 3% of sales. How it’s coming is a little bit different. And what we've seen is really an uptick more in a high-low strategy, originally our approach was okay, if we have kind of an everyday low price, not compared to our channels, right? Still the lowest price Loyalty program in our channel. That would be the way to win. But actually, it's -- whether it's how customers shop or part of the algorithm or a little bit of both, starting out with a slightly higher price that you can discount from, is a way to get more eyeballs. And so we've continued to test and pivot that way, and you are seeing it in the results. So again, we're -- the year is folding like we thought it would. And so what that leaves us with your question about DoorDash is the current exclusivity with Uber runs through Q1. At that point, whether or not we renew is our choice, and so we'll be looking at the economics and potential at that point. But that would be the time to think about do we stay exclusive? Or do we open up to a DoorDash or other aggregators. We've talked about the $1 billion opportunity for us is really our fair share on all of the aggregators, which in about three years or so is what we hope to get to.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your question please.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. Especially in the context of closures in France and in Japan. I asked about impacts of store splits in the US, you are currently at around 2.5% store growth rate in the US, which is actually high for a fairly mature brand. So talk about what you see as net I guess, cannibalization or whatever you want to call it, what negative impact on same-store sales from store splits. And is there any learning I guess, either side of the Atlantic or either side of the Pacific, as it may be in terms of who is learning for -- who is learning from who in terms of how markets can be penetrated? Is that -- that they didn't necessarily follow the same site model that you do? Or do you have any opportunities to kind of look at them in terms of how densely markets can be penetrated? I just want to I guess, have a sense of your level of risk acceptance in terms of hitting your US store targets without overly encroaching on your existing current asset base? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yes, John I'll take that. And maybe I'd start with the fact that I remember when we used to actually disclose what headwinds of splits were. So the fact that we are not disclosing them anymore, I can give you a sense of -- of how material they are. The great thing about the Domino's model and us leaning into carryout about a decade ago is 80%, when you split a store, 80% of the carryout volume is incremental. And so that right away when you are splitting a territory, you are getting all these customers. Those customers, they don't want to drive past four pizza places on their way to a Domino's. And so the more Domino's we have, the more carryout business we drive, and you can see how on fire carryout is the number that Sandeep took you through was same-store sales for carryout. That has nothing to do with all the carryout sales we're driving from new stores. And then what happens when you split these stores, not only does your carryout business get better. But remember, I talked earlier about our delivery time being 10% better than they were two years ago? Sure, it's a lot of the programs that we are driving with our franchisees, but it's also when you split stores, you get closer to your customers. And when you have more consistent delivery, those customers come back more. So it really is a – it is a wonderful cycle when it's really going well. And actually, one what I'd say is because you had asked about international learnings, one that -- DPE was one of the first folks to do in Australia. They got a 50% market share in Australia and a lot of it was through penetration with new stores and obviously, tightening their delivery areas, growing their carryout business. What they talked about that they saw in Japan was they probably split a little too fast. But doing it strategically over time has been a winning formula. They've shown it and I think that's been a huge driver of our market share.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your question please.
Sara Senatore: Thank you. I have actually sort of one just clarification and then a question on the new restaurant growth. So the clarification was just quickly on the pricing versus cost inflation and whether franchisees are seeing something similar. Obviously, you are still on track for the franchisee profitability targets, but pretty modest price increase that clearly didn't cover inflation for labor insurance. Is that kind of the dynamic that we should expect to see broadly going forward? Or was there anything kind of one-time in this quarter that specifically perhaps around insurance? But then the question on net restaurant growth is about -- you mentioned strength in China and India. Could you just maybe in broad strokes, talk about what volumes look like in different parts of the world. So a closure in Australia presumably is a higher volume or let's say, lack of openings in Australia, more of a hit to volumes for retail sales overall than perhaps openings in China and India, I mean that would be my guess, but perhaps that's not accurate. Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: So Sara, let me start with clarification on pricing versus cost inflation. I think you're talking about the corporate stores, particularly. And really if you look at what happened on the corporate stores, and we had an insurance charge in the quarter that actually resulted in margins contracting. And if you actually strip out that insurance charge, margins were roughly flat and profit dollars grew. And really speaking, when we look at our franchisee profitability, that's pretty much a dynamic. We are looking at profit dollar growth, and that's exactly what we're expecting to see. And frankly, we expect to see that in corporate stores as well, as we actually go through the year. We continue to expect to see both margin improvement, as well as profit dollar growth on the corporate stores as well. And then I think specific to restaurant growth in China and India and your comment on the size of the stores, the closures that we're talking about essentially are very low-volume stores. So from that perspective, I think they're not necessarily comparable to the averages across all of the different markets. And so I think the drag is relatively small with the closures that we're talking about, specifically in Japan and France. And the growth opportunities continue to be robust. And the China stores, they've actually put out releases talking about their new store openings and the kind of record sales they're generating over there. So very exciting to see the growth coming from China.
Russell Weiner: And I'd add to that Sara, for us -- and I think really for the industry, when you think about the best way to cover cost inflation, assuming margins are in the area of where they should be, the best way to do that is by driving order count versus price. And so cost inflation for some folks may be a negative thing. For us, given our scale because we can drive more order counts, if we can get away with doing that without pricing and getting frequency, we are going to do that all day, and that's what's happened. And I look -- I just want to give a nod to our insights team because one of the questions earlier about pricing in this environment right now and headwinds with the customer. Well, with through our research, we knew we figured out when it was time to take price, and we also figured out, when it was time not to take price. And all of those decisions are what's leading into the results you see now, and it will continue to drive what we decide to do moving forward. Now the best piece of it too, is the research, a lot of it is -- its numbers. But then it gets translated to real life when you put it down to the stores. And then what you do is you watch what consumers do and you watch what your franchisees do. And what's been great is obviously, the order counts. So consumers are happy. But franchisees who are sticking with the recommendations not only obviously on our national offer but local offers and menu pricing. And so this is something that I think, is proprietary for us and has worked and will continue to work over time.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your question please.
Danilo Gargiulo: I was wondering if you can give a little bit more color on what you think, at least in your view, will it causing the softness in unit opening by DPE? And more specifically also, if you can share what is your level of confidence that international store openings and closure pressures is going to be limited only to DPE and that we are not going to see another potential reduction in the guidance later on with other master franchisees coming softer versus your original expectation. Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yes. Danilo, I'll let DPE's release kind of speak to what they are thinking about those closures. So they talked about Japan being a little bit aggressive in openings and now they are seeing kind of the results of that. What gives me confidence about the rest of the piece of the algorithm as an example, I said earlier DPC China, DASH and Jubilant, they're going to be 40% to 50% of our openings, and they each increased their outlook. And so the beauty of being in over 90 countries around the world is, look, I'm not trying to look away from what clearly was a miss in one part of the business. But a good business is able to kind of handle that. And that's what being 90-plus markets helps us do. And all of these levers, end up leading to the 7% plus on the sales basis and the 8% plus on a profit basis really show how that is made up in times like this. Anything to add Sandeep?
Sandeep Reddy: No.
Russell Weiner: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your question please.
Peter Saleh: Yeah. Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the -- you guys mentioned positive order counts in both delivery and carryout in the US. Can you just talk a little bit about -- are these new customers? Are these lapsed users? And just any thoughts on that call, lower income consumer. Are you seeing -- I know you said you were seeing growth across all income cohorts. But any thoughts on what you are seeing there. Is that accelerating? Is it stable? I guess that's my first question. And then just a follow-up on that, on the store closures from DPE, Sandeep, you said they're very low volume. Is there any way to give us an order of magnitude of how low these stores are in terms of volumes just so that we understand. Thank you very much.
Russell Weiner: Yes. Maybe Sandeep, you can -- the other way to look at that is just talk about the profit impact.
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. No -- I think on the -- let me start with the second part of the question right, which is the store volumes and what's going to happen. Very low volume in relative terms to the rest of the fleet and the rest of the market in all the stores that are closing in Japan and France. So the impact is so material to the profit number. It's in a few million dollars and on a forward basis for 2025, and will have a very limited impact even on 2024, considering we’re only halfway through the year. So very small to answer your question from that Peter.
Russell Weiner: Yes. And Peter, just on the first question, what I'd say about the order count, and I try to stress this by giving the specifics of delivery and carryout in every income segment is we've got some of the most balanced order count I've ever seen. And I believe that is also true for the -- not only in our history, but also just in the industry right now. Your specific question on the lower-income customer, you have -- the order count there is positive as well. And part of that was intent not only from our pricing, but as we put the Loyalty program together. Remember you used to have to have two things. You had to buy $10 worth of food to get any points. Now it's $5. So that hurdle is a little bit easier. You used to have to buy six times to get something free. Now you can buy -- get some free after two orders, which is great for the customer, actually great for our franchisee too, because the margin on the 20-point and 30-point item is much better on those orders than the 60. So what it is not like we just kind of fell into this. This was intent in both the design of our pricing and the design of our loyalty program and it's not going away.
Sandeep Reddy: And the beautiful thing, Pete, is it is so balanced across all income cohorts. And I think it really reflects what Russell is talking about. And that consistency has been seen all through the first half of the year.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your question please.
Chris O'Cull: Yeah. Good morning guys. Also. Just given the success of the New York Style Pizza, can you talk more about this innovation with intent strategy? And it is just part of that answer, can you maybe touch on whether the innovation you expect to launch later this year, we'll leverage that approach?
Russell Weiner: Yes. Sure, Chris. Well, I will tell you the one thing that did not drive New York Style Pizza was the guy in the spot, which for those of you who don't know, was me. Sandeep keeps telling me I have a face for radio. So we'll see when it's time for your performance review, how that works out. But yes, so New York Style Pizza, this idea of Innovation with Intent. If you look back the last 15 years, 16 years at Domino's, there are -- I can't think of more than two items that -- products that we've launched that we've taken off the menu. Launching a new product takes a lot of money, it takes a lot of time. And so there needs to be a strategic role in it. Whether or not you were successful is whether or not that items are still there. So you think about -- I'm not going to really give you any forward-looking of it to say, again, we're going to continue to do two a year. New York Style Pizza right? We talked about this is a customer that may not like our traditional crust as much. So there's a reason for doing it. If you think about what we did last year with Pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread, Okay. Putting Pepperoni and something is probably not the most innovative thing in the world. But guess what? It reminded people that we have Stuffed Cheesy Bread. And when you have all of these platforms -- and remember Chris, 40% of what we sell is not pizza. You got to figure out a way to continue to talk about pizza, but continue to remind people that you have these platforms. And so maybe those are two good examples of intent. One is going after a customer that probably doesn't frequent Domino's. And the other is reminding people of a platform that when they add to their order, is increased the ticket and is more profitable for our franchisees.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Brian Harbour: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning guys. If I could just follow up on some of the comments about store margins. So if you kind of set aside that insurance impact, I mean, is this mostly just about there being still pretty significant wage inflation? Do you think that's kind of the case through the balance of this year? Obviously, you did have order count growth right? But it sounds like that's kind of being offset on the labor side. And I don't know if maybe there is any sort of product mix dynamics that have also affected that. Could you just talk more about the store margin dynamics?
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. So Brian, I think the thing that the company stores is actually it's a much smaller data set, right, because we've only got about [6 DMAs] (ph) in which we're operating. And yes, there was some wage pressure that we were actually dealing with as we went through the first half. But we are getting closer to lapping some of those -- the wage pressures that we took. And overall, -- when you look at the economics of the stores, they actually, on a first half basis, still pretty good and definitely [ex the insurance] (ph) adjustment, still expanding and growing. We expect that to continue to happen. That's why I said for the full year on the company stores, I still expect our margins to be better and our profit dollars to grow. And I think being -- what I want to emphasize is we shouldn't view company stores as an analog to what's happening on the franchisee stores because the data set is so limited in relative terms. On the franchisee stores, we are seeing very, very balanced profit growth across the business. And we -- and that's what gives us confidence that the $170,000 or more is definitely on track.
Russell Weiner: Yes. And I'll just maybe build on that question on the lab just reminds me of an earlier question we had about Q4 and emergency pizza and how we are going to lap that potential headwind. And I guess what I'd say there is, we are in the business of creating headwinds I love the questions on headwinds because that means we did something really successful that folks are wondering, how are we going to overlap. Well, we are in a business that are creating headwinds, and we are in the business of beating those headwinds. And so I'm not concerned about that. And I know what the team has going and they're up for the challenge. And if you think about emergency pizza, during this time now where you are seeing a lot of price out there from folks I think who has what price point is going to be, as I always talk about the sea of standard. How are you going to know when an ad is over, who owned this particular price point. Everyone in the country knows who owns Emergency Pizza. And so we have things like that, carryout tips, You Tip, We Tip, that's renowned value. And so there are as you see more and more discounts to customers as, I think, different restaurants are adjusting to pricing, I believe there is going to be a lot of noise in that. And what our team does really breaks through that noise.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Todd Brooks from The Benchmark Company.
Todd Brooks: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on Loyalty Sandeep, I think when you talked about loyalty last quarter that you talked about the 20 and 40 point reward tiers as being the majority of redemptions. I wanted to see if that trend is continuing to go going forward? And with enough time passing. Do you have a sense that somebody that redeems at a lower point level tends to continue to do so. So it is almost a faster frequency flywheel coming from loyalty, if those customers stick at those lower redemption tiers? Thank you.
Sandeep Reddy: So Todd, you asked the question and answered it yourself. And really, it is exactly that. We have been seeing very consistent trends in terms of the redemption of the 20 and 40-point levels, and it is driving that frequency flywheel, as we go along because they're continuing to transact and redeem. And that's what we are very confident on continuing as we move forward into a multiyear flywheel.
Russell Weiner: Yes. And back to the question before, Todd that reminds me of the Innovation with Intent has -- Innovation with Intent is not just new products. It's a Loyalty program and how you put your Renowned Value together. So with Emergency Pizza, if you recall, you buy a Pizza, you can get a free one in a month. Well, you do that, all of a sudden, you're part of our Loyalty program. You're at 20 points, you're getting a free item. With our tipping program, either carryout or delivery one, if you buy one, you're part of the program. You then use your tip, you've got a second item if you're part of the Loyalty program and you're redeeming. The most important thing about our new Loyalty program is getting people to understand how easy it is to earn. And the programs that we are putting out there aren't just driving sales. They are driving that clarity for folks about, wow I can get stuff really quick.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Christine Cho from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Christine Cho: Hi, thank you. So I know you have just had the worldwide rally in May. So really curious to hear some of your key takes from the event? Or were there any surprises? What are the areas that your franchisees around the world are most excited about, most worried about any common strategic priorities that have come up there would be great. Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yes, Christine, this was a fantastic rally. And it's not just me saying it. Here's -- I'll give you some numbers on it. We do quantative studies on everything here at Domino's, who we do it on a rally. It was the highest rally we've ever had as far as people. But the scores of attendee is we've never had a higher one. And this one blew my mind. I will get you that later if I'm sharing something I shouldn't. But one of the things we ask people is what was the -- did you take away the key message. And the results there were 98% took away a key message. We've never had numbers anywhere like that. And the cool thing was people were leaving to rally. A lot of times you do these rallies and whatever they are called, like the bumper sticker we are going to send out earlier, it really is more, what does the [t-shirt] (ph) look like or what do people shout. Hungry for MORE is more than that, folks came away knowing what jobs they needed to do. And so the really cool part for me were, for example, the US franchisees leaving and saying, I got it. I'm responsible for the M and the O. Making sure the food, we make it delicious and we deliver it the right way. We had international franchisees saying, oh, this idea of renowned value is really, really interesting. And what happened? We went back and you've seen changes in the marketing in a lot of our international markets because of Hungry for MORE. And so I just -- I believe it not only talks about the strength of our system. It is nice to have profitable franchisees all in one place, they're all pretty happy. But when they come away talking about the future, is what makes us really excited.
Greg Lemenchick: Thank you, Christine. That was our last question of the call. I want to thank you all for joining our call today, and we look forward to speaking with you all again soon. You may now disconnect.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-29 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Domino's Pizza's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. 
 And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Greg Lemenchick, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 
Greg Lemenchick: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. Today's call will begin with our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner; followed by our Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. The call will conclude with a Q&A session. The forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q, both of which are available on our IR website, also apply to our comments on the call today. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. 
 For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. This morning's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. We want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such, With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Russell. 
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Our Q1 results demonstrated that our Hungry for more strategy is delivering on its promise, driving more sales, more stores and more profit. We drove strong comp performance in the U.S. that flowed through to the bottom line with double-digit profit growth. And our growth in the U.S. came through positive order counts across all income cohorts in both our carryout and delivery segment. We saw the largest growth in our lower income cohorts that are undoubtedly benefiting from the renowned value that we're offering.  
 I'd like to highlight our first quarter results through the lens of our M-O-R-E, Hungry for MORE pillars. As you know, M stands for most delicious food. We know we have the most delicious food in the industry and are focused on showcasing that with more mouthwatering food photography in all of our marketing and sales channels. We also ran a campaign that highlighted our pan pizza, a premium product that brought news to this cross type for the first time since 2014. And I'm excited to announce that our first product innovation of the year New York Style Pizza launches on air today. The idea for New York Style came from customers who prefer a thinner, more foldable crust, than our traditional hand tossed.  
 And we believe that this new crust style will drive incremental occasions. We'll also drive deliciousness as the foldable crust, that just focus more on our incredible toppings, including a really unique blend of Provolone cheese that comes on every New York style pizza. Additionally, this crust option will be available as part of our mix and match offer, and Domino's Rewards members can redeem 60 points for free medium 2-topping New York Style Pizza as well. This is another example of how innovation is designed to drive value and more customers into our loyalty platform. 
 The O in Hungary for MORE stands for operational excellence. This is how we'll deliver on our promise to have the most delicious food by consistently driving a great experience with our products. As I shared on our last earnings call, in 2024 we're rolling out a new service program. We're calling more delicious operations, a series of 3 product training sprints that focused on our dough, how we build and make our products and how we cook them. In Q1, we embarked on our first sprint, which focused on our dough and rolled this out across all 6,800-plus stores in the U.S. We continue to see benefits from our service initiatives. And in Q1, we actually delivered more pizzas than we did in Q1 of last year at improved delivery times. I am just so proud of our operators.  
 Our third Hungry for MORE pillar is R for renowned value. I want to expand on what renowned value means to us at Domino's. It's not about just having the lowest price in the market, it's about providing value that's innovative and that's memorable. Renowned value breaks through the [indiscernible] discounts that you see in the marketplace. Value the buy one, get 1 free, renowned value reinvents this mechanic and creates emergency pizza. Emergency pizza performed better than any buy one get one free in my career, was a meaningful driver to our comps in both Q4 of '23 and in Q1. And it not only drove increased orders, but also the acquisition of members into our loyalty program. 
 Domino's Rewards continues to perform extremely well and was the key driver of our strong U.S. comp performance. The program is delivering on our objectives. Active member growth rates are up significantly since the launch of our new program. From a percentage standpoint, our biggest increases are coming from new labs and light customers. So we're bringing these new customers into the fold. I'm particularly pleased with the increase in carryout customers made possible in part by our reduced $5 minimum spend for earning point.  
 Once customers become members, they're redeeming more than ever before, and increases are being seen across all of our channels, delivery and carryout. Our new 20 and 40-point redemption tiers are doing exactly what we hoped. They're engaging more customers. These 2 tiers now combined for the majority of the redemptions in Domino's Rewards. And the program has driven incremental profit dollars for franchisees. So customers are getting more, and our franchisees have earned more profits, truly a win-win. We believe Domino's Rewards will continue to be a meaningful sales driver for us in 2024 and beyond. 
 National promotions are another way we're driving renowned value. In Q1, we brought back our carryout special boost week for the first time since January 2020, and its performance exceeded our expectations.  
 Clearly, customers want value, and we are driving it profitably for our franchisees. Now as it relates to our promotional cadence in 2024, you can expect it to be consistent with what we did in 2019. As part of that, you can expect around 6 boost weeks. As a reminder, these boost weeks are a proven customer acquisition tool that drives both short- and long-term benefits for our brand. And we're seeing the same commitment to providing renowned value internationally. Some of our best performing markets are getting this right. As an example, our master franchisee in Mexico has run very successful boost week campaigns that have driven outstanding order and sales growth. While providing renowned value through our own channels is one part of our barbell strategy, tapping into the aggregator marketplace is the other.  
 Our launch into the aggregator space remains on track to exit the year at 3% or more of sales coming through UberEATS. Now that we're a quarter into our full launch, I want to share a few insights on what we're seeing. Incrementality has been in line with our expectations. In addition, we're seeing a higher percentage of single user transactions on Uber than we've seen on our own channels.  
 Further, this channel is becoming more promotional. Customer responses to deals are stronger than to everyday low prices. As a result, we are continuing to work to fine-tune our marketing spend and our offers that we are effectively driving this channel. We remain focused on driving profitable transactions through UberEATS, while ensuring that the best values for our customers remain on our own channels. 
 Everything we do at Domino's is enhanced by our best-in-class franchisees, the E in our Hungary for MORE strategy. We'll be hosting thousands of franchisees for our worldwide rally in May, where we plan to bring our Hungry For MORE strategy to life across our global system. I can't wait for that gathering as our franchisees are what makes Domino's so special. They were the inspiration behind Hungary for MORE.  
 So to close, I couldn't be more excited about 2024 and beyond for Domino's Pizza. Our first quarter results clearly show that our strategy is resonating with customers. This gives me great confidence that we can deliver against our short- and long-term Hungry For MORE goals and drive significant value creation for our shareholders.  
 With that, I'll turn things over to Sandeep. 
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, Russell, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter financial results demonstrate how powerful our model can be when we drive profitable transaction growth. The smart pricing we took in 2022 and 2023 has kept us at a great value to our customers in 2024, while being profitable for our franchisees. This has resulted in profit dollar growth versus 2023 for our U.S. franchisees so far this year. We remain on track to achieve our target of $170,000 average U.S. franchise store profit for 2024. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 7.3% due to positive U.S. and international comps and global net store growth.  
 U.S. retail sales increased 7.8% and international retail sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency, grew 6.8%. During Q1, same-store sales for the U.S. saw a meaningful increase of 5.6%. Our strong comps in the quarter for carryout of 9.5% and delivery of 2.9% were driven primarily by transaction growth. As Russell mentioned in his remarks, the increase in U.S. same-store sales was driven by transaction growth from our new loyalty program. This was inclusive of a continued benefit from emergency pizza and results that exceeded our expectations from the carryout special boost week that we ran. We also benefited from 0.9% of pricing and a 1.4% sales mix from Uber. These tailwinds were partially offset by a higher carryout mix which carries a lower ticket than delivery.  
 We are still evaluating how much of the 1.4% sales mix coming from Uber is incremental. But everything we have seen so far would indicate that it's in line with our approximately 2/3 estimate. Shifting to unit count. We added 20 net new stores in the U.S. in line with our expectations, bringing our U.S. system store count to 6,874. 
 Shifting to international, where results were generally in line with our expectations. Same-store sales, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 0.9% in the first quarter. Store counts increased by 144 net stores, which is an increase over the 106 we opened in Q1 of 2023.  
 Income from operations increased 19.4% in Q1, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency of $1.4 million. This increase was primarily due to higher global franchise royalty revenues resulting from global retail sales growth of 7.3% as well as higher supply chain gross margins due to procurement productivity a decrease in the cost of our food basket and slightly lower delivery costs. I also wanted to call out that our margin rate benefited by about 0.3% in Q1, from the tech fee being at $0.395 and the lower ad fund contribution rate of 5.75%.  
 Now turning to our outlook, which remains in line with what we previously shared. 7% or more global retail sales growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency, and we continue to expect the following: first, 2024 U.S. comp to be above the 3% plus long-term guide as a result of our expected catalysts in Uber and loyalty for the full year, and we expect comps to be 3% or more in each quarter for the remainder of the year.  
 Specific to Q2, we expect them to be slightly below Q1 on a 1-year basis as the emergency pizza promotion rolls off, partially offset by a ramp in Uber. You can expect a similar national promotions cadence to what we ran in Q1 in terms of our activity, inclusive of the April carryout special boost week that is now behind us. Second, sales through Uber to increase throughout the year as marketing and awareness increases, and we are expecting to exit the year with an overall sales mix of 3% or more. Third, international comps to remain soft in the first half of the year due to a continuation of the trends we saw at the end of last year but expect them to accelerate to our 3% or more long-term guidance in the back half of the year.  
 Now shifting to net stores, where we continue to expect 1,100 or more, which will be driven by 175 in the U.S. and 925 in international. We continue to expect an 8% or more year-over-year increase in operating income, excluding the impact of foreign currency. 
 To highlight some of the components which remain unchanged, we expect operating income margins to be relatively flat compared to 2023. As a reminder, we are not expecting to see cost leverage in 2024 due to investments we are making in consumer technology, store technology and supply chain capacity to support future sales growth in the U.S.  
 We are expecting our G&A as a percentage of retail sales to be approximately 2.4%. This is inclusive of approximately $9 million in timing of G&A spend in Q2 driven by our worldwide rally, which takes place every 2 years. We are expecting supply chain margins to be roughly flat compared to the prior year, incorporating an inflationary food basket for the rest of the year, with a full year range of up 1% to 3%. Should our food basket pricing for the year moved to the lower end of our expectations, we may see modest leverage in operating and supply chain margins.   
 Thank you. We will now open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. 
Andrew Charles: Question first on same-store sales. Just 1Q is 5.6%. Obviously, a very impressive number. Should we think of that as the high watermark for 2024 U.S. same-store sales. You talked about Q2 will sequentially moderate partially given the benefit of emergency pizza rolls off, while UberEATS picks up. But just curious if you think this performance, though, is broadly sustaining as we think about the remainder of 2024? 
Russell Weiner: Andrew, thanks for the call. Part of the reasoning for putting out 3% or more as part of our Hungry for MORE algorithm is that 3% for us is the floor, but we're going to do everything we can to beat that and deliver more every single quarter. And so I'm not going to get into forward-looking on the quarters, but what I will say that I really liked about this quarter is there are 2 things I look at. I look at results and I look at repeatability. 
 And the results, like you said, were strong. What I then look at is say, okay, where the components that drove those results are those repeatable. And when you think about our Hungary for MORE platform, we had product news in first quarter. We've got actually our first new product of the year in the second quarter. 
 We talked about operational excellence. We delivered more pizza in Q1 than we did in Q1 last year at a better delivery time. Our renowned value, we went the second half of emergency pizza in Q1. We had a carryout boost week, and you probably read, we just put out a new renowned value promotion called "You Tip, We tip." And so -- and as Sandeep said earlier about the smart pricing, we took it, that's part of what's driving the consistent order count increase across every segment and consumer of our business. And so -- while I can't get into the specifics, what I can tell you is the repeatability of the MORE formula is what we're going to be leaning into. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. 
Dennis Geiger: Congrats on the quarter. Sandeep wondering if you could talk a little bit more about supply chain margin and sort of the overall operating margin strength that you saw in the quarter. And perhaps anything more on the latest thoughts on full year? I know you gave color on the quarter. You just talked about reiterating your thoughts for the full year. Anything more if you could kind of break down that procurement benefit perhaps exactly maybe what you saw deflation in the quarter itself for the supply chain? And anything on that go-forward procurement, et cetera, as we think about the full year. 
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks, Dennis. And I think that's a great question because if you really go back to our fourth quarter call, Dennis, we talked about our expectations for the first quarter to be really margin improvement and margin expansion, which we did see. And directionally, it was slightly more, and I'll get to that in a second. But I think overall, when we look at the full year, our expectations really haven't changed. We were expecting to see procurement productivity benefits for the whole year, and we were expecting to make investments that offset the procurement productivity.
 What we did see specifically in Q1 is that while we got the procurement productivity, some of the investments we are planning to make in supply chain capacity really pushed out into later in the year. So Q2 to Q4 gets a little bit more pressured as a result of it, but the overall year really doesn't change. And so directionally, I think that's the way to think about supply chain margins and where we expect to take that. 
 Now when you talk about the full year expectations, Included in that was a timing factor on G&A specific to Q2 because we have our worldwide rally. We'd already messaged on the last call that we were expected to see some compression but we've quantified it a little bit for you to help you with your modeling. And other than that, the back half really remains relatively similar to what we said in the fourth quarter call. So broadly, not a very different picture on the P&L than what we saw back in February. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. 
Brian Bittner: Your same-store sales in the U.S. accelerated in the first quarter about 300 basis points from 4Q. Can you just talk about how much of the acceleration was traffic -- was all the acceleration traffic? And it sounds like one of the biggest drivers of the strong comps are the rewards program. That's what you seem to be citing the most. And I realize 2Q may be a little lower than 1Q. But in general, can you just unpack why you believe the rewards program and all the improvements that you've made there can be an ongoing driver for sales trends, not just even in 2024, but how it can build on itself in '25? 
Russell Weiner: Sure. Brian, the Q1 results, I think you nailed it, what makes me so proud of the team is that they were order-count driven overall. They were order-count driven on our delivery business, on our carryout business across the different segments we've got. And I think that's something special in general, let alone, given the current environment for QSR. 
 Rewards certainly was a big part of it and will be a tailwind for us as we continue this year and for the next few years. I mean, we saw this the first time we launched a loyalty program. It was time to reinvent it and we did. The nice thing about the reinvented program is it's driving activity with folks that maybe we didn't engage as much in the old program. 
 And so the carryout customer engagement is much higher than it was before. Light users are much higher than they were before. And so that gives you a little bit of sense of where that growth is coming from. And I don't expect the tailwind from loyalty to go away anytime soon. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bank of America. 
Sara Senatore: I wanted to ask about the promotional environment. I guess a couple of things. One is, I know you mentioned that 3P is more promotional. So I think the appeal for pizza had been that it was more margin neutral or maybe even accretive because of the -- maybe the absence of deals. So I'm just curious if that still going to be the case? 
 And then as you think about the promotional cadence consistent with 2019, I think the implication was that promotional intensity is not particularly high relative to history. But 2019 was a bit of a slower comp year for Domino's. And so I just wanted to kind of understand how you're thinking about the implications on same-store sales from promotional intensity and the potential for competitors to match. 
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Sara. I'll try to get to each piece of that unpack a little bit. I think what we talked about that we're seeing on 3P is definitely a high low value-driven business. And what we're doing is we're kind of adjusting accordingly. The important thing to remember is the best prices for consumers and our loyalty program are always going to be on our own channels. But it's interesting, though, when you look at what's going on in 3P, I think that really exacerbates the difference between what we're doing on our own channels. So there, it's price.
 It's this percent off, you've given this away free up and down. What we're doing out there, which is why I think it feels like -- and you said this, it feels like there are more promotions out there, is the difference between value and renowned value. I talked to the team a lot. When we think about what renowned value means, it means bringing the talk to value. So it's talk value versus value. And so the promotions may feel that we're doing out there may be feeling like there -- the activities increased, I think what has increased is just the power of them. 
 And like I said, a BOGO versus a buy 1 versus emergency pizza or a $3 bounce back in -- for purchase in a week versus You Tip, We Tip. They just feel more powerful because the top value is there. And I think that's a great just to position understanding how we're going to break out from both 3P and the rest of QSR with the promotions that we do. 
Sandeep Reddy: And I'm just going to add something, Sara, because I think sometimes when we talk about promotion, the subtext is what's happening to profitability. What is great for us is our profit dollar growth continues to grow as we expected it to. We are on track to the $170,000 or more for the year. And we're doing exactly what we hoped for. 
 And I think on the last call, you asked about profit dollar growth versus margin expansion. Even on the corporate stores, we saw a very healthy profit dollar growth. And we did see a bit of margin expansion, but we're not solving for margin expansion. We're solving for profit dollar growth. And I think what we're seeing is very healthy the way all this explains with the P&L. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore ISI. 
David Palmer: I was hoping maybe we could drill down into just the labor situation for Domino's as you see it across not just your company stores and supply chain, but also the franchisees. Any metrics you can share that could speak to how labor availability is impacting the business, both sales and margins? 
Russell Weiner: Maybe I'll talk big picture, and Sandeep, you can talk on the margin level. I think, David, the biggest indicator to me about both labor availability, and frankly, the improvements that we're driving operationally is the fact that we delivered more orders in Q1 than we did last year at better delivery times. And so if labor was an issue, we wouldn't be able to do that. And obviously, the flow-through to profitability front, Sandeep spoke about that a little bit. And so that, to me, should be a takeaway that is working right now. 
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. No, I think and Russell is exactly right. I think accessing labor has been not a problem at all as we move through the year. What I do think is reality, and we talked about this on the last call as well, is there is some wage pressure in the year with some minimum wage increases, statutory increases that will impact the franchisee P&L and even our corporate store P&Ls. 
 But I think specifically, California is a good example, right, where we had the AB 1228 wage increases. So we essentially would have had to -- we had to increase our prices in California to address the wage increases that we saw over there. Our price increase is probably in the high single digits, but we will modify it if we need to, to actually adjust to what the competitors are doing. But overall, we're solving for profit dollar growth. That's what we are always solving for. And we are looking to protect that franchisee profitability in California and throughout the system. And so margin percentages are good to look at and maintain good flow through, but we're solving for dollar growth. 
Russell Weiner: CX marketer may needs to follow up with that. There are 2 profitabilities that we care about at Domino's Pizza because we know if we balance those, our profit follows and certainly, the franchisee profitability is one of them. But the other is the profitability of -- for every American out there every pizza-buying citizen kind of all over the world. 
 And that is where I think our record of smart pricing, which has been, call it, 15 years of doing so, has proved out. I mean we had the $5.99 mix and match offer for 12 years. Profits went up, order count went up. We took smart pricing and smart pricing is based on lots of analytics around what the competition is doing, what's going on with -- in consumers' wallets. 
 And we took pricing, and that's pretty much the majority of at least promotional pricing we've taken already. And you're seeing how that's translated into order count growth. And the way I think about it is every year, should the analytics say we can stay with $6.99 as an example, we get more and more in value. And so when you balance consumer profitability and franchisee profitability you get Q1. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. 
Lauren Silberman: Congrats on the quarter. You talked about the strong performance across income cohorts. Can you expand on what you're seeing with the consumer and whether there are any observable differences and how consumers across cohorts are using the brand? And then any changes in consumer behavior signs are particularly down within each channel? 
Russell Weiner: Sure. We talked -- I think, Laura, in Q4, even maybe in Q3 a little bit about what we were -- we thought was coming in 2024, and that is coming to fruition, traffic is hard to come by, orders are hard to come by in QSR. I think you're going to see that continue throughout the year. I don't think that's going to be the case at Domino's because of what we talked about before.
 And the traffic doesn't just come. It becomes -- like I said before, results are important if they're repeatable and they're repeatable if there's a formula. And essentially, our pricing is stable and right. Our promotional context or promotions have come back, carryout special, we brought that back on new products. I think the key thing, though, when you're talking about why is every income cohort engaging in Domino's with positive order count is a big piece of that is the new loyalty program.
 I mean, we specifically designed it to tap into consumers that we hadn't done before. So reducing the purchase from $10 to $5 well, all of a sudden, this is a much more compelling program for carryout customers and just customers in general who don't want to spend a lot of money at $5, they get points. 
 And the other thing is the 20 and 40-point level adding those redemption levels to our loyalty program has been key in driving frequency among kind of lower income and lower frequency customers. The amazing thing to me, if you think about the old program. which was only 60 points for a medium 2-topping pizza. Our new program, the 20-point and the 40-point level actually combined are higher than the 60-point level. And so that gives you a sense of why we're breaking through in every cohort across delivery and carryout. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. 
Danilo Gargiulo: Congrats [indiscernible] the quarter. I was wondering if you can elaborate on what is causing international markets to have a little bit more compressed growth this quarter, which kind of was in line with your previous expectations? And particularly, if you can elaborate if you have been able to estimate how the pressure from the tension in the Middle East are impacting you specifically? And more broadly, if you can take any lessons from the domestic markets that are growing so fast and you can trust them over to the international market? 
Russell Weiner: Well, you both asked and answered the question. So great job. Yes. No, look, Q1 comps were in line with our expectations. We continue to see pressure in Europe and Middle East. Sandeep had talked about this last time. The Middle East represents a relatively small percentage, less than 3% of our operating income. 
 But what makes us continue to expect comps to return to our 3% algorithm in the back half is exactly what you were saying. We see key markets starting to bring to life the Hungry for MORE strategy. So if you look at Australia, for example, they launched a campaign that literally is called MORE in Q4 that really just romances products, and they've had delicious new products that have launched as part of that. Their business has responded accordingly. 
 We looked at -- Mexico, I talked about them a little bit. They just reported Q1 of 12.2%. They launched Domino's mania, which is a boost week. And so what we're starting to see is as folks follow this playbook, it's starting to work internationally. And our job and that's part of why we have this rally coming up, is to continue to share these best practices. And that's why at the back half of the year, we think we'll return to the 3-plus algorithm. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. 
Gregory Francfort: Russell, you made a comment about just the third-party channel having more single item orders. And I think the reason for why you expected sales to build as you move through the year, was because you were still figuring out how to promote on the platform. I'm curious, what do you think has been working and what do you think still needs to be tweaked to kind of get you to where you want to be as you exit the year from a mix perspective in terms of pricing and promotional structure? 
Russell Weiner: Yes, Greg, we -- like I said, things are a little bit different on the platform than they were last year. The competition -- the promotional competition is just up. But we're still sticking to our strategy there of best pricing online at Domino's. It's just more about how we manage it. So for example, your base price could be higher if you want to discount a little bit more. I mean all of that stuff is available to us. 
 And so we feel good about kind of the way our team is handling that. We're promoting on the Uber channel. Uber is promoting us on the Uber channel, Sandeep talked about we're at 1.4% of sales, which is up from 0.4% in Q4. And all of that makes me really confident that we're going to get to that 3% exit rate for the year. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. 
John Ivankoe: In the context of third-party delivery, maybe being a little bit more promotional. I was hoping if you could put that in the context of your own delivery fee. We've actually seen some stores where it can be as high as $7.99. I think that's a New York example, but it's still an example. 
 How are you feeling about the current structure of the relatively fixed delivery fee, no matter how much customer orders, if there's any opportunity to kind of look at that over time? And when I think consumers increasingly look at the total landed cost of that delivery, if you feel the overall algorithm is still in the right place. And obviously, I understand orders being up year-over-year might just simply answer that question, but just wanted to get your thought on just delivery fee overall in terms of consumers' value perception. 
Russell Weiner: Yes. Thanks, John. We do price scraping on a, I think, other weekly or biweekly basis on delivery fee. And so what's important to understand is the recommendations to our franchisees are based on the competitors that are out there, kind of the ones that have stores that are more direct competitors whose pricing is probably a little bit lower than when people buy things on the aggregators.
 You're right, though, on aggregator so that people may sign up for programs where delivery may be reduced cost or free. But at the end of the day, particularly our customers looking at exactly what you said. They probably don't call it total landed cost. They just call it, is it a bargain, is it a value. And as long as we're doing that, we're aligning competitively with the local competition through our pricing there and we've got best pricing on dominos.com. That's the balance that we're looking for. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. 
Christopher O'Cull: Russell, you mentioned the company seeing more individual orders on UberEATS channel. And I was just wondering, does this create an opportunity to be more aggressive in promoting non-pizza items on the channel and maybe even attempt to drive sales during the lunch daypart? And also as a company share of voice on the platform right now among the pizza competitors, is that similar to what we might see outside of the channel? 
Russell Weiner: Chris, on the second one on share of voice inside versus outside the channel. I'll have to get back to you on that one. That's not something that I know off the top of my head. As far as what it is that we sell on Domino's, we have been -- I've been here a long time, and I've seen us promote just pizza on media, and I've seen us promote just our individual items like sandwiches or pasta. And really, the magic for us, the big sales becomes when -- I've used this before, this idea of Pizza Plus when you offer both. And that's really what mix-and-match is all about.
 And so what we don't want to do is we don't want to slow down momentum in what's really working through experiments in other area. We have looked at lunch before. We got a nice lunch business, but that business is not individual users. And so I think what this allows us to do is tap into individual users who, frankly, are willing to spend a lot more money on a per person basis than they would through us. And then once they're part of Domino's, obviously, they've got the ability to then go back and buy those items and get loyalty point for it and all that. So that's probably the better way to think about it is we're at our best when we promote our entire menu. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. 
Andrew Strelzik: I wanted to ask about the U.S. store growth pipeline. The first half of the year, I know it's supposed to be roughly flat year-over-year, and it seems like it's tracking there. But how are you seeing that pipeline build with the comp strength and margins obviously moving in the right direction? And just wanted to get a sense from you on when you expect and your confidence that you'll see that inflection higher in the back part of the year and even as we move into 2025 and beyond? 
Russell Weiner: Yes. Thanks. We've got visibility of the pipeline through the remainder of this year through next year, and I feel really good about hitting the 175 plus number. Stores tend to be a lagging indicator of performance and as you can expect with profits going up with order counts going up, we're becoming a more and more attractive proposition every day to our franchisees, but regardless of Q1, you should note, but before these results, the pipeline was clear on the 175 plus. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. 
David Tarantino: Russell, I had a question related to one of the comp drivers that maybe gets underplayed and that's the advertising approach. It seems like you made quite a big evolution in the advertising versus what you've done in the past in the first quarter and maybe before the first quarter, with a lot more focus on the food and the value as opposed to some other topics. 
 So I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much of a comp driver you think that was, if it's even easy to separate that out from the others? 
Russell Weiner: Yes, David, I'm really glad you noticed. The team, I think, has done a fantastic job. We brought a brand-new food photographer, filmmaker on and the deliciousness on Domino's ad. I mean, it's just -- it's a different ad than it used to be. And you take that and you combine that with the talk value, the renowned value I talked about earlier. And that stuff breakthrough. I have a lot of -- people I know are saying, wow, it feels like Domino's is advertising a lot more this year than it ever did before. And the answer is not really. It's -- what's happening is what we're doing is breaking through more. And that's where you want to be. And I think when we talk about Hungry for MORE, the M and the R, the most delicious food and the renowned value were going to be the 2 things we're going to lean into. 
 So I appreciate you noticing that. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. 
Brian Harbour: Maybe just on the operational focus on dough, what was the nature of that? And what's still planned for this year? Are those things that sort of have a cost benefit in your view? Or is it more just about kind of product consistency and service time? 
Russell Weiner: Yes. Thanks. It really is about consistency. And consistency gets repeat purchase. And so the way I think of it is we -- in the U.S., we sell about 1.5 million pizzas every day. We don't want to look at it that way. We want to look at -- we sell one pizza, 1.5 million times. Every pizza that we make is a chance to delight a customer or disappoint a customer. 
 And so the training we had last year was a little bit more focused on circle operations technology, and you're seeing the results now in delivery times. The stuff we're doing this year, as you said, the first Sprint was on the dough, then we've got ingredients and baking. That's all about the consistency. And consistency really drives repeat purchase. So if you get that right, plus you have the loyalty program on top of that, then you have 2 things driving repeat purchase, and that's where we want to be. We think this is going to be offensive for us, an offensive move on consistency. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. 
Peter Saleh: I just wanted to ask about the U.S. pizza category in general. Russell, do you think it's taking share at this point in time? I think coming out of COVID out of really '21, there was some pizza fatigue going on. That seems to have subsided. Just curious if you think the category itself has grown faster than it had been in the past couple of years. Or are you guys just taking share with some of the self-help initiatives that you have in place? 
Russell Weiner: Yes. I think we've returned to where we were, what our calling card was over time, which is that this is a category that is tremendous, and it's growing kind of in line with population. What we have always done is we've been, what I call it equal opportunity share stealers. And frankly, we lost that last year, 2 years, and we're back. 
 And so we're seeing those same dynamics and these self-help initiatives are helping drive share in delivery and carryout. I mean the carryout numbers are just tremendous. And one of the things we always talk about is the incrementality of carryout. And so when we split a store, 80% of the carryout volume is incremental. And so if carryout is growing big time that is yet another reason in addition to store profitability why franchisees are going to want to open up stores. And so I think all this stuff is a cycle that's positive for us. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower from Citi. 
Jon Tower: I'm curious, I wanted to come back to your comments earlier, Russell, regarding the loyalty program. I think you had mentioned in the U.S. that you're seeing some pretty good uptick from new lapsed users, light users, but I'm curious to hear about how existing loyalty members have responded to the program so far and all the changes that have taken place? And then separately, in terms of the consumer demand, obviously, you've had a lot of promotional -- heavy promotional windows during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter here. How has the consumer responded to the brand outside of those windows? 
Russell Weiner: Got it. Well, first, on the loyalty program, I think it's safe to say that not only new customers, but existing customers are really engaging in the program. If you're an existing customer and you had 50 points in your loyalty bank, you woke up when we launched this new program and you were able to get 2 free items instead of 0. And so there are a lot of happy customers who are existing customers there.
 When you talk about consumer demand, I mean, I love -- I get this question a lot, hey guys, it seems like you're increasing your promotional cadence. We're really not -- they're just more impactful. And I think that's why folks are talking about them more. But we've had a 52-week count promotional calendar for years and years and years. And the big difference now is just they're working better. They're working better because rather than just focus on price points, we're focused on things that break cultural tensions. 
 I mean, the carryout tips, everywhere you go -- I'm sorry, You Tip, We Tip, everywhere you go today, whether they're giving you extra service or not, folks are asking for tips. So you get that screen up there. In fact, I think maybe after this call, I'm expecting John, you to ask me to tip you. But -- and what we're doing though is we're using that talk value to get people to talk more about Domino's because we're breaking that tension. And that's why it feels like we're at, we're doing more. But 52 weeks of promotions, what we've done  for a long time. 
Sandeep Reddy: And just -- I'm going to add something to that, John, because I think when you look at the promotional windows and you talked about what's the cadence outside the promotional windows, it's very good. But why is it very good? It's because of the loyalty program. The activity that's actually generated through the loyalty program is really dispersing transactions and redemptions right through the quarter. And I think that just speaks to the strength of what we're doing with renowned value and the loyalty program specifically. 
Russell Weiner: Yes, that's a great point, Sandeep, which I don't like to admit when Sandeep makes a great point, but this was a good. The other pieces of the renowned value that are different than what we did before is to get this value, you have to sign up for the loyalty program, right? You can get mix and match, you don't have to be a loyalty member. But to get the carryout tips to get emergency pizza to get tipped for your delivery, you have to be part of the loyalty program. And so what these things are doing is they're working together versus working separately. And I think you just see the compounding effects of that. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: Just a question on the near-term comps for Domino's and the industry, I guess. On Domino's, I know you mentioned the second quarter comp below the 5.6% in the first quarter. I'm wondering whether that surprises you relative to plans at the start of the year. I would think that the ramp in Uber and loyalty and easier compares would more than offset the fee of emergency pizza. So just wondering whether that similarly surprises you? 
 And Russell, on the industry, you mentioned a slowing QSR category in terms of seemingly the macro. Just wondering with you having a decade-plus of experience there, does that surprise you? I would think QSR would be viewed as more defensive into a slowing macro and yet perhaps we're seeing something otherwise. So question on Domino's and the broader macro. 
Russell Weiner: I'll ask Sandeep to talk about the near-term comps, and then I'll answer your question on transactions. 
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. So I think on the near-term comps in Q2 that we talked about on the call, really, it's not surprising as at all. I mean, this is pretty much in line with our plans. We knew that we've had great success with the [ multi ] Pizza, and we were glad we did that because we've actually acquired customers into the loyalty program. But we did see some lift, which I think will kind of normalize as we go into Q2. But to the point we made making sense at the beginning of the year, we're expecting ramping and Uber to happen over the course of the year. So we expect to be slightly below our Q1 performance, which was very, very good. And we still think Q2 is going to be very, very good, but in line with what we expected. 
Russell Weiner: Yes. And I think on the -- in the QSR space, Jeff, what I was talking about was really more order count. I think there's just been pricing that's been taken in the category and consumers are responding now. You're seeing it in the results and what I'm excited about for us is the pricing we've taken is really in the rearview mirror. And so we can focus on driving value, profitable value to both our customers and our franchisees. And look, I'm sure there will be others in the industry who are also doing the same, but I think we'll be a little bit of an outlier there. 
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. And I just want to add one thing on this because -- I talked about in the prepared remarks and Russell referred it on smart pricing. The interesting about smart pricing is we took a lot of spot pricing in '22 when the market was highly inflationary. The smart pricing in '23 was almost taking no pricing. And that's really what actually drove that value differential that is now really showing up. 
 The number of questions we got right through '23 on, do you have pricing power? Why are you not taking pricing because everybody else is taking pricing, but we were really focused on 2 things. One is making sure customer value was maintained; two, making sure that the flow through from a franchisee perspective had been restored and that happened after the '22 pricing that we took. And so we just get on the straight and narrow and we were really teeing up for what's ended up happening in Q4 and Q1. 
Russell Weiner: Yes. I think one of the things we talked about before was consistency of product. If there are 2 things that we've got this tremendous e-commerce business. So we know we can tell on conversion when we do things right and we do things wrong. Product consistency is really important. The other thing is pricing consistency. People don't want whiplash. They want to get what they expect and we took that in 2022 and now they're getting what they expect, and it's profitable for our franchisees, and we're seeing that in the numbers. 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Meredith Jensen from HSBC. 
Meredith Prichard Jensen: On prior calls, I've heard you all speak about the experience Domino's has had internationally with third-party delivery and now that it's been rolled out here, I was just kind of wondering if you might speak a little bit about sort of the -- maybe the consumer behavior differences that you're seeing? Or some other things that have come up even anecdotally about the differences there. 
Russell Weiner: Yes, sure, Meredith. I mean really, what we've seen so far is some of it's very in line with what we thought going in, which was these customers, as we said earlier, would be more single users, they'd be younger they, especially on Uber, would be incremental to us and Sandeep has talked about a few months into this, it looks like they're about 75% incremental. 
Sandeep Reddy: 2/3 incremental. 
Russell Weiner: I'm sorry, about 2/3 incremental, yes, sorry -- about 2/3 incremental. And so the thing on the other side is just more just the promotional nature of it. And the pricing and profit ends up being kind of what we thought, but how we're getting to it is just in a little bit of a different way. Anything to add? 
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle from Jefferies. 
Alexander Slagle: Great to see everything coming together here. I had a question on the operations and the acceleration in delivery volumes, seemingly just starting and so forth, you're able to drive the speed improvements. But as the volumes ramp further, I guess, it's more of these individual orders on 3P and perhaps more surges of demand at certain times. I mean how much of your ability to keep up with the volumes and improve speed will require a step up in hiring drivers versus productivity and technology-driven improvements or other opportunities that you see out there? 
Russell Weiner: Yes. Well, the nice thing about our business is it scales really, really well. And so the -- I know you know this, but it sounds like we have to add a driver every time we add an order. And so what we're trying to do and what we have done with a lot of these back of house improvements is we've made these orders just more scalable, more leverageable. And so that's part of the process. But secondarily, as we talked about, driving for Domino's Pizza now is an attractive job. We're about to see a whole bunch of franchisees and more importantly, future franchisees at our rally. In order to become a Domino's franchisee, you need to start as a driver or a pizza maker.
 And so with the success of the brand, what we're seeing is people attracted to both the driver job and the opportunity at Domino's. 
Operator: And our final question for today comes from the line of Jim Salera from Stephens. 
James Salera: Wanted to ask on the New York Style Pizza innovation. Just as how that triangulates with some of the other promotions you guys have going on? And just any color you might have on driving either new use or new consumption from people that are discovering Domino's on the third-party apps or potentially newcomers to the loyalty program and how you can tie innovation into those newer users? 
Russell Weiner: Yes. That's a great question. New York is our first new product launch of the year and one the things that testing shows for us is this is a different customer. This is a customer who prefers a thinner foldable pizza that's a customer who really -- ingredient quality is important to them. And so we think bringing this into a portfolio is actually going to be attractive to folks who may be are pizza lovers, but our traditional hand cost may be a little bit too thick for them in cross type. 
 And so it's not -- this is -- and I should have said this in the remarks, this is not an LTO for us. And so it's important to know when we launch products, most of the time, it's because we think they are permanent fixtures to our menu. 
 The other nice thing about New York Style, which I like. And of course, we're promoting it through loyalty with points like you said, is our New York style is available in all 3 sizes in medium, large and a lot of cases, extra-large. But being part of a medium means that could be part of our $6.99 mix and match, and that was super important. 
Greg Lemenchick: Thank you, Jim. That was our last question of the call. I want to thank you all for joining our call today, and we look forward to speaking to you all again soon. You may now disconnect. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-26 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Domino's Pizza's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I’d like to introduce your host for today’s program, Greg Lemenchick, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Lemenchick: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call. Today's call will begin with our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner; followed by our Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. The call will conclude with a Q&A session. The forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-K both of which are available on our IR website, also apply to our comments on the call today. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. This morning's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. We want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such, we encourage you to ask one question only. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Russell.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Greg. I thought you were going to sing the opening as we discussed, but I guess we'll let that path today. Welcome to your first call here on Domino's, and good morning to everyone joining us. Our strong Q4 demonstrated that our Hungry for MORE strategy is already delivering results. Our positive U.S. same-store sales and transaction growth in both delivery and carryout underscore the strength and momentum that we're building in our business. These results and the initiatives that I'll cover today give me confidence in Domino's ability to continue to drive meaningful value for shareholders. We're excited to share an update on the business through the lens of our Hungry for MORE strategy. Now as a reminder, Hungry for MORE is our new strategy around what we're going to do to deliver over the course of the next five years, more sales, more stores and more profits. We're going to accomplish this through our four more pillars, MORE, that I'll share a brief update on. Let's start with M. M is for the most delicious food. And we know we have the most delicious food in the industry, but you know what, it's time to talk about it more. It's time to show it more, and we're already doing that. We're currently on air with Pan Pizza advertising for the first time since 2014. We call Pan Pizza, our best kept secret. It's time to change that. Pan Pizza is a delicious product made with fresh never frozen dough. It also showcases the variety of crust we have to offer. You're probably also noticing a shift in our advertising as we're beginning to romance the product more to showcase the deliciousness of our food. You can expect this to continue throughout the year. The O in Hungry for MORE stands for operational excellence, and this is how we're going to deliver on our promise to have the most delicious food. By consistently driving a great experience with our products. As we've noted before, we made meaningful strides operationally in 2023 with our Summer of Service program, which has resulted in service times being back to pre-COVID levels. But we're never satisfied, and we want to continue to get better, our operators and our franchisees, we are Hungry for MORE. In 2024, we're rolling out a new service program. We're calling that MORE Delicious Operations. This program will be a series of three product training sprints focused on our dough, how we build and make our products and how we cook them. All of this is being done with a keen focus on driving more consistency in our food by providing the proper teaching, tools and processes for our team members to succeed. Our third pillar is R for Renowned Value. We've always been known as a premier value player, and we believe this can continue to be a differentiator for us in '24 through our improved loyalty program, our national promotions, and our rollout on Uber. Domino's rewards is off to a great start and was a key driver of our strong comp performance in the fourth quarter, when we saw positive sales and transactions in both our U.S. delivery and carryout businesses. We've also seen the following: an uptick in active members. We are up 3 million active members in 2023, with 2 million plus since our relaunch in September. Domino's Rewards ended the year with approximately 33 million active members, a big driver of the increase in active members as well as the early success of the program was our Emergency Pizza promotion, which was an innovative marketing initiative that drove increased order counts and acquisition of customers into Domino's rewards. We're seeing more redemptions than ever before, and we're seeing them at those lower tiers that we implemented. And we know that this program has driven incremental profit dollars for our franchisees. So customers are getting more, and franchisees have earned more profits truly a win-win. Finally, we're seeing more carryout users and light users in the program than we were prior to the relaunch. So Domino's Rewards is working as we intended. National promotions will be another way will drive renowned value in '24. And right now, we're on air with our perfect combo promotion. We believe this is the best deal in the QSR industry to feed the family, and it highlights the depth we have in our menu. We also brought back our carryout special boost week in January for the first-time since January 2020. And this performance exceeded my expectations. Clearly, customers want value, and we are driving it profitably for our franchisees. While providing value through our own channels is one part of our barbell strategy, tapping into the aggregator marketplace is the other. We're very excited about this new sales layer, which we believe is a different and largely incremental customer that we had not been able to reach in the past. Our entrance into this marketplace with Uber is on track as we are now fully rolled out across our U.S. system. We've gone live with the marketing and formally kicked off our one-year exclusivity period in Q1. Sales are building in line with increased marketing, which has been great to see and we expect those orders to continue to grow throughout the year. Sandeep will share more about our sales expectations in 2024 for Uber in his comments. Now everything we do at Domino's is enhanced by our best-in-class franchisees, the E in our Hungry for MORE strategy. In 2023, we continue to enhance our U.S. franchisee base by adding more than 60 new franchisees to the system, the most in 15 years. Every one of these new franchisees started with Domino's either as a delivery driver or from within our system. This remains the secret sauce to our success. We ended 2023 slightly ahead of our expectations on U.S. store growth and profits, adding 168 net new stores and finishing the year with estimated average franchisee profitability per store of $162,000. This highlights the momentum we expect to continue into 2024. I couldn't be more excited about 2024 and beyond for Domino's Pizza. Our foundation has never been stronger and our vision has never been greater. We made a ton of progress in 2023 and our strong start to '24 gives me confidence in our ability to win with customers and drive return for Domino's franchisees and shareholders. Now with that, I'll turn things over to Sandeep.
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, Russell, and good morning, everyone. As a reminder, in the third quarter, we closed the remaining 143 stores in the Russia market. The 2023 global retail sales growth measures exclude the Russia market and are calculated as a growth in retail sales, excluding the retail sales from the Russian market from both 2023 retail sales and the 2022 retail sales pace. Now for our fourth quarter financial results. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 4.9% due to positive U.S. comps and global net store growth. U.S. retail sales increased 4.5% and international retail sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency, grew 5.2%. During Q4, same-store sales for the U.S. business saw an increase of 2.8%. As Russell noted earlier, our strong comps in the quarter were driven by both delivery and carryout as they were up 2% and 3.9%, respectively. For the year, delivery represented 48% of our transactions and 58% of our sales, while carryout represented 52% of our transactions and 42% of our sales. The weight of sales and transactions shifted slightly more to carry out in 2023. The increase in U.S. Q4 same-store sales was driven by transaction growth from our new loyalty program inclusive of a benefit from Emergency Pizza, pricing of approximately 1%, and a 0.4% sales mix from Uber. It will take us some time to determine just how much of that Uber mix is incremental. So more to come on that as we move through 2024 and into 2025. These tailwinds were partially offset by a slightly lower average ticket that was the result of higher carryout mix. Shifting to unit count. We added 92 net new stores in the U.S., bringing our U.S. system store count to 6,854 stores at the end of the year. For the year, we added 168 net new stores, which was a strong increase over the 126 net stores we opened in 2022. U.S. company-owned store gross margin decreased 1.6 percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding the impact from higher insurance costs and an increase in our loyalty liability, due to the change in point structure following the relaunch of the Domino's Rewards program, margins would have expanded slightly. Domino's unit economics remained strong with continued EBITDA growth for our U.S. franchisees. We are expecting that our average franchisee profitability per store will come in at $162,000 in 2023, up $23,000 from the prior year. Shifting to International. Same-store sales, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 0.1%. The deceleration from the third quarter is being driven primarily by pressures in Europe and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Please note that the Middle East represents a relatively small portion of our profits at less than 3% of our operating income. Our international store count increased by 302 net stores in the fourth quarter. For the year, our net store growth in international was 702 units, excluding the Russia closures. In total for the year, we grew 870 net stores across the globe. Income from operations increased $8.4 million or 3.4% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of the $21.2 million prior re-franchising gain that we are lapping income from operations would have been approximately -- would have been up approximately 13% in the fourth quarter and up approximately 10% for the full year. Now turning to our 2024 outlook, which remains in line with what we shared at Investor Day in December. Our guidance calls for the following in 2024. 7% or more of global retail sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency. We are expecting our 2024 U.S. comp to be above the 3% long-term guide as a result of our expected outsized catalysts in Uber and loyalty. As we have communicated previously, we expect our sales with Uber to increase throughout the year as marketing and awareness increases, and we are expecting to exit the year with an overall sales mix of 3% or more. We expect sales with Uber to start ramping up after Q1, which will have only a partial tailwind from marketing. In the U.S., we are planning for a modest price increase in the low-single digits. This is inclusive of California, where we're expecting to take pricing above that to offset the wage impacts from AB 1228. We expect our international comps to remain soft in the first half of the year due to a continuation of the trends we saw in the fourth quarter, but expect them to accelerate to our 3% or more long-term guidance in the back half of the year. Now shifting to net stores, where we are expecting 1,100 or more, which will be driven by 175 in the U.S. and 925 in international. There was a meaningful uptick in our U.S. net store growth in the fourth quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations, and the pipeline continues to build. We are expecting net unit growth in the U.S. to be relatively flat to 2023 in the first half of the year and to accelerate slightly in the back half based on current visibility. Internationally, we are expecting to increase net store growth each quarter over the prior year as we lap the one-time closures we had in 2023 and to step up significantly in the back half of the year. As previously communicated, we are expecting slightly less than half of our growth to come from China and India. On profits, we are expecting an 8% or more year-over-year increase in operating income excluding the impact of foreign currency. We do not expect the impact of foreign currency to have a material impact in 2024 based on current FX rates. A few additional points of color on some of the profit components. We are expecting our food basket to be up 1% to 3%. This has been driven by continued moderation on cheese prices. From meeting's perspective, we expect the Q1 food basket to be deflationary as we lap the only quarter from 2023 when the basket increased followed by moderate increases for the remainder of 2024. We are expecting our supply chain margins to be roughly flat for the year, barring any unforeseen shifts in the food baskets. We are expecting an increase in year-over-year supply chain margins in Q1 due to the expected negative food basket, followed by a slight moderation for the balance of the year. We expect supply chain margin dollars to grow in line with transaction growth throughout the year. We are estimating that rate (ph) inflation across the system, inclusive of California will be in the mid-single digits, and this has been primarily driven by minimum wage increases. We are expecting our G&A as a percentage of retail sales to be approximately 2.4%, which is in line with 2023. We also wanted to provide an update on our technology fee for 2024. In Q2 2023, we increased this fee to $39.5 and temporarily lowered our advertising fund contribution percentage by 0.25% to 5.75% for a 12 month period. Starting at the beginning of Q2 2024, we are lowering the technology fee to $35.5 and increasing the ad fund back to 6%. As previously communicated, we are expecting operating income margins to be relatively flat compared to 2023. We do not expect to see cost leverage in 2024 due to investments we are making in consumer technology, store technology and supply chain capacity to support future sales growth in the U.S. We are expecting Q1 margin expansion due to lower inflationary pressures, as previously noted on our food basket and we are expecting the Q2 margin rate to be down because of the timing of G&A spend which will be partially driven by our worldwide rally (ph), a gathering of our U.S. and international franchisees that takes place every two years. We expect margins in the back half of the year to be flat. As I conclude, I wanted to note that we announced a 25% increase in our dividend and increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. All of this is being done in line with our capital deployment priorities. Thank you. We will now open the line for questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. Clearly, your underlying core business is showing very nice signs of improvement, positive traffic in both the carryout business and delivery business prior to any Uber benefits. And I understand improvements in the core business can continue moving forward, maybe even perhaps accelerate and they remain important, but now you are fully rolled out with Uber. And our conversations with the investment community suggests the expectations for Uber mix currently is still relatively low, maybe that 1% to 1.5% range. And you talked about getting to 3% by the end of the year. So can you talk about how this improvement should unfold as the year unfolds and maybe unpack the marketing that's getting turned on. How is that bolstering your expectations for where the Uber mix will go? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Good morning, Brian. How are you doing? Let me talk a little bit about what we're seeing as far as the cadence of the flow of orders from Uber. Sandeep talked about the 0.4 in Q4, and we're seeing a meaningful uptick in Q1, we just turned the marketing on and so essentially, and same with Uber. So essentially, what we expect to see as awareness grows, is that percent of sales grow, and we feel like we're still in line for the 3% exit rate that we spoke about.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. And our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you very much. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask about value in January, you ran the week-long carryout promo, which I haven't seen before. Can you talk about the rationale behind that? Any commentary on how you saw that perform and to the extent that you're willing to talk about January, just given a little bit of noise across the industry? And then more broadly, how you're thinking about value and any incremental value offers through '24. Thank you very much.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Lauren, when you think about our Hungry for MORE strategy, renowned value is a big piece of it. And the carryout special isn't something new. It's something we brought back. I think the last time, we ran it was 2020. And frankly, that's going to be part of our portfolio moving forward as well as 50% off as well as our mix and match deal. Value is a key component not only price but value from a loyalty standpoint and value in the aggregator space. So yeah, the weak loan carryout wasn’t anything new, but what I will tell you, it performed extraordinarily well. I’m really happy with the way it went.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from of Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim (ph). Your question, please.
Gregory Francfort: Hey. Thanks for the question. Just looking at the unit growth this quarter, the domestic side, really strong pickup in terms of openings, international, maybe a little bit on the softer side. As you guys look out to next year, can you maybe talk about your confidence in that accelerating on a global basis next year and then maybe what that looks like from a domestic and international standpoint? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. We still feel really strongly about the guidance we gave, the 1,100 plus stores and 5,500 over the next five years. I mean you saw some really nice momentum at the end of the year in the U.S. in 2023. We expect to see more at the end of the year in 2024. Internationally, I think we've got a lot of closures behind us, that was probably one of the things that was driving down the number this year. But those closures really focused on three areas. Domino's Pizza Enterprises, and they talked about their number, Russia and Brazil. Those three were over 80% of our closures and no other market closed more than five stores. And so as we look forward, we feel really confident about openings. And I'm sure someone will ask a little bit later, but when you look at the profitability of our U.S. franchisees, you look at the fact that for the -- we had more new franchisees in 2023 than we have in the last 15 years, they're bullish about Domino's Pizza, and they're spending their money that way.
Sandeep Reddy: And Greg, I'm just going to add something in terms of the international store openings in particular. I think the -- we provided some milestones to say that every quarter we're expecting to actually grow against last year, as we lap the closures and then significantly accelerate more in the back half of the year. So very confident in where we are with store openings international. And we’ve been talking to our master franchisees and have good visibility to our expectations there.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Russell, within guidance for outsized ‘24 or U.S same-store sales, can you talk about your expectations for core traffic growth or what 2024 same-store sales will look like when you exclude the 3% mix for Uber and the low-single digit pricing? What I'm trying to get at is that do you believe similar to 4Q that you can drive positive carryout and delivery transactions, excluding the impact of Uber? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Andrew, absolutely. When I think about 2023, it was kind of a tale of two stories for us. The first part of the year was all about addressing the base and fixing things like delivery times and getting delivery times back to where they needed to be and getting franchisee profitability back where it needed to be, so that in Q4, we were able to really lean into the Hungry for MORE strategy and you saw it all in action. You saw most delicious food with innovation. You saw a renowned value from a promotional standpoint with loyalty. And so all of those things are going to be able to continue throughout 2024 with this improved base that we've got. So yeah, I expect both carryout and delivery orders to be positive.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your question, please.
Dennis Geiger: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys and thanks for all of the color on the loyalty program. Wondering if you could just talk a little more about loyalty in the U.S. and sort of expectations for the program looking ahead. I think recently, you've kind of talked about that as being the biggest contributor to U.S. same-store sales growth this year. Curious if that expectation still holds. Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yeah, Dennis. The loyalty program was just off to -- it's off to a great start. I'll just repeat numbers that we had in the opening remarks because I just like them so much. We added 3 million folks last year, 2 million of them came with a new program. And so it's important to know because I'll talk about Emergency Pizza in a second and the effect on loyalty there. But the loyalty program out of the gate before even Emergency Pizza was doing exactly what we needed it to do, which was engage lower-frequency users, engage carryout users, then we brought in this powerhouse of Emergency Pizza that continue to inflect those numbers. And we have ideas like that in the future that we'll be able to drive, there will be advantages and there are advantages to be in a Domino's Rewards customer. I'll give you a little bit more color about the users. It's doing exactly what we thought it would which is driving frequency, especially among the lower frequency customers, as I said before, also the carryout customers. And even though we have these lower tier levels, we're down to two purchases now can get you a free item. Because of the food cost at these various tiers, it’s actually positive for the franchisees. So really, as I said, a win-win, a better program that’s more engaging to customers and more profitable for our franchisees.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.
David Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. Great update. I'm getting some feedback as I'm asking, so I'll try to get through this. Wanted to ask you about a couple of profit drivers for this upcoming year, that being company-owned stores and supply chain. In the company store line is probably the only area of the P&L that was slightly disappointing on the quarter. But for the year, it looked like the company stores profitability was down maybe 10%. And your franchisees did a lot better than that, they were up double digits this last year. So any sort of callouts you would make in the quarter and for the year, and more importantly, how are you thinking about margins for company stores long term? They had been as high as 23.5% or so, consensus for '24 is more like 18%. So I'm just wondering, how you're thinking about company operated and then supply chain. Any comments there? Obviously, very strong on the supply chain in the fourth quarter, how you're thinking for '24. Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks for the question, David. So I think on the company stores in the prepared remarks, I actually called out a couple of impacts in the fourth quarter that actually impacted our margins. One of them really was insurance costs. And the other one was the accrual because of the points that actually got generated with the new loyalty program. And I think when you take out those two impacts, our margins actually expanded. So the good thing about this is, I think the loyalty program has worked extremely well from a transaction perspective for company stores. And we expect this to be significantly driving profit dollars, and we expect to revert to margin expansion in 2024. And frankly, I think we expect to continue to build on our margins as we move forward even beyond 2024. And then I would go to the supply chain profit. We're really happy about our supply chain profitability that we generated in the fourth quarter. A big driver of supply chain profitability all year was the productivity improvements that we saw specifically driven by procurement and in food cost, and I think that was a big element of what we saw. As we pivot to 2024, the expectation on supply chain is, it's going to be supply chain profit dollars because it's going to be driven by our transaction growth. And as Russell talked about earlier, we're expecting to see transaction growth before and after the impact of Uber. And all of that is going to fly through the supply chain P&L and expect that to actually drive significant profit dollar growth for the Supply Chain business.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. I'd just add those same transactions also add up to a low fees, online ordering fees as well. Yeah.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your question, please.
David Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. Very nice to see the order counts in both delivery and carryout, but I wanted to ask specifically about the Emergency Pizza promotion and whether you could try to frame up how much of a lift that might have cause for the transaction growth. And I know there's a component about customer acquisition in there. So just wanting to sort of get a sense of how you're thinking about the trend coming out of that promotion, which ended, I think, recently? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: David, I'll start, maybe Sandeep, you can give some color to this one, too. Emergency pizza was a resounding success. It really was. And when I look back and just, again, giving complements to our marketing team, this is your traditional buy one get one free, that has been marketed in such a way that it really breaks through. We've done buy one get one free before. They've done nothing like this. And when I think about Emergency Pizza, what I like is not only what it did to order count, it also drove people into the loyalty program because you need to be a loyalty member in order to get your Emergency Pizza. I think last, we have a new thing in our arsenal now. Boost weeks have worked really well for us. We've got this Emergency Pizza piece now, and I expect this is ownable from our perspective. And so this is something we'll be able to use in the future as well. Sandeep, if you want to add some color?
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah. I think Russell is exactly right. And I think the thing about what's happening with Emergency Pizza, it's a brilliant marketing innovation from our marketing team. But I think the broader construct of it is thinking about Domino's rewards the loyalty program. And that essentially creates a key platform to our third pillar renowned value. So at the beginning of the quarter in the fourth quarter, we had pepperoni stuffed cheesy bread, which was a special offer that was actually being connected to the loyalty program. Then after that, we've got Emergency Pizza and there's a number of different promotions that we can continue to bring along on to Domino's rewards. So the driver rather than looking at Emergency Pizza by itself, is really Domino's rewards and how much which can drive and transaction growth for us. This is a significant pillar of how we're going to drive transaction growth in 2024, both in delivery as well as carry.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. That was a big learning from us for the first loyalty program we had. With Piece of the Pie rewards, we advertised on TV, hey, we have a rewards program. And what we learned over time is actually the best way to tell people that you have a rewards program is have a really compelling promotion, whether it's a new product or something like Emergency Pizza that the only way you can get it is, if you sign up for the program. And once you sign up for the program, you're in this flywheel of frequency driving point levels that we've never had before. And so I think Emergency Pizza was a highlight. But as Sandeep talked about, that type of mechanism driving people into the loyalty flywheel is something we’re going to continue to – a play will continue to run.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your question, please. John, you might have your phone on mute.
John Ivankoe: Apologize. Can you hear me now?
Operator: Yes.
John Ivankoe: Okay. Perfect. All right. You're on speaker, but all right, this will work. First, in terms of the -- some of the slowdown that we saw, the brands saw in Continental Europe, were there any learning lessons that you could apply there, perhaps as Europe potentially being as a leading indicator to the U.S. of how you could get in front of some economic changes that would actually allow the perform -- the brand to perform better in the U.S. than perhaps it has in Europe, at least in the last quarter is the first good question. And then secondly, obviously, there's no direct P&L impact in advertising allocation, but there is a direct P&L impact in terms of the online ordering fee. In terms of reducing that online ordering fee or cutting it at least marginally relative to what it was in '23. I mean what was the reasoning behind that? Was that really franchise driven? Obviously, the economics at the franchise level would suggest that they could bear that higher fee, but I just wanted to have a sense of why you felt that, that reduction was necessary to make? Thank you so much.
Russell Weiner: Good morning, John. I'll take the first question, maybe Sandeep will take the second one. Our European business is really strong, and we believe some of the pressures we're seeing there are generally transitory in nature. If you listen to the call from DPE, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, our master franchisee over several markets, but especially France, there have been some challenges there, and that's one of our larger markets in Europe. We're partnering closely with them right now on those challenges. What I'd point to for DPE in general, there are green shoots in a lot of the markets where they're really leaning in on. And so, for example, Australia, New Zealand, the numbers there have been fantastic. And one of the reasons why is, they're leaning into the M, the most delicious food part of Hungry for MORE. I mean, I don't think anyone is doing it better than they are right now. They give a little insight into Japan into the first kind of six, seven weeks of the second half and how that seems to have turned a corner. Germany is positive. So we're working on France together, and that's certainly a business that needs to turn.
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah. And I'll just finish off on what Russell just said. And if you remember what I talked about in the prepared remarks, we expect to see pressure in the first half of the year on the international business. But exactly why we expect to see an improvement in the back half is because of all the more initiatives. Australia is one example. But taking those learnings and applying them across the international markets should enable us to offset any other headwinds that we have as we go into the back to our long-term guidance. And then specifically to your question on the advertising fund and the online fee. Now let's go back to about a year ago. And I think about a year ago, where we were was franchisee profitability was not in the best place. We had come off a big decline in franchisee profits in '22. And we saw an opportunity because of the buildup in the reserves of the ad fund to essentially take a 25 basis point 12-month hiatus from the advertising fund contributions, but we did want to continue investing in our technology solutions. And so we did take up the technology fee by $0.08. View that as a temporary increase and kind of an offset between the ad fund contribution and the technology fee. Now that we've actually come to the point where we think it needs -- it's time to restore the ad fund the 6%, we have actually adjusted the technology fee to $35.5. Another way to look at it is we actually went up from $31.5 to $35.5. And if you look back at our history, we've consistently increased our technology fee because we're making investments on technology for our franchisees, which drives the flywheel of their growth and eventually drives global retail sales and our royalty dollars as well. And so that is the rationale. I think where we are. All of this is included in the $170,000 or more in franchisee EBITDA that we’re expecting for 2024, and we feel very good about it.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your question, please.
Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Sandy, could you break down how much of the $23 million of the year-over-year supply chain profit dollar growth came from the productivity improvement versus the volume growth? And do you expect any productivity improvements to continue in that segment into '24?
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks, Chris. Thanks for the question. A significant portion of the profit dollar growth that we saw in '23 came from the productivity improvement that we saw. It was pretty outsized. And I think it was, it is probably a function of where the markets were, especially after the outsized inflationary period in 2022 that we were able to get such significant improvements in '23. And as we move forward in '24, this is definitely going to be a focus, but it's not going to be as outside as it was in '23. We do expect to get some benefits but I think we also have to make investments in capacity, like I talked about, both at Investor Day and earlier on the call today. So that's why I think as we look at '24, really expect profit dollar growth to be driven by transaction growth and productivity improvements that we can see, if anything should be an offset as some of the investments that we're making in the business.
Russell Weiner: But the nice thing about what our supply chain team has done, the productivity we gained in 2023, it's not going back and so, I would think about that as kind of accruing forward. So well done by Sandeep and the team (ph).
Operator: Thank One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your question, please.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to come back to the loyalty conversation. Russell, I think you mentioned 2 million plus new loyalty members since launch. And I think at the Investor Day, in early December, you had mentioned there was about $1 million incremental. So just curious if you could comment, was there a meaningful acceleration in new loyalty members in December? Do you expect that trend to continue in '24? And then is there any way to parse out how many of those are coming or more carryout customers versus traditional delivery?
Russell Weiner: Yeah, Peter. There are -- I'd say a couple of meaningful moves in the loyalty program. First was just the launch of the loyalty program, right? We saw a meaningful increase, and that's what we talked about with you in December. And then building on top of that, we had some more momentum driven by Emergency Pizza. So I'd say loyalty program on its own did well is doing very well. We have added a little bit more gas on the fire with Emergency Pizza. And as we continue into Q1, now with Emergency Pizza behind us, we’re still very happy with the way that’s growing, and we’ve got programs like Sandeep talked about earlier that we’ll continue to drive that business. The other thing, and you talked about this that I’m really happy with is the big objective here was to engage carryout customers and to engage light users. And we are absolutely doing that with the program. And we can see that even out of the gate so far.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Sara Senatore: Thank you. I have a clarification and then a question. Just a clarification is Sandeep, you said company margins would have been up slightly excluding insurance and loyalty liability. I guess given transaction growth and lower commodity costs and the shift to carryout, which I think is typically higher margin rate, I would have thought up more than slightly. So I guess as we think about that business, we should be focused now, I guess, increasingly on profit dollar growth as opposed to margin rate expansion sort of similar to how you think about supply chain or maybe my interpretation of up slightly is not quite right. And then the question is about the industry and the pizza segment. And so you often have better insights into the competitive dynamic than I do. Was any of this category improvement? Finally, I think that may be normalization in terms of sales mix, but anything you can say about what -- to what extent are share gains by Domino's versus finally seeing perhaps green shoots in the category? Thank you.
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks, Sarah. So I'll take the first one and Russell will take the shared question. So kook, in terms of company margins, we specifically called out the impacts of those two and the margins expanding slightly outside of that. And I think it's been consistent. If you look at the first three quarters, our margins expanded. And I think in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of those two items that we call out insurance and the loyalty liability, margins are expanded. So the great thing about the loyalty liability adjustment is it's because we expect to have incremental transactions or redemptions on the loyalty program. So you're right, look for profit dollar growth on the supply chain -- sorry, on the company stores. But I think we also do believe that there is an opportunity to expand margins in addition to driving profit dollar growth as we leverage the fixed cost structure of the company stores. So look for both on company stores is my answer.
Russell Weiner: And on the state of the industry, I think and this is really even looking forward to 2024. A lot of what we expect is QSR there to be real pressure on orders and transactions. We don’t expect that to be the case with Domino’s, and I think will be unique in that area in 2024.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Brian Harbour: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about just your international sales outlook as well. How much of this do you think is kind of market specific execution issues? And I'm referring to just some of the countries that have been a little bit slower versus kind of macro pressures. And as you have that outlook for kind of improvement through the year, does that depend on some of those macro pressures easing, like, for example, if you think about India or can you maybe comment on some of the other markets that you didn't address before.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Well, actually, maybe I'll start out talking about India because I was speaking over the weekend to Hari Bhartia, who's the Chairman of Jubilant. I mean that's a great example of both dynamics you talk about. And so obviously, they're pushing the business there. It's some headwinds. But what Hari talked about is what's going on in the rest of the industry and why he's bullish and while he's looking for the future. And while they're talking about 200 stores to grow in 2024 is because he's growing share. And so what I love about our franchisees is that they're future focused. And I think you see a lot of folks doing what they're doing in India. That's why we think the second half is going to return to that 3% that we talked about. Anything to add?
Sandeep Reddy: No. I think Russell is exactly right. We think it's all tied back to the Hungry for MORE strategy is being applied across the entire system with the international markets. Learnings from markets like Australia being applied across DPE and essentially all of the other markets as well have embraced Hungry for MORE, and that’s really what we’re looking to drive.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your question, please.
Danilo Gargiulo: Thank you. I have a quick clarification and then a question. So the clarification is, Russell, you mentioned that you're expecting some real pressures in the industry, but not for Domino's. Can you clarify whether the increase in transactions that you've seen in the fourth quarter is across all the income cohorts? And then the question is, can you talk about the speed of delivery in the overage channel versus your own channel, understanding that you're using your own drivers anyway? And maybe how does the delivery timing compared versus your peers today?
Russell Weiner: On the transactions piece, we believe that our transactions being positive is something that, like I said, is that is unique in the industry. We'll get more share information as that comes out, and we'll certainly share that with you. On speed of delivery, the biggest comparison -- the biggest comparison we have is versus ourselves. And every day, we expect to get better than the day before. So we're happy that we're back to 2019 levels. We're now moving more volume into that delivery network. And we're doing everything we can, not only to make sure that the delivery times or where they need to be. But more importantly, we haven't talked a lot about this is that the quality is there. And so when you think about our Hungry For MORE pillars, the first M is about most delicious food and so just delivering a pizza on time is one thing. It's got to be great. And one of the things that I talk about, hopefully, there are no Boston Red Socks fans on the call today of a Yankee fan. And there's a famous player, Joe DiMaggio who there's a quote Somebody asked him one, why you play so hard every game. And what he said was there's going to be someone who sees me for the first time in that game and so I'm playing for them. And that is how we need to approach making our pizza. Every pizza you're making is for your mom, right? And that's what some of these sprints are all about with more delicious operations. We're making promises in our advertising we need to deliver it, and it's more than just time. It's quality, it's consistency in all of those. And we like to say, down, we don't sell 1 million pizzas a day. Our goal is to sell one pizza a day 1 million times. And that's kind of the new thinking behind Delicious operations.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. Your question, please.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just following up from the Investor Day, you guys talked about your, I guess, Pulse 2.0 technology. And I think you mentioned there will be a complete overhaul throughout 2024 in conjunction with your Microsoft partnership talking about AI tools and whatnot, which are clearly very topical. So I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the greatest changes or the most likely incremental benefits to the front or the back of the house and maybe the time frame to see those benefits. Obviously, it's been, like you said, a long time coming with this major overhaul. So just trying to get a sense of what we're going to see as we look through '24. Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Thanks for the question. It's a good time for me to clarify that. I think the future of the benefits of Pulse is actually now, right? We talked about [indiscernible] and accelerating the areas within the circle of operations that make the biggest difference in our business. And so yes, next-generation pulses in stores now, some stores in the U.S. will be rolling out to a bigger degree later on in 2024. But the most important element, the ones that are going to drive the operational efficiencies, the more delicious food, the improved atmosphere -- working atmosphere for our team members. Those are out in the [indiscernible] with current pulse and the next-generation pulse. Hopefully, that clarifies it. The Microsoft – the answer to your Microsoft question is we’re working really in two areas with Microsoft and generative AI. One is on the consumer ordering side. We are not waiting for the new website to come in to see something on that. So you’ll see something that in 2024. And then also on the store side and what can we do with Generative AI to make the experience better on our team members in store. And so we’ll have more to talk about both of those in 2024.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your question, please.
Unidentified Participant: Hi. This is Joe Zinski (ph) on for Andrew Strelzik. Thanks for taking the question. So I'm curious how you would characterize the current competitive environment and what you're seeing from a promotional standpoint. And I was wondering if you could provide any incremental details regarding product innovation and the two new products that you are planning to launch this year? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Sure. I don't really like to talk a lot about competitors. I mean, a competitor we have is ourselves, and we try to get better than ourselves every day, and I think you see that in our Q4 results. I talked in general about it probably being a year that's less about order count. And we'll see how folks adjust to that and when they do, be happy to comment on that through the year. I didn't quite hear your second question. Can you repeat the second -- even though we're only supposed to ask one I'm joking. Yeah, products. Thank you very much. Yeah, on the product side, couple of things. One is we're really happy that we've got our pan pizza out there now. But that's not a new product, and you should know that is not counted among the kind of two plus new products we're going to have this year. But what you do see with that is, we haven't talked about pan pizza since 2014. So while I'm not counting it on my list of new products, it's something that's new to a lot of people and something that is really shot. If you look at the way we shot that commercial in the new way of kind of romancing the deliciousness of our pizza. So we're out with product news. News on a product for the first time in a long time, but that's not part of our two new product scheme for this year.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Carril from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.
Chris Carril: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. So Russell, you mentioned the U.S. system added more than 60 new franchisees. I think that was the most in 15 years, you said. On the back of this, how are you thinking about the evolution of the domestic franchisee base and just the balance of openings coming from new franchisees versus longer tenured franchisees going forward? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Thanks a lot for the question. When we have calls like this and what I -- what I tell people is you're ever wondering how the Domino's Pizza brand is going to do in the future, you look at what your franchisees are doing. And franchisees right now from a profit standpoint, obviously really positive versus where they were the year before. We opened up more stores really heavy towards the end of the year when things became clear there, yet we're still very positive that we're going to beat that number in 2024 and hit our 175 plus algorithm. The 60 to me means that we've got young of encumbers within our system that for the first time in 15 years, it's bigger than -- or bigger than we have had in 15 years, which means they see a really positive future. And the cool thing is as you look into '24, what I can tell you is two things. One is we already have 170 new potential franchisees that are either in or have graduated our franchise management school, which is the last step you do before you either build a store or buy a store. And we have 50 already waiting on opens or transfers within the system. We're in February. And so I think some of the momentum you saw is going to continue. And that just shows what they are feeling about the brand where they want to invest.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Meredith Jensen from HSBC. Your question, please.
Meredith Jensen: Yes. Hi. I know we've spoken about it a number of times in terms of the loyalty program. But given the mention of the liability, the loyalty liability from the relaunch, is there a way or how would you suggest we sort of track that and look at the breakage levels and sort of see where that may be going in the future and how we should sort of map that out. Obviously, as you mentioned, it's a positive thing, so. Thank you.
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah, Meredith. Thank you for the question. And look, I mean, I think the way to look at this is it’s the appropriate accounting treatment if we’re going to expect to see more redemptions, and that’s the adjustment to the breakage accrual. But I think the whole point with this is our Domino’s Rewards program is working as we intended. More transactions expected to come in, more redemptions are expected to come in. And I think Sarah asked the question earlier, look for profit dollar growth in addition to margin expansion as we move forward, especially on the company stores in 2024. And we’ll continue to provide disclosure as we move forward, but that’s how I would actually measure performance on this.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Mullan from Piper Sandler. Your question, please.
Brian Mullan: Hey. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the topic of Domino's advertising on Uber. Understanding it's just getting started, it will ramp throughout the year. Can you just discuss any learnings you've had here? Is it going how you would have thought? Has anything with the effectiveness surprised you either positively or negatively. And I ask in the context of just -- it's a new activity for Domino's, but I know you've been preparing to get ready for it. So just any thoughts on that strategy?
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Thanks, Brian. There’s two advertising now for Domino’s on Uber. One is Domino’s and the other is Uber. And I think what we’re seeing on that platform is very promotionally driven. And the nice place. The nice thing is when you think of marketplaces and excelling on marketplaces, that’s what we do, whether it’s a Google marketplace or in this case, Uber. And so responding how you would think it’s very much promotionally driven, but we know how to excel in those areas, which is why we are confident that a percent of sales remover is going to increase to that 3% exit rate we talk about.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jon Tower from Citi. Your question, please.
Jon Tower: Great. Thanks. I appreciate it. Quick clarification on a question. Clarification, the loyalty liability. I'm assuming that was just a onetime true-up, if you can clarify, that would be great. And then the question is on frequency shifts you're seeing in the loyalty program. Any way you can give us some sort of benchmarks as to where some of the more loyal customers were spending either frequency last year and what it's looking like so far since you made the shifts in late '23.
Sandeep Reddy: So I'll take the first part of the question, John. And it is a onetime thing because I think the significance of the change of the new program was what was the trigger. But that doesn't mean it's never going to happen also because I think you always have to continue to monitor your breakage and if you do need to make a true-up, you will make a true up. But given the new program launching, I think this was much more of a onetime event because of the new program launching. And I think on the frequency ships, Russell will take the question.
Russell Weiner: Yeah. What I can tell you, macro, we're still just a couple of months into this thing is what we thought we would see with regards to car customers and lighter user engagement, we are seeing. What we will do, John, is make sure throughout the year when we got more information under our belt, and we're able to give perspective because remember, loyalty programs are not just about the first use or the second it's about lifetime value and use over time. And so as we get more color on that, we’ll share.
Greg Lemenchick: Thanks, John. That was our last question of the call. I want to thank you all for joining our call today, and we look forward to speaking with you all soon. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-12 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to Domino's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Ryan Goers, Vice President-Finance, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Ryan Goers: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our conversation regarding the results for the third quarter of 2023. Today's call will begin with our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner; followed by our Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. Russell and Sandeep will leave ample time for questions and discussion. As this call is for our investor audience, members of the media and others should be in a listen-only mode. The forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that maybe referenced on today's call. We want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such, we encourage you to ask only one, one-part question on this call. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. I'd now like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. My remarks this morning will focus on several new initiatives that are designed to create significant shareholder value in the months and years ahead. We launched our new loyalty program, Domino’s Rewards on September 12. And here are some of the mechanics that are really meaningful to our current and prospective customers. First, we lowered the spend threshold to earn points from $10 down to $5, and this change will make us even more competitive in the carryout segment where ticket tends to be lower. Our second change was creating more attainable redemption opportunities for lower frequency customers. So in the past, they needed to order six times to get a free pizza. Our new program features redemptions at 20, 40 and 60 point tiers and offers items from eight different categories on our expansive menu. Joining pizza at the 60-point level, are the big sandwiches, pastas, and lava cakes; at 40-points, we feature our lines of bread twist and Stuffed Cheesy Bread; and at 20-points, we offer single-serve beverages, Parmesan Bread Bites and Dipping Cups. So, more items to choose from with redemption options after just two purchases. While the program just launched, we've seen meaningful redemptions at the 20 and 40-point levels. So customers are clearly engaging more with Domino's Rewards. These strategic improvements will be a significant value driver for our brand and company. We plan to grow active users and order frequency, unlocking continued share growth in both the delivery and carryout segment. Our second value-creating initiative is entering the aggregator marketplace for delivery orders. Our integration into the Uber Eats platform is proceeding as planned. We'll achieve our goal of Uber Eats providing delivery orders to all our U.S. stores by the end of the year. We expect this initiative will drive incremental delivery volume from new customers, increase our share of the pizza delivery market and create stronger economics for our company and franchisees. This will begin in a measurable way in the first quarter of 2024. We want to exceed the expectations that the incremental customers will get through Domino's Rewards and Uber Eats. Now the way to do that is through best-in-class delivery service. And that's why I'm pleased to announce that we ended Q3 of 2023 back at our pre-pandemic Q3 2019 delivery times. This improvement was achieved through many of the best practices highlighted with franchisees during our Summer of Service program. This focus is important for us to provide an excellent delivery experience for new customers flowing in from Domino's Rewards and the Uber Eats channel. We want these experiences to lead to loyal lasting customers who will provide considerable lifetime value for our brand and our company. Now I'll talk to our renewed commitment to the all-important role innovation plays in the pizza category and our ability to continue to build our brand. We launched pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread on August 28. The Stuffed Cheesy Bread launch is indicative of two things that you're going to see from us going forward; bringing news to our existing non-pizza platforms and leveraging Domino's Rewards. For the launch of pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread, we lowered the redemption points required from 40 to 20. It's great to see a product and technology innovation work so well together, and this is an example of the kind of purposeful innovation I've talked about in the past, innovation that serves many functions. In this case, we've got a new product that makes an existing platform top of mind with customers, all the while encouraging customers to sign up for and continue to take advantage of our improved loyalty program. So more customers, more orders and more market share, all leading to more top-line growth and greater profit. Another example of purposeful innovation is the Emergency Pizza promotion we launched just a few days ago. Customers who order Domino's will have 30 days to claim a free pizza to use in any emergency they see fit, whether dinner was burned or maybe circumstances or making things a bit tougher to afford. Customers who place an order on our e-commerce platform will automatically earn a Domino's Emergency Pizza. They'll have 30 days to redeem their Emergency Pizza and, of course, must be members of Domino's Rewards to do so. Another innovation designed to drive more customers, more orders and more profit. We're also driving purposeful innovation behind technology to improve customer service and a team member experience. On October 3, we announced undertaking this challenge with the best in the business, Microsoft. Our two companies will collaborate on Generative AI solutions that will create the next generation of pizza ordering and operations technology. Together, our teams are focused on two important goals: first, transforming customer experiences by enhancing the ordering process through personalization and simplification; and then second, streamlining operations and quality control with more predictive tools. I couldn't be more excited to work with Microsoft on this critical endeavor. Finally, I want to address one of the most important topics for all of us here at Domino's, and that's profit, profit for our stores and profit for our company. Despite our predicted and previously discussed softness in our U.S. same-store sales, our operating income margin improved as did our estimated franchisee profitability for the year. What that means is that the sales improvements we expect to realize in Q4 and even more significantly in 2024 will flow through a more efficient model for Domino's and our investors. I am confident about our future, including the more immediate future, here at Domino's. With that, I'll turn things over to Sandeep.
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, Russell, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before I go through our financial performance for the quarter, I wanted to give an update on Russia. Our master franchisee DP Eurasia, announced their process to exit the market, as detailed in our earnings release. As a result, we closed the remaining 143 stores in the market during the third quarter. For the purposes of global retail sales growth and our net store growth, we have removed the Russia business from both the current and prior year. Moving on to updates on our actions to drive the long-term profitability of Domino's and our franchisees. First, pricing. During the third quarter, the average price increase across our U.S. system was 3.2%. We now expect average realized pricing to moderate to slightly below 1% in the fourth quarter when we left the carryout Mix & Match pricing change from October 2022 and incorporate the impact of trends we are seeing from our newly launched Domino's Rewards loyalty program. Second, cost efficiency as we continue to drive margin recovery. We drove an improvement in our operating income margin, which grew by 190 basis points versus Q3 2022. We now expect operating income margins for the year to reach 2021 levels. Third, positive retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact in our U.S. and international businesses, drove operating income improvement. Now for our financial results for the quarter. Excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 5.1% and due to positive international sales comps and global net store growth. U.S. retail sales increased 0.9%. International retail sales, excluding the positive impact of foreign currency grew 9.4%. During Q3, same-store sales for the U.S. business decreased 0.6%. The decrease in U.S. same-store sales was driven by order count declines, partially offset by a higher average ticket, including the pricing actions I mentioned earlier. Our U.S. carryout business continued its positive momentum in Q3, with same-store sales plus 1.9% and rolling over a plus 19.6% performance in 2022. The delivery business continued to be challenged in Q3, in line with our expectations stated on the last call, with delivery same-store sales minus 2.3%, rolling over a minus 7.5% in Q3 2022. As mentioned on the last call, we expect delivery orders to have an improvement in trend in Q4, as our updated loyalty program and our Emergency Pizza Promotion have now rolled out. And that followed by a considerable improvement in 2024, as a result of transaction growth from our Uber Eats partnership and the other initiatives previously shared with you. Including consistent trends versus Q3 in our carryout business, we expect U.S. sales comps to be positive in the fourth quarter. Shifting to unit count. We added 27 net new stores in the U.S. with 28 store openings and one closure, bringing our U.S. system store count to 6,762 stores at the end of the quarter. As we had previously indicated, the U.S. four quarter net store growth rate stabilized during the quarter at 1.8% consistent with the rate at the end of the second quarter. We remain confident the store growth rate will improve during the fourth quarter with further acceleration into 2024. As of last week, 72 stores are under construction in the U.S., the majority of which are expected to open in Q4. Domino's unit economics remained strong with continued EBITDA growth for our U.S. franchisees. We are on track to deliver estimated average franchisee store profitability of at least $155,000 in 2023 up from the $150,000 we indicated on the last call. Same-store sales in our international business, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 3.3%. Our international store count decreased by 35 net stores comprised of 190 store openings and 225 closures. Closures were primarily driven by the previously mentioned exit of the Russia market and its remaining 143 stores, along with store closures from Domino's Pizza Enterprises as mentioned on our last call. Our current trailing four quarter net store growth rate in international was 5.9%. When combined with our U.S. store growth, our trailing four-quarter global net store growth rate was 4.5%. We expect our global unit growth to track to or slightly below the low-end of our 5% to 7% two to three year outlook. Despite strong gross openings, we will be pressured by elevated store closures this year that we believe are mostly behind us. Since these closures were underperforming stores and certain underperforming markets, we do not anticipate this will materially impact the financial benefit of our new international store openings. Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.
Brian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning. The Domino system clearly has two new drivers in your relaunch of Rewards in the upcoming Uber Eats initiative. And you seem very confident that this is going to drive incremental demand. You even had the Summer of Service initiative earlier this year to get the system ready for higher order counts. And just as it relates specifically to this Rewards relaunch, it happened a month ago. So we're a month in. And it'd just be really helpful to understand the early reads on this initiative. I know you expect improved comp trends in the fourth quarter. I think you said positive comps. But any incremental color would be helpful on whether it's driving true incrementality and how it's behaving relative to your pre-launch expectations for the relaunch.
Russell Weiner: Good morning, Brian, it's Russell. Thanks for the question. And we're really - I'd say very excited about how this has come out of the gate. We've done two things with the rewards program and both are working, right? Purposely, we took the dollar level down entry level from $10 to $5. That's really important, especially when you think about our carryout customer. We have a national deal at $7.99. So prior to this change, you couldn't get the national deal and loyalty points. So this has been a really nice way to bring in lighter users and carryout customers. That's on the front-end. And then on the back-end, we talked about we have eight different ways, eight different platforms now that you can use your points. It used to be that you had to buy six times in order to get a free pizza. Now you can buy as little as two times to get free items and what that does is it really plays with frequency of lighter users. So you're right, that's what we projected beforehand what I can tell you as we've moved in so far, that's exactly what we've seen. We've seen a lot of folks doing that with Domino's Rewards.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your question, please.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks, and thanks for all the color you guys provided. Russell, I wanted to ask about the Uber Eats partnership, which you guys seem also very excited about, that really kicks into gear next year. But I think you guys have had it in a few markets so far now for either a couple of months or so. Any thoughts or any detail you could provide on the early reads there, or any - how it's performing versus your expectations, and if you've had to make any adjustments so far to the program going forward? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yes. Thanks Peter. Obviously, it's something we're all really watching closely these pilot markets, and I call it pilot versus test market because we're really not using any marketing, either outside or inside the Uber platform at this point. This is really more to test out what I call kind of the handshake between two really large platforms I mean Domino's, we already deliver more pizzas than anyone in the country, and so as we take on these incremental orders, we just need to make sure that technology works. That's what we're doing now and then certainly making sure the staffing is right, and we're working with Uber and our franchisees to do that. So we've been in Las Vegas right now. And what I can tell you is things are going as planned, and we're now continuing that - those pilots moving in over the next - the course of the next few weeks into Houston, Miami, Detroit and Seattle, both corporate stores and franchise stores. So all is going as we expected, and we're still on target for a national launch at the end of the year.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Sara Senatore: Great. Thank you very much. I just actually a clarification of the question. I just wanted to make sure I understood that the growth opens in the U.S. are on track to the global numbers on that are more about international closures. But then the question I had was about the loyalty. You said that you're seeing more engagement. I guess when would you expect to see the increased frequency? If you have these sort of lower frequency customers who are only coming a couple of times a year, might it take a while for you to know the impact of the change in the redemption tiers? Or is there anything you can tell us about frequency, whether it's average or the low frequency customer that you might be seeing that could give us some color as to what the impact on transactions might look like over time?
Russell Weiner: Sure. I'll answer both your questions. I think your first question was bout closures in the U.S. In the U.S., we actually - we closed one store this past quarter. And I think Sandeep talked about franchisee EBITDA. And when you think about what drives store opens, and remember, he said that we've got visibility into over 70 builds right now. So you've got visibility into builds. You've got franchisee EBITDA at 155. These stores when they open - stay open. There's a lot of excitement about building stores at Domino's Pizza. We've been under 20 annual closures in the U.S. since 2017. So we have a strong U.S. pipeline and those stores stay open. On the loyalty side, what I can tell you, obviously, it is really early in, but what we were looking for is lower level redemption levels amongst customers, and we're seeing that in spades. So we'll have more information longer term once we get through a couple of purchase cycles, but pretty much right away, we're seeing what we wanted to see there.
Sandeep Reddy: And Sara, I'll just add on, on the global net unit growth. That's really driven by the international closures that we talked about in the last call, and now we're seeing it come through in the Q3 numbers as well. And that's the big driver of the adjustment and the expectations on the '23 level.
Sara Senatore: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your question please.
Dennis Geiger: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask another on the U.S. new open trajectory. And maybe a little more thoughts as it relates to U.S. franchisee demand to open those stores and the expected acceleration into 2024. I guess how much of this is - you've got some really compelling sales drivers. The top-line is going to look better. The returns are going to look better. How much of it maybe is the staffing is in a better place than it has been over the last 12 months to 18 months, 12 months to 24 months? If you could just kind of unpack a little bit of the sort of demand shift from what we've seen maybe over the last 12-plus months to what you guys expect in 2024 and beyond in the U.S., that would be great? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yes, Dennis. Well, you've obviously done good research on the business. You hit a lot of those there. I think it's - all those things are coming back, right? So the headwind on opens that were there with permitting and all that, those have started to subside. Staffing is back where we needed to. I want to reiterate how proud I am of our system. We are back at 2019 service levels, which is - it's a big deal, and it talks about where we've gotten our staffing to. Second is - the second big chunk is over what folks are seeing on the returns of the businesses they currently own. And as EBITDA continues to go up, if I'm a franchisee, I'd say, wow, EBITDA is at 155 right now, and that's on relatively flat sales in the U.S. And we know what's coming in the Q4, and we know it's coming with Uber in Q1, so today. And so that there's a lot of interest to make sure that we service this volume. I think lastly, this carryout business that we're leaning into, store growth is so important. The franchisees realize that. Right now, when we opened a new store, even when the store is split. So when we take an existing service area, and we split it, about 80% of those carryout customers are incremental. And so when you look at the headwinds that have subsided and you look into the present and the future as the franchisees, there are a lot of reasons to build a Domino's store.
Sandeep Reddy: And Dennis, I'll just add on something, because I think we've – in previous calls, we talked about the build cost, right, where we expected to - the build costs have gone up about 20% versus 2019. Frankly, build costs are coming in a very similar level for 2023 from what we've seen so far. And look, profit has actually gone up. We updated last time to $150 million, now its $155. So obviously, returns are going to be more and more compelling, given that dynamic. And frankly, with the Uber opportunity coming next year, we expect to see even more growth in 2024 in terms of profitability of the stores. So our appetite is very strong.
Dennis Geiger: Thank you guys, appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Saransh Gokhale from JPMorgan. Your question please.
John Ivankoe: Hi, this is John Ivankoe. Hopefully, you can hear me. The question is actually on the Microsoft announcement. And I do want to put this in the context of 20-plus years of in-house point-of-sale development a closed system. Obviously, there are significant benefits that came with this closed system but also considerable costs. So I just did want you to frame and I think it's a five-year agreement that I read in the release, just kind of how you see this balance changing, both from a benefit side. Of the equation, what the franchisees are going to see, what the customer will see, what, of course, you will get as a company, but also the cost side of the equation, this is actually an opportunity to perhaps on a net basis, slow some of the technology spend that Domino's has actually been famous for over the years? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Hi. Morning John, that's great point, as you look back in the history of Domino's, we certainly have built more things internally when it comes to competitive points of difference. I think we've always said, you can't outsource a competitive point of difference. We do outsource things that are really out there in the field that really are in a competitive point of difference what have we done here in this case. There's going to be a competitive point of difference, with Generative AI solutions. And we think we've got the resources and the pizza expertise internally. What we've got with Microsoft is the best in the field externally. And so you take those two things together, and it's not just cost, it's also an impact. This is a journey that if we could pick anyone to do it with, we would pick Microsoft. And so right now, the focus is really on two areas with them, first on transforming the consumer experience by enhancing the order process through things like personalization, and simplification. And the second is streaming - streamlining operations and quality control with some more predictive tools. So yes, this is kind of a hybrid here, best-in-class, both best-in-class pizza, best-in-class AI and our teams are very excited to work together.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Your question please.
Andrew Strelzik: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just a broader question on the consumer and what you're seeing there? And how maybe behaviors may be evolving, whether it's through delivery carryout, domestic international, curious what your analytics are showing you and how things are changing? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yes. Our approach, no matter what the consumer environment has always been the same, which is to provide the best relative value for our customers and that hasn't changed not only the U.S., but internationally. I'd like to point to a couple of best practices that have been exported around our boost weeks. We just had boost weeks in Mexico and Canada with television behind them just like we do here in the States. Those are the best weeks that those countries have had. And so I think just in general, customers are looking for value. Now, what we're trying to do here at Domino's is position the value more than just price. And that to me is the beauty of Emergency Pizza. And I want to talk about that a little bit. Essentially what Emergency Pizza is, is old school buy one get one free as a former marketer, right? But because of the tension in the world right now around the economy and things like that, people, their antennas are up. And so instead of calling it a buy one get one free, our creative marketing department decided - or buy one get one later, which is essentially what this is. You buy a pizza now, you can get your Emergency Pizza whenever you want over the next 30 days. We call it Emergency Pizza. The mechanics are still the same, but the message is going to resonate because of the economic that you're talking about. So best-in-class value is important, but making sure we break through with not just a value message, a strong brand message is critical, and I think we're doing that.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Carril from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.
Chris Carril: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for the question. So just on the outlook updates, can you expand maybe a bit more on what's driving the changes there? For retail sales, is it simply international performance to date or are you seeing anything in the current quarter that's leading to the update? And then on net unit growth, just to clarify, is the Russia exit not a factor in the updated unit growth outlook? Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks, Chris. I'll just answer that question for you. So on the retail sales outlook, I think we're taking into consideration the nine months, the three quarters that have passed plus the expectations that we have for the fourth quarter and that's incorporated in what we're talking about. As you noted, it includes an expectation of positive comps in the United States and an expectation of a strong growth in the international business as well. So I think from a unit growth standpoint, what we have taken into consideration is the closures that have happened internationally. That's the big driver of the modification that we made over there. But overall I think our U.S. business, as Russell talked about earlier in terms of visibility and trajectory, looks very solid and I think the entire change in unit growth on a global level is based on international business and the closures there.
Russell Weiner: And let me just put some, maybe some perspective on those closures. The ones that Russia obviously were talked to ahead of time, Domino's Pizza enterprises announced over the summer that they were going to have closures as part of a kind of a short-term business adjustment on their side And we saw those in Q2 and Q3. What Domino's Pizza Enterprises also did was they talked about that they were not going to change and they were still bullish around their long-term outlook for 2033 still at 7,100 stores. So I see this as kind of both of these as one-time-ish events. You take those two blocks of closures out, we closed less than 15 stores in international this quarter. And from an opening perspective, still stayed right around 1,000 store openings for trailing 12 months, we opened up over 1,000 in 2021 over 1,000 in 2022, and so that's just a little bit more color around our international store openings.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.
David Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. In the press release, you talked about the lift from third party and loyalty hitting in 2024. I’m wonder about this quarter, what sort of net same-store sales impact do you expect from loyalty in 4Q, the higher orders minus perhaps higher redemptions. And come to think of it, I'm not really sure what sort of lift you're expecting from loyalty over time. I think for some reason, we were thinking something like a couple of percentage point boost from loyalty and more of like a step change, not something that ramps, and of course, the magnitude and the ramp part, I'm not really sure about either. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about magnitude and perhaps a ramp phase to loyalty. Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yes. Thanks, David. I think both Sandeep and I will answer this one. On loyalty, loyalty is one of a few things. We've got loyalty, Pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread, Emergency Pizza. All things that we absolutely think are going to know are going to affect our Q4 numbers, and we're seeing that out of the gate. The third party piece will start in Q4 in December and that will be ramping up certainly big time next year. From a loyalty perspective, as soon as we get more information on how that is affecting the business, we'll let you know. But I can tell you, short-term, folks are interacting with the loyalty program and our innovation at a higher level than I expected coming in.
Sandeep Reddy: And Dave, I want to just add something to that, just so you can get a sense of cadence in terms of what's been happening with the comps and what our expectations are for Q4. If you note, we actually had a reduction in the impact of pricing from 2% roughly to a little bit under 1% in our expectations for Q4. And this was driven really by the increased redemptions that we were seeing from loyalty, Domino's Rewards, which is great because it actually is more than offset by incremental transactions, and that is implicit in our expectations of the comp that we're talking about for the fourth quarter being positive, which if you think about it, if you have a roughly 1% impact on pricing, this implies transactions are nearly flat or better in the total business. And so this - the good news about this is we expect this improvement in transactions to come both in delivery as well as carryout. And remember that carryout, we're lapping the Mix & Match promo pricing, which was done in October 2022, so we lose a bit of pricing over there, but we still expect to have consistent trends in the fourth quarter on carryout too. So feeling really good about the balance of the impact of the loyalty program on Q4, and it's definitely an accelerator of transactions.
David Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Brian Harbour: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I don't think you commented just on food basket. But is it fair to assume you've seen a couple of quarters of that being lower. And as we think about store margins and supply chain profits that, that probably continues into the fourth quarter at this point?
Russell Weiner: Yes, Brian, a really good question on the food basket. I think we – when we reported in July for the second quarter, there was so much volatility, particularly on cheese. That volatility did continue, but the trend line that we drew in the third quarter ended up still being favorable to us, as you saw and what we reported for minus 1.7% in the basket. Things are still a bit volatile, but I think overall trends seem to be pointing to favorability. And when you think about the franchisee store profitability going from 150 to 155, a big driver of that improvement, whether improved basket, both in Q3 and perhaps a little bit of an expectation of a little bit more tailwind as we go into the fourth quarter. So that's how we see the food basket and franchisee profitability, but supply chain margins also - if food baskets ends up being deflationary in the fourth quarter will benefit from a margin standpoint.
Brian Harbour: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Your question please.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Sandeep, I was hoping you could help just with the supply chain and how we should think about that going forward. The productivity benefits continued in 3Q as you indicated in 10-Q. With this still around the neighborhood of 70 basis points and at least versus our model, it looks like the labor cost in the supply chain business were a bit higher in 3Q than they were in 2Q. Could you speak to that the durability of that as well?
Russell Weiner: Yes, Andrew. I think when we look at supply chain, you're right, the biggest driver of the margin improvement is the procurement productivity that has been there earlier, and we expect that to continue into the fourth quarter as well. When we look at what happened in the third quarter, I just talked to Brian about this and we got the benefit of the food basket actually impacting the margin slightly favorable. There was a little bit of labor pressure, but I think a lot of that is more driven by the opening of the Indiana center that we'll lap over. So overall, I think, we're very happy with the trends that we're seeing in supply chain margins. And if you go back to the - the answer I gave to Dave on transactions, guess what that does. It's going to drive more volume through our supply chain centers and therefore, drive more profit out of our supply chain centers.
Andrew Charles: Very good. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your question, please.
Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Russell, I appreciate your comments earlier about the importance of Domino's offering the best value to consumers. But Domino's won't be offering international deals like Mix & Match on the Uber platform. So I'm trying to understand what proposition Domino's can offer on Uber that will be as effective against the competition? And I'm also curious if you think Domino's can obtain a similar share of the 3P pizza delivery market that it has off of the 3P platform.
Russell Weiner: Chris, great question. Let me take a step back and just make sure I talk about our strategy, both on our assets and then on Uber and I'll get to your question, but I want you to understand kind of the broader piece here, because at the end of the day, we want to drive incrementality. And when you think about our assets, if you're a customer and you want the best prices or you want the best loyalty program, you're going to come to dominos.com. There are going to be some customers, and that's why we're going into this marketplace. That are either only Uber customers or maybe have both. And because of that, what we want to make sure we're doing is, price it in such a way that if we don't have consumer incrementality, we at least are positive on the margin side for our franchisees. And so while we'll have our entire menu on Uber, we'll have a slight premium to our menu price on that channel. Now, menu prices at Domino's Pizza are still very competitive. And so I think within that platform, we'll be competitive. The second thing that we do really well, and you see this in our digital media, the Uber marketplace is a digital platform for us. And so we've got our National Advertising Fund budget and all the expertise we have from being on Facebook and all the other social media platforms. We're going to bring that into Uber, and we're going to drive folks within that platform with our marketing money. If you're in that platform, we're going to drive you the Domino's. And we have a lot of expertise on how to do that. And once you're there relative to other menu prices that you're going to see from the competition, we'll be in a really good place. So I think we'll be a value player there, and we'll have high awareness once you're within that platform. And so absolutely, I think we can get to our fair share on that platform, as well as eventually the entire marketplace for aggregators.
Chris O'Cull: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Long from Stephens Inc. Your question please.
Joshua Long: Great. Thank you for taking my question. When we think about loyalty and the opportunity for carryout to participate there, a lot of the conversation has been focused on third-party marketplace and some of the initiatives that have been put in place to unlock delivery. But can we circle back to other carryout initiatives and how you think about building that piece and that's been a strategic point of focus in prior calls. And just so as we think back you think forward to 2024 and beyond. Can you talk a little bit more about how you're building the awareness and scaling up the carryout side of your business as well, please?
Russell Weiner: Yes. Great. Carryout is one of my favorite topics, most recently, I'll just point to the two-year 21.5% comp in the - on the carryout business there. It's a really strong channel. Remember, last time, we talked about two really big incremental channels of growth for Domino's Pizza, right? The first was getting our fair share of the aggregator business. That's $1 billion net of incrementality. But the second is our fair share of carryout. What's our fair share of carryout? And by the way, carryout has been our most aggressive growth over the last decade ago from a share perspective. It's one in three just like we do one in three deliveries. And that's like a $2 billion opportunity. And so we're going to continue to lean in. Now the nice thing is what we're seeing is the stuff that we're doing, really affects both parts of our business, the more we're learning, I think we've talked about before that the customers are pretty separate customers. But at the end of the day, they're pizza customers. So things like Pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread, things like Emergency Pizza are going to work across both ends. And actually we've seen really nice redemption on Emergency Pizza from carryout customers, which is - it's been surprising to me. You'll also see us though continue to lean in on both the marketing and the operations piece of it, right? So, the marketing, you've seen carryout tips before. I'm sure that one's going to come back. Phone ordering is really important, believe it or not. We have a large number of our customers coming in on online ordering, but we still need to make sure that the phones are there so operationally, and we're answering those calls right now, and about 3,000 of our stores have call centers as potential overflow. And so driving the top line, driving the marketing, driving the funnel there, but also having the operational support are both things that we need to do and we will be doing.
Joshua Long: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Sanderson from Northcoast Research. Your question, please. Jim Sanderson, your phone might be on mute.
Russell Weiner: Sounds like Jim is waiting for his Emergency Pizza, so we'll make sure we get that to him.
Operator: All right. One moment, we'll move on to our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your question, please.
Danilo Gargiulo: Thank you. Can you share any feedback your franchisees are giving regarding their access to credit? Because with rising interest rates, they're seeing at their end, are there any incremental pressures outside of your control that might be slowing down the net unit growth expectations going forward? And if so, are you contemplating incremental incentive for franchisees to navigate these hard times?
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. Thanks for the question, Danilo. And I think that's a really good question, and that's a very fair point. But I think where we are with the franchisees, I'm going to start with the cash flows that the franchisees are generating because as you think about where we were last year, $139,000 per unit to now $155,000 and above. It is basically definitely a much significantly improved operating cash generation situation for the franchisees. In that backdrop, it is very fair to talk about the credit situation in the marketplace, which is definitely tighter and much more expensive. And so I think franchisees are cognizant of that, but I think as we talk to them, when they look at the trajectory of the business, when they look at the opportunity for growth in the business, they definitely have a very strong appetite for unit development as Russell talked about earlier and I talked about on the prepared remarks. And from an incentive standpoint, as a company, we've always actually worked with franchisees on incentive programs and we'll continue to do that. And so I think as we look at the opportunity for growth, it's in both our interests to look at it and that's something that we will continue to do.
Russell Weiner: And I'd just say as an early indicator, if I look at what we've got in the pipeline this time this year versus this time last year, it's much more aggressive.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Greg Francfort from Guggenheim. Your question, please.
Greg Francfort: Hi. Thanks for the question. Sandeep, last quarter you talked about some of the supply chain efficiencies you'd seen in the first half of the year. I'm wondering how that's looked in the third quarter and going forward. And then, can you just remind us the process of raising some of these fixed spreads on the supply chain cost. You've had mid-teens to high-teens inflation in the last couple of years on a cumulative basis. Obviously, there's a process through which you could raise those spreads on the franchisees, the dollar spreads over time. And I'm curious how often you look at that or how that process goes in raising those. I'm just curious, any thoughts would be helpful. Thanks
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks, Greg. Really good question. I think from a supply chain profit standpoint, as we've talked about all year, we've had procurement productivity benefits, right? And that predominantly is food. And when it actually ties back to you - the last part of your question, which is how do we take a look at adjusting the margins that we basically are taking on, what we're serving on to the franchisees. And so I think a lot of this benefit is flowing through our P&L, clearly, when we talk about the procurement productivity. We'll continue to optimize around this. But I think what has really been great is with the adjustment of volume that has actually happened in the last couple of years leading up into this year, the supply chain flow through has become much tighter as we've actually gotten adjusted to the lower level of volumes. All that's about a change because I think we've reset capacity to be able to deal with volume growth that is expected to come but with a much, much leaner operating model and a much more efficient operating model. So from a profitability standpoint, we continue to expect to see improvements, not massive improvements, but improvements. The big focus should be profit dollar growth from a supply chain standpoint with transaction growth that's coming in the fourth quarter and beyond.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Gojak from Cleveland Research. Your question, please.
Steven Gojak: Yes. Thank you. More of a near-term question, but it does look like you ran a boost week or at least a 50% off offer that first week of October. And it looked like it was outside of the normal pre-COVID cadence you have for those types of promotions. Just curious on the strategy and timing of what looks to be an incremental boost week promotion and particularly doing that, the week ahead of the Emergency Pizza deal, and then how much does that play into the positive fourth quarter outlook that you've laid out earlier in the call? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yes. Steven, we don't - we will not be doing another boost week this quarter that our cadence is to do it quarterly. Obviously, we'd like to keep you guys on your toes, so that's why we don't know. So we maybe we do like to keep you on your toes, but we pick strategic time periods in which to do with it. Obviously, we talk about a stepped up fourth quarter and so getting this out early, I think, makes a lot of sense. I also want to make sure that when we talk about promotional cadence that I touch on, I know this wasn't a direct question, but I know a lot of you have these questions about our product innovation. And I just want to make sure you understand that we're leaning into that again. If you look at our product innovation this year, we've had two major launches. The last time we had two major launches was 2011. And interestingly enough, one of those two launches was Stuffed Cheesy Bread, and so how fitting is it that we've got pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread now in the marketplace. And we're really - and we're doing that purposely because we're seeing a change in the dynamic. If we look back several years and you think about Domino's, we didn't do a lot of product innovation. We did a lot of technology innovation. We built delivery vehicles, all of those kinds of things, and we're going to continue to do that. But we're realizing we need to do more of now is lean into product innovation. And I'll use cheesy bread as an example of how it's really, really working well for us. So we've got platforms. Like I said, we launched Stuffed Cheesy Bread in 2011. We launched sandwiches in 2008, we launched pastas in 2009. A lot of people don't know that we've got these platforms. Even though they're pretty robust mix, there are a lot of people out there that don't know we have them. And so what do we do with Stuffed Cheesy Bread. We launched a new SKU. Believe it or not, we are selling more pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread s now than we are base regular Stuffed Cheesy Bread. I have - I have been doing promotion – I have been doing innovation most of my professional career, and I've never seen a line extension outperform the base. So one, when you do product innovation like this, you get sales on the new product. Two, is you bring awareness back to these great platforms that we have. And then third, what we're doing with the launch is we're leveraging our loyalty program. And so normally, Stuffed Cheesy Bread is a 40-point redemption. In this case, for a limited time, we're doing 20 points. And so you see about how we're working all of these things together is not a one-trick pony. There are kind of three levers going on at one time. I just want to make sure folks on the call know we're going to continue to lean into all types of innovation, including product.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Nick Setyan from Wedbush. Your question please.
Nick Setyan: Thank you. Just a question on how you're thinking about company margins over the medium to longer term. And obviously, pre-COVID over 20% company margins. Just given all of the changes going forward in terms of loyalty, third-party delivery post two, three years of inflation, pricing now seems like it's going to be pretty close to flat. How should we think about company-owned margins not only in Q4 but 2024 and beyond?
Sandeep Reddy: So Nick, I think it's a really good question. And if you look at the company margins in the third quarter, we expanded about 350 basis points, I think, in gross margins. And that was on the back of, I think, a 270 basis points improvement in Q2. So we continue to look at margin expansion in company store margins, and I do acknowledge that it's definitely on peak levels. But there are a number of initiatives that we have been taking as we've been going along. Obviously, from a pricing standpoint, we talked about being late to take pricing a little bit, but I think that's - all of that is actually caught up with us. And I think the other thing we've actually been doing is looking at the cost structure within the P&L, and that is being optimized as well. But overall, the big driver of further improvement in terms of profitability is going to be transaction growth. I talked about transaction growth earlier, which is going to impact the fourth quarter. It's going to impact next year even more. And I think when you see that, we're going to be able to leverage the fixed cost on the P&L a lot better on the company store margins and we'll make the march towards where peak margins used to be over time.
Russell Weiner: Yes. I think the way I look at it is we are going into 2024 with an improved operating model, both for DPZ and our franchisees. As I said earlier, what we had talked about where we thought Q3 would land and it's kind of landed where we expected. Think about the foundation now of this business, right, in a quarter that was essentially flat in the U.S. business, margins improved and the franchisee profit has improved. And so you take that and you bring in the orders that we expect both in Q4, but especially in 2024 that just leverages really, really nice. And so the foundation of Domino's is ready to be leveraged.
Nick Setyan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your question please.
David Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Had question on pricing and value. And I guess, one part of it is, I was wondering, how you and your franchisees are approaching pricing as you think about 2024? And then the second part of the question is, with this Emergency Pizza promotion, it does seem like, maybe you're leaning a bit more towards value or into promotions even outside of the Rewards Program. So I guess are you thinking about leaning in more frequently on value promotions like the one you're running or as you think about 2024.
Russell Weiner: Yes. I think really, the - when you think about 2024, you should think about the actions we've taken over the last couple of years, which includes the pricing we took on our Mix & Match. And while we're always going to look at pricing and if there are ways to optimize it, I think it's reflective in the franchisee EBITDA, that the pricing we took last year was the right thing to do. And it's something that, again, as reflected in their EBITDA is something that we continue to do next year. I'm so excited about pricing even through these tougher economic times. Again, we'll look at things if we need to change it, but I feel pretty bullish that this level of pricing is actually going to just be more of a relative value for customers as we get into next year. As far as Emergency Pizza, look, we always have the - there's always advertising we do and always has a promotional price or some kind of promotional effort. Again, I'm really excited about the kind of feedback we're hearing both from you and from customers because the takeaway is, Wow, this is a lot of value. And it is a lot of value, but it's no more value than we've traditionally done in prior promotion. What it means and kudos to our marketing department is these ideas are breaking through.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question And our next question comes from the line - and this will be our final question for today comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your question, please.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Russell, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the broader pizza segment, it does seem like over the past year, we were talking a lot about maybe customer fatigue, post-COVID and the consumer is keen to get out again. I'm just wondering if you could talk about where you think we are in that spectrum, maybe the current category performance versus Domino's. And if you could just remind us looking back to past slowdowns, the performance of delivery versus carryout in prior downturns, I think most investors are expecting maybe a consumer slowdown going into 2024. So I'm just wondering how you're - two components of your business have historically performed in that type of environment? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yes, sure. Let me first talk about the pizza segment. And historically, it's been a one, 1.5-point growth category. I don't expect that to change significantly. What's been great about Domino's Pizza is when you look at that category, we've been able to by far grow the biggest share amongst that. And so I think the growth of the category is going to continue. What's nice when you think about the pizza category is 40 plus percent of it, a little more in carryout than delivery, is on regionals and independents, folks who really don't have the scale in advertising or supply chain or store growth or advertising spending that we do. And so if that pizza kind of growth kind of continues that where it is, then there's no reason that we can't continue to lean in and gain share. It's - we've done it before and we'll do it again. As far as downturns, I mean, the last big downturn I remember coming out of was 2009 when we launched our new inspired pizza. And obviously, you saw what came out of that, which is growth both in the carryout and delivery standpoint. I think we're going to continue to see what we've been seeing. And we've been talking about folks down switching into the pizza category, down switching into value, this is going to happen I think a lot more in carryout than this delivery because delivery will also have some health switching, right? Delivery - there's delivery fees, there's - there are tips, there are things that it caused that channel to be a little bit more expensive. So I think we will see down switching at both, probably a little more out switching to eating at home for delivery. But the beauty for us is while that's happening, we're opening up to the Uber platform. And that platform has customers that are higher income customers in delivery. And so if there is a slowdown in that, we're now opening ourselves to a platform that really has a little bit more elasticity in that place. So no matter what the economics look like next year, I think both on the carryout and the delivery business, we're going to be a really good place.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Russell for any further remarks.
Russell Weiner: Well, we appreciate talking to everybody today and we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day either live or via video on December 7. Looking forward to it. Take care.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-24 08:30:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Domino's Pizza's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Ryan Goers, Vice President, Finance, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Ryan Goers: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our conversation regarding the results for the second quarter of 2023. Before we begin, I would like to announce that we will hold our Investor Day on December 7, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner, and the entire Domino's leadership team look forward to hosting you at our headquarters. Today's call will feature commentary from Russell and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. I request to our coverage analysts, we want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such, we encourage you to ask only one one-part question on this call. Today's call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner.
Russell Weiner: Well, thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. I'm going to open today with some brief remarks regarding our current focus and the momentum we're creating here at Domino's Pizza. Sandeep will then provide a high-level overview of our quarterly financial performance, followed by ample time for your questions and discussions. We are executing our plan to restore delivery growth here in the United States. Efforts to improve service and staffing and drive value and innovation will continue to make a difference, driving order counts in this important segment of our business. Our delivery service levels ended Q2 nearly two minutes better than Q2 of last year. And with the agreement we recently announced with Uber Eats, Domino's will benefit from a large and growing cohort of delivery customers. We believe these transactions will be incremental and provide a meaningful increase in the number of customers who leverage the Domino's delivery experience. Domino's delivered one out of every three pieces in the U.S. prior to our decision to compete in the aggregator marketplace. According to Circana, aggregator sales for delivery among U.S. quick-serve pizza restaurants has grown to almost $5 billion for the 12 months ending May of 2023. We plan to get our fair share of this market over time. The opportunity represents over $1 billion in incremental sales for our U.S. business. And our research indicates that most of the transactions we gain from participating in this segment will be incremental customers and sales. This has also been supported by what we've learned from our Domino's Pizza international master franchisees who've already developed $1 billion business taking orders from aggregators. We have here at Domino's a common sense process for making business decisions. We ask ourselves this important question: "Is it the right thing to do for the long-term growth of our brand and the business?" Our extensive evaluation indicates that by participating in the aggregator marketplace will drive net incremental orders over the long term by tapping into a new group of consumers. In addition, our contractual agreement has secured the protection that we require to maintain control over our customer data and assess the incrementality of the platform. And most importantly, orders placed through the Uber Eats platform will be delivered by Domino's delivery experts. So, we're excited to begin accepting orders through the Uber Eats channel later this year and look forward to reporting the results of this important growth initiative. Successfully executing an aggressive plan to get our fair share of the scaled pizza distribution channel isn't new to us. We approached the carryout pizza segment in a similar manner back in 2011. Carryout pizza was a smaller percentage of our business before we took thoughtful aggressive action. And today, our carryout business is almost $2.5 billion larger than it was in 2011, making Domino's the number one carryout pizza brand in the U.S. Despite this impressive growth, our current aspiration is to drive our carryout market share even further to at least the same market share we enjoy in pizza delivery today. We need to earn an additional 10 points of market share to reach our fair share in the carryout segment, and this 10 points represents about $2 billion in additional retail sales. Outside of the U.S., Domino's and Uber Eats operate in 27 of the same markets. Our new global deal has the potential to bring Uber Eats' customers to 70% of Domino's stores around the world with improved economics for our international franchisees. Next, I want to talk about another important initiative for us, the new and improved loyalty program that we'll be launching in the U.S. in September of this year. The program will reduce the requirements to earn and redeem loyalty points. This will positively impact our carryout customers as well as help us retain our current and new delivery customers. Finally, we have two exciting innovations that are coming to the U.S. market in the third quarter; this keeps with our stated intention of increasing the pace of innovation. We launched Domino's Pinpoint Delivery in late June. Delivery innovation, as you know, is the core of who we are, so we're thrilled to give customers this new delivery option by allowing them to receive their order nearly anywhere just with the drop of a pin on our app. And in late August, we're going to launch Pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread. Pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread follows the successful launch of Domino's Loaded Tots, and it is delicious. It brings news to our Stuffed Cheesy Bread platform, which was launched over a decade ago. The stuffed cheesy bread line is a significant part of our menu mix and provides a healthy margin for franchisees. My message to you today is more; more sales in both carryout and delivery, more ways to reward customers with our new loyalty program, and more innovation, both technology and product-related. We will drive orders with innovation and value, we'll tap into those incremental marketplace as I talked about, and then we'll bring customers back with best-in-class service and a new and improved loyalty program. This is our go-forward plan at Domino's Pizza. Our momentum will build starting in Q4 and will significantly impact the performance of our business in 2024 and beyond. As important, this momentum should drive continued EBITDA growth for franchisees. Our Mix & Match offer at $6.99, remains a strong value for customers and has helped our franchisees accelerate store-level profitability through Q2. That profitability is higher than it was this time last year despite inflationary headwinds. And I expect it to continue to grow as a result of the sales building initiatives I just outlined. So, there are many exciting things underway here at Domino's Pizza. And now for an overview of our Q2 financial results, I will turn the things over to our CFO, Sandeep Reddy.
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, Russell, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin with updates on our actions to drive the long-term profitability of Domino's and our franchisees. First, pricing. During the second quarter, the average price increase across our U.S. system was 3.9%. We expect average pricing to be similar in the third quarter before moderating in the fourth quarter to approximately 2%, when we left the carryout Mix & Match pricing change from October 2022. Second, cost efficiencies as we continue to drive margin recovery. We drove improvement in our operating income margin, which grew by 240 basis points versus Q2 2022. This was despite foreign exchange rates having a 15 basis points negative year-over-year impact on operating income margin during the quarter. We now expect full-year operating income margins in 2023 to reach or exceed 2019 levels. Third, positive same store sales growth excluding foreign currency impact in our U.S. and international businesses for the third consecutive quarter drove operating income improvement. Now for our financial results for the quarter. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 5.8% due to positive sales comps and global net store growth. U.S. retail sales increased 1.7%. International retail sales, excluding the negative impact of currency, grew 10.1%. During Q2, same store sales for the U.S. business increased 0.1%. The increase in U.S. same store sales was driven by a higher average ticket, including the pricing actions I mentioned earlier, partially offset by order count declines. Our carryout business remained strong in Q2, with same store sales plus 5.6%, rolling over a plus 14.6% performance in 2022. The U.S. delivery business continues to be challenged. Q2 delivery same store sales declined 3.5%, rolling over a minus 11.7% in Q2 2022. We expect Q3 same store sales trends in our delivery business to be challenged similar to Q2. However, we expect a slight improvement in trend in Q4 as our updated loyalty program begins to roll out, followed by a considerable improvement in 2024 as a result of transaction growth from our Uber Eats partnership and other initiatives Russell has shared with you. Shifting to unit count. We added 27 net new stores in the U.S. with 30 store openings and three closures, bringing our U.S. system store count to 6,735 stores at the end of the quarter and our four quarter net store growth rate in the U.S. to 1.8%. Domino's unit economics remain strong with continued EBITDA growth for our U.S. franchisees. We are on track to deliver average U.S. franchised store profitability of at least $150,000 in 2023. Moving to international. Same store sales in our international business, excluding currency impact, increased 3.6%. Our international store count increased by 170 net new stores, comprised of 223 store openings and 53 closures. Closures were driven by the closure of the Denmark market, closures in Brazil as our master franchisee there continues to optimize its store base, and some closures in Russia where the master franchisee has indicated an intention to exit the market. Domino's Pizza Enterprises, one of our publicly-traded master franchisees, recently disclosed their intention to close an additional 65 to 70 underperforming stores. This will likely occur during our third quarter. These reductions in underperforming stores will pull down our net store growth rate in the upcoming quarter and for the full year. However, our new store builds in international continued to be robust and we anticipate returning to our full-year run rate of net store growth in 2024, once these store closures are behind us. Our additional 170 net stores brought the current trailing four quarter net store growth rate in international to 6.3%. When combined with our U.S. store growth, the trailing four quarter global's net store growth rate was 4.7%. We now expect our 2023 global retail sales growth to track between the low end and midpoint of our two to three year outlook of 4% to 8%, driven by stronger international same store sales. And we continue to expect our 2023 global unit growth to track to the low end of our 5% to 7% two to three year outlook. Despite strong gross openings, we will be pressured by international store closures this year. Since these closures will be underperforming stores in certain challenged markets, this is not anticipated to materially impact the financial benefit of our new international store openings. Finally, the capital structure update. A debt leverage ratio of 4 times to 6 times is the appropriate leverage for our company and moves within the range depending on the level of interest rates. We have operated with this range of leverage for almost 20 years. In today's interest rate environment, you should expect us to use our free cash flow to make investments to grow the business, create strong shareholder returns through our dividend and share repurchase strategies and retire debt when it's in the best interest of our shareholders for us to do so. As always, we will be opportunistic if credit markets warrant additional borrowing or refinancing. Thank you. We will now open the call to questions.
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.
Brian Bittner: Good morning. Thank you. It seems like you really do have two new tangible catalysts to stimulate incremental demand, with one being the Uber Eats partnership, and two, being the relaunch of your loyalty program in September. You've talked about the size of the prize with the Uber Eats partnership being $1 billion, but how quickly could it be impactful to the business once it's launched? And as it relates to the relaunch of loyalty, have you attempted to size up how powerful of an opportunity this could be, or maybe you can rank order it in importance relative to the Uber Eats partnership for us? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Good morning, Brian. Actually, what I'd say is, I think we've got three catalysts. You talked about the Uber piece, you talked about loyalty. We also talked a lot about carryout on the call. And we've gained $2.5 billion since we leaned in to carryout 2011. We've got another $2 billion just to get our fair share. Our feeling here at Domino's Pizza is if there is a category that sells pizza that we compete in vigorously, we should get our fair share, which is our share of delivery, one out of every three, and so we've got a lot more to go on carry as well. There are a lot of questions within there. So let me unpack a couple and then if I missed anything, you come back. First is the $1 billion number that we're talking about here in the U.S., $1 billion incremental. As you know, we're first starting with Uber. We're really excited to them as exclusive partners for the first 12 months. After that, we've got optionality in the contract that we can choose to take however we'd like. The $1 billion is a signal of our fair share of the entire $5 billion U.S. aggregator pizza delivery business. And so obviously, that's something that would happen when we get on to the broader competitors in the platform, which we intend to do at some point. On the loyalty program -- by the way, you really listened to Ryan's one-part question. I'm totally joking with you. On the loyalty -- from the loyalty standpoint, the way I like to think of it is how do I feel as a customer when most brands redo their loyalty programs. Usually, as a customer, I'm on the short end. A new loyalty program for a company usually means they're trying to drive a little bit more profitability, which means things are taken away from me as a customer. We're doing the exact opposite here. And so the changes we're making in the loyalty program are there to scope the changes and the opportunity in our business. So we talked about carryout being one of the catalysts. One of the things that's going to be true in the new loyalty program is we're going to recognize that a carryout customers' ticket is lower, and so the hurdle for getting points will be lower. Secondarily, we want to engage people at all levels. We expect to have a big influx of new customers coming in today. And our current program, you need 60 points, there'll be points at various levels from a redemption standpoint. So, we think this is a truly new and improved program for our customers and a profitable one for our franchisees.
Brian Bittner: Thanks for working with me on that.
Russell Weiner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your question, please.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks. Russell, I just wanted to come back to the conversation around the loyalty program and the changes that are happening in September. Can you elaborate a little bit? Are we moving from a transaction-based to a spend-based model? Or how is this going to be configured, I guess, come September? Just trying to understand if there'll be -- if you do change from transaction-based to spend-based, do you anticipate any sort of additional pressure on order counts? Or just trying to understand the structure here on the new loyalty program.
Russell Weiner: Yes, sure. Good morning, Peter. Yes, on the loyalty side, we are big fans in general. We look at -- as I said in the opening remarks, we look at lifetime value. We look at long-term business decisions. And it's clear that, in the long term, order count drives franchisee profitability. And so this will continue to be a transactions-based program. And so, yes, like I said, the big change on the transaction-based is actually we will allow people to transact at a lower level. And we think this is really important in bringing in incremental frequency into the program. Today, you need to get 60 points. In the future, you'll be able to still get a pizza at 60 points, but at lower value with different products, you'll be able to participate, and we think that will be a nice driver of order counts. Ticket, in general, is something that, through our multiple platforms with Mix & Match, customers end up usually doing themselves. And obviously, we've got a robust AB testing system, and so there's a lot of upselling -- appropriate upselling on the website and on the apps.
Peter Saleh: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Sara Senatore: Great. Thank you. FYI, I guess I have another two-part, one-part question. The first is I'm just trying to understand the sort of carryout opportunity. I guess I always thought the distinction between Domino's and independence was perhaps a little bit more evident in delivery, just because of the speed of service and things like the tracker. So, from a carryout perspective, I guess, is it harder to make inroads because perhaps the advantages are less pronounced, or how are you thinking about that? And then, a separate question is just on pricing and the gap versus the industry, and it sort of seems to me that it keeps widening, the industry ahead of you. Is that going to translate into better traffic trends, or is there an opportunity to price? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yes, sure. So, I'll give you a two-part answer. I'm sorry, Sandeep, made me do this 8:30 call this morning. Usually, we do 10:30, so I've had a couple of cups of coffee. So, my apologies. On carryout, the interesting thing that drives the carryout business, and it kind of makes sense when you think about it, is just proximity. And so, the great piece of our fortressing strategy is that we're opening up stores closer to customers. So just like our delivery drivers make more efficient deliveries when they're closer to customers, the same thing is if we put a Domino's Pizza -- you mentioned, for example, competitors being local pizza companies. If we put a Domino's Pizza right in the middle, that's a great thing that those are really, really incremental transactions from us. In fact, the incrementality of carryout when we split the store is even more incremental than delivery from a customer standpoint. So, the second piece is carryout customers, they really want value. And one of the reasons they're doing carryout is they want to avoid the tip, they want to avoid the delivery fee and nobody provides better value than Domino's Pizza. Part of the scale that we're able to get through our purchasing is then passed along to customers, and I think we're very competitive from a carryout standpoint. And then, with pricing, to me, the pricing at Domino's has always been volume-based. We certainly want to have -- on an order-by-order basis, we want to make sure our franchisees are making the profit they need to, and Sandeep talked to the increase in franchisee profitability. But then, once the profit per order is established, we have, what we call, a high-volume mentality. And so, we price for proper profitability on a per order basis that will help drive consumer to buy Domino's more frequently. And so that's kind of how we look at it. I don't expect to be at the high end of pricing. What I expect to do -- and I think if you look at other restaurants in our categories, I expect our franchisees to be at the high end of profitability, while we're offering best-in-class value to customers.
Sara Senatore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your question, please.
Dennis Geiger: Thank you. And thanks for all the details on the sales drivers, definitely helpful. The third-party partnerships, the carryout and loyalty all seem quite impactful. But Russell, wondering if you could just speak to some of the other maybe slightly less-impactful sales drivers, that e-commerce upgrade, the Summer of Service, some of the tech and the menu innovation that you spoke to and seemingly will be a bigger part of the business going forward. Just curious if you could sort of help frame up how impactful you think about some of those other drivers are. Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Yes. No, sure. I appreciate you, because a lot of times, the headlines are what grabs folks. But actually, it's the subtext that actually drives the headlines, if you think about it. And so, maybe not talking about those three drivers, but talking about the things behind it, some of which we've mentioned already. But really, what we've done is, in addition to the significant carryout growth that you've seen this year, is we've improved the underlying fundamentals of the business. And those fundamentals are going to help us really get the most out of those other drivers that you've talked about. So, improved profitability for our franchisees and for us, frankly; Sandeep talked about our operating income margins. Summer of Service is leading to improved service. So, Dennis, the service this quarter versus quarter last year, we're 1.9 minutes -- almost 2 minutes better than just a year ago and actually better than even last quarter. And so, the discussions, the best practices, just the fact that we're leaning into service with our franchisees is making it immediate different. We -- so we've got this morning bunch of franchisees here for Summer of Service, so I can tell you firsthand how excited people are to be here. We've already had the equivalent of essentially 50% our stores represented through this building already in Summer of Service. So again, improved profitability, improved service, and then, obviously, the new loyalty program that we discussed. From an innovation standpoint, what I would tell you is our approach to innovation is purposeful innovation. And when I say purposeful innovation, it's -- we don't sit and say, "All right, we need this many new products. We need this many technologies. It's, what's the global purpose that we're trying to achieve for this brand over time," right? And so, we look at, obviously, product being important, and we've got two product launches this year, which is significant for us, at least that we've mentioned so far. But we also -- we believe innovation is more than just new products. In fact, if all you're doing is new products, in a way, you're kind of degrading your base product and you're hurting your service. And so, what we'd like to do is also lean into other things. And so, Pinpoint Delivery is a great example that we just launched right now. It's a technology innovation. We call those types of innovation tech-quity drivers, it drives our technology equity. But what it does too is it shows our consumers from an innovation standpoint, how incredibly obsessed we are with delivery. And whenever we do that, whether it's, in this case, with Pinpoint, we built our own vehicle. If you remember years ago with the DXP, we have the electric vehicle launch earlier this year. When we show our customers that we are obsessed with the delivery process or even the ordering process, there are 20 different ways to order on those pizza, they realize and recognize that means we're obsessed with every piece. And what that does is it drives long-term brand love. And that's why we are and we have to be delivering these aggregator orders, right? We are obsessed with delivery. We do have Pinpoint Delivery. We do have fleets of vehicles out there. And we do it because we think there's a competitive advantage to owning the entire customer experience. And so that is why we're really leaning in and making sure we were the delivery that us as the delivery experts, we're delivering the pizzas that we're getting through this platform were really important. So, you had a one-part question. I gave you a four-part answer to your one-part question. But as you can tell, we're really excited about delivery here at Domino's Pizza.
Dennis Geiger: That's great. Thanks, Russell.
Russell Weiner: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. Your question, please.
Gregory Francfort: Hey, thanks for the question. Russell, my question is just around the data in terms of the new agreement with Uber and what you're going to get. I think you put in the release a comment about getting sufficient data. What did you go into the negotiations wanting to have that relationship look like? And kind of what did you end up -- what's going to be the go-forward arrangement? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yes. Sure, Greg. On the data standpoint, it was really important for us to get the data that we need to have in order to analyze the incrementality of the platform. And so, we are getting that. We appreciate that in the partnership. The other thing and it probably hits you over the head, of course, but we are delivering the pizzas. And if we deliver the pizza, that means we need every piece of information in order to deliver that pizza, which is the customer's name and address and contact information. And so maybe those two things, the ability to analyze the incrementality and the fact that we're delivering the product, hopefully gives you a sense of what kind of data we'll be getting here.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Your question, please.
Andrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks -- excuse me, thanks for taking the questions. I guess this is a question really about value, but also about food costs. And I'm curious if you expect to continue realizing food deflation going forward? And I guess where I'm coming from is if the broader environment for delivery is pressured by price sensitivity or something like that, I mean, do you see an opportunity to maybe leverage deflation to alleviate some of those consumer pressures, or how do you think about that? Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Hey, Andrew, it's Sandeep. So, I think really important points that you bring up. I think from a value and food cost standpoint, as you know, we've actually had pretty significant volatility on the food basket over the last, call it, seven quarters. So, I think when you look at '23 specifically, the food basket is basically up on a year-to-date basis about 1%. Last quarter was a deflationary quarter with the minus 2.4%. And obviously, when you look at the guidance that we provided of 3% to 5%, if the current level of food basket deflation that happened in Q2 continues, it's mostly driven by cheese by the way, we should continue to see material upside on the food basket as we go through the balance of the year. This makes a huge difference to profitability of our franchisees. And I think that helps repair some of the pressure that they took last year in their profitability. So, from a price opportunity standpoint, I think what we've been very clear about from the get-go is value, value to the consumer. So, if there is a way to actually pass value to the consumer through all of our different promotional platforms, we always look to actually maximize that opportunity. And that will be -- continually be the way we actually approach this as well. It's too early to actually talk about where we're going to take this. But the framework through which we'll analyze it is exactly the same as what we've always had on pricing.
Russell Weiner: Yes. And I would just add to Sandeep's answer. Now that we're in -- we're going to be in this incremental channel of aggregators, I think it's important to really understand that we have a new unlock for value. So, the best value, the best prices, the best offers will be at dominos.com or our apps. The only way to get our great new loyalty program will be our apps or dominos.com. The only way to get Pinpoint Delivery. That's going to be our value channel. But essentially what the aggregator platform opens up for us -- maybe let me give you my point of view on it. I don't think we need to get every customer on that platform. I think we need to get the right customers. So like I said, the value customers, we want them to come to dominos.com. But this will be a premium price channel for us, and specifically the higher income customers that they've got are the ones that we're going to be targeting here. And so, I think if anything, this gives us more levers to unlock value for customers, but also value from our franchisees as far as kind of a higher income, higher price marketplace.
Andrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Carril from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please.
Chris Carril: Thanks. Good morning. So, on development, thanks for all the context around international, but I did want to follow up on the U.S. outlook. So, can you expand on just the pacing of U.S. development that you're expecting here for the balance of the year? And then, beyond this year, how soon do you think that improving profitability and all the top-line drivers that you already spoke of can actually translate into more meaningful acceleration in U.S. store growth? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Great question, Chris. I'll take that one. I think internationally -- I know your question was on the U.S., I'll get to that in two seconds. But when you think about it on a global basis, every eight hours somewhere around the world, we're opening up a Domino's Pizza. And I just think the magnitude of that is something that our team takes a lot of pride on. As Sandeep said, we certainly expect the store growth to inflect towards the end of the year and especially into 2024. And let me give you some kind of perspective why, and what I ask is just put yourself in the seat of our franchisees or as an investor and say -- and now I'm specifically talking about the U.S. per your question. It's okay, if I'm going to open up a store, if I'm going to spend my money on a store, what do I want to ensure? I want to ensure profitability, right? And Sandeep said, we expect to be at least at $150,000 this year for our franchisees, which is up $11,000 versus last year. So, you want to see growing profits. The other thing you want to do is you want to look at the track record. And so let me tell you a little bit about the track record of Domino's Pizza. And when I say track record, look, there are always going to be hiccups, right? But the one thing that I think is really special is if you look at our domestic business over the last 12 months, we've only closed 16 stores. And so, 16 stores, that's 0.2% of our base. I think the QSR average is about 1.5% to 2%. And so, we closed only 16 stores. Actually, the last time we closed more than 20 stores was in 2016. And so that, to me, is the reason to believe why we're going to take a system that's already opening up more stores than its competitors, and really lean in more because the profitability is better and the track record is fantastic.
Sandeep Reddy: I just wanted to add one thing to this, Chris, which I think is super important, because when we talked about the development outlook last quarter, we talked about is beginning to inflect in Q4, and then actually be very strong in 2024, this was before thinking about the Uber partnership. And I think when you think about the Uber partnership, this is a tremendous value to the franchisees. And the reason I say that is if you think about what Russell just talked about, all of our national promotions and all the special deals that we have will only be on our platform, which means that what is actually being sold on the aggregated platforms will be essentially menu price, which actually drives great profitability for the franchisees and great flow-through to them. And those are all incremental transactions as we talked about going into '24. So, the increase in profitability for the franchisees is going to be very material on top of what we already talked about in last call. And this, if anything, further accelerates the momentum in unit development in the U.S. going into '24.
Chris Carril: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.
Brian Harbour: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. So, just on the aggregator partnership, could you remind us again, it sounded like the $1 billion number you've cited was over multiple years. And as you perhaps, at other partners, have you thought about any sort of incrementality internationally? And then related to that, you talked about kind of fighting for your fair share on those platforms. How else will you kind of do that besides just appearing? Do you intend to market that heavily? Do you intend to emphasize kind of service times relative to some of your peers? What are the other ways in which you actually compete against most of your peers who, of course, are already on those platforms?
Russell Weiner: Yes, Brian. On the international piece, we already got $1 billion business there. And so, we're expecting the same type of incrementality as we take this from -- to those 13 incremental Uber Eats markets. And I just want to remind everyone on the call that between the U.S. and international, we'll be on 28 markets that we are overlapping with Uber Eats, and that means that -- because of where these stores are located, the markets and where the stores are located, 70% of our stores will be getting this incremental volume that we talked about. The $1 billion number is a net number, just to be clear. I think you did a great job answering some of the questions about how we're going to distinguish ourselves on the platform here in the U.S. One of the key pieces is service. We will have the best service experience, we believe, in the pizza or restaurant industry. The only thing we care about is getting the pizza to your house warm and hot and delicious. The important thing, and this is actually part of my opening remarks to our franchisees in Summer of Service, we're the only ones who from the time you order make your product, and the only person who touches it next is you, as the customer. We make it and we deliver it. And we just think that's really, really special. Second, it's a premium price, but Domino's has good prices. Even our menu prices, we've got a significant number of things that are going on in menu prices. So, I fully expect us to be of value there. And yes, you're right, on service times, I expect not only the service to be at the high end, and when I say high end, the good end of that. But when you get the product, that experience is going to be great because it will never have left Domino's hand. Finally, we will be spending marketing money, but it's important to understand two things. One is, the only place we'll be spending our marketing money is on the platform. We won't be spending our money to drive consumers to the platform. But once they're on the platform, we, of course, want to drive them to Domino's, and we've negotiated a return on advertising spend. That's in line with how we buy the rest of our digital media. And so, we think it's going to be a profitable one. But we know how to buy digital media on any platform. So I'm excited to see what we can do there.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your question, please.
David Palmer: Thanks. In the prepared remarks, you talked about how Domino's was on its way to restoring growth in U.S. delivery. It's great to just hear a mention of that. And is your thinking that the Uber Eats deal will get you to U.S. delivery same store sales growth? Or are there other major factors you're contemplating when you're targeting that? And I ask that because the lower check minimum for loyalty sounds like it would be helpful to carryout transaction, but it's unclear what that would mean for delivery, if anything. And then, maybe for Sandeep, did you contemplate this move to aggregators over a multiyear period when you lowered the multiyear growth targets earlier? Thanks so much.
Russell Weiner: Yes, David. The loyalty program is really not just focused on carryout. I mentioned the carryout piece because that's really the front end on ticket. We expect, obviously, through this deal as well, to get a lot of customers really interested in Domino's Pizza. And so, we want to have interactions for delivery customers at the low end, and that's one of the incremental things that we're driving here.
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. And Dave, just to add on to your second question, which is, was the aggregated deal contemplated when we lowered the two- to three-year outlook that we provided February? No, it was not. At that time, we had not gotten to the point where we thought we were going to actually do it. And so, I think this is -- that's just the context we should have.
David Palmer: Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your question, please.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. I wanted to talk about delivery in general, but maybe specifically, what you've learned or have taught or have picked up as part of Summer of Service in terms of how that could change some of the mechanics of the way that delivery is working to make you more efficient. Certainly, it's good to hear about an improvement of two minutes in service times, it's better than the one minute we were talking about before. But how big of an opportunity is that to significantly improve the service times? And if you can make some comments about your access of attracting and retaining delivery drivers, is that a headwind or tailwind at this point as you see it? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Hey, John, thanks for the question. Yes, on the -- I'll start with the attraction of delivery drivers. We actually have more applications coming in now for delivery drivers than we did back in 2019. And so, we're excited about that. And some of that is what's translating to the improved services. We've got more drivers, and I haven't really spent a lot of time talking about our electric fleet vehicles, and we've got about 1,000 of them coming on. And actually, we have over 1,000 non-electric fleet vehicles. And what that's done is it's really opened up -- not every store really needs them, but the ones that are having trouble getting delivery drivers, there are plenty of people with driver's licenses that don't have access to vehicles that want to drive for Domino's Pizza, and we're really seeing that make a difference. And so that's part of why you're seeing the current increase in momentum. And the desire with Summer of Service is to continue to drive that, in a few ways, right? One of it is just bringing it top of mind, every franchisee in the U.S. is coming to Ann Arbor to do this, and so driving the importance in top of mind, driving the accountability what it is that we expect from the delivery experience. And then lastly, driving some best practices. And these are best practices that already exist in the system, but new ones. And so, I'm really looking forward to sharing some of the things that we're sharing with our franchisees now in Summer of Service during Investor Day. And what you'll see is the circle of operations for a Domino's Pizza today is very different than it was even just a couple of years ago. And those changes are really impacting service. And then, there's the technology aspect of it. And so, we've got systems -- new systems that are going to be running in our store as part of our next-generation store system to really upgrade the level of service because we're helping our franchisees and our team members more. And so these systems are running in many of our stores today. So for example, our -- many of our stores are making pizzas before customers actually complete their orders online. And some of them are dispatching orders to drivers before those orders -- those drivers are even back in the stores. And so if you're making pizzas before people finish ordering them and you're dispatching them in a way that doesn't require your driver to come back into the store and find a parking spot, that's going to help. And so, Summer of Service is about best practices, but it's about introducing these kind of AI-enabled suite of services to help our franchisees and team members do their job more efficiently.
John Ivankoe: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Mullan from Piper Sandler. Your question, please.
Brian Mullan: Hey, thanks. Just a question on international business, specifically on China. Just wondering if you could comment on how the business is doing today, give us a sense of how things feel in regards to the macro and the consumer over there right now for the balance of this year. Understanding the long-term opportunity is quite big, just hoping to get your current take on the state of operations in the market and maybe the development outlook over the near term. Thank you.
Sandeep Reddy: Hi, Brian, thanks for the question. Look, we're really excited about the China market. I think we're doing extremely well. I think now that we've actually come out of the COVID years, we've actually seen a very strong growth in productivity over there. Great development actually happening and huge potential for runway in terms of future development. And it is going to be one of the biggest growth opportunities in the international portfolio. We are super excited about it.
Russell Weiner: I would say China is one of the -- when we talk about our top 15 international markets and the fact that there are 10,000-plus stores still to build in those markets, obviously, China plays a big role there.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Long from Stephens. Your question, please.
Joshua Long: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I was curious if you could give us some insight into how you're thinking about marketing and messaging as you build out your platform of seemly disparate consumers. So, we've talked about in the past how the delivery consumer is very different than the carryout consumer, and now thinking about the third-party opportunity. Just you're sitting on a wealth of transaction data. What kind of -- maybe where are we in terms of the opportunity to dig into that and really utilize it? What kind of changes or investments might be needed? Just any sort of high-level thoughts you could share there around just really bringing this whole picture together from a marketing and communications perspective?
Russell Weiner: Yes, sure, Josh. I think what's really important to understand is there is a common marketing message really throughout which is -- I'm not going to go in detail, I think it's a little bit of our special sauce. But suffice it to say, what a customer is looking for is a great overall pizza experience, no matter what channel they're ordering through. And that drives the consistency and the strong brand messaging we've had for the last 10, 15 years. What I think -- and actually, we're in a great place in the world now because there are so many different mediums out there. And so there's the marketing message, but also then there's the media buy. And what we can do with the media buy is being very, very targeted. And so, yes, that carryout customer that wants control and value, we can reach out to them that way. If a delivery customer that's looking for maybe quick delivery times and a big bundle for a birthday party or whatever, we can do that as well. And so, I think Domino's as a brand is -- will have a singular meaning to customers. But what we'll do is we're going to leverage media and really what I think is a best-in-class marketing -- or highest-in-class marketing budget in order to more personalize the message. And that probably gets me to the last part of your question, which is what am I excited about that we're going to -- that we're doing today, but we're going to lean into a little bit more, and that is just personalization. As you said, we've got millions of users on the database and we're personalizing our message today. But the tools are just getting better, and that's where our investment is going and we're going to be at the forefront of that.
Joshua Long: Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. I'm trying to fuse a two-part question on Uber into one-part, so please bear with me here. But first, just given the reduction in ad fund earlier this month, will Uber Eats be funding advertising the platform in 2024? And then, secondly, I appreciate that you're structuring the partnership with franchisee profitability at the center. And so, what I'm curious about is qualitatively, not quantitatively, will the commission borne by franchisees be a fixed fee for these orders or a percent of the order volume?
Russell Weiner: Well, let me first answer the -- and I appreciate that. That's pretty good, the one-part question. I'm going to have to -- I'm not as good as you, so I'm going to have to give you a two-part answer. On the Uber piece of it, the -- first, on the marketing funds. The marketing funds that we talked about earlier that are being used right now to cover some of the tech investments we're trying to do, that are marketing related by the way, came out of a surplus of that budget. And so that money was never could have been, should have been spent this year or even next year. And so we have plenty of money to continue to do what we do every year, which is increase the amount of GRPs and -- out there to our customers despite inflationary environment. So that hasn't held us back at all. I'll let Uber comment on what kind of funding they plan to do. I think I talked to you a little bit about how our funding or marketing message is going to be driving within the platform. Sandeep, you want to talk a little bit about the commission structure?
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. And I think it's a really good question, and there's quite a few things that are in there. And so, I'm going to actually kind of unpack them a little bit for you. So, I'll start with the tech fee itself. Well, the tech fees based on order counts. So every incremental order that actually comes through the platform, a tech fee will apply, same with any other order. So I think that's one. And I think the rest of it is what will royalties be payable on basically in terms of what we report. It's really the food sales as well as the delivery fee. So, our calculation of same store sales and retail sales will include those. And if there are any service fees or service charges that Uber actually charges, those really won't to appear in our numbers, those will be directly from Uber. So hopefully that helps you kind of understand the structure of how this is going to work.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Sanderson from Northcoast Research. Your question, please.
Jim Sanderson: Hey, thanks for the question. Just wanted to follow up to the discussion on Uber and marketing programs. I'm wondering if you plan to participate in some of the free delivery charges or free promotions that we see often on third-party aggregators? And if there's any concern that, early on, you might see some cannibalization of your own delivery business? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yes. Our delivery fee and franchisee level delivery fees, they're all contemplated in our pricing structure. And so, no, I don't think that's going to be affecting our profitability at all. And as we're on the platform, anything they want to do with their customers to drive them to buy Domino's Pizza, that's really upside for us.
Jim Sanderson: That would be at their expense?
Russell Weiner: Yes. I want to be clear that the ways we're spending our money is specifically on things that we can measure with something called return on advertising spend, and so that would be how we drive a customer on Google or any other kind of social media or digital media.
Sandeep Reddy: And just...
Jim Sanderson: Okay. Thank you. Yes.
Sandeep Reddy: Just to clarify one thing, I just want to make sure we touch on it. But any promotional activity on the platform would have to be agreed with us. And I think we'll do that in partnership with them. So, I think that we'll be thinking through the holistic lens of those promotions.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your question, please.
Danilo Gargiulo: Good morning. Russell, you started the call saying staffing levels are going to be important, and you're making improvement in staffing. So, I wonder if you could comment on the level of staffing at -- in the Domino's stores, and whether you see any staffing challenges to the service -- to service the incremental demand from aggregators if kind of the opportunity come to fruition as you were expecting.
Russell Weiner: Yes, a great question, and I'm going to -- we'll give you a tongue-in-cheek answer to this one is I very much hope and expect that we do not currently have the number of delivery drivers we will need for this incremental volume. But I also know, and I'm confident, based on what we've learned through what's been a struggling time to hire drivers, that we know what it takes now, whether it's the certain hiring practices, if you look at our new training, if you look at actually our corporate stores and just the turnover numbers going down, as well as the incremental fleet we're talking about. So yes -- do I expect to need incremental drivers? Yes. And yes, I expect to be able to get them.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. And our final question for today comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your question, please.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. I guess, putting some closure around the Uber discussion. I know for a long, long time you guys had deemed that a partnership was presumably not in the best interest of the company and franchisees. So, something, I guess, very recently maybe tipped the scales to push you to sign up now. I'm just wondering if you could talk about what kind of puts you over the edge, and I assume there is still some lingering headwinds that you're still conscious of and watching closely that perhaps where some of the headwinds you were anticipating before. And if you could just share maybe what will be the consideration set at the end of 2024 to decide who you partner with going forward, whether it's still just Uber or whether you add somebody else, like what would drive that decision? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Sure. Thanks, Jeff. Really for us, it came down to three elements: scale, scope and incrementality. The scale of the aggregator QSR pizza delivery business is big now. It's a $5 billion category. We're the number one pizza delivery company in the country and we don't sell a single order on it. And so if there's a $5 billion opportunity, that kind of scale, you can expect us to compete for our fair share. The second is scope, the scope of the deal and the terms of the deal is -- are really favorable for us and our international and domestic franchisees. And I said earlier, how now 70% of the stores will have access to potentially orders from Uber. And the last piece is just the incrementality. We are -- it's clear from the work we've done internationally and the studies we've done here in the states that we know how to manage this as a separate channel and drive incremental volume. And those things weren't always there in the past. As frankly, just to be perfectly honest, we are a delivery company and we needed to be able to deliver our own orders before we took on incremental, and we are absolutely doing that right now as you can see with the increased or the improvement in service time, and we're ready for that next wave of orders.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Russell Weiner for any further remarks.
Russell Weiner: Well, thank you so much, everybody, for joining the call this morning. Sandeep, Ryan and I, we really look forward to speaking with you again in October to discuss our Q3 2023 results. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 12:15:00) =====
Operator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Domino's Pizza's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Mr. Ryan Goers, Vice President, Finance, Investor Relations. Go ahead, sir.
Ryan Goers: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our conversation regarding the results for the first quarter of 2023. Today's call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner; and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. Our request to our coverage analyst, we want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such, we encourage you to ask only one, one part question on this call. Today's call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner.
Russell Weiner: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us on today's call. I'd like to start this call where we finished our last one, looking back on what we said we were going to do. I am really proud of the actions that our team and our franchisees have taken and the positive results that they delivered. You'll recall that there were three themes we discussed last quarter, the first one was the continued evolution of the Domino's brand from a U.S. delivery business to a global pizza company with leadership in both delivery and carryout. And we continued this progress since our last call. Let me start off with China. We're proud to welcome our partners DPC Dash, our master franchisee there to the growing list of public companies that are developing and operating Domino's Pizza stores across the globe. On March 28, CEO, Aileen Wang and her team completed their IPO on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We have got tremendous potential in China where the Dash team believes they've just scrapped the surface of their total opportunity with stores operating in only 17 cities in China. Now speaking of public companies, as of the end of Q1 2023, six of the top 20 public QSRs in the world as measured by market cap, are part of the Domino's family. DPZ is joined by our master franchisees, Jubilant Foodworks, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, ALSEA, Domino's Pizza Group and Alamar, all in the top 20. This to me exemplifies an important strength of our brand. We've got a diverse portfolio of more than 90 markets around the world. So our international business has both scale and balance. And what this affords us is the ability to weather any short-term headwinds in certain markets should they come up. We've seen this dynamic play out in Q1 with markets performing exceptionally well, balancing out others that are facing more pressures. All of this, though, resulted in positive international same-store sales growth for the first quarter. Now on to the U.S. In the U.S., we believe that the QSR pizza delivery and carryout businesses continue to be incremental to each other with limited overlap. We're number one in both segments and believe we've strengthened our position during the first quarter. The balance we have in our stores would carry out contributing around half the orders and 40% of sales has allowed us to mitigate the more recent macro headwind in the delivery category. The second theme we discussed on our last call was the need to maintain value in what is a competitive marketplace where our customers decide every day where to spend their hard-earned dollars. Value has to do with the right balance of price and service. Our U.S. business delivered on both of these things in Q1, and I'll start with pricing. On pricing, I mentioned that we and our franchisees have got to be mindful that value on our menu exists outside of our national offers. Menu prices and delivery fees were relatively stable throughout Q1 that means most of the menu pricing increase we saw in the first quarter versus prior year was carryover from changes that were made in 2022. On service and capacity, our stores and our franchisees continue to make progress on both fronts. Estimated average delivery times in the first quarter were over a minute better than the first quarter of 2022. While our goal is to get back to and improve on our delivery service levels from 2019, I'm really encouraged by the continued improvement we and our franchisees have made in this critical measure. Our system understands that to be the best, you need to beat the best, even when the best may be yourself. And that's why we're launching an important initiative. We're calling it our summer of service training program. We're inviting all of our U.S. franchisees to come to Ann Arbor to be part of one of the largest system training efforts in our history. Look, we've driven significant improvements in our back-of-house technology and our circle of operations over the last few years and we've got more coming. The summer of service program will allow us to share best practices with our franchisees, who we expect will leave Ann Arbor with specific plans that they create to positively impact service for every one of their stores. I think these changes will also improve the experience for our customers and our team members in our corporate and franchise stores. Our third theme from the last call was around the need to drive more innovation. While new products are certainly one way to do that, our brand has a history of bringing news to all aspects of the business. We dialed up innovation over the last few months and anticipate this will continue throughout the year and into the future. Let's start with product innovation. On the product side, we're really pleased with the launch of our Loaded Tots. For consumers, Loaded Tots offer a craveable potato side that delivers extraordinarily well. They also fit nicely into our Mix & Match menu, providing great value and even more variety when consumers build their orders. For franchisees, tots drive healthy ticket, given they've been largely incremental and have a strong margin profile. Early signs point to Loaded Tots performing even better than our last two product launches Dips & Twists and the Chicken Taco and Cheeseburger specialty pizza. To drive news and ordering convenience in our carryout business, we launched a convenient way for consumers to place their orders while they're on the go with Apple CarPlay. This innovation allows customers to place and track their orders on CarPlay via our iOS app. CarPlay ordering is a great alternative to drive-through, because it allows customers to avoid long lines by placing their orders while they're on the go, so their food is hot and fresh and ready when they arrive at their local Domino's. As important as the ordering platform is itself, CarPlay ordering will help drive what we call our techquity, short for technology equity. We've got a history of leveraging technology to improve customer experiences and Domino's CarPlay ordering continues that tradition. On the delivery innovation side, Domino's fleet of electric vehicles has been expanding. We announced on our last call that the initial order by our corporate stores and franchisees made us the largest electric fleet of pizza delivery vehicles in the country with 800 cars. Today, Domino's has committed to over 1,000 EVs and counting. The EV fleet is great for our stores and the environment, all while growing the potential pool of drivers by offering opportunities to individuals that may not have access to a car. All of this news contributed to positive U.S. same-store sales growth in Q1 and will provide momentum for Domino's into the future. Now for more detail on the quarter, I’d like to turn it over to our CFO, Sandeep Reddy. Sandeep?
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, Russell, and good morning to everyone on the call. I’ll begin my remarks with updates on the actions I’ve previously outlined to improve our long-term profitability. First, on pricing architecture. During the first quarter, the average year-over-year price increase that was realized across our U.S. system was 6.2%. This included the year-over-year benefit of national pricing changes made in 2022. As a reminder, delivery mix and match was updated to $6.99 in March of last year, with carryout mix and match updated in October. As we have lapped the delivery mix and match national pricing update in March, we expect our second quarter realized year-over-year pricing impact to moderate. Second, efficiencies in our cost structure as we continue to drive recovery in margin. We saw year-over-year improvement in our operating income margin, which grew by 100 basis points versus Q1 2022. This was despite foreign exchange rates having a negative year-over-year impact on operating income margin of approximately 40 basis points during the quarter. Third, we had positive same-store sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact in both our U.S. and international businesses for the second consecutive quarter, which also contributed to improving our operating income leverage. Now for our financial results for the quarter in more detail. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 5.9% due to positive sales comps and global net store growth over the trailing four quarters, lapping 3.6% global retail sales growth, excluding FX for Q1 2022. Breaking down global retail sales growth, U.S. retail sales increased 5.1%, rolling over a prior decrease of 1.4%. International retail sales, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, grew 6.5%, rolling over the prior year increase of 8.4%. Turning to comps. During Q1, same-store sales for the U.S. business increased 3.6%, rolling over a prior decrease of 3.6%. The increase in U.S. same-store sales in Q1 was driven by an increase in ticket, which included the 6.2% in pricing actions I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a decline in order counts. The Q1 comps were aided by the Omicron overlap from 2022 as well as the benefit from a boost week in 2023 that we did not run in Q1 last year. Neither of these tailwinds will aid us for the balance of the year as Omicron were seeded as a headwind, and we ran boost weeks in every quarter last year, starting in Q2. Now, I’ll share a few thoughts specifically about the U.S. carryout and delivery businesses. The carryout business was strong in Q1 with U.S. carryout same-store sales 13.4% positive compared to Q1 2022, rolling over a prior year increase of 11.3%. We are very pleased at the strength of our carryout business. But we do expect a moderation in growth rates for the balance of the year as we lap accelerating growth in 2022. The delivery business remains more pressured. Q1 delivery same-store sales declined by 2.1% relative to Q1 2022, rolling over a prior decline of 10.7%. The delivery business is still challenged by two factors that we discussed in our last call. First, a migration of demand from the delivery channel to the sit-down channel as the reversion to pre-pandemic consumer behavior continues. Second, constrained budgets for households with relatively lower disposable income, particularly when factoring fees and tips prompting them to shift their delivery occasion to cooking at home. We are closely monitoring the evolution of growth in real personal consumption expenditures as a consistent inflection in that trend could result in relief on the second headwind to our delivery business. Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 22 net new stores to the U.S. during Q1. Consisting of 25 store openings and three closures, bringing our U.S. system store count to 6,708 stores at the end of the quarter, which brought our four-quarter net store growth rate in the U.S. to 1.7%. As mentioned on our last call, we expected the U.S. store development pipeline will continue to be pressured by permitting and store construction and supply chain challenges before seeing a gradual recovery starting in the second half of the year, marked by stabilization first before an inflection in trend. Domino’s unit economics remain strong relative to the many pressures faced throughout the year, including staffing challenges and a high inflationary environment for food and labor. We have completed our analysis of estimated average U.S. franchisee store profitability with the final amount coming in at $139,000 for 2022, up from the $137,000 estimate provided on our last call. As previously mentioned, estimated average store profitability was higher in Q4 2022 than Q4 2019, as franchisees are seeing the flow-through benefits of the mix and match national pricing increases for both delivery and carryout. We expect this improvement in profitability to continue in 2023 and with the margin flow-through from Loaded Tots being an additional tailwind during the first quarter. We will need further time to evaluate if Loaded Tots will provide an incremental margin dollar lift over the course of the year. Also, as we have completed our analysis on 2022 build costs for stores, relative to our average build cost in 2019, we saw an approximate build cost increase of 20% in 2022. Even with these increased build costs, franchisees are looking at roughly three-year paybacks on new store openings for 2023 and beyond. Before we transition to discussing our international business, I would like to briefly touch on our technology costs. To fund additional investments in technology innovation, including a redesign of our e-commerce platform, the technology transaction fee charged to U.S. franchisees will be increased to $0.395 from $0.315 effective the beginning of the second quarter. The technology transaction fee increase covers investments split roughly evenly between G&A and capital expenditures. These investments are included in the annual guidance measures of $425 million to $435 million in G&A spend and $90 million to $100 million capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023. At the same time, a 25 basis point temporary reduction on contributions to the national advertising fund will go into effect. The net impact of these two changes on the increase in technology fee and the 25 basis point reduction of franchisee advertising contributions should be relatively neutral to the estimated average U.S. franchisee store profitability in 2023. Turning to our international business. Same-store sales, excluding foreign currency impact for our international business increased 1.2%, rolling over the prior increase of 1.2%. We continue to face the headwind of the negative year-over-year impact of the expiration of the 2021 VAT relief in the UK, our largest international market by retail sales. This was the last full quarter of the negative year-over-year impact with the UK VAT relief program being in place through March 31, 2022. Our international business added 106 net new stores in Q1, comprised of 143 store openings and 37 closures. Our closures were driven by another round of closures in Brazil as our master franchisee there continues its work to optimize the store base in that market as well as some closures in Russia. International store openings in the first quarter were also impacted by the timing of fiscal periods of some of our master franchisees that caused a significant number of openings to shift into the first week of our second quarter. These additional 106 net stores brought our current trailing four quarter net store growth rate in international to 6.7%. When combined with our U.S. store growth, our trailing four quarter global net store growth rate was 5%. Turning to EPS. Our diluted EPS in Q1 was $2.93 versus $2.50 in Q1 2022. Breaking down that $0.43 increase in our diluted EPS, our operating results benefited us by $0.36. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.09. A lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.04. Lower net interest expense benefited us by $0.06 and a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.06. We continue to generate sizable free cash flow. During the first quarter, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $115 million. After deducting for capital expenditures of approximately $19 million, which consisted of investments in our technology initiatives and supply chain centers, we generated free cash flow of approximately $96 million. Free cash flow increased $29 million from the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to the positive impact of changes in working capital and higher net income. During the quarter, we returned over $30 million to shareholders through share repurchases. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $380 million remaining under our Board authorization for share repurchases. In the first quarter, the allocation methodology for certain costs, which support internally developed software was updated on a prospective basis. The change in allocation methodology resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. store segment income of $10 million and an estimated increase in international franchise segment income of $2 million, fully offset by a decrease of other segment income of $12 million. Finally, I would like to provide an update on a few of our annual guidance measures that we previously communicated. We expect a year-over-year market basket increase of 3% to 5% in 2023. Changes in foreign currency rates could have a $2 million to $6 million negative impact on international royalty revenues in 2023. And our tax rate, excluding the impact of equity-based compensation, is expected to range from 22% to 24% in 2023. Based on current trends, we expect each of these measures will come in towards the low end of their respective ranges. Additionally, we continue to expect our global retail sales growth and global unit growth in 2023 to trend to the low end of our unchanged two year to three year outlook. Thank you all for joining the call today. And now I’ll turn the call back to Russell.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Sandeep. Before we close out the call, I want to touch on a couple of areas that are important as we move forward in 2023. The first one is store growth. As Sandeep mentioned in his comments, we expect that the U.S. store development pipeline will continue to be pressured by permitting and store construction supply chain challenges before seeing a gradual recovery beginning in the second half of the year. In my conversations with franchisees and discussions with our team on new commitments to store growth by our system, I’m confident that we will see an inflection in trend towards the end of the year and into 2024. Domino’s franchisees came out of a challenging 2022 with estimated store EBITDA of almost $140,000. This proves to me and more importantly to them, that building a Domino’s store remains one of the best investments in the restaurant industry. The second point I want to highlight is innovation, giving you a little bit of insight into our e-commerce pipeline. It’s not a comprehensive list, but it should help you understand that we’re bringing news to our customers while also improving our ability to drive loyalty and a more personalized experience, leveraging our robust customer database. As I mentioned on our last call, we’ll be refreshing and improving our Piece of the Pie loyalty program. When we launched it back in 2015, we were more of a delivery company with our carryout business still gaining momentum. So naturally, our loyalty program was designed more around the delivery customer. One of the key objectives of the refreshed Piece of the Pie program will be to explicitly cater to the carryout customer in addition to the delivery customer. We’re excited to add more value and rewards for everybody. We’ve also started to work on a redesign and rewrite of our entire e-commerce platform. This work will continue into 2024, and we will update you on progress along the way. Our digital ordering clients and tech stack have been a huge part of our strategy and a competitive advantage for us over time. So, we need to invest in these forms to ensure we remain in a leadership position. In closing, when I look back on the first quarter, I can’t help but be encouraged by the resilience of our business model and the competitive advantage that our franchisees and team members bring to Domino’s Pizza. I remain bullish on our future and look forward to telling you more of our story and our long-term strategy at our Investor Day, which will be held in late Q4. With that, we’ll open the call to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your question please. 
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. Just first, a clarification question from you, Sandeep. As it relates to your outlook, in 2023 for total retail sales to be at the lower end of the 4% to 8% range. Can you talk to us about what the implied same-store sales outlook embedded in this guidance is? And then, Russell, my main question to you, just as it relates to delivery and the ongoing weakness in this segment, I appreciate the macro pressures that you outlined during this call and previous calls. But – what are – are you currently taking market share? And can you just further elaborate on actions that you are taking inside the company to improve your competitive advantage within delivery to set that business up for a strong turn when these macro pressures recede?
Sandeep Reddy: So, good morning Brian and thank you for the question. I’ll take the first piece, and I think Russell will cover the second piece that you asked – so in terms of the outlook, I think you’re asking about the global retail sales outlook of 4% to 8% a rating that is still expected to be at the low end for 2023. And I think when we go back to what we said last time and again, what we’re saying this time, not really changing the narrative of what we said, drove that adjustment in the first place, which was the challenges that we were seeing in the U.S. delivery business was the primary driver of the lowered estimation of the global retail sales outlook. So we feel very confident more broadly about the business because the carryout business has been great. The international business, as you just heard from Russell did extremely well as well, notwithstanding the UK, VAT impact that we were rolling over. So we feel really good about the overall business. But I think until we come through the delivery challenges, and that's what you asked Russell about, we basically believe that the outlook is appropriate.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Sandeep. Morning, Brian. On the delivery side, it really is – to answer your question really in two parts. First, we grew delivery QSR pizza market share last year. We're continuing to do that in Q1. And so the point that you ask is what can we do in addition to drive that. And it's kind of the same basic things we outlined on the same call. It's driving value, delivery service were a minute better than we were a year ago. Innovation in all areas, not just product, but we have actually delivery innovation out there now with the electric vehicles. We're up to 1,000 vehicles. This new loyalty program is going to do a really good job in driving transactions. And then the majority of our delivery customers were online. And so I think what you're hearing when we're talking about redoing our e-commerce platforms, that's certainly going to help there as well.
Brian Bittner: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your question, please.
Peter Saleh: Great, thanks. Russell, I wanted to ask about the decision to reduce the marketing spend by 25 basis points. I understand it's pretty much an offset to the – raising the digital fees. But can you just give us a sense on how much total impressions would be down this year with that reduction in spend?
Russell Weiner: Sure. I mean the point at the end of the day is we take a holistic look at the franchisees' P&Ls. And we just think that this is a better investment over the course of the next year, because of where we are in our marketing budget. So I don't expect an impression decline, I just think that this is a great overall use of their money for the year.
Sandeep Reddy: And Pete, I'll just add a little bit to that, because I think it's very important to think about this strategically and holistically for both a financial standpoint and kind of what we're looking at. And we were engaged in deep discussions with our franchisees before we actually made this move. And I think over the course of the pandemic, we've actually built up the ad fund reserve to a point where we believe that the resources that are in the ad funds are more than enough to cover the demands that we have from an advertising standpoint this year. And at the same time, as we looked at innovation and the need to invest in technology, our franchisees and us believe that this was the right way to redeploy investment. And so we've done it very clearly with a view to the long-term. And this is, as we said, have been one year adjustment that we made. So we'll take a look at it in one year's time and decide what to do.
Peter Saleh: Great, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Sara Senatore: Okay, thank you. A question and a quick follow-up, you said the boost week won't be continued tailwind. Your outlook on same-store sales in general strikes a note of caution. I was wondering if you can quantify what you think that tailwind was? I'm just trying to understand the underlying run rate might be or what the drivers that Russ highlighted, the magnitude of those might look like as we go forward? And then just quick follow-up on the comment about shifting back to dine-in. Delivery across the industry is a lot higher than it was as a share of sales pre-COVID. So do you have any thoughts on how long this shift might last? I would expect dine-in probably ends up as a lower share of the total mix. But trying to again, understand how long that headwind persists in your view? Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Hi Sara, quite a few questions in there, but I'll take this. I'll take them in a sequence. So I think you're first talking about some of the things that I pointed out to in the prepared remarks on the benefits that we got in the first quarter on the comp from the tailwinds that we had from lapping Omicron and also the fact that we had a boost week in 2023, which we didn't have in 2022. And I'm not going to unpack the details of exactly how much that was, but definitely, those were two tailwinds, and they're actually a third tailwind also if I think about it, because we have now lapped the national pricing update on delivery. And I think we definitely got the benefit of that pricing impact that actually was embedded in ticket as well. So when you think about all these different elements, there is going to be an expectation that there will be some deceleration relative to that, because those were tailwinds that we had uniquely in the first quarter. And that's why we actually pointed those out. And then I think the broader topic of shifting to dine-in, I think our point when we actually did the Q4 call was, we've seen throughout 2022, a shift back into dine-in. And I think – but when we look at the values of where the dine-in had reached, we were still well below 2019 levels for dine-in. And so the expectation that we had when we set up our outlook for the two to three-year time frame is and particularly on 2023, was to continue to see that shift happening over the course of 2023.
Sara Senatore: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your question, please.
Dennis Geiger: Thank you. Russell, you spoke to stepping up the pace of innovation, and you gave some good examples. Just wondering if you could touch a little bit more on what that means? Perhaps how long it takes to kind of get innovation going to where it was a few years back? And anything more you can share in thinking about innovation across menu and technology? And if I could flip a related part in there, is there any update with respect to how you think about third-party aggregator relationships as we think about technology and evolution of the brand? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: Hey Dennis. Good morning. I maybe take the first – the second question first to talk a little bit about third-party. We've got $1 billion business internationally with aggregators. And we're learning there every day. I think the number one thing that we've learned is whoever you work with or whoever you compete with, Domino's is better when we're a stickier brand. When we have more to make consumers when they decide where they're going to order to order from us. And stickiness is getting the value right, it's getting service right. You talked about innovation, so I'll get to that in a second. I think stickiness is also this new loyalty program. The updated loyalty program will make us stickier as well as recognizing that it's time to upgrade our e-commerce site. And so if we're a stickier Domino's Pizza, no matter who we compete with or work with here, we'll be in a place that we can win. Secondly, or firstly, I guess, would be the – what was your first question, a question on innovation. I would really ask that folks take a broad definition of innovation. And that's not to couch and say we're not going to be doing a lot of product innovation and stepping up that and we're not going to be doing carryout or delivery innovation. But let me give you an example of something that people maybe wouldn't think of as innovation which is carryout tips. Carryout tips, the majority of companies, what they call it is a bounce back coupon, and what our marketing people did, did a great job. And they said, you know what, we're incentive of calling it a $3 bounce-back coupon. We're a delivery company. In this case, customers are delivering our pizza, let's call it a tip. They get to $3 to the next week, and it's an incremental purchase. And that's an innovation. So I think you got product innovation with tots. Value innovation, I don't think anyone talks about value innovation, the way we do. Apple CarPlay is a carryout innovation, the cars or EV is delivery innovation. All of those types of innovations are things you should see on a quarterly basis, I expect to be able to update you on these calls. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. Your question, please.
Gregory Francfort: Russell, just can you talk about what you think the competitive differentiation is of the Domino's business today, and if that's changed from four or five years ago, I think aggregators have figured out the profitability a little bit better. But can you maybe help us understand the reasons for why you have kind of competitive differentiation versus those platforms and if that's changed over the last four or five years or not? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Yes. Sure. Good morning and thanks for the question. Actually, I think when we talk about broadness and competitiveness, what I'd like to start out with is carryout. We talk a lot about the fact that there's not a lot of overlap between delivery and carryout historically about 15%. And so if you look back at the last three years on our U.S. carryout business, it's up almost 30% in same-store sales. So to think that that's a very incremental piece of growth for our business, should hopefully help you understand how we think about diversifying and differentiating and growing ourselves as not only a pizza delivery company, but as a total restaurant. And I think – on the delivery piece, again, I’ll point to we are growing pizza delivery market share, but we think we can do more. And a lot of it is because certainly, the competition is different. But I think we’ve learned a lot, Greg, over the last few years. You think of what we learned through COVID. We went through some capacity constraints. We went through driver availability issues. And they say the necessity is the mother of invention. And that’s why we’re doing this summer of service program here. We’re inviting our franchisees up, because we’ve made significant improvements and innovations because of all of this learning, we will now be better in our circle of operations and in our technology, and these are substantial enough that it’s not something that we can train people in a video. Every single Domino’s U.S. franchisee is coming up here to Ann Arbor for this training, and they will leave with individual plans that they’re putting together for their stores when they go back. And at the end of the day in order to really step change ourselves when these macro things go away, it’s going to be stepping up service. And I think, hopefully, this is an example of how we’re leaning in there.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Chris Carril from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.
Chris Carril: Hi thanks and good morning. So on pricing, Sandeep, you noted the lapping of delivery mix and match pricing in March. And with that pricing should moderate here in the 2Q. But appreciating your continued focus on value here. If transactions were to remain stable or potentially improve, how open are you to taking further pricing, particularly if you do see those service levels begin to improve with all the initiatives you have in place? Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Hi Chris, and thanks for the question. I think when we talk about pricing options and value, I think that’s a constant. It’s not this last year. It’s been over the last decade or more that we’ve been doing this. And so we’ll continue to evaluate pricing relative to competition and kind of what the macro environment will actually yield from a demand standpoint, because we always are going to do the work. But I don’t think we’re particularly in trying to say what we’re going to do or not going to do because it’s going to be the outcome of the work.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Brian Harbour from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
Brian Harbour: Yes, thank you. Good morning. One thing I was curious about just talking about innovation is could you talk about your market share at different dayparts and whether you think that there’s specific opportunities to lean into one or two of those where you perhaps don’t have as much share as the others? And can that be a source of product innovation perhaps?
Sandeep Reddy: Brian are you there?
Brian Harbour: Yes. Hello. Can you hear me?
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. Sorry, we had a blip on the last question. Do you mind repeating the question, please?
Brian Harbour: Sorry about that. I was curious just about if you could talk about dayparts and how your market share might differ by daypart and whether you think that that’s kind of an innovation opportunity as well to target different dayparts differently?
Russell Weiner: I don’t think we’re going to go into – by the way, sorry, good morning. I don’t think we’re going to go into the detail of the specific numbers of our dayparts. But your answer is – or your – the answer to your question is absolutely. Finding incremental drill sites has been key for this brand. I remember when I joined in 2008, the majority of our stores weren’t open for lunch. We gave them a product with sandwiches and then later pasta. And now that’s a pretty significant piece of our business. We also weren’t a big carryout company and obviously now carry out half of the orders that come through Domino’s. So what we’re – what our job is to do every day is to find incremental drill sites and dayparts are absolutely one of those areas that we look.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your question please.
David Palmer: Thanks. Just a follow-up on the previous question about third-party sites and marketing and collecting orders from those in the U.S. You noted how you do it overseas. But your previous answer, you said you’re looking for stickier sales or you found that those have the highest value. Is that your way of saying you’re kind of closing the book on this and that you’ve kind of made up your mind? Or are you evaluating this still? And if you are evaluating it still, what sort of factors and timing should we be thinking about that you’re thinking about? Thanks so much.
Russell Weiner: Yes. I think maybe the way to interpret what I said before is, there are opportunities and there are also potential issues with competing with folks or working with folks. And we’re not going to think about going into anything unless we’re our best Domino’s. And the best Domino’s we’re getting there every day. We’re improving our service, and we talked about some of the tech and loyalty pieces. And then we’ll be in a better place to compete with or work with anybody.
David Palmer: This is something you haven’t closed the book on but perhaps some changes that you’re making might enable you to pursue that path, not that you’re committing at this point, but is something that you haven’t closed the book on.
Russell Weiner: Maybe I’ll refer back to the prior questions. We’re always looking for drill sites. If there are incremental drill sites that are smart for us, and this is one of them. You’re never going to hear that this team closes the book on things. Right now, we’re focused on making ourselves a better Domino’s.
David Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Long from Stephens. Your question please.
Joshua Long: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Excited to hear more about the summer service program, understanding that all the franchisees are going to be walking away with an individualized plan – but this is certainly exciting, but curious if you could talk a little bit more about some of the big pieces that have either already been in test, maybe what you’ve learned from that? And just help us kind of contextualize what franchisees to be walking away with as they all come up to an later this year.
Russell Weiner: Good morning, Josh. I think the best way to answer that question is to invite you to come up and join us for our Investor Day in Q4. We are really excited to show you what we show our franchisees, which are takeaways on the things that we’ve learned through some of these capacity issues, driver availability issues. And then more importantly, how that is leading to ideas to reinvent our circle of operations and improve technology to help circle of operations, but also help at the end of the day, the product the customer gets to be as hot as it can be. And also improve would it like to work at a Domino’s pizza. So maybe if there were videos, and I’d be able to show you stuff a little bit more, but this is the old-school phone call. And so you have to come up to Ann Arbor. And we look forward to seeing you.
Joshua Long: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Chris O’Cull from Stifel.
Chris O’Cull: Thanks. Good morning guys. Sandeep, you mentioned comparison benefits in the first quarter that won’t benefit the second quarter. But I was under the impression that transaction declines were also just as weak in the second quarter last year. Implying the comparison should continue to be favorable. And I’m just wondering if that was true. And then if you could just help us understand how meaningful the ticket growth should slow in the second quarter. That would also be helpful. Thank you.
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. So Chris, you are right that transactions did decline last year in the second quarter as well. So, I think that piece is consistent between Q1 and Q2. What is not necessarily consistent is the fact that we had the Omicron tailwind. We had one boost week in Q1 of this year, which was not there in Q1 of last year. And I think you asked – the second part of your question was about pricing and the national pricing lab. We’re not going to really get into the detail at this point. But clearly, it was a pretty significant increase to $6.99 from $5.99 million – so you can do the math and look for how much that’s going to be. But I think it is enough of an impact for me to call it out in terms of that being moderating in Q2.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen. Your question please.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. It’s very encouraging to hear you guys talk about confidence in the U.S. performance. But perhaps just from the outside, it looks like trends did deteriorate on a four-year basis by about 200 basis points from 4Q to 1Q. And I guess you’re also talking about the low end of long-term retail sales growth guide in 2023. So can you just help contextualize what’s driving the encouragement that externally may not perhaps be as obvious?
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. So Andrew, I think – thanks for the question. And like I said on the last call, we’re not going to look at stacks as a way of measuring our business. And I think it’s fair enough that you can actually ask the question, but really, what we want to look at is something’s that are more near term, and that’s why we’ve really talked about the current care comp and the comparison that we’re overlapping. So what we really see is a terrific carryout business, a really terrific carryout business. And to basically be lapping 11% last year, it’d be doing 13.5% or 13.4% this year was a great result for us. And look, delivery, there’s a number of things that we’re working on. You heard all about the initiatives on value and service and innovation that we’re working on. So we are doing everything within our control to drive an improvement in the performance on that on that part of the business. And even there, look, sequentially, it improved from minus 6.6% in Q4 to minus 2.1% in Q1. We’re not happy with negative comps. We want to actually inflect the positive comps. So we’re going to keep on working on that. And we have talked about the macro. It’s not gone away, and that is impacting us to some extent. But we don’t want to keep making excuses about the macro. We want to focus on what’s in our control, and that’s why we’re really putting our foot forward and actually driving all of those initiatives to get to the outcomes that we need. So super bullish on the long-term. I think we just have to work for some of these short-term issues.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your question please. 
Lauren Silberman: Thank you. Over the past few years, there’s been the shift in delivery carryout mix and differences in performance between the channels. Can you just help us understand the differences in average order size as well as profitability per order between the two. And then just more recently, have you seen any changes in check management across either of the channels? Thank you. 
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. So Lauren, thanks for the question. I think on the delivery carryout business, they’re both really good businesses with different margin profiles, but very good businesses. And I think when we look at the profitability to the franchisees; they’re both very, very accretive to their profits. And I think that’s why when we actually look at the shift that’s occurring between delivery and carryout the franchisee profit is not impacted in a significant way because of just the shift. Both – businesses are super important, so you don’t want to actually decline in delivery, like, unfortunately, we did last year. But I think overall, from our check size, I’m not going to quantify how big the ticket is on average for delivery versus carryout but typically, delivery ticket is going to be higher than carryout. But I think the cost of delivery is a little bit more labor intensive for obvious reasons because you have driver cost in particular. So the flow-through on that in terms of dollars is good, but I think the cost profile is higher, and therefore, the margins are smaller on a delivery transaction versus the carryout transaction.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Shreya Gokhale [ph] from JPMorgan. Your question please. 
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. It’s John Ivankoe. I did in the spirit of innovation, I want to ask about where we are in the personalization journey. It’s something we’ve been hearing about the better data-driven companies which you are certainly the top of the ability to customize promotions to customers to really elicit a specific behavior. So where are we in that journey? Is there any kind of significant functionality that can come as part of your new loyalty program, maybe some back-end work that you’re doing around Pulse 2.0. Just give us a sense of where you are and where you think you will go in the relatively near to medium term? Thanks. 
Russell Weiner: Hey John, it’s a great question. We are making improvements in, call it, kind of the tweaking of it through A/B testing, Multivariate tested things like that. I think the reason we’re leaning into a new loyalty program and a redo, I don’t think I know and a redo of our e-commerce business is there are certain things that we want to be able to do that we’re not doing right now. And this will really let us lean into personalization in a much bigger way. So great question, and the timing is perfect.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your question please. 
John Parke: Hey, good morning guys. This is John Parke on for Zach. Thanks for taking my question. I mean, I guess, again, you guys talked about the lower income demo kind of shying away from delivery a bit given the macro pressures. Can you just provide some color on how that different income cohorts kind of performed within delivery versus takeout.
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. So I think on this, the – what we pointed out from a macro standpoint was on the last call, more particularly than this call. But – what we also noted, if you go back to my prepared remarks, I did say that we’re going to have to continue to monitor real disposable income and the trends in that. And kind of how that’s evolving? Because what you’re seeing right now is inflation is on a downward trend, but wage growth seems to be holding up in the U.S. economy. But I think it cuts a little bit differently depending on income strata. So I think over time, you’re going to basically see potentially a change in the dynamic. But as of now, we still see this being a pressure point.
Russell Weiner: And I think what I’d add to that is a lot of times we’re asked on these calls, do you see any trade down from delivery to carryout. I talked earlier about how there’s a little overlap between the two. We’re seeing a lot of trade down from non-Domino’s carryout into Domino’s carryout. And I think it’s those consumers we’re talking about. So certainly, from a delivery standpoint, there are macro pressures, but I think that’s actually an advantage for us on the carryout side.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our final question for today comes from the line of Todd Brooks from Benchmark. Your question please. 
Todd Brooks: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Just on the unit growth side. I know Sandeep, you talked about just timing of fiscal quarter end versus some international openings. Is there any way that you can maybe size how many of those openings did occur in the first couple of weeks of the quarter here. Any commentary about what gives you confidence that the frictions on the U.S. construction side will ease in the second half? And then do you continue to be comfortable with at least reaching that low end of that 5% to 7% unit growth guidance? Thanks. 
Sandeep Reddy: A few things that I’m going to unpacked in your questions. And I think let’s start with the international unit growth question that you had. There was pretty much a timing issue between our fiscal calendar and our master franchisees, which is going to be a noise factor, frankly, for the many quarters in the year. You’ll see quarter-to-quarter noise. But I think overall, when we look at the pipeline of where our master franchisees are projecting the year end openings are going to be. We feel pretty good that we are on track for a full year basis, and that’s really incorporated into our global unit growth estimation. And so I think then I will talk about the U.S. store growth in particular. Look, I mean, we’ve been saying since the beginning of the year that we expected to see a first half be pressured by the same issues, which is permitting supply chain construction challenges that we – want to get through. But you heard Russell say themselves, which is we’ve been talking to the system. We’ve been talking to franchisees. We’ve been talking to our own internal teams really digging in because our pipeline is very, very robust. And frankly, the appetite for store openings is very strong. And that’s why we feel that yes. First, we’ll see a bit of a stabilization in the second half, and then we’re going to see that inflection. And as Russell said, it’s into 2024 because we have a pipeline that goes beyond 2023 right now. And that’s why we have so much confidence. And I’m going to actually bring in another piece, which you didn’t ask, but I’m going to say that this is a very critical element.  I talked about the inflection in profits for the franchisees in the fourth quarter. If anything, that inflection is accelerating right now based on our first quarter results. And if you look carefully at the food basket guidance, we’re not going towards the low end, all that flows through. And I think overall, the franchisees are in a very good place from a profit standpoint relative to how they started off Q1 of last year. So there’s a number of tailwinds that actually will reinforce that confidence in the system is showing in our unit growth projections.
Todd Brooks: Thank you. 
Russell Weiner: All right. Well, we’d like to thank everyone for joining us this morning, and we look forward to speaking to you in July to discuss our Q2 results. Until then, talk to you soon.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today’s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-23 10:00:00) =====
Company Representatives: Russell Weiner - Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Reddy - Chief Financial Officer Ryan Goers - Vice President, Finance, Investor Relations
Operator: Thank you for standing by and welcome to Domino's Pizza’s Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I’d like to introduce your host for today’s program, Mr. Ryan Goers, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. 
Ryan Goers: Thank you and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for our conversation regarding the results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Today's call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner; and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-K also applied to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC.  In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. I'll request to our coverage analysts, we want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such, we encourage you to ask only one one-part question on this call.  Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner.
Russell Weiner: Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. As we end 2022 and look back to the beginning of the pandemic, I’m encouraged by the incredible work done by Domino's team members and franchisees.  Since the beginning of 2020, we and our franchisees have grown by 2,860 new stores around the world, when many restaurant brands closed stores or struggled to grow through an extremely difficult time for store development. Domino’s is in over 90 markets and should hit 20,000 as a system in 2023.  In the U.S. the QSR pizza category grew over the last three years with sales up almost 10% versus pre-pandemic levels. Domino's serviced that growth resulting in a gain of approximately three share points in the QSR pizza category since 2019 according to NPD.  We continue to grow our Carryout business. Carryout now comprises approximately half of the orders and about 40% of sales in the U.S. Carryout remains highly incremental to delivery for us, and in cases where it's not incremental, customers are moving to a service method with significant lower costs for our system. Our delivery business experienced both headwinds and tailwinds over the past three years. Our team focused efforts on finding solutions at every turn.  Now to the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, our results were mixed, particularly with the challenges in the U.S. delivery business that we previewed during our Q3 call. During that call, I pointed to a couple of dynamics we were watching in the broader restaurant category that have since played out.  First, as consumers returned to many of their pre-COVID eating habits, some of the sit-down business that was a source of volume for restaurant delivery orders returned to that channel.  Second, inflation impacted delivery due to the added expenses of fees and tips in that channel. Our research shows that a relatively higher delivery cost during inflationary times leads some customers to prepare meals at home instead of getting them delivered. We believe this dynamic will continue to pressure the delivery category in the short term, as long as consumers' disposable income remains pressured by macroeconomic factors. Despite these pressures, the U.S. delivery sales for Domino’s in 2022 were more than $0.5 billion higher than the pre-COVID baseline in 2019.  Domino's delivery business was not alone in facing these challenges. According to NPD data, the entire QSR delivery category was down high single digits for fiscal year 2022. Not surprisingly, according to NPD, pizza delivery was down as well. Given these industry wide headwinds, we're encouraged that while our delivery business was challenged in 2022, Domino's saw a moderate increase in QSR pizza delivery share.  On the topic of delivery, while there's more work to do on staffing that part of the business, we feel like answers to this challenge exist within the Domino system. Staffing has improved at all positions in our corporate restaurants, including Drive In.  Continuing to leverage internal best practices around delivery service, as well as innovations in this area, like our new electric delivery fleet, should help continue to improve this critical measure. I am proud of the work that we and our franchisees have done to address labor constraints in the delivery business, and know we have more to do.  A consistent positive throughout 2022 has been the continued evolution of the Domino's business. This helped offset some of the macro challenges on the delivery side. In the U.S. we are a more complete restaurant company than ever, running two businesses out of our stores. We are Number 1 in the U.S. in both the delivery and Carryout pizza segments of QSR.  The Carryout business continues to be a strength, with tremendous momentum. In fact, U.S. Carryout retail sales for full year 2022 were more than $1 billion higher than pre-COVID levels. More importantly, we still have a long runway for growth in this important segment of the business. To give you a sense of the current scale of our U.S. Carryout business, if it were a company of its own, Domino's Carryout would be counted amongst the top 20 QSR brands in America based on consumer spending obtained by NPD for the year ending December 2022.  To support the growth of the business, we opened a new supply chain center in Merrillville, Indiana in September. As you know, we have invested significantly in our supply chain, opening four new centers since 2018. During the fourth quarter I visited our new center in Indiana. It has the latest in technology, automation and new operational procedures. Merrillville represents an incredible testing ground for the future of Domino’s supply chain, and we look forward to bringing the best parts of what we learned in Indiana to other centers around the country over time.  2022 was a strong year for global store growth. We and our franchisees had nearly 1,300 gross openings around the world in 2022. For context, that's about 3.5 new store openings per day on average, while operating in a difficult environment for development. This is a testament to the strength of the Domino's brand around the world. Our team members and franchisees have continued to show the agility and perseverance required to operate and grow Domino's footprint in a volatile macroeconomic environment.  Looking specifically at our international business, the 1,135 gross openings outside of the U.S. were the highest organic openings in our history. Meaning, they were achieved without any of our master franchisees conducting a large scale conversion of another pizza chain.  One of my personal highlights during the quarter was the opportunity to be in market with one of our largest master franchisees, Jubilant FoodWorks. In December I met with their team in New Delhi, where they reiterated their goal to grow to over 3,000 stories in India over the next five years, which would further cement Domino's position as the leading QSR brand in this critical global market.  Additionally, Jubilant is inspiring our global system to raise the bar on service with their new 20 minute delivery zones. I was able to see these in action when I was touring stores. Service has always been a key differentiator for the Domino's brand, and Jubilant is extending its delivery service advantage in India. How are they able to do this? With incredible operations enhanced by global fortressing strategy. When we and our franchisees build more stores, we can get closer to customers and improve delivery and Carryout services.  Now, for more detail on our Q4 results, I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Sandeep Reddy. Sandeep.
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, Russell, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin my remarks with updates on the actions I've previously outlined to improve our long term profitability. First, we are continuing to examine and evolve our pricing architecture. During the fourth quarter, the average year-over-year price increase that was realized across our U.S. system was 6.3%. The realized pricing for full year 2022 was 5.4%.  Second, efficiencies in our cost structure as we seek to ensure that revenues consistently grow faster than expenses. We saw another sequential improvement in year-over-year operating income margin as a percentage of revenues, as margins expanded to 130 basis points in Q4 versus the 160 basis points contraction in Q3.  Even if you exclude the 150 basis points benefit to operating income margin from the $21.2 million refranchising gain recognized in the quarter, the contraction in year-over-year operating income margin as a percentage of revenues in the quarter sequentially improved by 140 basis points versus Q3.  Third, we had positive same store sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact in both our U.S. and international businesses, for the first time since Q4 2021, contributing to improving our operating income leverage.  Now, our financial results for the quarter in more detail. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 5.2% due to positive sales comps and global store growth over the trading four quarters, lapping 9% global retail sales growth, excluding FX and the 53rd week impact in 2020 in Q4, 2021. As we have discussed in the past, we believe it has been instructive to look at accumulated stack of sales across the business, anchored back to 2019 as a pre-COVID baseline.  With the evolving macro-economic conditions, we do not currently believe it will be relevant to anchor back to 2019 going forward, and anticipate returning to evaluating the business on a one year comp basis in 2023. Looking at a three year stack, our Q4, 2022 global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, grew over 26% versus Q4 2019.  Breaking down, total global retail sales growth, U.S. retail sales increased 2.7%, rolling over our prior increase of 4.6%, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020, and are up more than 21% on a three year stack basis relative to Q4, 2019. International retail sales, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency grew 7.5%, rolling over a prior increase of 13.2%, excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2020 and are up more than 30% on a three year stack basis relative to Q4, 2019.  Turning to comps, during Q4 same store sales for the U.S. business increased 0.9%, rolling over a prior increase of 1% and were up 13.1% on a three year stack basis relative to Q4 2019. This represented a sequential deceleration of 4.5% from Q3 on a three year stack basis, as we saw clear evidence of softening demand from delivery customers in particular, given the challenging macroeconomic environment during the holidays.  The estimated impact of fortressing was 0.5 percentage points during the quarter across the U.S. system. Going forward, we will only update the impact of fortressing if the change in impact is material.  The increase in U.S. same store sales in Q4 was driven by an increase in ticket, which included a 6.3% in pricing actions I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a decline in order counts.  As we have previously shared, we believe it is instructive to break U.S. stores into quintiles based on staffing levels, relative to a fully staffed store, to give a sense for the magnitude of the impact of staffing.  Looking at Q4 same store sales, stores in the top 20%, those that are essentially close to fully staffed, on average outperformed stores in the bottom 20%, those that are facing the most significant labor shortages by less than 2 percentage point. This is down sequentially from the approximate 6 percentage point gap we saw in Q3.  Now, I'll share a few thoughts specifically about the U.S. Carryout and delivery businesses. The Carryout business was strong in Q4 with U.S. Carryout same store sales 14.3% positive compared to Q4, 2021.  On a three year basis, Carryout same store sales were up 31% versus Q4, 2019. The gap for Carryout between the top and bottom quintiles based on staffing levels, remain small during the quarter. The delivery business continued to be more pressured. Q4 delivery same store sales declined by 6.6% relative to Q4, 2021. Looking at the business on a three year stack, Q4 delivery same store sales were 3.3% above Q4 2019 levels. When we look at the same quintiles relative to the delivery business, the gap between the top and bottom quintile stores closed considerably.  We saw only a 2 percentage point gap in delivery same store sales between stores in the top 20% percent and those in the bottom 20%. This represents a sequential improvement from the 8 percentage point gap in the third quarter. The 2 percentage point gap is in line with the expected gap end performance in a normal operating environment, and we believe is no longer a significant driver of sales performance. We do not intend to continue disclosing the performance by staffing quintiles in the future.  Our U.S. Carryout business is going from strength-to-strength, and our pizza QSR Carryout market share is up close to 200 basis points in 2022 and up close to 500 basis points since 2019. Our market share in total pizza QSR, which includes Delivery, Carryout and Sit Down continued to hold steady over the past year, and it's still up close to 300 basis points versus three years ago  Before I conclude my comments on market share, I would like to touch on channel dynamics for pizza QSR versus non-pizza QSR based on data we receive from NPD. As Russell mentioned earlier, delivery in 2022 was done in both pizza QSR and non-pizza QSR while Sit Down was up significantly in both.  In the case of pizza QSR, this was driven more by a shift from delivery to Sit Down and cooking at home. In the case of non-pizza QSR growth in Sit Down was potentially driven by a shift from delivery, but also from Carryout. Domino's business model in the U.S. has historically been focused mostly on the delivery and Carryout channels, so the shift to Sit Down hurts us relative to others in the non-pizza QSR who historically have had business models that include Sit Down and Carryout, but have now added delivery to their distribution channels.  We expect this dynamic to continue to play out in 2023, as Sit Down despite recent growth is still below 2019 levels.  Shifting to the unit count, we and our franchisees added 43 net new stores in the U.S. during Q,4 consisting of 50 store openings and seven closures, bringing our U.S. system store count to 6,686 stores at the end of the quarter, which brought our four quarter net store growth rate in the U.S. to 1.9%. This deceleration in growth was expected in light of the permitting and store construction supply chain challenges we have faced all year. While we expect the first half of the year for U.S. store openings to continue to be challenging due to a continuation of these same factors, based on our current pipeline, we expect a gradual recovery starting towards the second half of 2023.  Domino's unit economics remain strong relative to the many pressures faced throughout the year, including staffing challenges and high inflationary environment for food and labor. The average Domino’s store in the U.S. generated more than $1.3 million in sales during 2022 We currently estimate that our 2022 average U.S. franchise store EBITDA was close to $137,000, not much below the 2019 estimated EBITDA of $143,000. In fact, estimated average store profitability was higher in Q4, 2022 than Q4 2019. We will update the final number on our Q1 call.  With our continued strong four wall economics, we remain bullish on the long term unit growth potential in the U.S. and we maintain our conviction that the U.S. can be an 8,000-plus store market for Domino’s. New store openings paybacks remained strong with stores opened in 2019, averaging around three year paybacks similar to the 2018 vintage.  Same store sales excluding foreign currency impact for our international business increased 2.6%, rolling over a prior increase of 1.8% and were up nearly 12% on a three year stack basis relative to Q4, 2019.  We continue to face the headwind of the negative year-over-year impact of the expiration of the 2021 VAT relief in the UK, our largest international market by retail sales. The fourth quarter impact was around half the magnitude of the second and third quarter, as the UK VAT relief was reduced from 15% to 7.5% in 2021 on October 1. The year-over-year impact of exploration of the UK VAT relief will continue while we lap the reduced rates that were in place through March 31, 2022.  Our international business added 318 net new stores in Q4, comprised of 406 store opening and 88 closures. Our closures were driven by another round of closures in Brazil as our master franchisee there continues its work to optimize the store base in the market, as well as some closures in Russia, where our master franchisee as previously announced by them, continues to explore opportunities to exit the business in that market.  This brought our current fourth quarter net store growth rate in international to 7.4%. When combined with our U.S. store growth, our trailing fourth quarter global net store growth rate was 5.5%. The 5.5% is impacted by a significant increase in international closures this year, as compared to our historical run rate, including in Brazil, Italy and Russia.  Turning to EPS, our dilutive EPS in Q4 was $4.43 versus $4.25 in Q4, 2021. Breaking down that $0.18 increase in our delivered EPS, our operating results benefited us by $0.27, changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.22. Our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.20, driven by the discrete impact from the reversal of our tax reserve, based on recent tax law change, related to one of our foreign subsidiaries during 2022.  Lower net interest expense benefited us by $0.04. The refranchising gain recognized to our fourth quarter store transaction, benefited us by $0.46. The unrealized gain recognized on our re-measurement related to our investment in Dash in 2021, negatively impacted us by $0.68 and a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trading 12 months benefited us by $0.11.  Transitioning to the full year, I would like to hit on a few financial highlights for 2022. Global retail sales grew 3.9% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Same store sales in the U.S. declined $0.08 and international, excluding FX grew $0.01.  We and our franchisees opened 1,032 net new stores during, despite significantly higher closures this year in our international markets as previously discuss. Our food basket for the year was up 13.2%,, reflecting the strong impact of inflation. Our G&A for the year was $417 million, down 2.8% versus $428 million in 2021.  Operating income was down $12 million versus 2021, including the $21 million impact of the refranchising gain. Operating income margin was positively impacted by 50 basis points due to the refranchising gain, but this was fully offset by the negative impact from foreign currency. If foreign currency remains at current levels or increases as a headwind going forward, we expect that this will be a barrier to recovering to our pre-pandemic operating income margins.  Although we faced operating headwinds in 2022, we continue to generate sizable free cash flow. During 2022 we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $475 million. After deducting for capital expenditures of approximately $87 million, which consisted of investments in our technology initiatives and supply chain centers, we generated free cash flow of approximately $388 million.  Free cash flow decreased $172 million from 2021, due primarily to changes in working capital, including accrued liabilities and income taxes, as well as higher advertising funds spend and lower net income.  During the year, we returned over $450 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $294 million and dividends of $158 million. As to the end of the year we had approximately $410 million remaining under our current board authorization for share repurchases. Our board has also approved a 10% increase from our prior quarterly dividend to $1.21 that is payable on March 30 of this year.  Looking forward to 2023, we would like to provide our annual guidance measures for the year. We currently project that the store food basket within our U.S. system will be up 3% to 5% as compared to 2022 levels. We expect the first quarter food basket increase to be higher than the rest of the year.  We estimate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a $2 million to $6 million negative impact on international royalty revenues in 2023 as compared to 2022 if foreign exchange rates remain at current level. The negative impact of currency is expected to be higher in the first half of the year based on current rates.  We anticipate our CapEx investments will be between $90 million and $100 million as we continue to strategically invest in our business and prioritize our spend. We expect our G&A expense to be in the range of $425 million to $435 million. Our tax rate excluding the impact of equity based compensation is expected to range from 22% to 24%.  Finally, given the current macroeconomic headwinds that are impacting our U.S. delivery business in particular, we are updating our two to three year outlook from 6% to 10% global retail sales growth to 4% to 8% global retail sales, and unit growth from 6% to 8% global net unit growth to 5% to 7% global net unit growth.  We expect 2023 to come in towards the low end of the ranges for both metrics. We look forward to providing more details at our Investor Day we will hold before the end of calendar 2023.  Thank you all for joining the call today, and now I will turn it back to Russell. 
Russell Weiner : Thank you, Sandeep. The Domino’s system has a lot to be proud of, and we also have opportunities to address. We pride ourselves on being a work-in-progress brand, and there is no better way to describe this period in our history.  As we saw in the last recession, delivery moves with the economy, especially for customers with lower disposable income, who represent a significant portion of our business. As it was in Q4 of 2022, we expect the economy to be a headwind for our delivery business in 2023. While we expect to continue to grow QSR pizza delivery share, we also expect the delivery sales will be challenged. Every day delivery customers will be deciding where to spend their hard earned dollars. So we need to maintain value and continue to improve our service.  On the subject of value, moving the $5.99 mix and match offer we launched in December of 2009 to $6.99 in 2022 was the right decision for our brand. That said, we and our franchisees must be vigilant to make sure value exists across our entire venue, not just in promotional offers.  We also need to drive more innovation. When I look back at my 14 years at Domino’s, we were at our best when we brought big ideas to market. These ideas helped us tell great brand stories. Coming out of COVID, we became more transactional with our customers than I would have liked. This was understandable as our team needed to pivot and react to some of the labor constraints we discussed earlier in the year.  I'm encouraged at the way we ended ‘22 and have begun 2023. We and our franchisees reinforced our position as the delivery leader by introducing a fleet of 800 electric delivery vehicles. Domino’s now has the biggest electric fleet of pizza delivery vehicles in the country. In Carryout, we brought back our innovative Carryout tips promotion, which continues to drive value and news in that segment. We've launched Loaded Tots in early 2023. Adding a potato side to our menu has been a goal for many years, but it was difficult to find a product that delivered well and didn't end up in customers' homes cold and soggy. Loaded Tots delivers, literally and figuratively, and continues our innovation strategy of adding platforms that are incremental to our menu.  In 2023 we will also refresh and improve our Piece of the Pie loyalty program. We finished last year with approximately 30 million active members in the program and over 77 million total members in our loyalty database. We launched Piece of the Pie in the fall of 2015. There is an opportunity to innovate and grow this program further by unlocking value to an even wider base of customers.  Dominos has been called many things over the years; a pizza company, a delivery company, a marketing company, a technology company, all of those are true, but when we are at our best, we're also an innovation company. Product, service and technology innovation with a very specific purpose; to give our customers and store team members the best possible pizza experience; to tell one of a kind brand stories and to over-deliver on expectations. This is what you have come to expect and should continue to expect from domino's pizza.  With that, we'll open the call to questions. 
Operator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your question, please.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. My question is on unit growth. Just first, on the two to three year algorithm change, moving to 5% to 7% from 6% to 8%. Can you just help us understand the drivers that forced this change? Is it primarily because of the decelerating U.S. outlook or is there other factors that maybe you'd like to take this moment to unpack for us.  And second to that, Sandeep you said in 2023 our unit growth should be at the low end of this new range, kind of near the 5% area. Can you just paint the scenario for us where you accelerate from the bottom of this range? Is there a catalyst that you see emerging, following 2023 that we should be thinking about, that makes the midpoint of this range more of a base case for unit growth moving forward? Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Good morning, Brian. Thank you for the question, and so let me start first with the rationale for the unit growth update from 6% to 8% to 5% to 7%. As we said in the prepared remarks as well, I think the U.S. delivery business and the constraints that we see in front of us on the U.S. delivery business are a big driver of this decision to actually slow down the expectations from a unit growth standpoint.  And as you also noted from my prepared remarks, the headwinds that we saw throughout 2022 are expected to continue into the first half of 2023 and that is going to put pressure on the unit growth that we expect to see as we go forward in 2023. And I think in terms of what the catalyst would be, the answer is a little bit in terms of what I talked about on the U.S. growth itself and the cadence. So the first half of the year is going to continue to be pressured for the same reasons that it was pressured in 2022. But as we move into the second half of the year, the pipeline that we have for 2023 looks really encouraging, and I think this is at the back of economics that continue to be very compelling.  We’re delivering $137,000 in EBITDA with all the pressures that were faced from an inflationary standpoint on food costs, labor and just general costs in the P&L and that's literally within $6,000 of 2019 levels. And most encouragingly, the exit rate from Q4 had the EBITDA levels that we are estimating above 2019 levels. This is really a manifestation of the price increases that we took on the natural offer for Mix of Match in the fourth quarter, in particular for Carryout beginning to flow through.  The flow through benefits for the franchisee P&L are very compelling, and we feel that if this continues, this cadence as we move forward in ’23, notwithstanding the 3% to 5% food basket increase that they're looking at. Franchisee is in a very good place to continue improving their profitability, and that's why we feel so confident with the pipeline that we’re seeing in 2023, economics back it up, paybacks continue to be very strong at roughly three years. 
Brian Bittner: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your question, please.
Peter Saleh: Great! Thanks. Russell, you alluded to some changes to the rewards program in 2023. I was hoping you could add a little bit more color to that. That feels like it could be a meaningful driver, as it’s been a driver for you guys for several years in the past. So just any update on that would be beneficial. Thanks. 
Russell Weiner: Sure. Good morning and thanks Peter. As I said during my remarks, we've been pleased with this program. We launched in 2017. We've got over 30 million active members, 77 million total members, and really at this point as we think about the evolution of the rewards program, it is about taking the best and keeping the best of what we have and then continuing to dial up on where the opportunities are, and so – and we're not going to talk to the specifics of it now.  But I think when you see us launch it later on this year, you'll see those who are joining the program continue to – are going to continue to enjoy the positives of it, and probably some of our less frequent customers are going to be incented to do more. And I should tell you, I'm sorry I misspoke. The launched central loyalty program was 2015, not 2017. 
Peter Saleh: Thanks. And then just one follow up for Sandy. Is it possible to get restaurant level margins for the franchisees back to you know 2020, 2021 levels with this mix of carryout delivery or do you really need delivery to resurge here to get back to those types of margins? Thanks. 
A - Sandeep Reddy: Thanks. Thanks Peter for that question. Now, in terms of where we were, in terms of restaurant level margins on the franchise's side, what you did see from a cadence standpoint was the profitability. It really went up pretty significantly between 2019 and 2021 from 143 to 174 I believe in 2021.  But I think the cost increases that have actually come through have been really significant, and I think until that kind of beds in and the price increases that we've taken basically start normalizing, it's going to take them some time. Over time of course, I think we’ll get back to those levels of profitability and absolute dollars.  But I think in the short term we're looking at small steps and I talked about Q4 specifically, because we're now inflicting, we're now inflicting the trend, and I think with the adjustments that we made on the pricing architecture, we're in a good place with the franchisees, and we hope that as we move into 2023 this continues to accelerate and helps them actually see even better profitability in ‘23. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line – one moment, from Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your question, please.
Sara Senatore: Yes, can you hear me? Thank you. I wanted to ask about sort of the comments on the comp and the macro environment. You know we're really not seeing very much softness or evidence of price sensitivity across the rest of the industry, and I understand delivery might be different, but I guess the question is two-fold.  One is, is there any reason to think that maybe your pricing could be higher? You seem to be lagging the industry by 2 to 4 points, and that's roughly where your comp gap is I would say. So you know as you think about pricing, is there room to maybe take more on the menu and perhaps less on delivery fees.  And then separately, does this increase the likelihood or the attractiveness of partnering with aggregators, not delivery as a service, but as a marketing platform. You know virtually everybody who has done that has suggested that the income cohort is higher on aggregator platforms and that it's incremental to the – you know to remember maybe ordering through the proprietary ordering.  So I'm just trying to piece together everything that's happening in the context of pizza being a very good value in absolute, but the lag versus the overall industry and maybe some drivers. Thanks. 
Russell Weiner: Yes, thanks Sarah, it's a great question. I think what I'll do is take a little step back and just give perspective on our business. As you said, it's a unique one.  60% of our sales are delivering. When we talked in our comments about the QSR delivery category down, the pizza delivery category was down, Dominos actually gained shared. So it's not the prettiest way to gain share, but in a macroeconomic time where the entire delivery QSR category is pressured, we grew sharing in the pizza category. That's 60% of our business, and when that’s 60% of your business, you're going to see the numbers fall out the way they did.  Now, what I'd like to think about when I talk about the Sara Senatore from Bank of America and future Dominos is how much more diverse we are than we were years ago. So think about our Carryout business that's not encumbered by any of those headwinds was up 14% to 15% in Q4, over 30% over the last three years, $1 billion dollars over the last three years, you know that's really a business that's on fire, and then internationally we open more organic stores than we ever had in our history.  And so I think you just need to have that perspective of looking at our entire business, how we're performing in delivery, how that performance is actually making us better, so when we come out of this we're going to be a better delivery company, but how the more complete dominoes is in a better place as we head through these tougher times.  So if I were to take that as a backdrop to your second question on you know aggregated for delivery, again like I said, we're continuing to grow share of delivery pizza here. We do work with aggregators globally. We've got $1 billion in sales outside of the U.S. where we're learning every day, and while we do that we're doing things like continuing to improve our ordering experience and improving the loyalty program as I spoke about, to make sure our delivery ordering experience is better than everybody else's. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Farmer from Gordon Haskett. Your question, please.
Jeffrey Farmer : Good morning. You guys stated that you're proud of the work that you've done with franchisees to address labor constraints and delivery business. Can you just elaborate on what you've done there to sort of shore up some of the driver need? And do you believe that staffing shortfalls are no longer having a material impact on your relative same store sales performance?
Russell Weiner: Yes, thanks for the question. Look, we're satisfied with the improvement. We're never going to be satisfied until every delivery is there as expeditiously as we can get it. So we're satisfied, but what I'd say is we have more work to do, so our service times are better. They are not better than they were in 2019 and that's the place we need to go.  When you look at our corporate stores, it’s trying to think about that as a proxy for what's going on in the rest of the business. Corporate stores, our hires are at pre pandemic levels now, turnover is down, job applications are up and we're getting people through the system faster on applications.  We talked about call centers. I wouldn't really mention it on this call, but about half our stores are on call centers right now. Not every single call goes through the call centers, but they are there to help and that makes the job easier for our team members. We have a lot of operation simplification processes that we put into place that we're really excited to share with you guys when you come in for Investor Day.  And then something that I'd point to that we just launched was this EV fleet. So we have an EV fleet of 800 vehicles, but that actually is part of a larger kind of strategic shift you're starting to see with our franchisees and corporate stores and purchasing vehicles. And what that enables us to do is attract folks who've got driver's licenses, but maybe don't have access to vehicles.  So when you put all that stuff together, you're seeing a more efficient inflow of people, more efficient operations, new pools of driver, that's why you're seeing the sequential improvement in the first and fifth quintile. And that's why you know we got another boost week coming up, back to the regular cadence as we said we would do in Q3. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes in the line of Brian Mullan from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. 
Brian Mullan : Hey! thank you. just a question on the Carryout business in the U.S. In the quarter same store sales were up 31% versus ’19. It's very, very strong on an absolute basis. It sounds like that trend versus ’19 did decelerate a little bit, a few hundred basis points versus the 35% you saw in the third quarter. Just wondering if you could speak to the dynamics you think were at playing in the quarter in Carryout and what might have been behind that deceleration, if anything worth noting. 
A - Russell Weiner: Brian, good morning. I think, look – on the Carryout business, when we look at it, when we look at three years tax of 31% on a business that has actually grown over $1 billion over the last three years, you get to a point where the sequential change is sometimes going to be off a little bit, but I don't think it really reflects on the underlying business. The underlying business is extremely strong. We are really pleased about what we are seeing in the Carryout business, both as we look back on 2022 and as we look forward into 2023. So, super happy with what we've seen. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your question, please. 
Dennis Geiger : Great, thank you. I wanted to have another one on the U.S. delivery challenges and how you address those, the biggest issues there. Russell, you just mentioned a focus on making the order experience better than everyone else’s, and I think at the end of your prepared remarks you gave a bunch of points of focus for sales going forward. But can you talk a bit more about the biggest opportunities to address the delivery pressures right now? Just you know, how difficult it is to overcome this kind of macro pressure, but again ultimately how you can do that within your brand. Thank you. 
Russell Weiner: Yes, sure. Look. I mean, I think part of the answer your question was in our question. The delivery pressures are a macroeconomic thing, and so like I said it, while it's not a pretty way to grow share, when you're growing share in a category that has got headwinds, that means you're kind of outperforming the rest of the category.  Now that's not what we like to see in our overall numbers, but you're really talking about macro pressures. And so the way I look at is all the things that we're doing now to get better in delivery with hiring folks, with having a tighter circle of operations, with innovating, with technology, all of these things, so that what is now a share increase in a category that’s got headwinds, when those headwinds will subside – and look, I joined during the time during, during the last recession. We boomed out of that recession, because I think as we said last time, we knew this, delivery because of delivery fee and because of tips, if they're going to have extra headwinds during these economic times.  So I like to look at how are we performing during these times? Are we getting better during these times, so when that pressure is gone you should see us to accelerate. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Your question, please. 
Andrew Strelzik : Hey! Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Mine is actually a follow up to your prior answer, and I guess my question is about balancing, kind of maybe being more aggressive and kind of creating a bridge through the macro challenges instead of maybe what sounds like a more incremental approach is kind of how I'm understanding what you're talking about, it. Kind of incremental steps and then a real acceleration as the macro improves.  So how do you think about potential opportunities to be more aggressive to smooth out that cadence rather than kind of the dip and the boom? Thanks. 
Russell Weiner: Yeah Andrew, great question, and that's kind of what I was talking to, you know really at the end,  Look, during COVID we were clear during the pandemic that we had capacity issues. And so the type of delivery innovation, there you are seeing more on things like car side delivery or contactless delivery, and so I'm not going to talk to innovations moving forward, but that's an important piece for us.  If we want to break out of the category, then we need to break out of the category from an innovation standpoint, and that's – you know we'll talk product later, I could talk all day. But there are innovations that are going to help us in addition to EV fleet on the technology side. That should help us break away from the crowd. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. Your question, please. 
Gregory Francfort: Hey! Thanks for the question. Russell, you talked a little bit about broadening value from the national coupon offers to maybe the rest of the menu. Can you expand on what that looks like and maybe what customer feedback you're getting that's driving you to or franchisees to reassess that? Thanks. 
Russell Weiner: Yeah sure, thanks. Well, I just want to reiterate our positive look to the change we made in our mix and match, moving to $6.99 both delivering Carryout. It was absolutely the right thing.  You know, as you know our franchisees and local stores control their own menu pricing and delivery fees and things like that and all the models in the world, all the experience in the world with the headwinds and changes in food cost and labor and things like that [inaudible]pretty quick. And I think if we were to look at some of our stores, things that are not on promotion.  So, menus and maybe some case delivery fee our price may have got a little bit of a head. We need to be of value, not just international offer. Sometimes people want medium two type pizzas, a lot of times they want medium two types pizzas, but sometimes they want other things too. And it's just making sure that we have the right value across the other pieces of our menu. We'll be working with our franchisees on that. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. 
Lauren Silberman: Thank you for the question. I appreciate all the commentary on franchise EBITDA and payback. Can you just level set where development costs are running today? I think they were around 3,500 in – those were in 2019. Just to figure out what that is now. And then, Sandeep, I think you might have said franchise EBITDA could actually grow in ’23, versus ‘22. Did I understand that correctly? 
Sandeep Reddy: Yes, thanks Lauren for the question. And I'll start with the last part, then we'll go back to the first part.  So I think in terms of franchise EBITDA, we expect ’23 to be improved versus 2022 for sure, given the pricing changes that we made towards the back half of the year and the lowering pressure from food basket and costs that we anticipate in ’23. But I think in terms of the development cost, the answer is, it kind of varies. It depends on where exactly they are building stores, and there's a big range in terms of development costs around the country. And so as we're coming out of this constrained environment, where we had permitting and store construction issues, we are basically saying that there is some cost pressure for sure, but I think getting into specific from what that number is, is probably not right until we see this play out over the course of ’23. And I think at the right time will be in a position to give you a better update in terms of the where things are at.  But essentially from a payback standpoint, the three year range of payback is still very much what franchisees are looking at, and that's why they are making the investments they are making. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your question, please. 
John Ivankoe : Hi, thank you. A part from me, first, U.S. unit development 1.9%. You’ve talked about splits of around 50 basis points, So that would suggest something like 25% on average of a split store comes from existing stores. And I wonder as you kind of think about the footprint going forward to 8,000 stores, if there be a way to reduce the sales impact from those splits, because obviously to the most nearby stores, it would be much greater than 25%, so that's the first part of the question.  And then secondly, I think it's been some time since we talked about the test or some initiatives that you were specifically doing in the Houston market, if I remember correctly. Is there anything to share that you're seeing there, that I guess in theory we could see publicly if we went and found that selection of stores, that maybe has some application to the Domino’s system from a efficiency effectiveness in store delivery, whatever we can maybe get a little preview of some of those initiatives on this call. Thank you so much. 
Sandeep Reddy: Sure I'll start off on the impact on the unit growth and a split impact of fortressing basically that you're referring to John. As you – we started already get updating again during the course of ’22 and if you saw we went from I think 0.7% of fortressing impact in the second quarter to 0.5% now. So the impact on fortressing is becoming less and less in terms of what effects it's got on the same store sales.  We don't see it being a very, very significant impact as we move forward. But as we said again, we going to update it if it really deviates from that. There is plenty of growth still that we actually seen in our runway. We have the opportunity mapped out by our internal teams, and we know that we can definitely go after that in the pipeline that we have from franchisees is on the back half. Knowing what that opportunity looks like, the economics that they see coming out of it, and so I think we feel pretty good that we had the right balance on that. 
Russell Weiner: Yes, I would just add John. We are transforming this company right now. Obviously, the delivery business is a hot topic today, but you know Carryout pizza, Carryout QSR is significantly bigger than delivery QSR and so what we see is every time we open up a new store, not only do our delivery times get tighter. And hot pizza is actually hot food in general by the way, which is why we're launching our Tots, because people want hot potatoes pun intended.  The delivery times get tighter, but also the Carryout volume is very incremental. Consumers don't want to – customer’s don't want to – customers don’t want to walk that far, drive that far to get their pizza. So part of the transformation of this brand into a more complete company is absolutely – you know continuing to drive these store growth.  As far as some things that we were doing at Houston, I think rather than me trying to describe things over a call, I would really invite you to come to our meeting later this year, where we're going to show that stuff live. It's super hard to describe, but I would say at the end of the day these are processes that enable us to get a hot pizza to customers, obviously in a safe but faster way. But also improve the experience in the store for our team members and the resulting quality of that product.  So hopefully, that's enough to wet your whistle to come to Ann Arbor. 
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our final question. And our final question for today comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your question please. 
David Tarantino: Hi! good morning. My questions is on the margin outlook and Sandeep, I was wondering if you could help to frame out how you think the EBIT margin will progress if you hit the low end of your targeted range in 2023. 
Sandeep Reddy: Yeah, so that's a great question, David. So look, I mean as far as we're concerned, the guiding principles that we've actually outlined is revenue should be growing faster than expenses. So when you look at the guidance range on global retail sales and you look at our guidance range on G&A, can see that essentially, even at the low end our G&A is basically below that in terms of growth at the midpoint. And so I think straight away that gets you into a place where you can be margin accretive, so that's point number one.  Point number two is, we actually experienced a lot of headwinds this past year from foreign exchange, and I think that actually had a 50 basis point negative impact on our operating margin in ’22. Unfortunately, given where we are, we still see a little bit more headwind, but not in the same magnitude given where current rates are. And so that would be an offset to some of that operating improvement. But from a mix standpoint, with the corporate store sales that have actually happened, we’ll now get three or more full quarters from that, that helps our margins.  So I think overall when we look at the margins, my expectations for margins is that margins will improve. But I think when we talked about pre-pandemic margins or 2019 margins with the currency headwinds that we experienced in ’22, that's probably further away than ’23, but it's not something that we're saying its unattainable. It's more a question of time and some of the other factors that hit the P&L. 
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Russell Weiner for any further remarks. 
Russell Weiner: Well, thank you, and thank you everybody for joining the call this morning. Sandeep and I look forward to speaking with you in April to discuss our first quarter results. Until then, we'll talk soon.
Operator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect today. Good day!

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-13 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 Domino's Pizza Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today to Ryan Goers, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ryan Goers: Thank you, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for our conversation regarding the results for the third quarter of 2022. Today's call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner; and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode.  I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q also applied to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-I financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. I'll request to our coverage analysts, we want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such we encourage you to ask only one one-part question on this call. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner.
Russell Weiner: Thank you, Ryan. And thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I'm encouraged by our global performance during the third quarter. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew almost 5% in the quarter, resulting in a three-year stack of plus 28% versus Q3 of 2019.  We and our franchisees over 200 net new stores during the quarter and over 1,100 over the trailing four quarters. 44 of our international markets opened at least one net new store, demonstrating the continued strong global demand for Domino. Our team members and franchisees around the world have continued to show the agility and perseverance required to operate in a volatile macroeconomic environment.  I wanted to start the call by going a little bit more in depth on our U.S. business, and some key initiatives. First and most important, the Domino's brand is as strong as ever. Our research shows the brand health remains at pre-pandemic levels, and we have maintained our lead over relevant QSR competition, and critical brand health metrics like net promoter score, and taste and value. All of these are key indicators of short and long-term performance.  Next, our same store sales. Same store sales in the U.S. were up 2% versus Q3 of last year. And when we look at our business on a three-year stack, which will continue to do for as long as it remains useful to put in perspective any COVID impact, same-store sales were up almost 18% versus Q3 of 2019. This represents a sequential improvement in three-year comps, from Q1 and from Q2.  Now Carryout. Carryout continues to be a growth lever and a massive opportunity for us. As you know, while Domino's started as a pizza delivery company, we began targeting the Carryout segment with specific offers in 2011. That effort has paid off, as NPD shared data shows that we became the number one Carryout pizza brand in the U.S. at the end of last year. We continue to grow the Carryout business in the third quarter. Carryout same-store sales were up almost 20% versus Q3 of 2021 with a three-year stack of plus 35% versus Q3 of 2019. Most importantly, we continue to see tremendous runway ahead in our carryout business.  On the Delivery side, the pricing we took on our national offer for Delivery performed as our proprietary research predicted. Going from $5.99 to $6.99 on our delivery mix and match deal was the right move. Given the continued inflation we have seen our analytics now indicate we should take pricing on our national Carryout deal as well. We will continue to balance customer value and franchisee profitability by taking our Carryout mix and match deal from $5.99 to $6.99, starting on October 17. From a delivery capacity perspective, we saw progress throughout the quarter resulting from our initiatives in this area.  While we only have visibility to our corporate stores, the number of job applications and new hires have increased throughout the year. At the end of the quarter, we were more or less back to 2019 levels as far as applications and new hires per week. Staffing remains a constraint, but my confidence in our ability to solve many of our delivery labor challenges ourselves has grown over the past few quarters.  Our delivery service also showed improvement throughout the quarter. While we still have work to do to get back to our highest standards for delivery service, I am encouraged by the progress we've made so far. Estimated average delivery time has improved every quarter this year. Additionally, our system is all in on another boost week for Q4, indicating their confidence in handling the increased volume. A boost week in each of three consecutive quarters represents a return to our pre-pandemic boost week cadence.  Finally, with regard to phone orders, around half our stores in the U.S. are now connected to call centers to help answer at least some of their calls.  Now moving on to our corporate stores. Our corporate stores there we are continuing to make moves to strengthen that business and the Domino's brand. We re-franchised corporate stores in Utah and Arizona after the end of the quarter. These transactions provided the opportunity to bring in several fantastic existing franchisees, who will further evolve and accelerate growth in these markets, as well as three new franchisees ready for the opportunity to own and grow with Domino's brand.  These transactions aligned with our strategy to utilize our corporate store platform to unlock growth by buying stores such as our transaction earlier this year to purchase stores in Michigan and selling stores, such as the 2019 transaction to re-franchise in New York. I visited our corporate stores in Houston in Q3 and it was happy to see progress and get feedback on some of the operational initiatives we're testing. As we have said, it is critical that we drive efficiency and effectiveness to benefit our customers and simplify jobs for our employees. I look forward to sharing more about these initiatives as we continue to learn.  Now for more detail on Q3 results, I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Sandeep Reddy. Sandeep.
Sandeep Reddy : Thank you, Russell, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin my remarks with updates on the actions I've previously outlined to improve our long-term profitability.  First, we are continuing to examine and evolve our pricing architecture. During the third quarter, the average price increase that was realized across our U.S. system was 5.4%. As Russell mentioned earlier, we will adjust our, carryout mix and match deal from $5.99 to $6.99 on October 17. As a result of this update, we expect to realize pricing to increase to approximately 7% in the fourth quarter.  Second, efficiencies in our cost structure as we seek to ensure that revenues consistently grow faster than expenses. We saw a sequential improvement in the year-over-year contraction of operating income margin as a percentage of revenues from 180 basis points in Q2 to 160 basis points in Q3. We need to continue this trend.  Third, we realized the sequential improvement in U.S. same store sales from minus 2.9% in Q2 to plus 2% in Q3, mostly driven by a smaller decline in order count.  Now, our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Global retail sales decreased 1.6% in Q3, 2022 as compared to Q3, 2021. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 4.7% due to positive sales comps in the U.S. and sustained global store growth momentum over the trailing four quarters, lapping 8.5% global retail sales growth excluding FX in Q3, 2021.  As we have discussed in the past, we believe it remains instructive, we look at the cumulative stack of sales across the business, anchored back to 2019 as a pre-COVID baseline, and will continue to do so for as long as we believe it is useful in understanding our business move on.  Looking at a three-year stack, our Q3, 2022 global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact grew 28% versus Q3, 2019. Breaking down total global retail sales growth, U.S. retail sales increased 4.1% rolling over a prior increase of 1.1% and are up more than 26% on a three-year stack basis relative to Q3, 2019. International retails, excluding the negative impact of foreign currency grew 5.2%, growing over our prior increase of 16.5% and are up more than 30% on a three-year stack basis relative to Q3, 2019.  Turning to comps. During Q3, same-store sales for our U.S. business increased 2% rolling over a prior decrease of 1.9% and were up 17.6% on a three-year stack basis relative to Q3 2019, representing a sequential 0.9 percentage point improvement from Q2 on a three-year stack basis.  Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 2.2% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 1.9%. The estimated impact of fortressing was 0.7 percentage points during the quarter across the U.S. system. The increase in U.S. same-store sales in Q3 was driven by an increase in ticket growth, which included the 5% in pricing actions I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a decline in order count. As we have previously shared, we believe it is instructive to break our U.S. stores into quintiles based on staffing levels relative to a fully staffed store to give a sense for the magnitude of the impact of staffing.  Looking at Q3, same-store sales, those are the top-20%, those that are essentially closed to fully staffed on average, unperformed stores in the bottom 20%, those that are facing the most significant labor challenges by less than six percentage points. This is done sequentially from the seven percentage point gap we saw in Q2 between the top and bottom quintiles showing improvement in the lower quintile stores ability to meet consumer demand.  Now I'll share a few thoughts specifically about the Carryout and Delivery businesses. The Carryout business was strong in Q3, with U.S. Carryout same-store sales 19.6% positive compared to Q3, 2021. On a three-year basis, our Carryout same-store sales were up 55% versus Q3 2019. The gap between the top and bottom quintiles based on staffing levels remained relatively small during the quarter, highlighting both strong consumer demand and the lower cost of serve relative to delivery order.  The Delivery business continue to be more pressured. Q3 delivery same-store sales declined by 7.5% relative to Q3 2021. Looking at the business on a three-year stack, Q3 delivery same-store sales were 8.4% above Q3, 2019 level. When we look at the quintiles relative to the Delivery business, we continue to see a more pronounced difference in performance. We saw an eight percentage point gap in Delivery same store sales between stores in the top-20% and those in the bottom 20%.  While we continue to see a gap in performance between the top and bottom quintiles, this represents a sequential improvement from the 11 percentage point gap in the second quarter, and the 17 percentage point gap in the first quarter. A point to note is that despite the decline in same store sales in the past year, or pizza delivery QSR market share based on NPD data is up modestly over the prior, as we see a similar decline in the size of the delivery market over the past year. This decline in pizza delivery QSR is potentially attributable to a shift of delivery to dine-in, as consumer behavior starts to revert to pre-pandemic habits. In fact, the pizza delivery QSR market is still up almost 30%, versus three years ago, despite the recent decline.  Our market share in total pizza QSR, which includes delivery, dine-in and carryout has held steady over the past year and is up by more than 200 basis points versus three years ago. The overlap of our customers who order both delivery and carryout continues to be relatively modest, and spending slightly above our historical overlap rate of 15%, pointing to each channel as a relatively unique business.  Shifting to unit count, we and our franchisees added 24 net new stores in the U.S. during Q3 consisting of 27 store openings and three closures bringing our U.S. system store count to 6,643 stores at the end of the quarter, which brought our four-quarter net store growth rate in the U.S. to 2.7%. With our strong four-wall economics, we remain bullish on the long-term unit growth potential in the U.S., and we maintain our conviction that the U.S. can be an 8000-plus store market for Domino.  New store paybacks remains strong, with stores opened in 2018, averaging around three-year paybacks and stores opened in 2019 on track to deliver a similar performance. Same-store sales excluding foreign currency impacts for product international declined 1.8% rolling over a prior increase of 8.8% and were up more than 13% on a three-year stack basis relative to Q3, 2019.  Similar to the second quarter, we faced headwinds of the negative year-over-year impact of the expiration of the 2021 VAT relief in the UK, our largest international market by weekend sale. This resulted in a negative comp for the quarter for international, versus a slightly positive comp without this unfavorable UK VAT impact. The year-over-year impact of expiration of the 2021 UK VAT relief will continue, while we lap the reduced rates through March 31, 2023 but with a lower impact, as the UK VAT relief was reduced from 15% to 7.5% last year on October 1.  Our international business added 201 net new stores in Q3, comprised of 263 store openings and 62 closures. Our closures were driven by our master franchisees exit from the Italian market, as well as another round of closures in Brazil as our master franchisee there was its work to optimize the store base in the market. This brought our current four-quarter net store growth rate in international to 8.1%. When combined with a US store growth, or trailing four-quarter global net store growth of 6.2% continues to fall within our two to three-year outlook range of 6% to 8%.  Turning to revenues and operating income. Total revenues for the third quarter increased approximately $70.6 million or 7.1% from the prior quarter, driven by higher supply chain revenues due to a 13.4% higher market basket pricing to stores and U.S. stores revenues resulting from retail sales growth. These increases were partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $7.9 million during Q3.  Our consolidated operating income as a percentage of revenues increased by 160 basis points to 16.5% in Q3 from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by food basket and labor cost increases. These impacts were partially offset by pricing actions and G&A leverage.  Our diluted EPS in Q3 was $2.79 versus $3.24 in Q3, 2021. Breaking down that $0.45 decrease in our diluted EPS, our operating results have benefited us by $0.10, changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.17, our higher effective tax rate negatively impacted us by $0.48, $0.36 of which was driven by changes in tax impact of stock-based compensation, lower net interest expense benefited us by $0.02, and a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.08.  Although we faced operating headwinds, we continue to generate sizable free cash flow. During the first three quarters of 2022, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $330 million, after deducting for capital expenditures of approximately $50 million, which consisted of investments in our technology initiatives and investments in our supply chain centers, including a new facility in Indiana, which will begin serving stores next week.  We generated free cash flow of approximately $280 million. Free cash flow decreased $154 million from the first three quarters of 2021, primarily due to changes in working capital, the timing of payments for accrued liabilities, and receipts on accounts receivable and lower net income.  During the quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 491,000 shares for $196 million at an average price of $399.52 per share. As of the end of Q3, we had approximately $410 million remaining under our current board authorization for share repurchases. During the quarter, we drew down $120 million on our existing variable funding note facility to fund additional return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases.  Subsequent to the quarter, we also closed our new additional $120 million variable funding note facility with terms that are substantially similar to our existing facility and paid down $60 million up to $120 million during an existing facility during the third quarter. We are very pleased with the competitive terms we were able to achieve given the current volatile interest rate environment.  In addition, as Russell mentioned, subsequent to the end of the quarter on September 26, we completed transactions to re-franchise all our corporate stores in Arizona and Utah to certain franchises for approximately $41 million. We will provide further details of the financial impact of the transaction when we report our fourth quarter results next year.  Before I close, we would like to update the guidance we previously provided for 2022. Based on the continuously evolving macroeconomic environment, we now expect changes in foreign currency exchange rates to have a negative impact of $29 million to $31 million, compared to 2021, an increase from $22 million to $26 million we were expecting to see in July.  We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $100 million for the year, down from the previous guidance of approximately $120 million. And we now expect G&A to be $415 million to $420 million, down from the previous guidance of $420 million to $428 million.  Thank you all for joining the call today. And now I will turn it back to Russell.
Russell Weiner: Thank you, Sandeep. Before we open the call for questions, I wanted to talk a little bit about the macroenvironment and the potential impact on the QSR industry, particularly delivery. There are a couple of dynamics that we're watching in the broader restaurant delivery segment.  First, as consumers returned to some of their pre-COVID eating habits, the sit down business that was once a source of volume for restaurant delivery over the past few years is rebounding and bringing back with it, some of the orders that were delivered when sit down was constrained.  The second dynamic is inflation. We believe that inflation will impact delivery more than carryout, due to the added expenses of fees and tips in that channel. Our research shows that a relatively higher delivery costs might lead some customers to prepare meals at home. This could be exacerbated as consumer spending becomes more constrained around the holiday.  As we begin Q4, I believe Domino's is poised to emerge from these volatile times stronger than ever. This is what our business model was built for. I joined Domino's in 2008 during another tough economic environment. What I learned then is even more true today now that we're the number one pizza company in the world.  In a world where consumer confidence is shrinking and inflation is high, Domino's will succeed, because we have strong profitable franchisees, a team that makes disciplined decisions based on insight, and have the digital supply chain and delivery expertise to offer best-in-class value and customer experience. We delivered around one out of every three pizzas in the United States before the pandemic, and we deliver around one out of every three pieces today.  One important thing we have today that we didn't have in 2008, is a strong Carryout business. As a more complete restaurant company today, I have never been more confident in the future of Domino's Pizza.  With that, we'll open the call the question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Brian Bittner: Good morning. Russell, I want to ask about the promotional strategy. And I know you touched on a tougher macro at the end of your prepared remarks, but specifically, you've had the 20% off everything discount in place since around September 6 and it's been happening at a time where I think staffing still does remain a headwind even though it's been improving. And I would think franchisees margins are also being pressured by inflation. So, can you just help unpack the strategic thinking around this strategy? When is still in place, from what I can see so is it accomplishing what you initially wanted it to accomplish?
Russell Weiner: Good morning, Brian. Thanks for the question. On the 20% off, there were really two strategic reasons why we went ahead and did it. And as you said, it's kind of at the end of the quarter. The first is, as a brand with Domino's tries to do is whenever there's a big tension in society, and obviously now the macro tension is around inflation, we try to do a brand action that shows that we are the advocates for our customers. And so in a time where there's inflation, and everything's going up, Domino's being able to offer 20% off was really a more strategic communication moves, and it was anything else.  Secondarily, as I said in my opening remarks, we're about to evolve our carryout offer from $5.99 to $6.99 next week. And so part of what 20% off does, it gives us a little bit of room between where we were and where we're going from a communication standpoint.
Sandeep Reddy : And Brian, I'll just add something to that. The 20% off promotion, or the mix and match promotion from a profitability standpoint is not significantly different. It's just a different way of delivering a promotion to the consumer. So from a margin standpoint, our franchisees and our corporate stores have not been really impacted in a significant way through this transaction, through this promotion. And so we feel really good about that piece of it as well.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you, one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open.
Peter Saleh : Great, thanks. Russell, I just want to come back to those comments you just made, the tension on inflation. We've had double digit inflation really all year. Yet, it seems like the commentary and the rhetoric around the impact on the consumer seems a little bit more, I guess, pronounced right now. So can you just talk about what you're seeing? And maybe what's changed there, that makes you feel like, I guess, has the inflation just caught up with the consumer more broadly. Or just what's changed on that side, given that we've had really double-digit inflation for really three quarters so far this year?
Russell Weiner: Peter, thanks for the question. For us here at Domino's, our approach to whether it's an inflation environment or non-inflation environment is, we need to be the best relative value out there in the QSR industry, interestingly enough, and it was exactly what our internal research predicted. When we went from, $5.99 to $6.99, we still remained a great relative value on the delivery side. Things have changed, prices -- cost inputs have changed. And our research now indicates we can do the same thing on the carryout side and will still remain a large relative value. So really, that's our role within this inflationary environment is to be a strong relative value in QSR for our customers. 
Peter Saleh : Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question Sara Senatore from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Sara Senatore : Hi, thank you. The two-part question if I may. One was just on company margins and how to think about that versus franchisees. Labor hours, or labor costs was sort of stable, the pressure was stable quarter-over-quarter, even though your comps were a lot better. So is that signaling more wages or more hours in response to driver shortage and our franchisees seeing something similar? And then second, I guess, if you were to choose to refranchise the Michigan market to help mitigate the impact on company margins. Is the refranchising strategy a headwind to doing that? I know you've talked about 70 basis points of comp headwind, which is pretty much unchanged. But just trying to understand the appetite for that. Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy : Hi, Sara. I'll take the first part of the question and then Russell will pick up on the second piece on the refranchising opportunity. So I think on the company margins or what we saw there was a multitude of headwinds, definitely the food basket and some investments in labor that we had to make over there. But I'm just going to step back a little bit and talk about total company margins. And number one, the refranchising of these two markets essentially will be margin accretive to total company margins and it will start showing up in the fourth quarter. But I think specifically talking about corporate stores margins, we've talked about this in the previous quarters as well, but from a pricing standpoint, I think we were slightly behind where the franchisees were and taking pricing. And I think as the inflationary headwinds have actually built, whether it's the food basket or the investments in labor that we have to make in our stores, that has been a pinch point for company operating margins. As we've talked about, we're evolving given the national offers right now on the carryout side, and this benefit will come into the company-operated stores as well as the franchisee stores, obviously. And I think with what we've actually done in terms of changes that we've talked about since the last quarter, we're really pleased with the sequential improvement that we saw in same-store sales. It went from minus 9% to minus 1.9% between the second quarter and the third quarter.  So that's very encouraging. And this ends up being a leading indicator of where we can take our profitability of the corporate stores going forward. So it's not going to be an overnight fix, but a lot of the actions, including pricing, already underway. So I think it's more a question of time to actually see this play out in terms of total profit margins. So pass on to franchising.
Russell Weiner : Sure. Thanks for the question, Sara. The franchising or refranchising strategy for us is really more -- I would think of it as a growth strategy. Team U.S.A., our corporate store markets are there to unlock growth in two ways. Sometimes we're going to buy a market like we did in Michigan, and there it was to kind of redistribute stores and own some ourselves and unlock what is a market that we think have a lot of upside.  In some cases, the unlocking of growth and the creation of franchisees that are going to be our future is done through refranchising, and that's what was done most recently in our markets in Phoenix and Salt Lake City. And I would like to spend a few seconds just talking about what it means when we refranchise stores in this particular instance because really, it's what makes Domino's so special. And maybe there are people who are listening to the call now who are interested in drivers' positions. And let me tell you why you should be interested because our drivers become franchisees. We sold stores, we refranchised stores to our franchisees in Arizona and Utah. 11 franchisees purchased those, three of them were first-time franchisees, two of them were former corporate employees. Remember, 95% of our franchisees started out as employees making pizza or driving. Six franchisees purchased the first store they ever worked in. And so that's part of the American dream, which is Domino's. So in this case, we're unlocking growth and new franchisees.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question will come from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
John Glass: Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about the outlook for the global unit growth balance of year or maybe into next year? You signaled that U.S. would slow. I think you were seeing that international closures were higher. I'm not certain if this is all just contained in this quarter, but can you sort of talk about how you think about that? And just more generally, are you starting to see some constraints on international development given inflation, given supply chain? Are there any concerns that you might see further deterioration or slowing, I should say, an international store growth ex those closures given changing macro environment? Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy : John, this is Sandeep. And I think on the outlook for global unit growth, we're really bullish. I think things are looking very strong in terms of where the potential for growth exists. We've talked previously about 10,000 potential stores in our top 15 markets. That hasn't changed in terms of the calculus.  Looking at the more specific recent quarter, we've already flagged that in the U.S. be between the permitting and construction delays that we're dealing with, we're going to see a slowdown. The slowdown has come. So we saw that as a part of it. And I think specifically internationally, we talked about the exit of the Italian market by a master franchisee as a key driver of the decline. And I think in Brazil, we had our master franchisees there continuing to optimize the market. There were some stores that closed in the first quarter, and they close some more stores in the third quarter. So I wouldn't really read too much into this in terms of where the long-term international trends are going. It is very strong in terms of potential.  I talked in the prepared remarks about the paybacks on our U.S. stores. They're very compelling. They're around three years from more recent years like 2018 and 2019 seems to be on track as well. I can assure you that the international paybacks are even better. So the runway that we've got over there is very, very strong, and we're very confident of that.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question off the line of Brian Mullan from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Mullan : Yeah. Thank you. I think in the prepared remarks, you said it was an eight-point gap between the top quintile and the bottom quintile of stores this quarter and delivery, another sequential improvement. My question is, can you give us a sense of what the historical gap between the top and bottom quintile for delivery was prior to COVID? And when you get back to that normal gap, is that an indicator that the driver issue is getting close to solved in your mind? Just talk about that or measuring that internally as you make progress.
Sandeep Reddy : Brian, thanks for that question. You're right. I mean the eight-point gap that we're seeing on delivery is higher than we've seen historically. But again, let's just keep in mind, it was 17 points in Q1. It was 11 points in Q2, and now it's eight points. It is still higher, and there's still a bit more work to be done, but we continue to make progress, as Russell talked about in the prepared remarks. So the key over here is we had to restore service to the levels that our customers are accustomed to. And we also need to make sure that we're able to fulfill all the demand comes our way. It's when those things actually happen that we know we've actually returned to where we need to be.  And I think as far as we're concerned, we continue to look for progress points as we make sequential progress through the year. And we're very confident that the answer is probably within the system like we've talked about previously. But I think we'll continue to look at profiles. We'll keep talking about it as we go through the next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe : Hi. Thank you. It's John Ivankoe. The question was on U.S. unit development. I know we talked about slowdown has come, I think, Sandeep, was your quote. But looking at the 172 units year-over-year, the 2.7%, is that -- I guess, is that the bottom in terms of growth? I mean, how should we be thinking about the next fourth quarter, firstly, but also the next 12 months in terms of those levels that you have achieved in the previous 12 months? I mean is that stable higher or lower from here? I guess, is the first question. And then secondly, I just wanted to understand if there's any symbolism in terms of the modest cutbacks in G&A and the more significant cutbacks in CapEx. Is that more timing oriented? Or are there other changes in the business that are going to be more lasting? Thank you.
Sandeep Reddy : Thanks, John. Appreciate the questions. Now I think in terms of the U.S. units, we flagged this back at the end of the second quarter when we talked about the expected slowdown due to the permitting and construction delays that we were seeing. I think it's expected to impact definitely the balance of the year, as we've talked about earlier. And frankly, until we see the permitting and construction delays completely abate, it is going to be a head.  But I think what we do see is once we get past that headwind, the demand is very strong from our franchisees. So we should see that to work to prior norms in terms of growth rates. And that's why we're really very convinced that we're on our way to that 8,000-plus mark. And I think it's more a question of getting past these macro disruptions that we are seeing over here. And then I think when it comes to the G&A and CapEx adjustments to guidance, I'll take the G&A one first. The G&A is impacted a little bit by the refranchising of stores that we talked about. So with the -- some of the -- with the corporate stores in Arizona and Utah are now moving into the franchise P&L, the G&A structure that was going with those stores vendor corporate stores wouldn't really hit our G&A, and that's part of the driver of it. And there are some other small elements of adjustments in terms of expenses that actually went into that as well. So -- but it's not major. It's just more of a reclass between corporate stores and franchise stores. And I think on CapEx, if you look at our run rate on CapEx, the $120 million was a bit of a tick up. We expected to have heavier spend on some of our supply chain investments. We're just pretty much sliding it forward. So I don't think it's going to change the cadence of how much spend we're going to have. It's just more of a timing impact starting forward.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. The next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Gregory Francfort : Hey, thanks for the question. Russell, also, I had a question about just pricing elasticity and I think it's interesting that a lot of your competitors have taken the delivery prices up 25%, 30% above their in-store prices. And you guys, it's pretty consistent, but you guys, I think, have a little bit higher delivery fees. Is that because of maybe some work on the elasticity of pricing in the delivery fees versus in the menu? And is there an opportunity to widen out maybe the delivery prices versus the in-store prices over time for Domino's? Thanks.
Russell Weiner : Yeah. Gregory, thanks for the question. As we've said on prior calls, the delivery fees and the menu prices are both franchisees' decision on what they make. What we do there, though, is we provide them with what the competitive context is at a local level. And there certainly are recommendations that are based on data on where you need to be versus the competition and all of that's taken into account when they set their pricing relative to our national pricing.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question will come from Andrew Strelzik from BMO. Your line is open.
Andrew Strelzik : Hey, good morning. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on your comments about efficiencies in the cost structure, which is something you mentioned in prior quarters as well. But are you continuing to find incremental efficiency opportunities in recent months? Or is this more kind of execution of the initiatives you've been talking about? And then is there anything at the store level technology or otherwise that you're exploring to potentially help from an efficiency perspective?
Sandeep Reddy : So Andrew, thanks for the question. In terms of efficiencies in the cost structure, I think from the beginning of the year, we've been talking about continuing to look at it. I think it's a combination of other costs that actually could be eliminated if they make sense to eliminate. But more importantly, it's resource allocation, how do we redeploy resources to the best returns.  And so I think in terms of the journey that we're under, it's not really changed that much from what we talked about when I first talked to you in April. And I think we'll continue to do this as we move forward, not just in the fourth quarter but into '23 as well. And so from that standpoint, there's nothing more than that. But I think from a technology and supply chain standpoint, if you had a question, Russell some comments to add on that.
Russell Weiner: Yeah, I think you're absolutely right on the efficiency standpoint. It's something we've been looking to drive, and we'll continue to look to drive it. I think there are really two ways that we're doing it. One is in the physical circle of operations and bringing in codifying best practices that we're going to talk about in future calls. But as part of what I told you, I was so excited to see when I was down in Houston. In addition to what we can do with the physical circle of operation, we have a next generation suite of store systems that we've already launched, and we're going to continue to launch that really just tries to automate some of the more manual decision making and optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of our stores. So we're looking at from a human center design standpoint and also how can technology help us.
Operator: One moment for next question. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles : Great. Thank you. Russell, I know you said brand health scores are pre-COVID highs, but I want to dig in a little bit more just around the evolution and modernization in recent years with things that drove your success in the prior 10 years, menu innovation loyalty, digital and advertising. And really, my question is, looking beyond boost weeks and beyond 4Q, what work is being done to advance the ball on these core four parts of the playbook to help you guys grow traffic in 2023 and beyond in a more competitive delivery environment as well as pizza category?
Russell Weiner : Yeah, Andrew, thanks for the question. I mean you're right, certainly during the last couple of years, we were adjusting as things kind of came our way. So the long-term planning and kind of the stories you're used to seeing from Domino's maybe took a little bit of a back seat to just trying to adjust to what was going on in the environment. But I fully expect, obviously, we can't talk about the future. But what you've seen from us before, which are these OUS, we did stories that are adjusting to what's going on in society, technology innovation, not only for the customer but in store.  From an innovation standpoint, I think we're really unique and we will continue to be unique and that we just don't launch products for products sake that we're spending all this money and then they come out of the market. We launched incremental platforms and those platforms work really well into our mix and match deal. And we know when we work them into our mix and match deal, it increases items per order, and that's a healthy way to drive ticket. So I think you're right on in how you assessed the way we've grown the business, and that's how we're going to be focus moving forward.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question will come from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Johnson: Thanks, guys. This is Patrick on for Chris. My question relates to the supply chain. Am I right in thinking that unit volumes remain down year-over-year, along with transactions? And if so, what opportunities are there to improve volumes outside of unit and transaction growth in that segment? Would you consider adding new products or potentially some other alternatives that make strategic sense for the business as a whole?
Sandeep Reddy : Yeah, Chris, sorry. Thanks for the question. And I think specifically on supply chain, if you go and look at the most recent quarter, yes, unit volume was down just because I think that was a driver that was a partial offset to the fact that the market basket pricing was up by 13.4%. But I think overall, when we look at the actual dynamics of what happened in the margin, there were two different things.  I think you had fuel and labor costs basically were also a headwind that actually impacted the supply chain margins in the quarter, which sequentially was a change. It was actually a hardening impact compared to the second quarter, and that's why you saw margins shift a little bit downwards in terms of the gap versus the prior year. And just a reminder, I think we've said this before, but supply chain margins in an increasing cost environment will contract because we have a constant dollar margin on what food product we sell. In the opposite situation where costs decline and food cost decline, we would be seeing improving margins. So this is nothing new in terms of our business model and the model that we apply to how we price to the franchisees. And so we expect to see this headwind for the balance of the year given where we're projecting the full basket.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Lauren Silberman : Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the increase in the two more mix and match for carryout week. Can you talk about the decision to change the carryout price now versus increasing it in March alongside delivery? Is elasticity lower than expected, so you have more comfort raising it on carryout or any other factors that went into the decision? Thank you.
Sandeep Reddy : Thanks, Lauren. I think what's really important is really think about the philosophy on how we look at pricing in the company, and it's not new, it's not stock side of this year, it's been happening over the last decade or more. And I think there's key elements to it. One is I think we would look at our input costs and essentially what that does in terms of long-term store profitability for the franchisees and our own corporate stores. But then we also look at the relative consumer price points and competition in the market.  So when you actually peel back to the decision to adjust the delivery mix and match back in March, all of these factors were taken into consideration. But I think we saw that there had been some hardening in cost was in the labor side. And because delivery is a more labor-intensive channel of business, we had visibility to that where the increases tend to be more permanent in nature. And to drive the contribution margin that was needed on the delivery side, we believe it was needed to make that adjustment to the mix and match price on delivery in March. While food basket had already started going up, what has happened historically is it's been very volatile. It can go up, but it can also reverse. So we wanted to make sure that the increasing costs that we are seeing on the food basket were likely to sustain. And also, we've examined over the last six months how competitive pricing has actually evolved in the marketplace.  So when you take both those elements under consideration competitive price shift as well as the fact that the food basket has continued to harden, we believe now is the right time to make the change on the carryout mix and match as well to drive that profitability for the franchisees and process.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question will come from the line of Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. 
Jared Garber : Hi. Thanks for the question. Russell, you made some comments around maybe the shift that you're seeing or potentially we'll see in the delivery business versus the carryout business as it relates to consumer demand and some more pressure on the consumer. Can you talk about that dynamic in international markets as well and maybe give us a little bit of a sense of the breakdown on carryout versus delivery there?  And I know we heard some good color on the UK market, some of the bad impacts there, but certainly, the macroeconomic outlook in broader Europe is a little bit more challenged as we go forward. So any color on how we should be thinking about that or how you're thinking about that and what you're hearing and seeing from franchisees would be great. Thanks. 
Sandeep Reddy : Yeah, Jared, I think just a couple of points on that before I get into the international markets, which I think was the bulk away talking about the demand change. So I think what we talked about in the prepared remarks was specifically on delivery, there could be some pressure to the macroeconomic environment and inflationary environment. But I think overall, from a carryout standpoint versus delivery, we -- as we've said in the prepared remarks, it's very little overlap between the two businesses. And I think there's two pretty unique businesses. So we don't necessarily see a switch out between the two channels. But I think overall, when we talk about the impact of inflation, it is not just a domestic impact, it's international as well. So the same dynamics that we talked about being a pressure point would be an impact internationally, including the UK that we talked about. And I think the risk is when you have a very significant inflation, consumers may actually switch to cooking at home and preparing for it all.  And that's just the risk factor. We are an unprecedented inflationary times. So how consumer behavior evolves right now is still a little bit more to be seen, but our testing models show that there's a higher likelihood of switch if inflation remains at these elevated levels.
Russell Weiner : Yeah. I would add to that what Sandeep said is when pricing hits on the delivery side, people tend to more go to cook at home. When pricing hits on the carryout side, folks tend to look at relative value. And that's really where we win. And a lot of the growth, I mentioned earlier, we're the number one carryout pizza brand, at least in the U.S. But the fact is we also source a lot of our carryout volume from other QSR. So during times globally, where pricing is going up, on our carryout business is actually should be a source of volume.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for next question. Our next question will come from line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Your line is open.
Dennis Geiger : Thanks for the question. Sandeep, you spoke to a strong franchisee demand to open new stores in the U.S., particularly as you get past the supply chain and the permitting delays. So I'm just wondering if you could speak a little bit more to sort of franchisee health across the U.S. as we think about the cost pressures that the industry has been facing as well as now sort of higher interest rates. Just sort of where sentiment is now broadly for your franchisees here in the States?
Sandeep Reddy : Yeah. I think when we talk to our franchisees and obviously when we mentioned this recent refranchising transaction as well, significant discussions around potential growth. And I think every time we actually have these discussions, we're talking about growth potential. The growth pipeline is very clearly seen by our franchisees. And they partner with us very extensively on how it happened that into our growth pipeline.  And so this comes from multiple conversations happening -- that are happening across the organization. They happen with all of our leadership in the organization with Russell, of course. And I'm really confident because I've seen that the level of confidence building since I've come in. So when I came in, in April, I think things were pretty much at the toughest point as they were. But I think every quarter that I've been over here sequentially I've seen an improving sentiment because solutions are being found. I think collectively, we're seeing improvements in performance.  And I think the latest decision that we've actually taken on the national offers has been very well received by our franchisee system, and we're all excited to drive long-term profitability.
Russell Weiner : And I would just add to that. For me, working with Domino's franchisees, is the best part of my job. Next week, we have our franchisees coming in. Annually, we have an economic summit. And so this is something we do every year, and I'm looking forward to seeing them again. And I thought maybe as we get towards the end of the conversation, I would tell you a little bit about what I'm going to be talking to them, how excited I am at what they're doing. So Sandeep talked about sequential improvements. That means Q3 better than Q2 better than Q1. So same-store sales one year and three year. Q2 is better than Q1, Q3 is better than Q2. Service times, they got better in Q2, into Q1, they got better into Q3 than Q2. The gap between the first and fifth quintile is shrinking every quarter. The boost week performance, their service time in the second boost week was better than their service time in the first boost week and they are all in on future boost weeks getting back to how we used to do them prior to the pandemic. They delivered one out of every three pizzas before the pandemic, and they deliver about one out of every three pizzas post. What is new and what they should be congratulated for is we've emerged now as the number one carryout brand. And so from a total pizza market share standpoint, we're up 200 basis points versus three years ago, and that's just an amazing accomplishment.  Maybe one more question?
Operator: Thank you. We do have one last question. Our last question will come the line of Alexander Slagle from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Alexander Slagle : Hey, thanks. Just a follow-up question on the G&A. As you have ratcheted that down the outlook fairly meaningfully through the year and talked about the refranchising impact, but curious if there's a deeper structural change beyond this that can extend past this year? And is it possible we see G&A spend next year ramping less than typical? Or conversely, is there -- are there some timing shifts that might drive more of an increase in '23?
Sandeep Reddy : So Alex, on this, I think I would just go back to what I said previously on G&A. I think the big driver of it was the refranchising transaction where the G&A basically shifts out of the corporate stores into the franchisee system. And I think in terms of how we would look at it, we've always continued to make investments to fuel growth. We will continue to make investments to fuel growth. We -- the growth algorithm is very much intact for the company.  And so I don't expect to have structural reductions in G&A. But at the same time, we just need to be very thoughtful about where we allocate the resources that we're investing in. And that's really more the focus of it than absolute reductions in G&A.
Operator: Thank you. That's all the time we have for Q&A. I'd like to turn the call back over to Russell for any closing remarks.
Russell Weiner : All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining this morning. We appreciate it. And Sandeep and I will look forward to speaking with you in our full year '22 results. Have a great day and a great weekend.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Domino's Pizza Q2 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today to Ryan Goers, VP of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Ryan Goers: Thank you, Dylan, and good morning. Thank you for joining us today for our conversation regarding the results of the second quarter of 2022. Today's call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner; and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy. As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q also applied to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website, actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. I'll request to our coverage analysts, we want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of your questions as time permits. As such we encourage you to ask only one one-part question on this call. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Russell Weiner.
Russell Weiner: Thank you, Ryan, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. As Ritch Allison and I communicated back in April, we expected the second quarter to be challenging. We continue to navigate a difficult labor market in the U.S., especially for delivery drivers, in addition to inflationary pressures, combined with COVID and stimulus fuel sales costs from the prior two years. Our results for the quarter were consistent with the challenges we outlined at that time. However, the strength of our franchisees and team members along with the strategies we're putting into place, make me feel confident that we're on the path to overcome these short-term obstacles, make the Domino's brand and business stronger than ever. Back in May, my team and I gathered with more than 8,000 of our franchisees and team members from around the globe at our 2022 worldwide rally. Due to COVID, we had to cancel our last rally. So it was our first time back together as one global team in four years. We used this time to share best practices, a lot on goals and commit to continue growth that will drive meaningful value creation for all of our stakeholders. The energy, the commitment, passion for the brand and confidence displayed at this year's rally was truly inspiring and reinforces my belief that our best days lie ahead. I can assure you that nobody at Domino's is happy with our recent performance. However, I have tremendous confidence in the team that we have assembled to leverage some of our current successes, address our current pressures and proactively work to mitigate the negative impact of those external factors that we can't control. As always, we will make discipline decisions and we'll focus on doing what is right for our customers, our franchisees and our brand. This approach has served our stakeholders well over many years and I don't see any reason to the verdict from this proven approach. We have high expectations for what we can achieve and we will hold ourselves accountable for meeting and often exceeding those objectives. I plan to provide you with more specific on the strategies and plans we have for the business after our CFO, Sandeep Reddy walk through the results of the quarter. Sandeep?
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, Russell, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I wanted to share some of my initial observations after my first full quarter, as Domino's CFO. I see some exciting opportunities to improve our long-term profitability. First, while we continue to explore options to further optimize our consumer pricing architecture in the United States, it is important to highlight that the average price increase we realize in the second quarter across our U.S. system was nearly 6%. We have successfully pulled many pricing levers, including our standard menu pricing. Our national offers, our local offers and our delivery fees. This has helped us cover some of the cost increases we are incurring in both the food basket and labor market while also ensuring we continue to deliver terrific value to our consumers. Our work continues on right pricing our product while keeping a compelling value proposition for our consumers, with more opportunities to pursue. Second, efficiencies exist in our cost structure, as we seek to ensure that revenues consistently grow faster than expenses. We saw a sequential improvement in the year-over-year contraction of operating [ph] income from 270 basis points in Q1 to 180 basis points in Q2. We need to continue the strength. Third, as a result of the actions we are taking to increase our capacity to meet demand. We realized a sequential improvement in the U.S. same-store sales declines from minus 3.6% in Q1 to minus 2.9% in Q2. Now our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Global retail sales decreased 3% in Q2 2022, as compared to Q2 2021. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 1.5% due to sustained positive store growth momentum over the trading full quarters lapping 17.1% global retail sales growth, excluding FX in Q2 2021. As we have discussed in the past, we believe it remains instructive to look at the cumulative stack of sales across the business, anchored back to 2019 as a pre-COVID baseline and will continue to do so for as long as we believe it is useful in understanding our business performance. Looking at the three-year stack, our Q2 2022 global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact grew nearly 27% versus Q2 2019. Breaking down total global retail sales growth, international retail sales excluding the negative impact of foreign currency grew 3.7% rolling over a prior year increase of 29.5% and are up almost 30% on a three-year stack basis relative to 2019. U.S. retail sales declined 0.6% rolling over a prior year increase of 7.4% and are up almost 27% on a three-year stack basis relative to 2019. Turning to comps. During Q2, same-store sales excluding foreign currency impact for our international business declines 2.2%, rolling over a prior year increase of 13.9% and were up 13% on a three-year stack basis relative to 2019. Order growth was slightly positive during the quarter, demonstrating continued global demand. However, this growth was more than offset by declines in ticket driven by the year-over-year impact of exploration of the 2021 VAT relief in the UK, our largest international market by retail sales. This resulted in a negative comp for the quarter for international versus a slightly positive comp without this unfavorable UK VAT impact. The year-over-year impact of exploration of the 2021 UK VAT relief will continue while we left the reduced rates from 2021 to the rest of year. Same-store sales for our U.S. business declined 2.9% rolling over a prior year increase of 3.5% and were up 16.7% on a three-year stack basis relative to 2019, representing a sequential 5.3 percentage point improvement from Q1 on a three-year stack basis. Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was down 2.5% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 9.2%. We believe the difference in the top line performance in our company-owned stores as compared to our franchise stores continues to be driven by more substantial operational challenges in our company-owned stores that Russell will address later on the call. The estimated impact of fortressing was 0.7 percentage points during the quarter across the U.S. system. This impact will continue to trend lower as our U.S. store base grows. The decline in U.S. same-store sales in Q2 was driven by a decline in order counts, which continued to be pressured by the challenging staffing environment, which had certain operational impacts such as shortened store hours and customer service challenges in many stores, both company-owned and franchise along with tough COVID and stimulus fuel comps from the prior years. The decline in order counts was partially offset by ticket growth, which included nearly 6% in pricing actions I spoke about earlier. We saw a similar trend on a three year stack basis with a 16.7% growth in same-store sales driven by growth and ticket and partially offset by a decline in order count. As we have previously shared, we believe it is instructive to break our U.S. stores into quintiles based on staffing levels, relative to a fully staffed store, to give a sense for the magnitude of the impact of staffing. Looking at Q2 same-store sales. Stores in the top 20% those that are essentially fully staffed on average outperformed stores in the bottom 20% those that are facing the most significant labor shortages by 7 percentage points. This is down sequentially from the 12 percentage point gap we saw in Q1 between the top and bottom quintiles showing improvement in the lower quintile store’s ability to meet consumer demand. Now I’ll share a few thoughts specifically about the Carryout and Delivery businesses. The Carryout business was strong in Q2 with U.S. carryout same-store sales 14.6% positive compared to Q2 2021. On a three year basis, our carryout same-store sales were up 33% versus Q2 2019. The gap between the top and bottom quintiles based on staffing levels remain small during the quarter highlighting both strong consumer demand and the lower cost to serve relative to delivery orders. We are incredibly pleased with our carryout momentum, especially considering carryout as a much larger segment of QSR giving us a significant runway for growth in the future. The Delivery business continued to be more pressured, Q2 delivery same-store sales declined by 11.7% relative to Q2 2021. Looking at the business on a three stack, Q2 delivery same-store sales remain more than 8% above Q2 2019 levels. When we look at the same quintiles relative to the Delivery business, we continue to see a more pronounced difference in performance. We saw an 11 percentage point gap in delivery same-store sales between stores in the top 20% and those in the bottom 20%. While we continue to see a significant gap in performance between the top and bottom quintiles, this does represent a sequential improvement from the 17 percentage point gap we observed in the first quarter. Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 22 net new stores in the U.S. during Q2, consisting of 24 store openings and two closures bringing our U.S. system store count to 6,619 stores at the end of the quarter. With our strong formal economics, we remain bullish on the long-term unit growth potential in the United States and we maintain our conviction that the U.S. can be an 8,000 plus store market for Domino’s. The pace of U.S. store growth may decelerate slightly from the current four quarter runway to 3%, the rest of the year or until the headwinds subside, given some of the continued development, supply chain, staffing and inflationary headwinds. Our International business added 211 net new stores in Q2 comprised of 249 store openings and 38 closures. This brought our current four quarter net store growth rate in international to 9%. When combined with our U.S. store growth, our trading four quarter global net store growth of nearly 7% continues to fall within our two to three year outlook range of 6% to 8%. Turning to revenues and operating income. Total revenues for the second quarter increased approximately $32.7 million or 3.2% from the prior quarter driven by higher supply chain revenues resulting from a 15.2% higher market basket pricing to stores. Our market basket pricing is up approximately 20% on a three year basis now. The increase in supply chain revenues was partially offset by declines in our company-owned stores revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $5.9 million during Q2. Our consolidated operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased by 180 basis points to 16.7% in Q2 from the prior quarter, primarily driven by food basket and labor cost increases. These impacts were partially offset by pricing actions and G&A leverage. Our diluted EPS in Q2 was $2.82 versus $3.06 in Q2 2021 or $3.12 when adjusted for the $0.06 impact of the recapitalization transaction in the prior year. Breaking down the $0.30 decrease in our diluted EPS as compared to our adjusted diluted EPS, our operating results negatively impacted us by $0.14. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.12. Our higher effective tax rate negatively impacted us by $0.14, $0.09 of which was driven by changes in tax impact of stock price compensation. Higher depreciation negatively impacted us by $0.02 cents. Higher net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.02 and a lower dilutive share count driven by share repurchases over the trading 12 months benefited us by $0.14. Although we faced operating headwinds, we continued to generate sizable free cash flow. During the first two quarters of 2022, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $153 million. After deducting for capital expenditures of approximately $33 million, which included investments in our technology initiatives, such as our next-generation point of sale system and investments in our supply chain centers, we generated free cash flow of approximately $121 million. Free cash flow decreased $142 million from the first two quarters of 2021, primarily due the changes in working capital as a result of the timing of payments and recruit liabilities and in receipt to an accounts receivable and lower net income. During the quarter we repurchased and retired approximately 148,000 shares for $50 million at an average price of $337 per share. As of the end of Q2, we had approximately $606 million remaining under our current board authorization for share repurchases. Before I close, we would like to update the guidance we provided in April for 2022. Based on the continuously evolving macroeconomic environment, we now expect the increase in the store food basket within our U.S. system to range from 13% to 15% as compared to 2021 levels and increase from the 10% to 12% we were expecting in April. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates are now expected to have a negative impact of $22 million to $26 million compared to 2021. An increase from the $12 million to $16 million we were expecting to see in April. We anticipate that we will continue to see fluctuations in commodity prices, including wheat and fuel costs, and foreign currency exchange rates resulting from geopolitical risk and the resulting impact on the overall macroeconomic environment. Thank you all for joining the call today, and now I will turn it back to Russell.
Russell Weiner: Thank you, Sandeep. I'm going to start my comments with the U.S. business. The performance during the quarter started slow as we were lapping – fueled comps on a one and two year basis. These dynamics ease throughout the quarter as we move further away from the government payments distributed March of 2021. During the quarter, we continued innovative ways to engage with our consumers through our carryout tips promotions, where we rewarded our carryout customers with a $3 tip good for the purchase of another carryout order within the next week. We also launched our Mind ordering app, which created a fun ordering experience for – into the new season of stranger things, one of the most popular shows on TV and streaming. In addition, the second quarter marked our first full quarter, since we evolved our national offers to include $5.99 mix-and-match for carryout customers and $6.99 for delivery mix-and-match. On the last call, I laid out some of the action plans that we’re taking to meet customers demand, including returning to core hours, utilizing call centers to ease constraints in the stores and bringing back those suite promotions. I'd like to take some time to provide additional color on each of these actions. If you recall out of necessity, many stores have had to flex their hours of operations because of the labor constraint from the staffing challenges and the Omicron surge early in the year. During the first quarter, when we added up all the lost operating hours, we estimate the stores cumulatively closed the equivalent of almost six days across the entire U.S. business. During the second quarter of this number improved a little over four days. The stores primarily flexing hours could be closed during non-peak times. The impact on orders of less than the number of days closed as a percentage of the total days in the quarter, while we and our franchisees continue to make progress on a full returns of all stores to core hours as we start to lap the service disruptions from last year, this metric will become less meaningful as a driver of the year-over-year of sales performance. Another key action is utilizing call centers to take phone orders. This allows team members to focus on making and delivering pizza without having to worry about answering phones, especially during the busiest times in the store. At the end of the quarter, around 40% of our U.S. stores were utilizing call centers in some capacity. As a result, headwinds from unanswered calls were lower than we experienced during the first quarter. The third action is bringing back boost weeks. We promise we would bring back these important customer acquisition and loyalty enrollment activities this summer. And as you saw, we ran our first boost week in more than two years in early June, I am extremely proud of our franchisees, team members and supply chain for executing at a very high level during what was our busiest week of the year. Consumer reaction was strong and we planned to do another boost week by the end of the summer, before we evaluate future cases. Turning now to corporate store performance, our corporate stores continue to lag franchisee performance during the second quarter. As I mentioned during the last call, we are committed to restoring our corporate store's leadership position among the U.S. system of store. As such we have put into place an operations recovery plan with 30, 60 and 90-day milestones. Now, last month we made a leadership change designed to positively impact our corporate store business. Frank Garrido, our Executive Vice President of Operations who also led corporate store before taking on his current role in February of 2020 will have that team report directly to him. So he can more closely assess and address the needs of this business. We will continue to provide updates on the progress of our corporate stores and look forward to them resuming their leadership role among our U.S. system of stores. Now, finally, I'd like to provide an update on our ongoing delivery labor market fee cut. We continue to believe that many of the answers to the labor shortages we are facing are already in our system. We see that our top quintile stores, they can meet the demand and outperform the system. We also saw the gap in performance, which between our top and bottom quintile stores improve during the second quarter. We know from our work that one of the key issues for delivery drivers is flexibility. And for many, this is even more important than compensation. Flexibility includes the ability to work shorter shifts, fewer hours in a week, and sign up for shifts with short lead time. These are the areas where we are continuing to evaluate and evolve our practices. The question remains, can we close the gap in performance and get back to fully meeting demand, utilizing our current delivery model as it has evolved over many decades. Until we've fully answered this question, all options will remain on the table. Now let's turn to international. The international business displayed strong fundamental growth opening over 200 net new stores during the quarter as well as positive order count growth. During the second quarter, 44 of our international markets opened at least one net new store demonstrating the strong demand for Domino’s around the world. As Sandeep mentioned, we had some short term pressures from the UK VAT relief overlaps that drove the comp to go negative in the quarters, snapping our long running streak of consecutive quarters with positive same store sales growth. I remain confident – extremely confident in the long-term growth potential for our international business. Opening more than 1, 000 net stores over the trailing four quarters is an outstanding accomplishment by our team and our international master franchisees. I'll now highlight a few international markets of notes. I'd like to congratulate DPC Dash. DPC Dash, our master franchisee in China for opening their 500th store during the second quarter. Also as you may have seen Dash brands recently made it A-1 filing for a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. We saw strong sales growth in the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia. Also Alamar Foods, our master franchisees across 11 markets in the Middle East and North Africa announced its intention to go public through an IPO on the Saudi Stock Exchange. Other markets have noted with strong growth in the quarter, including India and Mexico, Spain, Turkey and Guatemala. We have a long runaway for growth in the U.S. and around the world in both our delivery and our carryout businesses. We will continue to mitigate challenges within our control and take steps to proactively confront external factors. We can't completely control with strategies and plans to minimize their impact. We're now happy to take some questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. Question on the same store sales in the U.S., your same store sales in the second quarter, as you said accelerated by over 500 basis points first. The first quarter when we look at it on a three year stack basis, so clearly a meaningful improvement in the quarter. Can you just unpack the drivers of this improvement in a little bit more detail and help us understand maybe, how much of this improvement came from improved staffing levels through the quarter versus maybe some other sources of improvement, just so we can understand the underlying health of this improvement in the second quarter? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Good morning, Brian. Thanks for the question. And I think a lot of it is actually in some of the prepared remarks that we went through, but I'll just really try to split it up a little bit for you because the answers are really a sequential acceleration for sure on the carryout business, where we went from 11% increase in the first quarter to 14.6% increase in the second quarter. So definitely that momentum that we saw impacted on three-year stack basis. We went from 24% to 33%, so significant acceleration and strength in the carryout business, very exciting. I think on the delivery business if you look at what happened in the quarter. We were up against much more significant overlap last year. So even though we had 11.7% decline on a three-year stack basis were up 8% compared to the plus 6% that we had last quarter. And so sequentially, a lot of the initiatives that we talked about on the last earnings call started playing in and delivery did improve sequentially. We have more work to do, but we definitely had some progress that we saw in the quarter, so said another way that the sequential improvement of 530 basis points was driven by both carryout and delivery with both making meaningful progress.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
David Palmer: Thanks. First just maybe a two part here, you mentioned customer service issues and that being a drag I wonder what does that look like? I mean, what does the customer experiencing any numbers that describes what that is and how you measure the impact on the business? And then relatably it sounds like you're still in an evaluation phase with regard to other options to alleviate pressure to labor in the delivery sense, could you talk about some of the things that you're most evaluating at this point? Maybe things that are in test right now? Thanks so much.
Russell Weiner: Sure. Thanks and good morning. On the customer service side really at the end of the day, what we like is things have gotten sequentially better in the second quarter over the first quarter. We certainly still have capacity things we're dealing with, but at the end of the day, demand is strong and our ability to serve in that capacity is getting better. To your second question on the evaluation, what I tell you is we are 100% committed to getting this done ourselves. We think the answers to some of the capacity issues lie within the system and until we get though where we need to be, our responsibility is to understand all the options available and that's what we're going to do.
Operator: Thank you. And sir, our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Please go ahead.
David Tarantino: Hi, good morning. I had a question on the carryout versus delivery business, I guess first, if you could maybe give us an update on what the mix of businesses today, given the big changes you've seen in the carryout business. And then I guess, secondly on the carryout business, the strength that you saw in the second quarter was very impressive. And I'm wondering if you could at least offer some thoughts on the sustainability of that or whether you think it was just a great promotion with the offer that you are in there? If you think that this is a more durable layer of sales with new customers or new occasions? Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks, David for the question that's really good one. I think there's – we'll take it in two parts, Russell will cover the second piece, and now let's talk about the carryout versus the delivery dynamics that you asked about. So I think overall, when we look at carryout versus delivery from a mix standpoint, clearly with the comps actually are the acceleration in carryout mix, carry out comps was a delivery declining. The mix is shifting towards carryout. We typically update only at the end of the each year. And I think we will give you a further update at the end of the year because things are moving around quite a bit. But what we are really thrilled about is the momentum on the carryout business, because as we said in the prepared remarks it's an accelerating trend on a business that is a significantly larger business and in the QSR space. So there's a lot of runway for growth for us on that business. And then Russell, do you want to talk about the sustainability?
Russell Weiner: Yeah. Thanks David. We have seen sustainability and continuing momentum and convenient growth in carryout not just over the last three years, but over last decade or so, since we decided to really focusing on that area. One of the reasons that's so important for us is, it's very incremental to delivery. We see maybe 15% or so overlap between carryout occasions and delivery occasions. Interestingly enough, the carryout sourcing of buy-in we have is lesser from pizza on a percentage basis and more so from other QSR. So enables us to not only grow in the larger carryout pizza segment, but the larger carryout QSR segment.
Operator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Brian Mullan from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Mullan: Hey, thank you. Just question related to domestic development. As you think about restoring the pace of growth domestic growth back up to that 45 to 5% rate. What are the most important factors for investors to consider right now in regards to the pipeline for next year? Do you think you can get back to that pace in 2023, or is this going to be a little bit of a longer path to the pre-COVID run rate in your view? And if it's a little longer, what are kind of the key gating factors right now?
Sandeep Reddy: So Brian, thanks for the question. I think when we look at the U.S. potential, I think Russell has touched on something really important with the carryout momentum and the acceleration that we are seeing there and the opportunities that we have in terms of the QSR space and how we can actually penetrate into that. So then I'm going to actually go back to what we've talked about previously as our goal for the U.S. of 8,000 stores relative to that is 6,619 stores already. So the gap is not massive. And as we've talked about this year from the beginning, I think on the last call itself, Rich mentioned that we were probably going to see some headwinds basically in terms of the space of development because of supply chain problems, just the fishery environment, et cetera. This continues to be the factor. And I think even though we are at a trailing 12 months of 3%, we see some potential deceleration relative to that in the short term, until all of these headwinds subside, doesn't change the long term trajectory of where we can take this, but I think we need these headwinds to subside before we can accelerate. And I think from our franchisees, they have a really fantastic industry meeting profitability. Their returns are very compelling. They average three years in terms of cash on cash payback. And they see the potential part to future growth. So we are really confident that the 8,000 unit objective is definitely very achievable and especially for the momentum that we are saying on the carryout business if we actually have more upside without focusing strategy, and that actually, that gives us a lot of upside in runway in terms of development.
Operator: Thank you. And I show our next question – our next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
John Glass: Hi, thanks very much. Why did you run a boost week during a time when you had [indiscernible] driver constraints still? I mean, I would think that would risk disappointment of customers. Was that a signal that toward the end of the quarter, you just were getting better? I mean, maybe what was – when you still have capacity constraints and already too much demand to deal with?
Russell Weiner: I think John for the question I just also want to reiterate that success of that boost week, it was the biggest week for us for the year and on the carryout side, it was our biggest week in history. And so when you think about a boost week, it's not just about the delivery business, it's also about the carryout business and we did an incredible job doing it there. Look, we have the best franchisees in the business and we gave them enough time and our supply chain enough time to prepare for this thing. We were ready. I think they're also right. It is showing that we're making some of the things that we're doing, improving, Sandeep talked about the sequential decline in the difference between our top and bottom staff quintile. So we wouldn't have done this if we didn't think we could handle it. And I think our system did a great job.
John Glass: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from Morgan Stanley[ph]. Please go ahead.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you from JP Morgan. I think I heard in your prepared remarks that the U.S. would see, I guess a down tick in development for the next 12 months relative to this last 12 months. Could you just clarify that? I heard that, and then secondly, if you're willing to give that I guess, soft guidance for the U.S., I mean, can you do something similar on international, especially with the negative same store sales, you know the second quarter comps very often a leading indicator of development. Should we expect the next 12 months of international to be same higher or less than what the thousand or so stores that you hit in the previous 12 months. Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Thanks John for the question. So I think what you did here on the prepared remarks was, yes, we expect to see a slowing down of the trailing 12 months unit growth, definitely through the balance of the year and as long as we see the headwind. So we didn't say 12 months, but we said until the headwinds is subside. But I think in the international business, we're super excited because it's a plus 9% trailing 12 months growth. And that's very, very solid. And I think if you look at the quarter and you unpack it, it was really driven by this UK VAT impact and the overlaps. And in fact, if you include, basically it's been a positive comp for the international division. And so what I would say is look at the three-year stacks on international. It's 13%, very healthy. And we are very confident with that. And so I think we are very comfortable with the range that we provided the 6% to 8% on average across the global footprint of growth and international at 9%. That sounds we've demonstrated that with all these comps, we've been able to deliver very strong unit development. And we see no reason for that to change.
Russell Weiner: Yes, I think to add to Sandeep’s points, just a little context on the development side. First, I'm just so proud of our system. If you look back at the last five years and you look both in the pizza industry and the QSR industry, as far as actual number of net stores and percentage, Domino's is a leader in that, and still with these numbers, we're going to continue to be a leader. So just some context there, but also I think what that tells me is while we continue to lead in development, our franchisees are doing exactly what they need to do, which is balancing the capacity needs between the current stores they have and stores they need to open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on an earlier question, U.S. same-store sales accelerated by an impressive, I think you said 530 basis points from 1Q to 2Q on a three-year basis. I know you guys called out 6% price in 2Q and first, it's very helpful. Thank you for disclosing that. But we estimate nearly 5% price was taken at the end of 1Q. Back when the mix and match platform for delivery orders was raised from 5.99 to 6.99. We know the 10-Q called out a higher number of items per order in addition to that higher pricing at the end of 1Q. So I'm curious if you can speak to the sequential change in traffic from 1Q to 2Q on a three year basis that our math suggests was perhaps flat, perhaps deteriorated amid some encouraging updates that you guys shared on staffing and carryout.
Sandeep Reddy: A lot to unpack in the question itself so, but I'd say overall, let's start with pricing. And our pricing, we have multiple levers on pricing. A mix and match is one of them and as part of the national offer, but I think there's menu pricing, which I think would have been activated well before any of the changes on national offer that we talked about. There's the national offer updates that were made in the first quarter. And then I think local pricing is actually an option that the franchisees have at their disposal and delivery fees are something that has been activated all the time, with the franchisees. So all of those elements would have gone into pricing effectively, both in the first quarter is whether the second quarter and it's not just national pricing. So the average of all of that was about 6% in the second quarter. So that's one thing I would actually take away from that. And so I think when we look at pricing and ticket versus order count. What we had in the second quarter was order count was definitely down. And I think when you look at the pressure that we actually faced, the pressure was really significantly more on the delivery side. And then when I look at the overall offset, we saw ticket offsetting order count declines to end up with the minus 2.9% that we saw in the quarter. Even though, we had these headwinds, I think sequentially same-store sales did accelerate to the point that we made. And I think we are very happy because from a sequential standpoint, it's clear that the actions that we are taking to address the issues in terms of capacity to serve on the delivery business are helping us. And we are seeing the demand coming through and that's why we saw the acceleration because it's reflected both in the order count as well as the ticket and the combination of those. So happy with what we're seeing, but I think as we go through the subsequent quarters, we'll have more information on all the drivers that we’re talking about all.
Andrew Charles: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jared Garber: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to revisit the U.S. unit growth commentary. I know it's been asked a couple times, but if we look back historically the unit growth annually has certainly continued to decelerate. Even if we look back to several years ago into the 2018 or 2019 timeframe so, can you just help us understand what gives you the confidence that pace of development can reaccelerate, maybe it's a 2024 kind of timeframe, given some of the headwinds you talked about, maybe there's a way to frame what the pipeline of demand looks like from franchisees. And then as a follow-up, just as we think about the carryout opportunity, is that changing how the discussions are going with franchisees, maybe in terms of site location, making those a little bit more accessible to consumers versus I think the base delivery business is one that doesn't necessarily need to be main and main to drive that delivery business, but that may change to carryout as a greater focus going forward. Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: So Jared, thanks for the question. There's two pretty significant components in that. So let me start with a second and I'm going to go to the first, because from a carryout momentum standpoint, I think Russell talked about it earlier in one of the previous answers as well. The carryout business and the delivery business are two separate businesses. What we are seeing is very significant acceleration on the carryout business, which is very encouraging for us because we basically are able to penetrate a new market and I think a much – a significantly larger market in addition to the delivery business. The delivery business, one in three pizzas like Russell told last time is delivered by us. So we have a very strong position in that. So the thesis in terms of unit development is based on both businesses being fulfilled from the box and the potential that we have continues to be very strong. If anything, this actually gives us even more runway in terms of unit development versus what was there before, but in no way, is this a trade between carryout and delivery. They're two separate businesses. The carryout should be incremental to the delivery business and we are doing all the work that we're doing on the delivery business. So in terms of U.S. unit growth and the deceleration that's been happening, there's a few puts and takes that are going on over there. I think it's a few years ago, we had the reclass the Hawaii and some of the market that's basically out of the United States into – out of international into the United States, which helped the United States. That was the one year it picked about 5%. But other than that, it's been in the flourish range, pre-pandemic. And I think the trailing 12 months of three is more reflective of some of the headwinds that we've been seeing since the pandemic started in terms of supply chain, economic factors, including staffing. So overall, I think once we get past these headwinds, there's no reason we can't get to a normalized unit development growth, especially given the drivers that just talked about, this carryout business, being an incremental opportunity that we seem to be seeing, gathering steam as we go along and delivery business being what the baseline thesis was about anything. So that's answering both of your questions and I hopefully give you enough information on that.
Russell Weiner: Yes, Sandeep, I think I would just add, there is every incentive for our franchisees to continue to build, obviously the EBITDA per store is still a very strong place. The returns on a new store still in a very strong place, when we look at the top quintile stores on delivery, the ones that are really doing well, those are the ones that have fortress the most. And so what happens when you're fortress is you get closer to your customers, getting closer to your customers from a delivery perspective, during a capacity constrained, labor constrained environment helps delivery. We also know the majority of the carryout volume, the overwhelming majority of the carryout volume when you open up a new store is incremental. So there's every incentive financially and also in helping us deal with capacity to go ahead and continue to do that.
Jared Garber: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Andrew Strelzik: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on comments indeed, that you made in your prepared remarks about after the first full quarter, excuse me, seeing a lot of efficiency opportunities. Can you elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing, maybe where the biggest opportunities are and the timeline to which we might see that start to come through the P&L? Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. And so I think the opportunities are multifaceted, right. So I think we talked about three different components. On the first one, we talked about the consumer pricing architecture and I think there, it's really about looking at given the different cost measures that we are dealing with. How do we make sure that we deliver terrific value to the consumer, but at the same time, taking up price where it makes sense, and it still delivers that value to the consumer. And so we'll keep on looking at that as time goes along. The second was, just making sure that operating revenues are going faster than – revenues are going faster than expenses. And from an operating margin standpoint, we did see some sequential improvement. We went from a 270 basis points decline in Q1 to 180 basis points decline in Q2. So that includes some G&A discipline as well, that we talked about. And you saw that we lowered our guidance for the year on G&A based on that. And it’s really about prioritizing as to expenses to make sure that we’re making investments and opportunities that are driving near-term growth, and actually continuing to invest in critical areas like technology and supply chain, which we have over the years, will keep doing that. But it’s that prioritization that is critical. But the most important thing honestly, is the third one that I talked about, which is how do we accelerate our capacity to serve the demand that we see. And that’s what Russell talked about earlier in the call. And I think that’s been very encouraging to see the progress that we’ve actually made in the last quarter. We continue to work on similar drivers in the coming quarters as well. So as much as we can make progress on that I think we’ll be able to get to much better place.
Russell Weiner: Yes, I would just add to, Sandeep talk about efficiency, answers your question from a financial standpoint. I would maybe do that also to add some color on the operations standpoint. Essentially on the delivery side efficiency is what we need to drive. Simplification is what we need to drive. So our folks in stores are focused on the most added value parts of their jobs. And if you think about a couple of the programs we talked about last quarter and we continue to give some input on here. For example, one of those things is taking calls out of the store. We ended last quarter with 29% of our stores on call center. We ended this quarter at 43%. Our operation simplification project there are many of them, one we spoke about last time, which is eliminating multiple box folding times within a store, which doesn’t sound like a lot. It actually adds up to 40 hours a store a week. And that program is now in 90% of our stores around the country. So efficiency on the operations standpoint leads to unlock capacity, and then that flows down to the financial.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS. Please go ahead.
Dennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for the question. Appreciate all of the commentary on your efforts to address the driver staffing challenges and sort of the – a lot of the metrics that you provided as a result there. Just wondering if you could speak a bit more to sort of where you are on the journey to address the challenges? Is the plan to address the driver situation internally? Is that finalized or are you still kind of tinkering with different opportunities internally to address that? And I guess really the question is, if you could kind of frame up what inning you think you’re in with respect to addressing those challenges internally, maybe before you look at other options, if there’s a way to frame that up? Thank you.
Russell Weiner: I don’t know about innings, Dennis, it’s the All-Star break, although my Yankees, Mr. Stanton won the MVP. So, we’re pretty happy there. We are a work in progress brand and we are just – we are never going to be satisfied with our ability to fulfil capacity until we can fulfil every single order. That is coming our way. So in that case, we will never be in the final three innings as far as I’m concerned because we can always get better. We did say, we do think and our first priority is try to fulfil this stuff internally. We have a lot of stores who are doing that. A lot of franchisees are doing that. We are 100% committed to getting this done ourselves and we’re seeing improvements. But until we get where we need to be, we will continue to explore all options. But our big focus there is for us to be able to serve our own customers.
Dennis Geiger: Thank you very much. Go Yankees.
Operator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Lauren Silberman: Thanks for the question. I had one on the boost week. So one was run in early June, and I think you talked about plans to do another one by the end of the summer, which I believe is more frequent than historical. So can you talk about how you’re thinking about the cadence of boost week promotions from here? And is there any read through, an underlying demand? Or do you see this more of a catch up from not running promotions over the last couple of years? Just trying to understand how that all plays out?
Russell Weiner: Yes. No, I mean, if you look historically we ran, call it three to four boost weeks a year. Obviously we are planning one at a time. And so we want to work with our franchisees. Obviously everyone thought the last one went well or see how the next one goes. And we will announce anything further after that happens. So nothing more than just one step at a time, one pizza at a time.
Operator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Chris Carril from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Chris Carril: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. And thanks for the detail and thoughts on pricing so far. Following up on those earlier comments though, can you tell us how you’re thinking about pricing power today? Do you see greater risk to any potential further pricing actions given that there is more pressure on the consumer today? Or do you see yourself as well positioned? Should you pull that pricing lever if necessary?
Sandeep Reddy: So Chris, it’s a great question. And I think it really ties back to what I talked about in the prepared marks, which is in the end pricing in itself is fine, but it’s about making sure there’s a terrific value to the consumer. And that really is the key threshold for us. And so we continue to do testing. And by the way, the testing’s been done for the last decade, not just the last quarter. And that’s a process that is always going on inside the company. And look, when the macroeconomic situation is as volatile as it is, things keep on shifting and we continue to do consumer testing to ensure based on the shifting sense, what makes sense and what doesn’t make sense. We’re pretty clear that there is definitely a decreasing cost environment. So there’s a balance between making sure that terrific value is being delivered to the consumer. And then making sure that from a profitability standpoint, our franchisees are able to make the profits on their stores to deliver the paybacks they need from a long-term perspective. And we and our franchise partners basically look at it from a long-term perspective because most of them have been with us for decades or a number of years and find long-term commitments with us. And it’s a shared journey. So we work on it together with them. And I think there’s – that thoughtfulness will continue to go into what we do.
Russell Weiner: Yes, I’d just add to that to Sandeep’s point on balance. The balance for us as we go into this quantitative testing, like he said, we’ve done this over a decade is essentially to balance how do we optimize [Audio Dip] EBITDA, but also how do we optimize value to the customer? And all of those inputs help us get to where we want to be. We know at the end of the day though, order counts are much more correlated to profitability than tickets. So it’s about driving order counts. When we talk about the macro environment, to me, I started at Domino’s right in the middle of a recession back 14 years ago. This is a category where for folks who want to continue to eat out when times are tough, they will maybe down switch from a sit down or what have you into pizza. So we actually think our concept, our business is strong as we maybe go through more difficult times.
Chris Carril: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Mr. Jon Tower from Citi. Please proceed with your question.
Jon Tower: Hello?
Operator: Mr. Tower, your line is open.
Jon Tower: There we go. Sorry, you cut out for a minute there. Yes. I appreciate you taking the question. First, a clarification and then a question. I’m curious if you could clarify or at least explain perhaps the check differences in the Carryout business versus the Delivery business and what that might mean for your same-store sales just in a normalized environment? And then I guess the question is, you did the Stranger Things promotion in this quarter, and I believe it’s the first time since I won’t say Batman in 2008, but you’ve done anything with really any other brand at least in the TV or streaming businesses. So I’m curious to know if this is a one-off or if you believe this is something that could persist with other TV shows or whatever in the future?
Sandeep Reddy: Yes. So Jon, I’ll go through the clarification question and then Russell will definitely answer the question on the Stranger Things question that you have. So I think from a check different standpoint, there are always I think between the delivery fee and other components of the cost to serve, the delivery ticket tends to be higher than the carryout ticket. There’s a few other dynamics in terms of some of the natural offer changes that we made as well that go into it. But that is pretty much what we would say. It is a higher ticket than carryout. But I think it also is pretty obvious when you look at the relative trends of delivery versus carryout. Carryout had a 14.6% same-store sales increase in the quarter, delivery was down 11.7% and comps were down minus 2.9%. So you can actually make the conclusion from that.
Russell Weiner: Yes. And on Stranger Things, I just – you have an amazing memory. My first day, I remember looking at the Batman box, wow, that’s pretty amazing. You’re right though, interestingly enough, we have not done a tie in, in a big way since then. And that’s because, I believe – we believe that we really don’t have any interest in getting lost in a laundry list of brand high. And most of the time nowadays, whether it’s with sports or with movies or what have you, that’s what it is. At the end of the day, I’m not sure if anyone knows what brand is associated with what. I think you just get lost there. And I think that was one of the reasons why this promotion was so strong because we don’t do it a lot. And Netflix, and particularly the Stranger Things property, they don’t do that a lot. And so when two brands that are really strong brands in and of itself without being borrowed equities come together and do something like this is so powerful. And so, yes, an opportunity like this comes around, again, you can see us do this, but our logo will not be paved at the bottom of a dozen others in a partnership.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I’d like to turn the call back to Russell Weiner, CEO for closing remarks.
Russell Weiner: Hey, thanks so much everybody for joining the call this morning. Sandeep and I look forward to speaking with you in October to discuss our third quarter 2022 results. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day and welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Domino's Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Jenny Fouracre. You may begin.
Jenny Fouracre: Thank you for joining us today for our conversation regarding the results for the first quarter of 2022. Today's call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Ritch Allison; and from our new CFO, Sandeep Reddy; and incoming CEO, Russell Weiner. As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask that all members of the media and others be in listen-only mode. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition please refer to the earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. Our request from our coverage analysts, we would like to accommodate as many of you as time permits. So we encourage you to ask only one part question on the call. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ritch Allison.
Ritch Allison: Thank you Jenny and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Before getting into the details of the first quarter, I would like to publicly welcome our new CFO, Sandeep Reddy to the Domino's leadership team. Sandeep officially joined us on April 1st and we are thrilled to have found such an accomplished finance leader. You will hear from Sandeep in a few minutes. You'll also hear from Russell Weiner on today's call. Russell will officially step into the CEO role three days from now on May 1st. With Russell and Sandeep in place alongside our outstanding leadership team I have enormous confidence in the future of this company and of our great brand. Let's now turn our attention to the first quarter. As you saw in our release this morning, Q1 was a challenging quarter particularly on the top line for our US business. We got off to a slow start in January due to the Omicron surge, which impacted our stores and supply chain centers, further limiting our capacity to serve customer demand particularly in the delivery channel. After a return to modestly positive US same-store sales in February, we turned negative again as we began to overlap the impact of the 2021 federal government stimulus in March and have continued to face that overlap in April. While we saw momentum continuing to build in Q1 in our US carryout business and in particular digital carryout, we are disappointed in our Q1 delivery results and still have a lot of work to do to restore growth in that important channel. I will also acknowledge that we are not satisfied with the sales or the margin performance in our corporate store business in the first quarter. Our team is fast at work on a comprehensive assessment and recovery plan to restore that business to the leadership role in our US system that we expected to play. Consistent with our communications during our prior earnings call, we faced significant inflationary cost increases across the business in Q1. Those cost pressures combined with the deleveraging from the decline in US same-store sales resulted in earnings falling short of our high expectations for the business. While the quarter was certainly challenged, we also saw the solid foundation of the Domino's brand and business model on display as evidenced by our robust global store growth that continues to demonstrate the strength of the Domino's operating model along with our franchisees' ongoing commitment to investing in growth. During the quarter, we reached another significant milestone with the opening of our 19,000th global store. We have action plans in place that are designed to address the issues in our US business as well as other initiatives that we are developing. But that work will take some time. And we believe that we will continue to face pressure both on the top line for our US business and on our bottom line earnings over the next few quarters. While we remain very optimistic about our ability to drive long-term profitable growth in the near-term 2022 is shaping up to be a challenging year. Now with that as a backdrop, I'll share a few additional observations on the US business, followed by a brief review of our international performance. We have completed our analysis of U.S. franchisee P&Ls from 2021 and are pleased to share that our average estimated 2021, US franchisee store level EBITDA came in at $174,000. With our strong four-wall economics we remain bullish on the long-term unit growth potential in the US. And we maintain our conviction that the US can be an 8,000-plus store market for Domino's. But we believe it may take some time to accelerate the pace of US store growth beyond the current four-quarter run rate, given some of the continued development, supply chain staffing and inflationary headwinds, we expect to continue to see in the quarters ahead. Staffing challenges continued during Q1 resulting in reduced operating hours and other service-related challenges in many stores across the US business. To give you a sense for the magnitude, when we add up all the lost operating hours during the first quarter, US stores were cumulatively closed the equivalent of almost six days across the entire US business. As I shared last quarter, we believe it is instructive to break our US stores into quintiles based on staffing levels relative to an essentially fully staffed store. When we compare sales performance across the quintiles in the first quarter, it gives us a sense for the magnitude of the impact that staffing continues to have on our US business. Looking at Q1 same-store sales, stores in the top 20% those that are essentially or close to fully staffed on average, outperformed stores in the bottom 20%, those that are facing the most significant labor shortages by 12 percentage points. When we look across the US business, we continue to believe that consumer demand for Domino's remains very strong across the country. It is our current capacity to serve that strong demand, particularly for delivery customers that has continued to be our greatest near-term challenge. Now, I'll share a few thoughts specifically about the carryout and delivery businesses. The carryout business was very strong in Q1 with US carryout same-store sales 11.3% positive compared to Q1 2021, driven by both ticket and order growth. On a three-year basis, our carryout same-store sales were up over 24% versus Q1 2019. As of January 31, our $7.99 national carryout offer is now available online only. This supports a balanced approach of bringing value and a great experience to our customers online and is aligned with our goals of growing the digital carryout business and enhancing the profitability of our carryout orders. Online carryout orders generate a higher ticket and require a lower cost to serve than phone carryout orders, in addition to driving digital engagement and the opportunity to add members to our loyalty program. Thus far, we are very pleased with the initial results in our carryout business with positive impacts on order counts, ticket, store-level margins and in particular digital penetration. During the quarter, we began a strategic campaign to support a transition to online carryout for our customers by offering a $3 tip for each online carryout order. This approach also aims to drive repeat purchases as the tip comes in the form of a coupon that the customer can use on their next order, which must be used the week after the initial purchase. Tying back to my comments earlier around the staffing quintiles, it's useful to note that we saw almost no difference in carryout same-store sales performance across the quintiles in the first quarter. We believe the relatively low labor intensity associated with carryout has largely insulated this business from the staffing challenges we see impacting delivery. Turning now to the delivery business. Q1 delivery same-store sales declined by 10.7% relative to Q1, 2021, driven by order count declines offset in part by higher ticket. Looking at the business on a three-year stack, Q1 delivery same-store sales remained almost 6% above Q1 2019 levels. When we look at the same quintiles relative to the delivery business, we see the stark impact that staffing had during the first quarter. We saw a 17 percentage point gap in delivery same-store sales between stores in the top 20% and those in the bottom 20%. It is this disparity in delivery performance that is driving the overall contrast in performance across our US business. The gap between our top performers and our bottom performers has widened over the past year and we are keenly focused on lifting up the underperforming stores. On March 14, we evolved our long-running $5.99 mix-and-match offer for the first time in over 12 years. Our delivery mix-and-match offer is now $6.99 each for any two or more items on the mix-and-match menu. We believe that $6.99 is still a great relative value for our delivery customers, offering variety, great taste and a competitive price, while also reflecting the increased costs inherent in a delivery order. This approach can allow our franchisees to achieve balanced growth across ticket and orders, which is key to driving profitable long-term growth for their businesses. We are also bringing more value to our customers by adding three great products to the mix-and-match menu: 32-piece Parmesan bread bites, 6-piece wings and 3-piece chocolate lava cakes. Customers can now have even more variety – with more than a dozen items to choose from as they assemble their meals. We made these changes in part to manage through the significant cost inflation facing the business. And we did it using the same balanced approach, we have successfully executed over the last decade by offering great value to our customers while giving our franchisees the tools to profitably grow their businesses over the long term. As we just implemented these changes to mix-and-match on March 14, the new offers were only in place for two weeks of the first quarter. It is still very early. But so far results are fairly consistent with our expectations. Russell will be able to share more with you on the Q2 call in July. I'll turn now to our international business. It was another strong quarter of performance for our international business. I'm pleased to report that this was our 113th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth in our international business. We are also encouraged that growth during the quarter was driven by a mix of ticket and order count increases as franchisees continue to provide great value to their customers globally. A clear highlight for the quarter was the outstanding store growth momentum that continued to build across our international business. When combined with our US store growth our trailing four quarter global net store growth of 7% aligns squarely within our two to three year outlook range of 6% to 8%. 40 international markets opened at least one new store during the first quarter, demonstrating the broad and balanced growth across the business. I'll now highlight a few international markets of note. India once again led our international markets in store growth and opened their 1500th store during the quarter. This was accompanied by a continued same-store sales growth. We also continue to see strong sales and store growth from China. And I'd like to congratulate Alamar Foods our master franchisee across 11 markets in the Middle East and North Africa on the opening of their 500th store during the first quarter. Other markets of note with strong growth in the quarter included Mexico, Spain, Turkey, Taiwan, Iceland and Guatemala. Our master franchisees across the globe continue to show resilience and a strong belief in the future of the Domino's brand in their markets. The combination of our global brand and systems with their local expertise gives me great confidence in both the long- and short-term growth prospects in international. And with nearly 96% of the global population and 75% of the world's GDP residing outside the US we are just getting started. I'll turn it over now to Sandeep, who will take you through the details of the quarter. And after that Russell will share his views on the road ahead and the actions we and our franchisees are taking to drive growth in the US business. Sandeep, over to you.
Sandeep Reddy: Thank you, Rich and good morning to everyone on the call. I'm thrilled to now be a part of the Domino's team. Having had the privilege of working with many great brands over my career, this opportunity to work with such an iconic global brand with enormous growth potential is very exciting to me. I look forward to partnering with Russell and the leadership team, as we craft the road map to continued value creation. To start with, I would like to comment on one of my initial observations in the past few weeks, as I start to learn the business. Given the softness in comparable sales trends in the U.S. and the resulting contraction of operating income as a percentage of sales in the first quarter, we expect margins for the rest of 2022 to be pressured. However, we are already actively working on several initiatives, to drive improved profitability. These include, number one, exploring further optimization of our consumer pricing architecture in the United States. Specifically, this covers our many levers of pricing which includes our standard menu pricing, national offers, local offers and delivery fees to enable both our company-owned and franchisee stores to better cover the cost increases we are facing in both the food basket and labor market. Number two, efficiencies in our cost structure as we seek to ensure that revenues consistently grow faster than expenses. Number three, actions to accelerate our capacity to service the demand we see and generate incremental sales growth. Once implemented, we expect the initiatives I just covered to enable annual operating income margins to recover to pre-pandemic levels post 2022, I will now review our financial results for the quarter in more detail. Global retail sales increased 0.3% in Q1 2022 as compared to Q1 2021. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 3.6% due to sustained positive momentum in our international business, lapping 14% growth in Q1 2021. As we've discussed in the past, we believe it remains instructive to look at the cumulative stack of sales across the business, anchored back to 2019, as a pre-COVID baseline. And we'll continue to do so for as long as we believe it is useful in understanding our business performance. Looking at the three-year stack our Q1 2022 global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact grew 23.5% versus 2019. Breaking down total global retail sales growth, international retail sales excluding the negative impact of foreign currency grew 8.4%, rolling over a prior year increase of 12.8% and are up 28% on a three-year stack basis relative to 2019. U.S. retail sales declined 1.4%, rolling over a prior year increase of 15.3% and are up 18.8% on a three-year stack basis relative to 2019. Turning to comps, during Q1 same-store sales for our international business grew 1.2%, rolling over a prior increase of 11.8% and were up 14.5% on a three-year stack basis relative to 2019. The international comp in the quarter was driven by both ticket and order count growth. Same-store sales for our U.S. business declined 3.6%, rolling over a prior year increase of 13.4% and were up 11.4% on a three-year stack basis relative to 2019. Breaking down the U.S. comp our franchise business was down 3.2% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 10.5%. We believe the difference in the top line performance in our company-owned stores as compared to our franchise stores, continues to be driven by more substantial operational challenges combined with more conservative price increases as compared to our franchise stores. The decline in US same-store sales in Q1 was driven by a decline in order counts, which were pressured by the very challenging staffing environment which had certain operational impacts such as shortened store hours and customer service challenges in many stores, both company-owned and franchised. The decline in order counts was partially offset by ticket growth, resulting from higher menu prices, as well as more items per transaction and increases to our average delivery fee. Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 37 net stores in the United States during Q1, consisting of 40 store openings and three closures. We've also completed the purchase of 23 franchise stores in the Detroit DMA during Q1, bringing our total company-owned store count to 400 as of the end of the quarter. The purchase of these stores allowed us to consolidate the market along with higher-performing franchisees and should unlock growth in the Detroit DMA. We believe there will be some markets where corporate stores can unlock growth and others where franchisees can optimize the market, as was the case with the sale of our New York corporate stores to franchise partners in 2019. We believe leveraging our corporate portfolio to unlock growth will be an important strategic use or source of capital in the United States going forward. Our international business added 176 net stores in Q1, comprised of 217 store openings and 41 closures. More than half of the closures were in Brazil, where our master franchisee remains highly committed to the Domino's brand, while making strategic decisions to get out of some underperforming locations to focus resources and grow stores in other areas. This brought our net global store openings in the quarter to 213. Turning to revenues and operating income. Total revenues for the first quarter increased approximately $27.5 million or 2.8% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher supply chain revenues, resulting from higher market basket pricing to stores. This increase was partially offset by declines in our company-owned stores and US franchise revenues, due to the decline in retail sales I mentioned earlier. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $4.3 million during Q1. Our consolidated operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased by 270 basis points to 16.3% in Q1 from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by food basket and labor increases in excess of pricing increases, as well as G&A deleverage due to the decline in same-store sales in our US business. Our diluted EPS in Q1 was $2.50 versus $3 in the prior quarter. Breaking down that $0.50 decrease in our diluted EPS, our operating results negatively impacted us by $0.36. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.08. The gain on our investment in Dash in Q1 of last year negatively impacted us by $0.05. Our higher effective tax rate negatively impacted us by $0.04. Higher net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.15. And a lower diluted share count, driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months, benefited us by $0.18. Although, we faced operating headwinds in Q1, we continue to generate sizable free cash flow. During Q1, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $79 million. After deducting for capital expenditures of approximately $12 million, which included investments in our technology initiatives such as our next-generation point-of-sale system and investments in our supply chain centers, we generated free cash flow of approximately $66 million. We invested $6.8 million in purchases of franchise operations in our Detroit DMA. We repurchased and retired approximately 101,000 shares for $47.7 million or an average price of $473 per share. As of the end of Q1, we had approximately $656 million remaining under our current Board authorization for share repurchases. And subsequent to the end of the first quarter we also returned $40 million to our shareholders in the form of a $1.10 per share quarterly dividend payment. In addition, we would like to update the guidance we provided in March for 2022. Based on the continuously evolving inflationary environment, we now expect the increase in the store food basket within our US system to range from 10% to 12% as compared to 2021 levels. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates are now expected to have a negative impact of $12 million to $16 million compared to 2021. We anticipate that we will continue to see fluctuations in commodity prices including wheat and fuel costs and foreign currency exchange rates resulting from geopolitical risk and the impact on the overall macroeconomic environment. G&A is now expected to range from $420 million to $428 million as we cancel or delay some of the investments originally planned for 2022 and prioritize those projects we believe will be more near-term drivers of growth. CapEx is not expected to change from the $120 million projection we provided in March. Finally, while our global retail sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency in 2022 will likely drop below the low end of our 6% to 10%, two year to three year outlook, we are confident that the long-term growth algorithm is still very much intact and we expect to recover back to that range starting in 2023. Our practice has been to not comment on short-term sales trends in the business and we do not plan to make a habit of doing so. However, based on the very unusual and volatile operating environment, we and others are experiencing, we are making an exception in this case. On future investor calls, plan on not sticking with our two year to three year outlook as the best indicator of our expected global retail sales trends. Thank you all for joining the call today. And now I will turn it over to Russell. 
Russell Weiner: Thank you, Sandeep and good morning, everybody. I want to start-off by thanking our franchisees and their teams for continuing to work incredibly hard to serve their communities during the pandemic. Domino's franchisees are the best operators in the business delivering around one out of every three pizzas in this country every day. COVID and Omicron in particular required that they balance this volume with customer service and team member workload. And we were faced with the same situation in many of our corporate stores. While none of us were satisfied with US sales in Q1, I am confident in our ability to get back to the growth levels we and our franchisees expect. As indicated by our carryout performance and the strength of our business in stores that were less constrained by labor shortages, we believe the demand for Domino's remains strong. Our focus now is on addressing the capacity constraints that have impacted our ability to fulfill this demand. Those constraints have led to demand shaping activity across the US business things like reducing store hours, not answering phones and restricting online orders. These bottlenecks are largely in our and our franchisees' control. And as we distance ourselves from the peak of Omicron's impact, we're addressing them together with our franchisees. First, we'll be returning to our core standard operating hours. Knowing the last thing our franchisees want is to be closed, we're working with them closely to return to standard hours. This will be monitored along with online ordering uptime. Second, we have worked with third-party call center providers to facilitate and add capacity that will allow our stores to utilize call centers to take phone orders when necessary. This will allow stores to focus on production and delivery when they're short staffed during peak hours. By the middle of May, we believe between 2,500 and 3,000 stores will be leveraging call centers in some capacity. That number can grow depending on our needs. Our corporate stores will be testing phone center options as part of this process, so we can understand the impact on operations, on store team members, customer service and the P&L. Third boost weeks will return this summer and we expect they will continue moving forward in the cadence similar to our pre-COVID practices. Boost weeks are key to building our business. They drive customer acquisition and grow our loyalty program. Now, while these actions will begin to take effect in Q2, we know from the quintile analysis that stores need to solve for different levels of staffing challenges. So, it will take some time for our entire US system to get back to pre-Omicron levels of staffing. Additionally we're facing two-year same-store sales overlaps of 19.6% in Q2. As such we expect Q2 to be another quarter where same-store sales will continue to be pressured. Next, I'd like to talk about our corporate stores. We are disappointed in the results of that business. As we've said in prior calls, our current mix of corporate stores, they are concentrated in areas more impacted by staffing shortages. That said when adjusting for uncontrollables these stores have underperformed similar stores owned by our franchisees. This has not been the case historically and the gap is being addressed by our leaders of that business. They are already several weeks into operations recovery plan with 30, 60, and 90-day milestones. While corporate stores represent only 2% of our footprint around the world, they remain a critical strategic tool to develop talent and to test and refine innovation and in some instances, to accelerate the growth of an under-penetrated market. We must restore their leadership from a performance perspective. Next, I wanted to talk through staffing and some of our plans to address it as a headwind on our performance this year. First, we're seeing an improvement in delivery service in many Domino's stores. By the end of Q1, delivery service has improved versus the same time last year in 42% of stores. This number improved sequentially in each period during the first quarter. Second, while it may take some time to get to full staffing levels, the majority of our franchisees support the boost week and a return to more aggressive promotions that drive customer acquisition. I believe this is an indication of their confidence that staffing and service will continue to improve. Third, with Omicron interruptions largely behind us we were able to roll out a new service assessment program at the end of the quarter. The service assessment provides each store with its own specific service improvement objectives based on individual results. The service assessment also comes with tools to help stores identify and address where they have opportunities. We really expect this new program to help our franchisees as the year progresses. Finally, as Ritch mentioned during our last call, we are continuing our deep dive on driver labor. A lot in the world of delivery has changed because of the pandemic. And we're thoroughly analyzing what all these shifts mean for our business. We're still doing the work of this important initiative and believe many of the solutions for how we can evolve and improve our driver staffing already exist within our system as is evidenced by the performance of our top quintile stores. That said we're coming at this analysis with an open mind and are exploring all avenues at our disposal. I am excited for what's ahead at Domino's. And I'm honored at the opportunity to lead the continued evolution of this great brand. Together with Sandeep and the rest of our leadership team, we will leverage the learnings from these headwinds we're facing today and we'll use them to become even better. I look forward to talking with you about this in future calls. And with that said I'll send it back to Ritch for some final words. 
Ritch Allison: Thanks Russell. Looking forward I have a great deal of confidence in you our outstanding leadership team and our incredible team members and franchisees here in the US and all around the world. I'm optimistic about the future of this brand with many years of growth runway ahead. Today is my last earnings call and I'll close my remarks this morning with a heartfelt thank you to our franchisees and team members across the globe. Over the last 11 years, you have inspired me every day with your passion, your commitment and your innovative spirit. I'm truly grateful, for the partnership and the friendship that you have extended to me. Serving you as the CEO of this great brand has been the highlight of my professional career. And to our investors and analysts it has been a pleasure to work with you over these years. Thank you again for joining us on the call today. And we will now be happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.
Brian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning and Ritch well wishes into the future. As we think about the US business and the pressure that you guys are experiencing from staffing stimulus rollover et cetera, can you help us understand what your share trends look like year-to-date so we can better kind of understand how much of this is idiosyncratic to Domino's versus industry-wide headwinds? And just Russell as you come into this role, is there any new strategic initiatives we could see you pivot towards to really help get the system more staff more quickly perhaps even gaining some operational health maybe through new partnerships? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Hi, Brian. I'll answer your first question. On the share trends on those we rely on NPD information. And there's been so many switches from sit-down to -- when that sit-down was closed people would get delivery. Now sit-down was open again, and so there's a lot of moving parts kind of up and down. When we look at kind of the total Delco delivery carryout share performance for us, we've held our own and actually moved up significantly on the carryout side.  I suspect a lot of people have the same question you did on the second -- on your second question so I'm going to take a little bit more time answering that if that's okay. And I wanted to start with a little perspective. And I just got back from over the last month a listening tour where I visited with 155 of our US franchisees over the last month. And what I can tell you that I heard was the only person more disappointed than the customer who can't order Domino's is the franchisee who owns that store and can't serve that customer. We take so much pride our franchisees take so much pride. When I started Domino's in 2008 and I -- there's a motto that's thrown around and I hold it close to my heart because it describes our franchisees, which is we are the last to close and the first to open. And so the fact and Ritch talked to this in his comments earlier the fact that we were closed almost six days, is not something that our franchisees or us that's not part of our DNA. And Omicron is behind us now. And I can tell you through these visits they are ready to get after it. And so the question really is, with that what are we going to do to if the energy is there kind of what are we going to do to address that capacity? And I'll give you some -- maybe some quantitative information and then a couple of facts along the way. First, what we've seen every period during Q1, is an improvement in our delivery service. And in fact, we ended the quarter with 2,700 stores a little bit more than that with delivery service better this year than it was same time last year. And like I said it continued to improve every period. We're going to return to our store hours the core store hours. There were times at which a store had to decide hey do I let my staff go home it's been a long day or not. And we are proud that they made the right decisions in that case. But again we're in a different situation now. And our franchisees and us feel like we can make that return to core store hours in all of our stores. Next we need to free up capacity. Obviously, bringing in new team members is one thing. But if phone calls are one of the things that maybe gets second fiddle if a store is busy now moving and getting capacity for 3,000-plus doors and the number can increase to take those phone orders that's going to take work out of the store where they can focus on making the pizza and delivering the pizza. And lastly, we haven't done boost weeks in a couple of years. And boost weeks really is what drives new customers into Domino's. And that's where the magic happens with our loyalty program and all our digital and analytical capability. And so when you think about all I went through hopefully, you understand why I'm bullish on this. I'm bullish, but I think we also have to be realistic. And that's why Rich talked about the last call, I talked about this call, we are undergoing a full assessment of the driver and delivery landscape both today and into the future. We do think a lot of the answers for some of the headwinds that you mentioned before and how we're going to overcome them hey we're seeing them in our top quintile stores, right? So a lot of stores are actually doing that. And our goal my job is to help everyone move to that top quintile. But our job as well is to make sure that anyone who wants a Domino's Pizza gets a Domino's Pizza. And so while we continue to look internally for best practices, I will tell you nothing is off the table, when we look at – when we think about long term, and getting folks who want Domino's their delivery order.
Brian Bittner: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Palmer: Thank you. You mentioned the quintiles. How is staffing at the bottom one or two quintiles versus pre-COVID? And perhaps you can talk about, how that's changed in recent months and even recent weeks and to the degree that that's giving you confidence to this labor capacity getting better perhaps midyear-ish or so? And then maybe there's something tied into this call center as a solution. But I do want to get a sense of your confidence on getting that bottom up to pre-COVID levels? Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Sure, David. I think a couple of things. One is it's not just my confidence. We and our franchisees are aligned on bringing back boost weeks this summer. And so that means the entire Domino's system is confident we'll be where we need to be. We're not going to be perfect, but we're going to try. And that's been our history, right? Last to close first to open. How I'll address the quintile piece is maybe – a better way to think about it maybe is what have we learned that the top quintiles do that we can help inform the bottom quintiles to move up? And what's really interesting to me is only one of those learning's to me is something that's out of your control. So in general, if you're an urban store, it's a little bit harder to staff than, if you're a suburban store. But as I take you through some of these other points, I think what you'll realize is these are things that are well within folks control. And we just help – need to help lead and inform our franchisees. So I'll take you through with some of them differences again top quintile versus bottom quintile. They're going to have more drivers on the road, right? Their drivers are going to spend more time on the road less time in stores doing things other than driving. They process their new hires more quickly, right? They are in markets that are more fortressed. We've been talking about fortressing forever and how important fortressing is from a delivery standpoint but also how incremental it is from a carryout standpoint. I think the results here show that us and our franchisees, we're really happy we started fortressing because that's a big difference in the quintile analysis. Higher a list is another one. The last one and this is really important one of the biggest drivers of quintile performance is the strength and the tenure of the general manager. And so when I think about the things that are within our control all but one of those things are and we can get after that.
David Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Your line is open.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to the conversation around delivery drivers and what you guys plan to do I guess to attract more delivery drivers and keep the ones that you have. I think last quarter you talked about more scheduling flexibility and using technology to make sure you keep the drivers in their cars, I guess, more often. So just give us an update on, where you are with some of those initiatives and if you feel like that's going to be enough. Or do you think you have to really step up pay or push the franchisees to step up pay to really I guess retain the drivers that you have and maybe go out and expand and find more drivers?
Russell Weiner: Thanks Peter. From a payer perspective -- obviously, I can talk to our corporate stores. Over the last three years, we spent -- we've increased wages well over $30 million. So I don't think, it's pay. I think it's a real holistic view. As I said earlier that general manager is a big piece of it. And so you want to make sure the store around them is as stable as possible. I think the way we look at hiring is really a chain from start to finish. And so, if you think about what we did this year that we really haven't done in the past to attract new people is we used our television advertising. We had not done that in the past. And so, we have a story out there with Lolly, a 27-year-old, franchisee who owns two stores started as a delivery driver, really as an aspirational goal. If you want to be a general manager at Domino's and an owner at Domino's it all starts as being a driver. So, getting awareness out there we're a marketing company. And marketing staffing is something we hadn't done before. So that brings in more people. Now when they come in then what happens? Well, you have to process their applications more quickly. And we rolled out a new ATS system, which helps applicants get through in less than five minutes. And so that piece is better. Then once they start in the store, you need to do what you can to make the job as easy as possible. There's a lot of pressure on those jobs. And so a lot of the technology that we've introduced addresses that. We talked last time about some operational best practices taking box holding way for example, that takes 30 to 40 hours out of the store. And so when you think about that kind of holistic start apply working in a store, what we've tried to do is change our approach holistically that to that. What I can tell you though is again, we are doing a full assessment of this area and we will have enough people to deliver Domino's Pizza.
Ritch Allison: And Peter, just one thing I would add to Russell's comments. We're absolutely also looking at how we schedule those drivers once we have them on the payroll. And certainly there are a lot of folks out there now looking for more flexibility perhaps shorter shifts, maybe fewer hours over the course of the full week. So, we're taking a look at that scheduling component as well to make sure that the way we ask our team members to show up aligns in some cases better with their expectations of what they want to do.
Peter Saleh: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.
David Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. I just had one clarification question about the US comps and perhaps it's a bit nuanced but, I know you mentioned a lot of volatility around Omicron. And I was wondering if you could comment on whether you've seen some stability in the business post Omicron. Meaning, if you look at growth relative to pre-COVID levels in February up through March did it stay relatively stable in March decelerate because of the comparison or are you seeing a further deceleration? I guess that's one clarification. And then, I guess my real question is really about the operational challenges and the impact that might be happening on consumer feedback or consumer perceptions towards Domino's more generally. And just wondering if you can comment on what kind of consumer feedback you're getting from some of the issues you're having on the delivery side. Thanks.
Sandeep Reddy: David, this is Sandeep. I'll take the first part of the question and then I'll pass it over to Russell for the second piece. But I think when you talk about the cadence of US comps, Ritch talked about it in the opening remarks. And it was a very tough January with Omicron. Feb got a little bit better. But then we actually got -- it went backwards a little bit in March. So we had a bit of a mixed bag as we went through the quarter. But I think the challenge that we actually saw was across the quarter quite significant. That's why we ended up that down 3.6%. And I think Russell talked about this in the prepared remarks as well. We are now up against a very tough comparison on a two-year stack 19.6% in the second quarter. So I think that's something to keep in mind given how we actually finished up in the first quarter that we're up against tough compares. So, that's really what's been happening from a cadence standpoint. But pivoting back to what Russell talked about in the opening remarks we're doing a whole bunch of things to address this and accelerate demand. We're not going to basically just accept where things are at right now. And everything that Russell talked about in terms of getting back to normal operating hours using the call center to actually bolster our volume and be able to create more capacity to take it, this is all going to be critical. And it's amazing that the boost weeks haven't been done for so long with the pandemic, but that should be a significant accelerator as well. So, personally when I kind of take a look at comps in the first quarter, to me it's an aberration. When I look at the business performance over multiple years I've gone back and looked at the history on a three-year stack basis we're up 11%, despite all these problems with labor that we're dealing with. And I'm really bullish about our ability to bounce back, once we actually start implementing the initiatives that Russell was talking about as we move through the year. 
Russell Weiner: Great. Thanks Sandeep. David I'll -- on what are consumers saying question, I'll reflect back. You may know I started at Domino's in 2008. And at 2008, we had a customer problem, which affected demand, which is people didn't like the taste of our pizza. We actually had plenty of capacity back then. In fact we were closing stores and we were closing supply chain. Demand from a customer perspective is hard to create and we did it here at Domino's. Where we are now the customer issue we actually have plenty of demand. We just have that capacity problem. And so I say that just to reflect that this is a company and a group of franchisees that overcame what I think is a much more difficult issue. And what the headwinds we're up against right now is we just got to serve the demand that's coming our way. Are consumer -- are our customers happy about it? No. Do we have programs that can address them? Sure. We have an extreme delivery program. If you get your pizza late, you're going to have free pizza next time. We've got the loyalty program. We've got all those things. I also think our customers understand -- they're not happy, but they understand what our team members are up against. If you remember the amazing thing about the Domino's system is when COVID first was hitting its peak and everybody was closed, our folks were open and our customers don't forget that. So anyway maybe a long way of answering your question, but I think we've overcome more difficult customer issues before. And what they'll see soon is we're going to be back to being the same Domino's as far as delivery perspective. 
David Tarantino: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Mullan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Mullan: Hey, thank you. Just a question on domestic unit growth. Last call you had given a heads up that this year could be impacted by some COVID-related delays. It sounds like from your prepared remarks today that maybe the driver issues and general inflation could have an impact as well. But at the same time you expressed confidence in the unit economics and the 8,000 long-term targets. Can you just help us marry those two things? Can all these issues get sorted out this year and next year's return to that 4% to 5% growth range, or could it perhaps take a bit longer than that in your minds?
Sandeep Reddy : Hi, Brian. This is Sandeep. And I think if we look back at what we've done on unit growth in the past quarter we've been really thrilled. And frankly, if you go back to the trailing 12 months as well it's been a very impressive growth rate. And we've -- on a global basis we've actually gotten to a growth rate of about 7%, which is very strong. And it's driven by strength both in the international store growth as well as the domestic store growth. What we have said is, there are certain challenges that we faced in the last few quarters, especially because of the supply chain delays and permitting delays and the like that have actually caused our rate of unit growth to be less than we'd like it to be in the past few quarters. And those issues probably are likely to persist for the next few quarters, as Ritch mentioned in the prepared remarks. However, when I look at the landscape of where we are in the U.S. business, our unit economics for the franchisees are industry-leading. It's amazing how much value they generate. $174,000 in EBITDA for the franchisees enables them to have a fantastic cash-on-cash return and an opportunity to continue expanding their footprint. And so we're at 6,600 stores give or take across the system. And the 8,000 plus objective is very much within reach. And with the clip that we've been through this last trailing 12 months it's not that far away either. So it's super exciting. I'm thrilled about the opportunity that we have because it's such a profitable business for our franchisees. And we're working all the time to make sure that they continue to be profitable. And I think that's why we're very comfortable with the unit growth projections that we provided of 6% to 8%. We're committed to that. We expect to see that this year and going forward. 
Russell Weiner: Yes. Sandeep, I'll just add a little bit to your comments. But you're right I mean 7% right that's right smacking between our 6% to 8% guidance. I want to do first a shadow on the international side. We're experiencing the last 12 months our highest organic growth from a store perspective internationally. And when I think about the US business, I really like to -- people say half empty half full, what is your glass? And my glass on US development half full and we're going to fill it up more. And why I say half full is when you look at the pizza category in QSR there is no one trailing 12 months two years three years nobody has opened up as many pizza stores in the United States as has Domino's franchisee. So that is an absolutely huge accomplishment. And that is why I think the glass starts half full. As Sandeep said there are a bunch of things that they're dealing with now both on the labor side and on the supply of things that you need to open up a store. So it makes some time -- may take some time to get beyond what you've been seeing. But again I want to thank our franchisees for doing what nobody else is doing. They have high expectations as do we and that 8,000 number is within reach. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
John Glass: Speaking of glasses, Russell, you didn't mention, sort of, the consumer reaction to the price increase in March to $6.99. But the business also got softer. So can you just talk about has that been accepted? Is that not a factor as you look at your sales? And Sandeep I think you talked about further pricing actions. And I think one of the things on the list was further exploring price points to national offers. And I sort of thought this was a one-time raise the price because there was so much equity in that you didn't want to adjust it further. Are you now reconsidering that and thinking about further increases in the national price point offers? 
Russell Weiner: So John, you totally threw me off my game because I'm just sitting here trying to think of a retort to your glass comment, so well done.
John Glass: Thank you.
Russell Weiner: On the two changes that we made from a promotion standpoint the $5.99 one to $6.99 at least on the delivery side remember we held the carryout side that was middle of March. And so we've got some time before we're going to see what's happened there. I can say on the $7.99 remember there were a couple of things that we did there. We did $7.99 to move it online because moving our carryout customer online is really important to become part of the loyalty program. We can do all our data magic with them. At the same time we also did the carryout tips promotion. And the only way you can get the carryout tip is to also go online. And so we've seen a five percentage point increase in our online carryout business. And so that strategy is absolutely working. I'll start answering the Sandeep portion. I'll let you finish it. But John we've been doing -- when it comes to pricing, we've been doing pricing analysis since we launched $5.99 here at Domino's. It's not like we wrote it down on a piece of paper and decided to stick with it. And that architecture is not set in stone. There's actually math and there are numbers behind all of it. And so essentially what Sandeep is saying is true. But we look at pricing every day. I looked at pricing before I came down here. It doesn't mean we need to change pricing. What we do is we optimize our pricing to make sure that our customer has the best value relative to the competition and that that drives the most bottom-line for our franchisees. And so we can understand through our testing demand when we look at different brands. And we know what the input costs are from a labor standpoint from a food standpoint. And if things need to change to protect the consumer value proposition or to protect our franchisees' profitability, we will do that. And that I think is what Sandeep was referring to.
Sandeep Reddy: Yes that's exactly right, Russell. I think Russell hit it exactly because it's – in the end it's a delicate balance between the value our consumers expect and then our franchisee partners who have to actually make sure that they generate the profitability to keep their growth going and our business continuing to grow the way it has. So I think what we have to do is be cognizant of the fact that today we're dealing with a highly inflationary economy. And so the food basket is up double-digits. Labor costs have actually gone up significantly. And in this environment I think we just want to make sure that while we keep in mind that consumer value proposition and we are making sure that the demand continues to flow we still find a way to ensure the profitability of the franchisees is where it needs to be to drive that long-term growth for them and for us. And that's as simple as it is.
Operator: And our last question comes from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jared Garber: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to get a sense – I know you talked about this driver economic study and maybe it's early days in there but just wanted to get a sense of if you have any sort of early reads on maybe what specifically is keeping folks from sort of signing up to work at Domino's or to drive for Domino's. Fully understand sort of some of the Omicron-related headwinds in January. But I think post that we've heard from several restaurant industry peers that would suggest staffing levels that are back at or above pre-COVID levels. But maybe Domino's is seeing something different. So I just wanted to get a sense of what you're seeing sort of in early days of that study and how that's starting to inform some of your decision-making going forward. Thanks.
Russell Weiner: Sure. When I – when we talk about staffing, I really think you need to think that we essentially we have two businesses at Domino's. We've got a – the carryout piece of business and the delivery business. The carryout business has not really been constrained because there are no delivery. The customer as you know we tip them. And the customer is their own delivery driver. And that business over the last three years is up 24%. What we're really talking about here is I think stuff that's a little bit more specific to Domino's as a restaurant. But I want to be clear first, nobody in this country delivers more pizza than Domino's Pizza. So we have a lot of fantastic drivers there. I think the question is can we deliver more than more? And that's part of what this study is and this is part of what we're working with our franchisees on. Like I said I do think we have a lot of the answers internally. But we're going to leave nothing on the table when we look at options once the study is done.
Jared Garber: Thanks. And I guess maybe elephant in the room but as part of that assessment is third-party aggregators partnership being considered? 
Russell Weiner: Nothing is off the table. But I've got a lot of faith in the Domino's system. We've got quintiles that are doing it. But like I said our job is to fulfill the demand that customers have for us. Luckily we don't have a demand problem right now but nothing is off the table.
Jared Garber: Thank you.
Operator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. Please proceed with closing remarks.
Russell Weiner: Thanks, everybody for joining the call this morning. Sandeep and I look forward to speaking with you in July to discuss our second quarter 2022 results. Have a great day. 
Operator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-03-01 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Domino's Pizza Fourth Quarter Year-end 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]

 With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ritch Allison. 
Richard Allison: Thank you, Jenny, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Before getting into the details of the fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, I'd like to begin by addressing our leadership succession news announced this morning.  
 After almost 11 years at Domino's, including the last 4 years as CEO, I've announced my plans to retire from the company. With the outstanding leadership team we have in place, I believe now is the right time for me to pass the baton to the next generation of leadership. That's why I'm delighted to share that our Board of Directors has unanimously chosen our very own Russell Weiner, Chief Operating Officer and President of Domino's U.S., to become our next CEO effective May 1 of this year. I look forward to working with Russell for a smooth transition and will continue to serve as an adviser to him until I retire on July 15. There is simply no one more qualified than Russell to oversee Domino's next chapter. Russell has been a member of the Domino's family since 2008 and has been instrumental in defining and executing the strategies that have led to our success. Russell has played a pivotal leadership role driving innovation across all aspects of the Domino's brand during his tenure, including reinventing Domino's menu and advertising. As we enter a new phase of growth for the company, the Board and I believe Russell's vision, incredible passion for the brand and earned respect of our team members and franchisees, make him the right choice to take Domino's forward.  
 This morning, we also announced that after a thorough search with the assistance of an outside search firm, we have named Sandeep Reddy as the company's next CFO. We are excited to welcome Sandeep to the Domino's family, and we are confident that he will be an incredible addition to our talented leadership team.  
 As for my next chapter, my wife and I look forward to returning home to North Carolina to spend more time with our family and focus on community and philanthropic efforts that are close to our hearts. Looking ahead, I remain as confident as ever in Domino's growth prospects, and I know the company will only build on its momentum with Russell at the helm.  
 With that, I will now turn it over to Russell for some brief remarks. Russell? 
Russell Weiner: Thank you, Ritch, and good morning, everybody. I am honored and humbled to take on the role of CEO. This for me is the opportunity of a lifetime to represent a brand that I love and team members and franchisees all over the world that I respect and admire so much.  
 I'm excited to begin the next chapter of an incredible Domino's journey that started for me back in 2008, and I'm eager to build on that strong foundation we have and continue to deliver value for all of our stakeholders.  
 Domino's became the #1 pizza company in the world through a relentless focus on our customers in every aspect of their pizza experience. I'm here to tell you that, that focus is as strong as ever, and I'm excited to work with our talented leaders, our team members and franchisees to deliver the next phase of Domino's growth.  
 On behalf of Domino's colleagues around the globe, I want to thank Ritch for his leadership and incredible contributions to Domino's over the years and really on a more personal note, for the collaboration that we've had and for the friendship that we will have for a long time. I look forward to continuing to work closely with Ritch over the coming months to ensure a seamless transition.  
 I'm also really looking forward to working closely with Sandeep, who I was personally involved in hiring along with Ritch and our Board. Sandeep brings nearly 3 decades of global leadership experience in consumer-facing businesses, and I know he will be an incredible fit from both a business perspective and culture perspective.  
 With that, I'll now hand it back to Ritch to take you through the quarter and the year. Ritch? 
Richard Allison: Thanks, Russell. Overall, I'm very pleased with our 2021 results, which once again demonstrated the strength of the Domino's brand around the world. Throughout the year, we and our franchisees continue to battle through ongoing COVID-related challenges. Through the Delta wave, through the onset of Omicron near the end of the year, our franchisees, store operators and supply chain teams fought on in service of their customers, their team members and their communities across the country and around the globe.  
 As I look back on 2021, there are a few key highlights that demonstrate the continued strength and resilience of the Domino's business model. Global retail sales reached $17.8 billion in 2021, up 11.7%, excluding the impacts of foreign currency and the 53rd week compared to 2020. And that was lapping a 10.4% growth rate in 2020. When we compare back to pre-pandemic 2019, the Domino's brand grew by approximately $3.5 billion in retail sales on a global basis over the last 2 years. Now for perspective, $3.5 billion was about the size of our entire U.S. business just a decade ago in 2011, 51 years after Domino's was founded. We and our franchisees opened 1,204 net new stores in 2021, more than 3 stores per day, reaching a global store count of 18,848 at the end of the year. When combined with our 2020 store growth, we opened more than 1,800 net new stores over the last 2 years. That's in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic and the development difficulties and delays witnessed worldwide. This demonstrates the incredible commitment and resilience of our franchisees.  
 Our unit economics remain very strong, even in the face of rising labor and food costs. In the U.S., the average Domino's store generated more than $1.3 million in sales during 2021, while the global average approached $1 million. We currently estimate that our 2021 U.S. franchisee store EBITDA once again exceeded $170,000 per unit, and we'll have that final profitability figure for you in April.  
 International store level profitability also remained very strong with cash-on-cash returns averaging under 3 years. The strength of our business and operating model allowed us to distribute almost $1.5 billion in share buybacks and dividends, continuing our long-standing commitment of efficiently returning capital to our shareholders.  
 We also stepped up our commitment to giving back to support the communities where we live and work, from raising more than $13 million toward our 10-year $100 million pledge to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, to awarding our first scholarships through the United Negro College Fund, among many others.  
 In 2021, we published our inaugural stewardship report, including the results of materiality assessment and our goal to achieve science-based targets and net zero emissions by 2035 and 2050, respectively, to improve our environmental footprint. In summary, the Domino's brand continues to deliver to our customers, to our franchisees, to our team members, to our shareholders and to the communities we serve.  
 I'll turn the call over now to Jessica Parrish, our Controller and Treasurer. She will take you through the details of the quarter and the year. I'll then come back to share some additional thoughts about 2021 and the year ahead. Jessica, over to you. 
Jessica Parrish: Thank you, Ritch. Congratulations to both you and Russell, and good morning to everyone on the call.  
 We are pleased to share our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results with you today. Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world continue to generate healthy operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $4.25 for Q4, which represents a 22.8% increase over our diluted EPS as adjusted in Q4 2020. As a reminder, our fourth quarter results in 2020 included an extra or a 53rd week, which is outlined in more detail as an item affecting comparability in our earnings release filed this morning.  
 Global retail sales were down 0.2% in Q4 2021 as compared to Q4 2020. However, when excluding the extra week in Q4 2020 and the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 9%, demonstrating sustained positive momentum in both our U.S. and international businesses.  
 Breaking down total global retail sales growth, when excluding the extra week in Q4 2020, U.S. retail sales grew 4.6%, rolling over a prior year increase of 14.3%. International retail sales, excluding the extra week in Q4 2020 and the negative impact of foreign currency, grew 13.2%, rolling over a prior year increase of 9.9%.  
 Turning to comps. During Q4, we continued our streak of 112 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. Same-store sales for our international business grew 1.8%, rolling over a prior year increase of 7.3%. The international comp was driven by order growth and was partially offset by a slightly lower average ticket. Same-store sales for our U.S. business grew 1%, rolling over a prior year increase of 11.2%.  
 Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 1.5% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 7.3%. We believe the difference in the top line performance in our company-owned stores as compared to our franchised stores was primarily due to more substantial operational challenges resulting from staffing shortages combined with more conservative price increases as compared to our franchised stores.  
 The increase in U.S. same-store sales in Q4 was driven by ticket growth as we continue to see customers order more items per transaction. The ticket comp also benefited from higher menu prices as well as increases to our delivery fee and the mix of products we sell. The increase in ticket was offset by lower order counts, which were pressured by the very challenging staffing environment which had certain operational impacts such as shortened store hours and customer service challenges in many stores, both company-owned and franchised.  
 Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 89 net stores in the U.S. during Q4, consisting of 92 store openings and 3 closures. Our international business added 379 net stores in Q4 comprised of 430 store openings and 51 closures. For the full year, we and our franchisees opened 1,204 net stores, bringing our store growth levels back to a pre-pandemic pace driven by the strong cash-on-cash returns our franchisees are able to generate from our operating model.  
 Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the fourth quarter decreased approximately $13.4 million or 1% from the prior year quarter. When excluding the $88 million in revenues attributable to the extra week in 2020, revenues were up 5.9%. This increase was driven by higher retail sales, which generated higher supply chain and global royalty revenues.  
 Our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 37.7% in Q4 from 39.5% in the prior year quarter. Supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 9.6% from 11.6% in the prior year quarter. This decrease as a percentage of revenues was driven primarily by higher labor costs due to additional bonus pay and increased wage rates for our supply chain team members as well as higher food and delivery costs. Company-owned store margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 19.7% from 21.9% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher food costs as a percentage of revenues. Market basket pricing to stores increased 4.7% in Q4 as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, occupancy and insurance costs were also higher year-over-year, partially offset by lower labor costs. As a reminder, we incurred additional bonus pay in the fourth quarter of last year for frontline team members. And although we did make investments in the form of higher frontline team member wage rates during 2021, we continue to experience staffing shortages in a majority of our company-owned stores.  
 G&A expenses increased approximately $1.9 million in Q4 as compared to 2020. Excluding the estimated $6 million impact of the extra week in 2020, G&A expenses increased approximately $8 million in Q4 due primarily to higher travel and event expenses as well as higher advertising costs. Other income was $34.3 million during Q4 and represented an unrealized gain recorded on our investment in DPC Dash Ltd, our master franchisee in the China market. During the quarter, as part of a private funding opportunity, we made an additional investment of $9.1 million in Dash. Accordingly, we remeasured the investments we have made in previous quarters due to the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investments.  
 Net interest expense increased approximately $6.3 million in Q4 as compared to 2020. Excluding the estimated $3 million impact resulting from the extra week in 2020, net interest expense increased by approximately $9 million, driven by a higher average debt balance due to our recapitalization transaction completed in Q2 2021.  
 Our weighted average borrowing rate for Q4 decreased to 3.7% from 3.9% in Q4 2020 due to lower interest rates on our outstanding debt as a result of this recapitalization transaction. Our effective tax rate was 20.6% for the quarter as compared to 19.9% in Q4 2020. The effective tax rate in Q4 2021 included a 0.3 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. This compares to a 1.8 percentage point positive impact in Q4 2020. This decrease was due to fewer stock option exercises in Q4 of this year. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these tax benefits from equity-based compensation.  
 Combining all of these elements, our fourth quarter net income was up $3.8 million or 2.5% versus Q4 2020. Excluding the estimated $15 million positive impact on net income resulting from the 53rd week in 2020, net income was up $19 million or 13.9%.  
 Our diluted EPS in Q4 was $4.25 versus $3.85 from the prior year quarter. As compared to our diluted EPS as adjusted of $3.46 in Q4 2020, our diluted EPS increased 22.8%. Breaking down that $0.79 increase in our diluted EPS, the unrealized gain recognized in our investment in Dash benefited us by $0.68. Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.02. A lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.30. Higher net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.18, and our higher effective tax rate negatively impacted us by $0.03.  
 Transitioning from Q4 to the full year, I would like to hit on a few financial highlights for 2021. When excluding the extra week in 2020 and the positive impact of foreign currency, our global retail sales grew 11.7% during 2021. Same-store sales for the U.S. grew 3.5%, and same-store sales for our international division grew 8%. We and our franchisees opened more than 1,200 stores globally or more than 3 stores per day on average. We came within our 2021 annual outlook measures on the increase in our store food basket, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and royalty revenues and capital expenditures. Our full year G&A came in at $428 million, which was $3 million over our 2021 G&A outlook measure due to higher performance-based compensation expense.  
 We also completed a $1.85 billion recapitalization transaction at favorable interest rates and returned $1 billion to shareholders through an accelerated share repurchase transaction.  
 Our continued sales growth led to a healthy increase in our diluted EPS year-over-year and strong and consistent free cash flow generation. During 2021, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $654 million. After deducting for capital expenditures of approximately $94 million, which included investments in our technology initiatives such as our next-generation point-of-sale system and investments in our supply chain centers, we generated free cash flow of approximately $560 million, up more than 36% from our pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 free cash flow generation. Combined with the net proceeds from our 2021 recapitalization transaction, our strong free cash flow generation allowed us to continue our long-term commitment to returning cash to shareholders.  
 During 2021, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.9 million shares for $1.3 billion or an average price of $453 per share. As of the end of Q4, we had approximately $704 million remaining under our current Board authorization for share repurchases. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have repurchased and retired an additional 101,000 shares for approximately $48 million or an average price of $473 per share. We also returned $139 million to our shareholders during 2021 in the form of $0.94 per share quarterly dividend payment, including 2 dividend payments totaling $68 million that were paid in the fourth quarter.  
 As we move into 2022, we are pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share to be paid on March 30, representing an increase of 17% over our prior quarterly dividend amount.  
 Looking forward to 2022, we would also like to provide an update on the 2022 annual outlook items that we communicated in mid-January. We currently project that the store food basket within our U.S. system will be up 8% to 10% as compared to 2021 levels. We previously told you that we estimated that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a $4 million to $8 million negative impact on royalty revenues in 2022 as compared to 2021. Based on the current outlook, we now estimate that this could be an $8 million to $12 million negative impact. We expect that we may continue to see volatility in this outlook as there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rates.  
 We anticipate that our CapEx investments will be approximately $120 million as we continue to invest in strategically growing our business, including in our supply chain centers, technology and new corporate stores. We expect our G&A expense to be in the range of $445 million to $455 million. Keep in mind that these metrics can change based on economic and other factors outside of our control and may vary depending on our performance and strategic opportunities.  
 In closing, our business continued its solid performance during the fourth quarter, and we are proud of the results our franchisees and team members around the world delivered. 
 Thank you all for joining the call today. And now I will turn it back over to Ritch. 
Richard Allison: Thanks, Jessica. I'll begin my comments with a look at our U.S. business. Domino's 2021 U.S. retail sales, excluding the impact of the 53rd week of 2020, were up 6.7%, rolling over 15% retail sales growth in 2020, representing a 21.7% 2-year increase. Fourth quarter U.S. retail sales grew 4.6%, excluding the impact of the 53rd week, lapping a 14.3% increase from Q4 2020. 
 Our fourth quarter same-store sales growth of 1% was enhanced by the positive impact of 205 net new stores that we opened throughout the year. There were also headwinds in the quarter driven by ongoing staffing challenges, particularly in our delivery business. These challenges were more pronounced at the end of the quarter due to the Omicron surge. 
 Let's take a few minutes to further break down the U.S. retail sales growth into its 2 components, store growth and same-store sales. 89 net new U.S. stores in Q4 brought us our franchisees to 205 net new stores for the full year. U.S. store growth in 2021 was softer than we would like to see, particularly given the continuing strong franchisee store-level EBITDA. While cash-on-cash returns remain very strong, and we continue to see a robust pipeline of future openings, we and our franchisees had a number of store openings delayed in 2021 due to a variety of factors. We experienced slowdowns in permitting inspections and equipment deliveries as well as delays in construction and utility hookups. The aforementioned staffing challenges also impacted some store openings. We remain bullish on the unit growth potential in the U.S. but believe that we may continue to see some of these challenges persist in the quarters ahead. 
 Let's turn now to same-store sales. As we continue to experience COVID overlaps, we believe it remains instructive to look at the cumulative stack of comparable U.S. same-store sales anchored back to 2019 as a pre-COVID baseline and will continue to do so for as long as we believe it is useful in understanding our business performance. 
 Our 2-year stack for Q4 was 12.2% and the 2-year stack for full year 2021 was 15%. We saw a sequential decline in the Q4 2-year stack when compared to Q3. As we look back across 2021 and interpret our results, several things evolve throughout the course of the year, which we believe contributed to this sequential decline. 
 First, we believe that government stimulus had a material impact on our sales in Q1 and Q2 2021 that waned in the third and fourth quarters as we moved further away from the onetime payments and other enhanced government benefits tapered off over the course of the year. 
 Second, we saw staffing challenges intensify across the country as the year progressed, resulting in reduced operating hours and other service-related challenges in many stores across the network. We saw that urban markets were generally more impacted than our rural markets. We believe these staffing challenges posed a more significant headwind on orders and sales during Q4 than they did during Q3 and much more so than in the first half of the year. 
 When we break our U.S. stores down into quintiles based on staffing levels relative to a fully staffed store and then compare their sales performance in the fourth quarter, it gives us a sense for the magnitude of the impact that staffing is having on our U.S. business. Stores in the top 20%, those that are essentially or close to fully staffed, produced an average Q4 same-store sales increase of almost 6%. By contrast, stores in the bottom 20%, those that are facing the most significant labor shortages, saw Q4 same-store sales decrease by an average of almost 7%. 
 When we look across the U.S. business, we continue to believe that consumer demand for Domino's remains very strong across the country. It is our current capacity to serve that strong demand that we believe presents one of our largest near-term challenges. 
 We and our franchisees are taking a number of actions to address the staffing issues and to expand that capacity. A new applicant tracking system that we rolled out a few months ago has made it easier for candidates to apply for openings and to be onboarded at both corporate and franchise locations across the U.S. system. 
 We are also sharing operational best practices to eliminate unnecessary and time-consuming tasks in the operation of our stores, tasks like pre-folding boxes that could drive both team member and customer satisfaction. We now have over 2/3 of our stores who are not pre-folding boxes, saving an estimated 30 to 40 hours per store per week in labor. The objective of this initiative is to keep drivers in their cars and on the road while working as much as possible. 
 In our corporate stores during 2021, we rolled out increases in team member compensation and benefits totaling more than $6 million over and above required minimum wage increases. In 2022, we are currently anticipating committing an incremental $8 million investment in team member wages over and above required 2022 minimum wage increases in our corporate stores. Looking back to 2019, we will have invested over $30 million in frontline wage and benefit enhancements in our corporate stores. We are also implementing new approaches to team member onboarding, training and development to improve the employee value proposition. 
 While I'm optimistic about the efforts that we and our franchisees have underway, including a great new hiring ad that features one of our terrific young franchisees, we believe that delivery driver staffing may remain a significant challenge in the near term as the labor market continues to evolve. We are conducting a full assessment of the driver labor market and potential additional actions to relieve the existing constraints on our business. 
 Now I'll turn and share a few thoughts specifically about the carryout and delivery businesses. The carryout business was very strong in Q4, with U.S. carryout same-store sales approaching 10% positive compared to 2020, driven by both ticket and order growth. On a 2-year basis, our carryout same-store sales were up over 16% versus Q4 2019. 
 We drove greater awareness of Domino's Carside Delivery during the fourth quarter through our Carside Delivery 2-minute guarantee. I continue to be pleased with our Carside Delivery performance. Our research shows that it is appealing to both existing and new customers. And we have consistently averaged below 2 minutes out the door and on our way to our customers' cars. During the fourth quarter, we went on air to launch 3 great new products to support our signature $7.99 carryout offer. We call them Dips & Twists, and they hit the mark for great taste and consumer appeal with terrific economics for our franchisees. Results indicate that these products contributed meaningfully to our carryout ticket growth in the fourth quarter as many customers added these incremental items to their orders, resulting in the smart ticket growth we've been so focused on driving. 
 During our recent presentation at ICR, I also highlighted a change for 2022 to our $7.99 carryout offer that recently went into effect. As of January 31, this national offer is now available online only. This supports a balanced approach of bringing value and a great experience to our customers online while supporting our goals of growing the digital carryout business and supporting the profitability of our carryout orders. Online carryout orders generate a higher ticket and require a lower cost to serve than phone carryout orders, in addition to driving digital engagement and the opportunity to add members to our loyalty program. 
 Most recently, we launched a fund campaign to support this transition to online carryout for our customers by offering a $3 tip for each online carryout order. This approach also aims to drive repeat purchases as the tip comes in the form of a coupon that the customer can use on their next order. 
 Turning to the delivery business. Q4 delivery same-store sales declined relative to 2020, driven by order count declines, which were offset in part by higher ticket. Looking at the business on a 2-year stack, Q4 delivery sales remained almost 10% above Q4 2019 levels. We believe that the staffing challenges that I referenced earlier had a disproportionate impact on our delivery business in Q4. 
 During the fourth quarter, we continued our Surprise Frees ad campaign to support our delivery business that played on a key tension that consumers have with third-party delivery apps. The Surprise Frees that are often charged for service or small orders or simply because you live in a certain ZIP code. This campaign supported 2 of our key brand attributes, value and transparency. Over the course of the campaign, Domino's and our franchisees gave away over $50 million worth of Surprise Frees to our delivery customers. 
 We and our franchisees also gave back to local independent restaurants in our communities across the country. Many of our customers received gift cards with their Domino's orders that could be used to buy directly from local restaurants that have been hurt by rising costs, including fees charged by third-party apps. As we look forward into 2022 and the inflationary forces across the U.S. economy, we expect to face unprecedented cost pressures on our U.S. business. As Jessica mentioned, we estimate that our food basket will increase 8% to 10% versus 2021, and we anticipate that increase will be even more pronounced in the first half of 2022. 
 As I mentioned earlier, we also expect to make significant incremental labor investments in our corporate stores this year, and we believe many franchisees will be facing similar cost increases in their businesses. These costs put particular pressure on the delivery business due to the more labor-intensive nature of that service method. Managing through this cost inflation requires the same balanced approach that we have successfully executed over the last decade. We must continue to offer great value to our customers while giving our franchisees the tools to profitably grow their businesses over the long term. 
 It's with that balance in mind that on March 14, we will evolve our $5.99 Mix & Match offer for the first time in over 12 years. We will bring more value to our customers by adding 3 great products to the Mix & Match menu: 32-piece parmesan bread bites, 6-piece wings and 3-piece chocolate lava cakes. Customers will now have even more variety with more than a dozen items to choose from as they assemble their meals. Historically, when we have added items to the Mix & Match menu, we have seen positive impacts on ticket as customers add more items to their orders. 
 To ensure that Mix & Match can still drive value for our franchisees, we will replace the current single national offer with 2 separate offers. Our delivery Mix & Match offer will be $6.99 each for any 2 or more items on the Mix & Match menu. We believe that $6.99 is still a great relative value for our delivery customers, offering variety, great taste and a competitive price while also reflecting the increased costs inherent in a delivery order. This approach can allow our franchisees to achieve balanced growth across ticket and orders, which is key to driving profitable long-term growth for their businesses. 
 Our carryout Mix & Match offer will remain unchanged at $5.99 each for any 2 or more items on the Mix & Match menu. This allows us to continue offering the same familiar price point with enhanced variety and great value to our carryout customers as we look to continue growing that important and lower cost-to-serve business channel. 
 Rounding out the fourth quarter, we made continued progress in our U.S. business across several important areas. Our digital sales growth continued, accounting for $6.6 billion in U.S. retail sales in 2021, an increase of over 36% since 2019. We surpassed 29 million active members in our Piece of the Pie loyalty program and now have almost 70 million customers enrolled in our loyalty database. 
 We broke ground on a new supply chain center in Indiana, which we expect to complete by the end of 2022, and we are now running permanent installations of our new PULSE point-of-sale system in 5 stores right here in Michigan. We are excited about accelerating this rollout in 2022 and beyond. 
 Now as you know, it is not our practice to provide intra-quarter updates. But before we close our discussion of the U.S. business, I'd like to take a minute to share that the increased staffing headwinds we and our franchisees saw late in the fourth quarter have continued as we begin 2022. COVID, and specifically the Omicron variant, impacted us significantly in January, with the resulting staffing impacts putting more pressure on our U.S. business than we saw on average across the fourth quarter. These labor constraints, in particular, among delivery drivers, have encumbered our and franchisees' ability to take and service all of the orders coming into our stores. When we look at our 1- and 2-year trends, the limitation on order capacity resulting from these labor constraints, combined with the absence of government stimulus in 2022 as compared to Q1 2021, have created a challenging backdrop to date for U.S. sales comps in the first quarter of this year. 
 We believe that the sales we saw in Q4 2021 and have seen so far in 2022 for the U.S. business are not indicative of the demand our great brand is capable of generating. That demand gives us confidence about our ability to drive long-term growth once we adequately address these labor constraints. 
 Consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter, well staffed stores continue to outperform those that are not by similarly wide margin. And when we look at the carryout and delivery businesses, carryout has remained much stronger than the more labor constrained delivery business. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that delivery driver staffing may remain a significant challenge in the near term. As the labor market continues to evolve, we are conducting a full assessment of the driver labor market and potential additional actions to relieve the existing constraints on our business. 
 We and our franchisees remain laser focused on relieving the labor capacity constraints and continuing to grow the Domino's brand as we have for many consecutive years. 
 I'll end the U.S. discussion with a big thank you to our U.S. franchisees, our corporate store operators and our supply chain team for their ongoing efforts to serve their customers, their team members and their communities in a challenging operating environment. 
 I'll now turn my attention to our international business. And before I speak about the quarter and the year, I just want to send out our best wishes and prayers to our team members and their families in Ukraine. 
 It was another strong quarter of performance for our international business. Our 13.2% international retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact and the impact of the 53rd week, lapped our 9.9% growth in Q4 2020, combining to deliver a 2-year stack of 23.1%. Q4 same-store sales were positive at 1.8%. While this is a sequential deceleration from Q3, we are encouraged that this growth was driven entirely by order count increases as our franchisees continue to provide great value to their customers globally. 
 For the full year, excluding the impact of foreign currency in the 53rd week of 2020, Domino's international retail sales grew by 17.1%, our strongest result since 2016. As previously shared, we are continuing to watch the 2-year stacks across both the U.S. and international, and 2021 represented a 23% international retail sales 2-year stack relative to 2019. 
 A clear highlight for the quarter and the year was the outstanding store growth momentum that continued to build across our international business. Our international franchisees demonstrated their strong commitment to growth by opening 379 net new stores in Q4, bringing our full year total to 999 net new stores. When we back out the conversion of Dominion Pizza in Poland, our 999 net new international stores included 950 net new organic stores. That's a new record for our international business. This continued acceleration of international store growth, combined with our U.S. store growth, has driven the global pace of store growth to 6.8% for the full year 2021, aligning nicely with our 2- to 3-year outlook range of 6% to 8%. 
 Our 430 international gross openings and 51 closures during the fourth quarter brought our totals for the year to 1,094 gross openings and 95 closures. This low level of store closures was driven by continued and strengthening store-level economics and related cash-on-cash returns. 
 Importantly, the few individual markets that closed more than a handful of stores each were among our highest net store growth markets. Many of these closed stores were in atypical locations such as office parks and malls and had significantly lower order counts than average. Closing these stores now, while opening new stores in more ideal locations, creates a stronger foundation for continued growth in 2022 and beyond. At the end of the quarter, we estimate that Domino's had fewer than 50 temporary COVID-related store closures, with the majority of those located in India. 
 I'll now highlight a few international markets of note. In the U.K., our master franchisee, DPG, announced in December a new deal with its sub-franchisees after 2 years of negotiations. The agreement calls for DPG to invest over GBP 20 million and improves alignment between DPG and its sub-franchisees on marketing and promotions, enabling a balanced approach to customer value and franchisee economics. Importantly, the agreement also calls for DPG and its franchisees to increase store openings to 45 annually over the next 3 years. As our largest market by retail sales outside the U.S., we are encouraged by this agreement and the future growth that it can unlock. 
 I also want to highlight several of the BRIC markets, which are a significant source of current and future growth. India continued its impressive store growth from Q3 into Q4, leading our international markets, both for the fourth quarter and for the full year in net new store growth. Accompanying the strong store growth was solid same-store sales growth driven by order counts. 
 Our master franchisee, Jubilant, continues to invest in the business and set a higher bar for growth, while also taking care of their people throughout the ongoing COVID challenges. Subsequent to the quarter, Jubilant opened the 1,500th Domino's store in India. By far, our largest international market by store count, this was an incredible milestone for the brand in India. 
 As I highlighted on previous calls, we continue to see strong results coming out of China including more than 100 net new stores opened in 2021. As mentioned at ICR, China is now estimated to have a full market potential of over 5,000 stores. Fourth quarter results were very strong with a double-digit same-store sales increase and continued store growth momentum. 
 Domino's Brazil was also a highlight in Q4, opening 18 new stores in a difficult macroeconomic environment. That marks 100 net new stores that our master franchisee, Vinci Partners, has opened since acquiring the brand at the end of 2018. We've been impressed with Vinci's ability to drive growth in the market and are very excited about the potential for them to continue expanding the Domino's brand. Brazil is estimated to have a full market potential of over 1,000 Domino's stores. 
 In addition to those markets, we saw a strong continued regional growth in the Middle East from our master franchisee, Alamar, and the 11 markets in which they operate. Alamar recently achieved a great milestone with the opening of their 500th Domino's store. 
 Mexico, Spain, Turkey, Malaysia and Australia were additional large market highlights contributing to our global growth. Our master franchisees have once again reinforced my belief that we have the best partners in the restaurant industry. With an estimated remaining potential of over 10,000 new stores in our top 15 international markets alone, we look forward to continuing to work with them to drive long-term global growth for Domino's. 
 In closing, I'm very proud of the results we and our franchisees delivered in 2021, particularly when we consider the persistence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the continued challenging operating environment. Our proven model for success, leading with innovation, leveraging our global scale and driving superior returns for our shareholders has continued to guide us. 
 We have adapted to the ever-changing environment. We've grown sales, increased our global store count, invested in our people and driven returns for our franchisees and shareholders, all while staying true to our values as an organization. I am proud of our franchisees and team members who once again proved to me that they are the best in the restaurant business. 
 As we look ahead to 2022, we will work through the near-term challenges while remaining diligently focused on delivering for our customers, our team members, our franchisees, our communities and our shareholders. We have a long track record of profitable growth, driven by a powerful global brand and a disciplined operating model. This durable foundation gives me a great deal of confidence in our ability to continue to grow the Domino's brand over the long term. 
 I'll end my remarks this morning with a heartfelt thank you to our franchisees and team members across the globe. My team and I are proud to serve you each and every day. And I thank all of you again for joining us on the call today, and we'll now be happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. 
Brian Bittner: Ritch, congratulations on all your success at Domino's the last 11 years. And Russell, obviously, congratulations as you step into the new role here. Ritch, I'd like to ask you about the staffing trends and the ongoing impact. You suggested about a 13% difference in comp trend between fully staffed stores and your lower staff stores so that quantification is very appreciated as we try to understand the impact here. 
 As Omicron has peaked and arguably passed, are you seeing any improvement recently in staffing? Or did COVID maybe drive a more structural staffing issue that could remain meaningful as the year progresses regardless of the COVID environment? 
 And I just have a quick clarification question. Just as it relates to the price point change to $6.99 on the delivery Mix & Match, is there any way you can help us understand how that impacts effective pricing for the U.S. business on a year-over-year basis as that is implemented? 
Richard Allison: Thanks, Brian. I appreciate your thoughts. And as it relates to the staffing trends of the business, certainly, as I highlighted earlier, during the last couple of weeks in December and during the month of January, we saw a significant shock from Omicron resulting in lots of call-outs, team members at home and more impact in terms of reduced operating hours in our stores. 
 Over the course of February, we've certainly seen some stabilization. We've seen some improvement in applications, and we've seen some improvement in our delivery times and ability to serve our customers, but a big shock in late December and during the month of January. 
 The second part of your question there around staffing related to, more broadly, the COVID impact or the shifts in the labor market. Certainly, we still saw during the fourth quarter and still feel today that underlying impact of some of the structural shifts in the labor market. And that's a big part of what we and our franchisees are focused on going forward. 
 And as I mentioned earlier, we're doing a broader assessment of that labor market today to understand beyond the things that we're doing today, what additional actions might we be able to take to further alleviate some of those staffing challenges for the long term. 
 And Brian, to your question on $6.99, and I want to make sure I heard it correctly, but the basic construct of what we are going with going forward will be to change the price on our Mix & Match for delivery orders only. So we'll be dividing that coupon into 2 parts, $6.99 for delivery and $5.99 for our carryout customers. So the increase in price there will, to your question on effective pricing, it will effectively apply just to the delivery orders that come through the national coupon. 
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. 
Peter Saleh: Great. And congrats to both of you, Ritch and Russell. I just wanted to ask, Ritch, on multiple occasions, you said potential additional actions on labor. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're planning or thinking about there if this situation continues to be more challenging? 
Richard Allison: Yes, Pete, thanks for the question. So as I highlighted earlier, there are a number of actions that we've taken and that we are continuing to take. Certainly, we've done a lot with respect to team member wages and benefits, and we'll be bringing more around wages in 2022 relative to 2021. 
 We're also taking a look as we look forward at what are the other ways that we can make these delivery driver jobs more appealing and more lucrative to our drivers. So we've taken some action to take other tasks away from delivery drivers to enable them to stay in their cars as much as possible during their shifts, and therefore, to get more deliveries per hour at more tips. 
 In our best-run stores today, during the rush, you won't see a delivery driver come into the store. We are running pizzas out to cars, to load them up, so drivers can stay on the road. So that's a key action that we are taking, and we are expanding more broadly across our system. 
 And then beyond that, as we think about future things that we could do, we're taking a look at what are the options that we have to make these jobs more flexible for our drivers relative to our -- the more historic approaches of how we've scheduled a staff delivery drivers. So we're looking at a range of options across the board and as we work really hard to make sure that we can continue to have the capacity to serve our customers and also make these great jobs because, ultimately, these are the jobs that lead to franchisees. 95% of our U.S. franchisees started off delivering pizza. So we got to make sure we're still attracting a great labor force to be the franchisees of the future. 
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. 
Christopher O'Cull: Ritch, can you provide some color on how you expect the value menu changes will impact transactions and maybe franchisee profitability? Maybe describe what you saw in the test markets. 
Richard Allison: Sure, Chris. So every time we look at pricing and think about changes that we may or may not make to pricing, we are always looking at it through the lenses of transactions, sales and profitability at the store level. And as we took a look at the $5.99 Mix & Match offer, which we've done every year since we launched it more than 12 years ago, we take a look at what those impacts may be. 
 We don't run test markets. We have research and analytic tools that are very predictive, have been predictive in the past of the outcomes that we ultimately get. And so as we made the decision alongside our franchisees to shift the delivery Mix & Match offer to $6.99, it is absolutely with the goal of continuing to drive balanced growth of transactions, of sales and of profitability. Because we know -- we've seen it in the U.S. We've seen it around the world. The only long-term way to continue driving profitability in the business is to make sure that we're continuing to be more relevant to customers and driving more transactions. 
Christopher O'Cull: Wish you well in retirement. 
Richard Allison: Thank you. 
Operator: Our next question will come from the line now of Sara Senatore from Bank of America. 
Sara Senatore: Great. Just I wanted to ask about the U.S. and the idea of perhaps looking at retail sales versus just same-store sales or stacks. I noticed that the retail sales growth ex the 53rd week was actually better, it looked like to mean 4Q than 3Q even if your 2-year comp trend perhaps slowed. So is there any evidence that we should be thinking about it from the perspective of new units, either transferring sales from existing restaurants or even competition for drivers? I guess anything that maybe can balance how we think about overall sales growth for the system versus perhaps same-store sales? 
 And then just a clarification, you saw the opposite dynamic in international markets in terms of traffic versus ticket. Is there something specific that might have weighed on ticket in international markets, either mix or less pricing? Just trying to understand since that dynamic seems the opposite of the U.S. 
Richard Allison: Sure, Sara. To your question on retail sales versus same-store sales, I can tell you that inside the business here and across the management team, retail sales is what we pay the most attention to because it really does drive the economics in our business. It drives royalties. It drives the transaction fees. It drives sales through our supply chain centers. And ultimately, at the franchisee level, it drives profitability for the -- for our franchisees' enterprises. So that's how we look at it. 
 And we look at it -- we look at same-store sales and store growth as the components that ultimately drive that. And that's why when we've talked over the years about our strategies around fortressing the markets that we operate in, it really is about driving retail sales because we're willing to give up some same-store sales in cases where we feel like building new stores and getting closer to the customer can ultimately drive better economics for the franchisees. 
 And then taking a look at international same-store sales, it was more driven this time around by transactions. And what I can tell you is the dynamics vary quite considerably when you look across each of the 94 markets that we operate in outside the U.S. So there's not really one answer for you there, Sara, just simply that when we roll it all up, there was a preponderance of the markets that were driving more of their growth through transactions. And in most of those cases, it centers a lot around the fact that they're doing a really good job of making sure that they're bringing value to our customers and holding the line there, which ultimately enables us to drive more transaction growth. 
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Mullan from Deutsche Bank. 
Brian Mullan: Just echo the congrats to Ritch on a great career at Domino's. Russell, congrats on the new role. 
 One thing you talked about last quarter in reference to staffing challenges was that it prohibited you from being more aggressive on certain promotional activities. So I guess, one, is it safe to assume this remained the case in the fourth quarter? And then two, with your comments on February stabilizing a bit perhaps, I'm curious if staffing is starting to get back to a place or will soon where you anticipate being able to run some more promotional activity going forward? If you could just describe the relationship between staffing and your promotional activities. 
Richard Allison: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. It's absolutely related because one of the things that we don't want to do is, if we're in a constrained staffing environment, we don't want to drive bad customer experiences. And so we have been more conservative about aggressive promotions in the face of some of the staffing challenges that we've had. 
 We've seen some stabilization in February, as I mentioned earlier, and we are optimistic that through the current and future efforts of ourselves and our franchisees, that we'll get staffing back to a level where we can return to some of our more aggressive promotional activities because they are important as we think about how we continue to attract new customers into the Domino's brand. 
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. 
John Glass: Congrats both to you and Russell as well. Ritch, you mentioned a couple of times that demand remains strong. I'm just wondering how you understand or you know that just based on the comps, and you gave some tiers around staffing levels. But I suspect there's other elements in those lower staff stores that maybe they're urban, for example. So just how do you tease out the impact of staffing versus maybe some other contributing factors that may have impacted demand or if it's not a demand issue? Can you also just talk about the other levers of pricing besides the $6.99 offer? I think you said there was just some underlying menu price. Maybe what the underlying menu price on the regular menu is or delivery fees, other ways that you might be able to improve pricing besides just changing that promotional offer? 
Richard Allison: Sure, John. Thanks very much for the question. Yes. So we do feel very good about the underlying demand for Domino's Pizza. I shared with you some of those quintiles earlier where we tried to break down the stores from those that are well staffed to those that aren't. And when we take a look at it across each of those quintiles, we're able to gain visibility into where we have limited hours in stores, which is driven by staffing. 
 We can get visibility into where we've not answered the phones or where we have potentially not taken online orders, shut off online orders coming into the stores. So we can take a look at that data across each of these buckets of stores, and it gives us a good sense for where we may be failing to serve some of that incoming demand. So that gives us a sense kind of across those stores when we bucket it out. And those stores that have been well staffed, as I mentioned earlier, have continued to drive very strong same-store sales growth on both a 1- and a 2-year basis. 
 Also, John, when we take a look across the 2 businesses that we run out of each box, the carryout and the delivery businesses, the labor challenges we've had have not put as many constraints on our ability to serve carryout, and we continue to see very strong growth in that carryout segment. While it really is that delivery business that has been more constrained by driver labor. So that's another lens that we look at it through. 
 And then to your question on pricing, in addition to the national offers that we often talk about, each of our franchisees and stores has the ability to manage their own menu pricing and also to manage delivery fees at their stores. So we've seen -- in addition to seeing ticket go up through more items per basket, which is a smart ticket and we love to see that, we've also most certainly, as franchisees and stores have dealt with some of the cost pressures on the business, we have had some increases in menu and delivery fees also. And that comes into play as we think about how we evolve the national offers as well because it really is a balance across customers who want to order off the menu, order off local coupons and order off the national coupons combined with the delivery fee for those delivery customers that we're trying to balance in an effort to drive great value for the customer while also making sure that we've got a fantastic business model for our franchisees. 
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Jared Garber from Goldman Sachs. 
Jared Garber: Certainly would echo the same congratulations to you, Ritch and to Russell. I wanted to switch topics a bit and just think about the supply chain margins. Obviously, that margin impact in the fourth quarter pretty materially versus either prior year or several prior quarters. Just wanted to get a sense of how we should be thinking about the progression of margin recovery there. Is it related to kind of continued commodity inflation but also maybe some structural labor wage inflation at those supply chain centers? 
Richard Allison: Jared, thanks for the question. And certainly, supply chain margins were under pressure in the fourth quarter. And 2022 also sets up for a challenging margin backdrop for supply chain also. 
 We've got a couple of dynamics that are going on there and you've highlighted them. One is the commodity cost increases that we're seeing, which we estimated 8% to 10% over the course of this year. As we've talked about in the past, the way we manage margins to our franchisees is basically a fixed dollar amount. So we are not -- when the underlying cost of the commodities goes up, we get natural compression there in the margins. 
 And then second, we do have costs going up on the labor side of the business as well. I talked a lot on the call earlier about some of the increased investments that we've made in our corporate stores. We've also made significant labor investments in our supply chain centers as well. And then when you combine that with the rising cost of fuel, we are seeing a fair bit of pressure on supply chain margins. 
 Now when we think about how we manage through that, we do that once again with balance in mind because we want to make sure that our supply chain continues to bring a terrific value to our franchisees, supporting the unit-level economics that we've been so proud of for so long. And the good news is we've got the scale and the wherewithal in that supply chain business to absorb some of these cost increases while still making sure that we create great unit-level economics for the franchisees. 
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. 
John Ivankoe: I was surprised to not hear labor shortages with drivers internationally, especially in developed cities internationally, as maybe a constraint to fourth quarter sales. So I just wanted to make sure that, that wasn't perhaps influencing some of the fourth quarter slowdown in same-store sales. And related to that, same-store sales are often a leading indicator of development even when underlying cash and cash returns are good. Does that, I guess, optical slowdown in same-store sales in the fourth quarter and perhaps labor conditions as well, give some franchisees in some markets a little bit of pause in terms of a rate of development in fiscal '22 that they otherwise would have pursued. 
Richard Allison: John, thanks for the question. Certainly, in some of our international markets, and in particular, in some of the urban centers, certainly, we've seen some labor shortage pressures there as well. But when you step back and look at the international business in its totality across the 94 markets that we're in, the labor challenges we're seeing in international are not as pronounced as what we're seeing here in the U.S. business, different labor markets around the world have felt the strains of COVID and some of the shifts differently, governments in different markets have reacted differently with how they handle things through the course of COVID-19. But when you take a look at it in total, the challenges are more pronounced here in the U.S. than they are in the international business. 
 And then to the second part of your question around development. Certainly, same-store sales do factor in, obviously, to as they evolve over time into unit-level sales and profitability. So we're always keeping an eye on the quarterly trends, while we also keep the vast majority of our attention on the long term. But what I can tell you is that when we look across the business, both in the U.S. and in international, we still see a very robust pipeline of growth. And in fact, in the U.S. business, we did not get the store growth that we would have liked to have seen in 2021, but it wasn't because of sales, and it wasn't because of unit-level profitability. It really was around the factors that I mentioned earlier, just supply chain issues around getting equipment to the stores or getting permitting, getting inspections and things like that. 
 And then on the international side of the businesses, as I think you've seen, we've seen a dramatic ramp-up in the pace of store growth over the course of 2021. And we still feel very bullish about our opportunity to continue to grow in that 6% to 8% unit -- net unit growth range that we've communicated. 
Operator: Our last question will come from the line of Gregory Francfort from Guggenheim. 
Gregory Francfort: Ritch, can you maybe just in terms of the Mix & Match as we think about the portion of that, that could be delivery, is that going to be similar to the 2/3 of the overall business that's delivered? Or is it maybe something higher than that? 
 And then as you guys look at the margin profile of the $5.99, I'm assuming the reason to move it on the delivery orders to $6.99 was because the margins were somewhat lower. Does it put them closer to parity on those orders? 
Richard Allison: Greg, thanks for the question. I'm actually going to turn this one over to Russell, who's been at the center of the evolution of our offer here. 
Russell Weiner: Thanks, Ritch, and thanks, Greg. I think overall, when you look at our approach to pricing, hopefully, what you'll see is a really surgical approach. There was not a one size fits all here. So last call, Ritch talked about the evolution of $7.99 to online, right? When you bring that to online, we know our online carryout ticket is 25% higher than phone. So there was attention to that. We get customers' names, works with our loyalty program, the $5.99, which we've had since December of 2009, we think we can really keep that value for our carryout customers. There is a lower cost to serve there, and we're going to maintain that value. The carryout business opportunity is 2x that business in pizza than delivery. And so we want to be aggressive there. 
 Moving delivery to $6.99, again, is that surgical approach and allows us to keep the carryout offer where we need to do competitively helps us with some of the headwinds. Actually, overall, we think the $7.99, $5.99 going to $6.99, some of the menu pricing and delivery in our corporate stores, obviously, we don't have as much insight to our franchise stores, will really cover the majority of food and labor headwinds. We still need to ratchet up the efficiency a little bit. So I just want to make sure, as you think about this, it's not just $5.99. It's really this surgical holistic approach. 
Richard Allison: Great. Well, listen, I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call this morning. We look forward to speaking with you in April, where we'll have the opportunity to discuss our first quarter 2022 results. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-14 10:00:00) =====
Richard Allison: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Domino's Pizza Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]
 I'd now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Jenny Fouracre, Director of Public and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Jenny Fouracre: Thank you so much, and thanks to all of you for joining us for our conversation today regarding the results for the third quarter of 2021. Today's call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Ritch Allison; and from the office of CFO, Jessica Parrish. [Operator Instructions]
 I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of these documents are available on our website. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. 
 In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. [Operator Instructions]
 Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. 
 With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ritch Allison. 
Richard Allison: Thank you, Jenny, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Overall, I'm happy with our results this quarter, which, once again, demonstrated the powerful growth potential of the Domino's brand around the world. The third quarter presented significant challenges related to COVID and specifically the rise in the Delta variant. Across the U.S. and around the world, our system had to pivot yet again in response to the resulting changes in public health guidance and requirements. 
 As this pandemic extends deep into its second year, I'm proud to say that our franchisees have continued to step up to meet the ongoing challenge in service of their customers, their communities and their team members. Throughout the Domino's system, we remain committed to serving our customers with outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences. 
 Now you've heard me say it many times, global retail sales growth is the engine that drives our business model. During the third quarter, we delivered 8.5% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, driven by a combination of store growth and same-store sales. That 8.5% result was lapping a 14.8% from the third quarter of 2020. 
 The third quarter extended our unmatched streak of international same-store sales growth to 111 consecutive quarters. While a 41-quarter streak of positive same-store sales in the U.S. ended during the quarter, I'm pleased that we still grew our U.S. retail sales during the quarter while rolling over 21.3% retail sales growth in Q3 2020. 
 During the quarter, we also accelerated our pace of global store growth. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, we have opened 1,124 net new stores. That's an increase of 500 relative to where we were in Q4 2020. Over the last 4 quarters, we've averaged just a touch above 3 net new stores every day. So overall, the Domino's brand continues to deliver. 
 I'll turn the call over now to Jessica Parrish, our Controller and Treasurer. She will take you through the details of the quarter, and then I'll come back to share some additional thoughts about the business. Jessica, over to you. 
Jessica Parrish: Thank you, Ritch, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to share our third quarter results with you today. Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world continued to generate healthy operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.24 for Q3. 
 In Q3, we sustained our positive momentum in both our U.S. and international businesses, resulting in year-over-year global retail sales growth. Global retail sales, excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, grew 8.5% in Q3 as compared to Q3 2020. 
 Breaking down total global retail sales growth, U.S. retail sales grew 1.1%, rolling over a prior year increase of 21.3%. International retail sales, excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, grew 16.5%, rolling over a prior year increase of 8.5%. 
 Turning to comps. During Q3, we continued our streak of 111 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. Same-store sales for our international business grew 8.8%, rolling over a prior year increase of 6.2%. The U.S. comp was negative in Q3, following 41 straight quarters of positive same-store sales growth. Same-store sales in the U.S. declined 1.9% in the quarter, rolling over a 17.5% increase in same-store sales in Q3 of 2020, the highest quarterly U.S. comp we have ever achieved since becoming a publicly traded company in 2004. 
 Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was down 1.5% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 8.9%. We continue to observe a larger spread between the top line performance of our franchised stores and our company-owned stores than we've historically observed which we believe is a function of the heavily urban and higher-income footprint of our company-owned store markets relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise base. More aggressive fortressing in our company-owned store markets also contributed to the same-store sales gap between our corporate store and franchised store businesses. 
 The decline in U.S. same-store sales this quarter was driven by lower order counts. Our U.S. order counts during Q3 were pressured by a very challenging staffing environment, which had certain operational impacts, such as shortened store hours or customer service challenges in many of our stores. Additionally, since the onset of the pandemic, our comps had also benefited from significant economic stimulus activity in the U.S., the effects of which largely tapered off in the third quarter, which we believe pressured our order counts as compared to Q3 2020. 
 Ticket growth partially offset the decline in order counts as we continued to see consumers order more items per transaction during Q3. The ticket comp also benefited from increases to our transparent delivery fee as well as the mix of products we sell. 
 The international comp was primarily driven by order growth due to the return of nondelivery service methods across a number of international markets as well as the resumption of normal store hours and the reopening of stores that were temporarily closed in certain of our international markets in Q3 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 45 net stores in the U.S. during the third quarter, consisting of 46 store openings and only 1 closure. Our international business added 278 net stores comprised of 287 store openings and 9 closures. 
 Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the third quarter were up approximately $30.3 million or 3.1% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher retail sales which generated higher international royalty, supply chain and U.S. franchise revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $1.3 million in Q3. 
 Our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 38.6% in Q3 2021 from 37.4% in the prior year due primarily to higher revenues from our global franchise businesses. Company-owned store margin as a percentage of revenues was flat year-over-year at 19.8%. As a percentage of revenues, food and occupancy costs were higher year-over-year, offset by lower labor costs. Recall that we incurred additional bonus pay in the third quarter of last year for frontline team members. And although we did make investments in frontline team member wage rates during Q3, we continue to experience staffing shortages in certain of our company-owned stores. 
 Supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 10.7% from 10.2% in the prior year quarter. While the market basket increased 2.1% year-over-year, higher product and supplies expenses related to certain COVID-related safety and sanitizing equipment negatively affected the supply chain operating margin in Q3 2020 which did not recur in the current quarter. This year-over-year decrease in product cost was partially offset by higher labor cost. 
 G&A expenses increased approximately $4.7 million in Q3 as compared to Q3 2020, resulting from higher travel and labor cost, including higher noncash compensation expense, partially offset by lower professional fees. 
 Net interest expense increased approximately $7.1 million in the quarter driven by a higher average debt balance due to our recent recapitalization transaction completed in Q2. 
 Our weighted average borrowing rate for Q3 decreased to 3.8% from 3.9% in Q3 2020 due to lower interest rates on our outstanding debt as a result of this recapitalization transaction. 
 Our effective tax rate was 10.7% for the quarter as compared to 19.9% in Q3 2020. The effective tax rate in Q3 2021 included a 10.4 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. This compares to a 2.8 percentage point positive impact in Q3 2020. This increase was due to more stock option exercises in Q3 of this year. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these tax benefits from equity-based compensation.
 Combining all of these elements, our third quarter net income was up $21.3 million or 21.5% versus Q3 2020. 
 Our diluted EPS in Q3 was $3.24 versus $2.49 in the prior year quarter. Breaking down that $0.75 increase in our diluted EPS, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.36; our lower effective tax rate, primarily due to higher tax benefits on equity-based compensation, positively impacted us by $0.34; a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.19; and higher net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.14. 
 Shifting to cash. Our strong financial model continues to generate significant cash flows. During Q3, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $189 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $172 million. Regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on CapEx in Q3, primarily on our technology initiatives, including our next-generation point-of-sale system and our new supply chain center. Our strong free cash flow generation allowed us to continue our long-term commitment to returning cash to shareholders.
 As we discussed on the Q2 earnings call, we completed our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction during Q3. Subsequent to the settlement of the ASR, during Q3, we repurchased and retired approximately 153,000 shares for $80 million or an average price of $521 per share. As of the end of Q3, we had approximately $920 million remaining under our current Board authorization for share repurchases. We have continued to repurchase and retire shares subsequent to the end of the quarter. And through October 12, we had repurchased and retired an additional 205,000 shares for approximately $100 million or an average price of $488 per share. We also returned $35 million to our shareholders during Q3 in the form of a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend.
 Shifting gears, as we look toward our fourth quarter, we wanted to provide an update on our annual guidance measures for full year 2021 provided earlier this year. We previously provided guidance that our store food basket pricing in our U.S. system would increase approximately 2.5% to 3.5% over 2020 levels. We previously provided guidance that foreign currency could have a $4 million to $8 million positive impact on royalty revenues as compared to 2020. We previously provided guidance of $415 million to $425 million for G&A expense. Based on our current outlook, we expect each of these 3 measures to come in at the high end of these current estimates. We continue to expect that our full year CapEx investments will be approximately $100 million. 
 Keep in mind that these metrics can change based on economic and other factors outside of our control. Our G&A expense is also affected by our own performance versus our plan, which affects variable performance-based compensation expense. These estimates also reflect our normal 16-week Q4 which will be rolling over the 17-week Q4 we had in 2020 due to the inclusion of a 53rd week in our fiscal year. Recall that the 53rd week last year contributed an incremental $0.39 to our EPS in Q4 2020 due to the additional week of revenues and the costs attributable to the 53rd week. This amount was adjusted as an item affecting comparability in our Q4 2020 earnings release.
 In closing, our business continued its solid performance during the third quarter, and we are proud of the results our franchisees and team members around the world delivered. 
 Thank you all for joining the call today, and now I will turn it back over to Rich. 
Richard Allison: Thanks, Jessica. I'll begin my comments with a look at our U.S. business. Retail sales grew 1.1% in the third quarter, lapping a 21.3% increase from Q3 2020. Our 1.9% same-store sales decline during the quarter was offset by the positive impact of 232 net new stores that we have opened over the trailing 4 quarters. Domino's trailing 4-quarter U.S. retail sales, excluding the impact of the 53rd week of 2020, were up 9.5%, a truly impressive achievement by our franchisees and operators which shows the tremendous amount of growth in the brand across the U.S.
 Now let's take a few minutes to further break down the U.S. retail sales growth into its 2 components: store growth and same-store sales. Our 45 net new stores in Q3 was a sequential improvement over Q2 but still came in softer than we would like to see. While cash-on-cash returns remained very strong and we continue to see a robust pipeline of future openings, we and our franchisees had a number of store openings delayed due to a variety of factors. We and our franchisees saw delays in construction, equipment, utility hook-ups and inspections. In addition, franchisee staffing challenges also resulted in some delays. We remain very bullish on the unit growth potential in the U.S. but believe that we may continue to see some of these challenges in the months ahead.
 Now let's turn to same-store sales. As we continue to experience COVID overlaps, we believe it's instructive to look at the cumulative stack of comparable U.S. same-store sales anchored back to 2019 as a pre-COVID baseline, and we'll continue to do so for as long as we believe it is useful in understanding our business performance. At 15.6% for Q3, we saw a sequential decline of the 2-year stack when compared to the second quarter, bringing us back more in line with the 2-year stack we saw in Q1 of this year.
 So what changed from Q2 to Q3? Jessica highlighted several key drivers that I'll expand on here. First, we believe that government stimulus had an impact on our sales in Q2 that waned in the third quarter as we moved further away from the spring onetime payments and as other enhanced benefits tapered off. Second, we saw more pronounced staffing challenges across the country, resulting in reduced operating hours and service challenges in a number of stores across the network. We believe these challenges posed a more significant headwind on orders and sales during the third quarter than they did during the first half of this year.
 We and our franchisees are taking a number of actions to address the staffing issues. A new applicant tracking system rolled out a few weeks ago that will make it easier for candidates to apply for openings and to be onboarded at both corporate and franchise locations across our U.S. system. We are also sharing operational best practices to eliminate unnecessary time-consuming tasks in the operation of stores, like pre-folding boxes, for example, that can drive both team member and customer satisfaction. In our corporate stores, we have recently implemented meaningful increases in team member compensation and are also piloting new approaches to team member onboarding, training and development. While I'm optimistic about the efforts that we and our franchisees have underway, we believe that staffing may remain a significant challenge in the near term as the labor market continues to evolve.
 Now I'll share a few thoughts specifically about the carryout and delivery businesses. We saw positive carryout same-store sales growth during Q3 as we continue to build awareness of Domino's Carside Delivery. We were on air for several months with a fun campaign highlighting our Carside Delivery 2-minute guarantee. This campaign hits on 2 key elements of the Domino's brand: service and value. I'm very pleased with our Carside Delivery performance as our franchisees and operators have enthusiastically embraced this new service method. Our research shows it's also bringing in new customers. We have consistently averaged below 2 minutes out the door and on our way to the customers' cars. In fact, we have many stores across the country that are consistently below 1 minute. It's a great technology-enabled way to serve our customers and will remain an important part of our long-term strategy to serve our existing carryout customers and to attract new QSR drive-through-oriented customers going forward.
 I'm also excited to talk about our latest menu innovations. Just this past Monday, we went on air to launch 3 great new products to support our signature $7.99 carryout offer. We call them Dips & Twists, and they hit the mark for great taste and consumer appeal with terrific economics for our franchisees. I'm excited about the impact these can have on sales and on store-level profitability. I really hope you'll get out and try them. We have 1 sweet and 2 savory dip options in this new product line: baked apple, five cheese, and my personal favorite, cheesy marinara.
 Turning to our delivery business, Q3 saw same-store sales decline relative to 2020, but delivery sales remained significantly above 2019 levels. During the quarter, we believe that the stimulus wind-down and the staffing challenges that I referenced earlier had a disproportionate impact on our delivery business. 
 Just a few weeks ago, we launched a new ad campaign to support the delivery business. It plays on a key tension that consumers have with third-party delivery apps: the surprise fees that are often charged for service, for small orders or simply because you live in a certain ZIP code. Consumers also tell us that they hate the fact that these charges are often confusing, hidden or buried in the receipt. Domino's and our franchisees never charge surprise fees. We charge one transparent delivery fee. So we decided to give our customers surprise: frees instead of surprise fees. Doing this campaign, 1 out of every 14 digital delivery orders receives a free item. That item could be a pizza, stuffed cheesy bread, lava cakes,or any one of a number of other great items. Over the course of the campaign, Domino's and our franchisees will give away $50 million worth of surprise frees to delivery customers. Now this campaign supports 2 of our key brand attributes: value and transparency.
 I'll also share a few important milestones that occurred in the U.S. during the quarter. First, we broke ground just a few weeks ago on a new supply chain center in Indiana, which we expect to complete and open by the end of 2022. And second, we are now running a pilot version of our new PULSE point-of-sale system in a live store environment, and we will continue to invest in that multiyear project going forward.
 So as we look forward in the U.S. business, I remain optimistic about our ability to continue driving long-term growth. We'll manage through the staffing and other challenges in the short term. Frankly, that's what Domino's franchisees and operators do and have always done. And we'll continue to lead the brand with a clear focus on long-term profitable growth for our franchisees and DPZ. I'll end the U.S. discussion with a big thank you to our U.S. franchisees, our corporate store operators and our supply chain team members for their ongoing efforts to serve their customers, their team members and their communities. 
 Now moving on to international. It was another outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. Our 16.5% international retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, was supported by a very strong 8.8% comp. When you look at it on a trailing 4-quarter basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the 53rd week of 2020, Domino's international retail sales grew by 16.2%. As I discussed earlier with our U.S. business, we are also watching the 2-year comp stacks for international anchoring back to pre-COVID 2019. Q3 represented a 15% 2-year stack, which was very consistent with the second quarter.
 International store growth was a highlight during the quarter. Our international master franchisees opened 278 net new stores during the quarter, which increased the trailing 4-quarter pace to 892 stores for the international business. This acceleration in international store growth, combined with our U.S. store growth, has driven the global pace of store growth back into our 2- to 3-year outlook range of 6% to 8% global net unit growth.
 I was also very pleased to see that we had only 9 closures in international and only 10 closures on a global basis during the quarter. This low level of store closures is driven by 2 factors: first, our outstanding unit-level economics; and second, and very importantly, the strong commitment of our franchisees across the globe. 
 During the quarter, COVID continued to have a significant impact on many of our international markets, and we expect COVID to remain a challenge in many parts of the world for some time to come. At the end of the quarter, we estimate Domino's had fewer than 175 temporary store closures with many of those located in India and New Zealand. I'll highlight a few of the international markets that contributed significantly to our growth during the quarter.
 We successfully converted 52 stores in Poland as Dominium Pizza rebranded to become part of the Domino's family. This provides important scale for us in Poland, fast-forwarding us to 119 total stores in the market at the end of the third quarter. We now have 24 international markets with 100 or more Domino's stores. 
 We opened our 93rd international market during the quarter, officially welcoming Lithuania to the Domino's family. We're off to a great start there with the first store opening, and we have a second one coming very soon.
 India resumed an impressive pace of store growth by becoming the first Domino's market outside the U.S. to reach 1,400 stores. I could not be more proud of Jubilant, our master franchise partner, and the efforts they have made to fight through COVID, taking care of their people while still growing their business.
 Japan had another outstanding quarter, passing the 800-store milestone and continuing its impressive streak of growth. The transformation of the market by a master franchisee, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, has been remarkable. 
 China delivered double-digit same-store sales growth while continuing its strong pace of store growth. With each passing quarter, we become even more confident about the long-term growth potential for the Domino's brand in China.
 In addition to those markets, the U.K., Mexico, The Netherlands, Turkey and Colombia were additional large market highlights and a strong quarter of performance across our international business. And along with those markets, we also saw robust regional growth across the Middle East and Northern Africa during the quarter.
 I've long been convinced that we have the best international franchise partners in the restaurant business, and they certainly proved me right during the third quarter. As we look forward, we have so much opportunity ahead of us to continue driving long-term growth for Domino's outside the U.S.
 So in closing, I'm pleased with our third quarter results. Our outstanding franchisees and operators continued to battle through a challenging set of circumstances while delivering strong growth for the Domino's brand around the world. These passionate Dominoids, combined with our outstanding unit-level economics, position us incredibly well for the future.
 There is no doubt that we will continue to experience challenges with COVID, with staffing and other factors. We also expect inflationary headwinds to continue impacting Domino's and the broader restaurant industry over the coming quarters, but we will face all of these challenges and headwinds from a position of strength and with the unwavering commitment of our franchisees and team members who proudly wear the Domino's logo. My team and I are proud to serve them each and every day.
 So thank you again for joining us today, and we'll now be happy to take your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. 
Brian Bittner: Rich, the labor staffing issues was obviously highlighted as an incremental challenge in the quarter. Do you guys have any data to try to help us, on the outside, quantify how these capacity and service issues from labor staffing challenges maybe impacted the trends in the quarter? And also these staffing issues, are they specifically preventing you from deploying traffic-driving initiatives throughout the system, like utilizing the 50% boost weeks, et cetera? 
Richard Allison: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Staffing has been a challenge, most certainly during the quarter, as we highlighted. It's -- I don't have a lot to share with you today in terms of specific stats about what that headwind is on the comp because it's always difficult to say what sales might have been without staffing challenges.
 But what I can tell you is that when you look at the third quarter relative to the first half of the year, we certainly saw more of an impact in the system around some things like reduced operating hours and some challenges with respect to delivery service times in particular. 
 And when we look in our own corporate store business, we certainly saw our staffing levels, relative to ideal, were lower than we saw during the first half of the year. So the impact on the comp in the U.S. was more pronounced in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter. 
 And as it relates to how we think about the business going forward, the staffing challenges do impact our ability to be more aggressive as it relates to promotional activities in the marketplace. So we're continuing, obviously, to monitor the levels across our system. In our corporate store business, we are doing things proactively, like looking at our wages, compensation for our team members, and as I spoke about earlier, working across the system, rolling out an applicant tracking system to help with team member acquisition and hiring. And then we're also working on a number of operational improvements inside of our stores to allow us to operate more efficiently, and frankly, with less labor for every order that goes out. And then finally, I'd just highlight the carryout business will continue to be a focus of ours given the significantly lower amount of labor involved in those transactions and the fact that's been a big growth driver for us anyway. We're going to continue pushing there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. 
Peter Saleh: Great. So Rich, you mentioned on a couple of occasions the impact of the labor challenges on the comps. But can you talk a little bit about the labor challenges and maybe the impact on the industry on independents? Are you seeing more closures there? I suspect if you're seeing these issues and feeling these issues on labor that your competitive set is feeling it just as much, if not more. Any comments on closures in the industry? 
Richard Allison: Pete, thanks. I certainly believe that the staffing challenges are impacting the restaurant industry more broadly. As I take a look across the industry and talk to leaders in the industry, it's certainly a common theme that you hear. 
 In terms of how that's impacting independents, I don't have great statistics for you about what's going on with closures there, but I can tell you that I think the impact of staffing and rising labor costs and also, frankly, rising commodity costs, where independents are typically less able to buy -- are less able to buy with the scale and also to lock in pricing as the larger players, like we are, I suspect that there is a lot of pressure on the P&L among some of the independents and smaller regionals out there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Mullan with Deutsche Bank. 
Brian Mullan: Ritch, last call, you indicated the carryout order counts in the U.S. had not quite reached the 2019 levels. Just wondering if they got back to even or close to in the third quarter relative to where they were in 2019. The country was dealing with Delta, but there was also a broad reopening. So just any color on the carryout business order counts would be great. 
Richard Allison: Sure. When we look at our carryout order counts, we are still not quite back to where we were 2 years ago on carryout order counts despite having positive carryout same-store sales in the third quarter. But it continues to be a focus for us and an area where we continue to see strong opportunity to continue the long-term growth trajectory of that side of the business.
 We just launched these Dips & Twists that just went on air this week as just yet another tool coming from our innovation team to help us continue to push carryout and push it at that $7.99 hero price point that we've got there. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. 
John Glass: Ritch, just 2 follow-ups. One is, is the labor issue most focused on drivers that would make that maybe more of a delivery company issue? Or do you think it's -- is it in the restaurants as well? I just want to make sure we understand if it's more specific to your type of business versus others.
 And can you talk about -- I know you talked about independents, but is there -- how do you think you are on a market share basis this quarter, just so we can understand how maybe you think you're doing versus your largest peers to the extent you have insight into that? Did you gain share or lose share? Is everyone sort of in the same boat given the external factors you've cited? 
Richard Allison: Thanks, John. First, on the labor, what I would tell you is that it is more pronounced with respect to drivers, but we see labor challenges really across our business. And as I look broadly across the industry, the restaurant industry, both the retail side and the distribution side of that, I think -- and frankly among suppliers, I think labor continues to be a significant challenge. You look at the number of open job positions across the U.S. right now, it's a pretty staggering number. And a lot of those are certainly related to our industry. But drivers, in particular, have been challenging as we look over the last -- the third quarter.
 And then as it relates to market share, we don't get great real-time data on that. And we always take -- when we do get it on a quarterly basis, we always like to see a few quarters of trend before we get really comfortable about what those external views of the market look like. But we do continue to believe that we and the larger players in the market continue to gain share at the expense of some of the smaller chains and some of the locals. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. 
Jared Garber: Obviously, labor continues to be a topic of discussion, but I wanted to maybe take it a little bit of a different route. The offset there would obviously be pricing. So Ritch, I wanted to ask how you're thinking about pricing across the menu and if there's any thoughts about maybe potentially increasing those $5.99 and $7.99 platforms that you're so well known for and just how you think about offsetting some of these highly inflationary pressures. 
Richard Allison: Sure, Jared. Thanks. As we are -- currently, as we do, on a very frequent basis, taking a look at our price points. We test them on a pretty frequent basis over time and really with an eye to what are the price points in the marketplace that can help us to drive long-term profitable growth for our franchisees. So we are certainly taking a look at those again. Here, as we look forward into 2022, there are cost pressures across the business, as you highlight, both on the labor side, but also inflationary pressures as it relates to commodities as well.
 So we're taking all of those things into account as we think about what our pricing looks like in 2022. And what I'll tell you there is that we will, as always, do it with the long-term profitable growth of the franchisees in mind. And while we are wedded to value, we are not specifically wedded to any individual price points. And if a better price point yields better long-term profitable growth for our franchisees, then that's where we're going to go. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. 
Andrew Strelzik: I appreciate the commentary on some of the sales constraints that you mentioned. But I'm just curious, and I know, historically, you said these are 2 distinct occasions, but do you think as we're kind of normalizing from an operating environment perspective and trying to find an equilibrium or normal, do you think you're seeing more switching between carryout and delivery? Or do you continue to believe that that's really not the case, even kind of in this unique period here? 
Richard Allison: Yes. It's a great question because -- and as you highlight, historically, we've not seen a lot of switching across those 2 service methods. And in fact, only about 15% of customers would go back and forth between the 2. But it's an interesting question that I think opens up to your point as we work our way out of COVID and as we and across the industry continue to see some of these staffing challenges and labor cost increases which do result in higher delivery fees.
 As Jessica highlighted earlier, we've seen some increase in our single transparent delivery fees across markets. And we've certainly seen prices go up as it relates to delivery charges or even what it takes you to go across town when you hail an Uber or a Lyft. So I think it is an open question as to how much more switching we might see when the cost of delivery continues to rise for consumers. So those are some of the things that we're obviously thinking about and testing here.
 We're also really pushing on this Carside Delivery as a service method to try to make things significantly more convenient for customers to pick up product. Eliminating the need to go into the store and pay and carry your own food out, we think is a significant improvement in the consumer experience and may tip some more consumers over to come into the carryout channel as opposed to delivery. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. 
John Ivankoe: The question is on U.S. unit development. Certainly, we understand labor. We understand the construction-related issues, but there was a comment made that fortressing is affecting company stores more than franchise stores. And if you look at -- excuse me, company store development is up something like 5% year-over-year. The comp is down whatever it is, 8.9%. If one were to assume that half of that comp decline is due to fortressing, would basically mean that the new stores actually aren't -- are basically getting all their volume from nearby stores? I know that's -- it's very bad math to mention this on a conference call, but the numbers are -- could potentially look fairly exaggerated in terms of the amount of sales transfer that's happening to a new store that acts as a fortress store.
 So can you comment on just kind of what the current algorithm is in fortressing, I mean, when you open new stores for both company and franchise, the percentage of sales that it expects to get on its own versus the percentage of sales that it expects to get elsewhere. And considering the labor and the construction environment that we've talked about, are you prepared to talk about how materially lower potentially fiscal '22 development in the U.S. could be relative to '21, which I think would be consistent with some comments that you made of units being delayed in the overall U.S. system. 
Richard Allison: John, yes, I'll try to pick off some of the parts of your question there. First of all, on U.S. unit development, I'll just make a macro comment overall. There is still a very healthy demand out there among our franchisee base for unit development. I've highlighted some of the challenges in the near term of getting these stores open. But when we take a look at the profit of the 4-wall profitability at the store level and the resulting cash-on-cash returns for Domino's, which is ultimately what drives store growth, it's still very, very strong.
 And as we continue to dust off our models to take a look at what the U.S. holding capacity is for Domino's stores, we continue to be very bullish about that holding capacity. I've talked about 8,000 store potential in the past, and we believe it's at least that, if not more, as we continue to dust it off. 
 When we open new stores, a significant portion of those are fortress stores in that they do take some number of addresses from existing store service areas. When we take a look at the impact that, that has on the comp, I have spoken in the past about that being 1 point, 1.5 points or so. If you take a look at the third quarter, it was about 1 point when you look across the system and a bit higher than that on the corporate store side because, to your point, we have been a little bit more aggressive in terms of percentage opens off the base, but also basically every store we open in our corporate store business is a fortress store. 
 But when we take a look at what the cash-on-cash return expectations are for those openings and we look at it, not only on the individual new store, but we look at it on the impact of the store cluster that, that store is a part of, we still see very positive returns on those stores, and that's why we continue to be aggressive in the growth of our corporate stores. 
 So it -- fortressing is going to continue to be a key part of our strategy, John, and I haven't seen anything in the quarter that gives me any sense that we should be slowing down. There is still a lot of opportunity out there to continue opening Domino's stores around the country. 
John Ivankoe: And just because I think that there's going to be such a point of conversation, I mean, can we -- can you give us at least a soft guide of '22 U.S. development relative to '21? Is that something that you're prepared to do at this point? 
Richard Allison: We're not going to do that today, John. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Guggenheim. 
Gregory Francfort: My question is on the technology upgrades. But do you have staffing as a percent of maybe where your target was in the quarter? Just any quantification on that. But my question is, Ritch, I know you've been putting a lot of investments and focus on upgrading the technology platforms, PULSE 2.0. Can you just help us understand where that stands and when that may have an impact on the business? 
Richard Allison: Sure. Yes, Greg, in terms of staffing relative to where we'd like it to be, I don't have a specific percentage to share with you today. It varies pretty significantly market by market because the labor markets around the country are so unique. And obviously, we've got direct visibility into the corporate store markets that we operate but not direct visibility into all of our franchise locations who obviously manage their own employment base. 
 On tech, I made brief reference to this earlier in my prepared remarks, but we've had a really exciting milestone over the course of the last several months where we now have our new version of PULSE operating on a continuous basis in a live store. So the team has just done a terrific job of developing that to the point where we've got the minimum viable product to have out in a store today that allows us to continue to test and learn. And our expectation is that we continue to expand the initial phase of that rollout with a few more stores this year. And then as we continue to learn and improve the product, we'll be able to come back to you in subsequent quarters and give you a little bit more of a sense of the pace of rollout of that product. 
 But when we go in and have a look at how it's operating in the stores, it is easier to manage transactions inside the store and significantly easier to get new team members up to speed on the use of PULSE. 
 And then as it relates to our ongoing development and evolution of the product, the architecture that we've used with PULSE is a -- is transformational for us in terms of our ability to respond more quickly and add enhancements and updates to the product versus the architecture that the current version of PULSE is on. So we're excited about it, and you'll hear a lot more about it from us in the future. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. 
David Tarantino: Ritch, I want to circle back on the issue related to staffing and get your thoughts on what you think needs to happen for you and the industry to get this resolved. It seems like the industry needs to consider maybe a structural step change in wage rates here and maybe much more aggressive than what's already been done, and I'm wondering if you agree with that.
 And then secondly, how your franchisees are approaching it. It seems like they entered the year with all-time high profitability and should be willing to fund that to get the staffing levels right, but maybe I'm missing that. So any perspective you can offer would be helpful. 
Richard Allison: Yes, David. It's a great question, and I can tell you it's something we spend a lot of time on around here each and every day and have a lot of conversations with our operators and franchisees about it. When you think about what has to happen in the labor market,for our industry, I think there are a couple of things that are under our control, and then there are a couple of things that are more macro factors. If I start with kind of -- with the macro factors, most certainly, there have been a significant number of Americans who have removed themselves from the workforce over the course of COVID and haven't come back yet. If you look at labor force participation rates, they are down rather significantly from pre-COVID. 
 We have not seen it yet, as much as we would like, but we do expect there to be some relaxing of the labor market as COVID continues to subside and as folks get more comfortable, have more options to care for their children, et cetera, to get back out into the workforce. I have no doubt that this Delta variant, over the course of the last several months, has made that recovery more challenging. 
 We also have not had much in the way of immigration into the U.S. here over the course of the last couple of years. And in a country whose population is not growing as it used to, we, in our industry and a number of others, will need more immigration, I think, to continue to have a robust workforce, particularly in the younger age groups. 
 So those are some macro things that we can't really control. What we spend our time thinking about is what we can control. Wages is one of those levers. I spoke earlier about the fact that we have made some significant moves in our own corporate store business, and we've done that in our supply chain business as well. And as we talk to franchisees, we don't control their employment practices or wages, but we hear from many franchisees that they are also investing in their team members. And frankly, with the profitability levels that we have in our stores, we are much better positioned than many players in the restaurant industry to be able to invest in our teams. 
 But then also, as an industry and as a company, we also have to think about the jobs themselves and how do we make those jobs easier and more appealing to team members. And we're spending a lot of time on that inside our business and piloting a number of exciting things in our corporate stores where we're looking fundamentally at the jobs themselves. How do we make them easier? How do we keep drivers in their cars 100% of the time and not have them do tasks inside the stores that they don't enjoy doing and that don't drive tips for them? How do we bring more technology into the stores to allow us to operate more efficiently with fewer labor hours per unit of sales?
 So we're looking at all of these elements. And while it's a challenge, I feel like we're very well positioned with the profitability that we've got in our stores and also really well positioned, just based on the innovation and technology teams that we've built over time, who -- this is power alley for them to go in and figure out how to solve these problems alongside our great operators. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. 
Dennis Geiger: Great. Ritch, you talked about the impact from the waning benefits of stimulus. And specifically curious if you're kind of able to identify any specific shift that you've seen in customer behavior from that benefit fading or anything else that you would kind of point out that changed from 2Q into 3Q with that benefit starting to fade some. 
Richard Allison: Yes. Dennis, thanks for the question. We saw a boost back in the second quarter when the $1,400 stimulus payments went out. You had the onetime payment, and then you also had the unemployment which was introduced at that time and ultimately completed, I believe, in first or second week of September. And I think what we saw was, as consumers spent off that $1,400 and as some of those unemployment benefits waned, the impact was really more pronounced, we believe, on our delivery business than it was on the carryout business. So I think we had more customers with money in their pockets also worried about COVID, and more of those were ordering delivery into their homes, and we saw that taper off in the third quarter relative to what we saw in the second quarter. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. 
Lauren Silberman: Another one on labor. More broadly, it feels like some structural headwinds, increased competition from 3P platforms, people have left the industry and then just higher manual labor costs. A follow-up to your response to David's question, can you expand on the technology you're exploring to address labor headwinds over the medium to long term like automation perhaps more so than you would have considered, call it, 6 to 12 months ago? 
Richard Allison: Sure, Lauren. And we're looking at that really in several areas of our business. At the store level, which we've spent most of the time talking about today, one of the key things that we're working on is in an environment where driver staffing is one of the constraints, key question is how do you keep drivers in their car more? And how do you get more deliveries per hour through those drivers?
 We introduced some time ago our GPS tools that are in the hands of drivers. That's a core technology that helps them to be more efficient. The technology underpinning of Domino's Carside Delivery and the operational practices that we've instituted around that are also key ways for us to think about driving more efficiency with our delivery drivers. Because if we can identify when a customer pulls into the parking lot and run a pizza out to that customer's car, there's no reason why -- and we're doing it in a lot of stores around the country, no reason why we can't just run pizzas out to drivers' cars as well. 
 And when I think about the Domino's I would like to see in the future, I don't see why drivers should ever have to get out of their cars. Why can't we keep them turning to the store, back to the customer and maximizing deliveries per driver per hour which also maximizes the wages that those drivers earn? So there are a number of different things going on there inside the stores. Our next-generation version of our point-of-sale system, along with other store technology innovations, are also helping us to get more productivity, to drive more productivity in the stores. 
 And then lastly, outside of the stores, if I shift gears over to our supply chain centers, as we build these new centers and as we go back and replace assets in existing centers, we're putting in place equipment and technology that reduce the amount of labor that is required to produce our dough balls and to manage the distribution of product out to our stores as well. 
Operator: And our last question will come from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. 
Christopher Carril: So I wanted to ask about the surprise frees promotion. I mean to what extent do you think the promotion helped to offset some of those declining stimulus tailwinds and other delivery headwinds that you had pointed out? And I think the promotion continues into November. So are you planning on marketing it more over these next few weeks? 
Richard Allison: Yes. Chris, we just rolled it out a few weeks back, and we're getting a lot of exciting press out of it. And I think it really -- it plays on a tension, a consumer tension. And that's one of the things we think about always when we think about great advertising at Domino's is how does it play on a consumer tension. And consumers tell us that they get increasingly irritated about all of these fees that they get charged, so we've decided to do the flip side of that and do surprise frees.
 So far, we're pleased with the customer reception to the campaign. We're going to continue to run it in the weeks ahead and excited about how that can continue to position Domino's as the transparent and value-oriented player in the market. So we remain excited about it. Look forward to sharing results as we -- as the program continues to evolve. And as we see how it behaves in the quarter, we look forward to talking to you about it in more depth when we report our fourth quarter results out. 
 All right, folks. Well, thank you so much for joining us on the call this morning, and I look forward to getting back together with you in February to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via the website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Ritch Allison.
Ritch Allison: Thanks, Jenny, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Overall, I am very pleased with our results this quarter, which once again demonstrated the strength of the Domino's brand around the world. We are still navigating to the COVID pandemic across the globe. Throughout the last 18 months, our franchisees have continued to step up to the challenge in service to their customers, their community and their team members. I continue to be extremely proud of our global franchisees and their extraordinary efforts to provide outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences. You've heard me often about the importance of global retail sales growth and how that drives our business model. During the second quarter, we delivered 17.1% global retail sales growth excluding foreign currency impact, driven by a powerful combination of growth in U.S. same-store sales, international same-store sales and global store accounts. The second quarter marked our 41st consecutive quarter of U.S. same-store sales growth and our 110th consecutive quarter of international same-store sales growth. We also reinforced our leadership position in the pizza category with a very strong quarter of global store growth highlighted by the opening of our 18,000th store. We celebrated this terrific milestone with the opening of a beautiful store in La Junta, Colorado. The pace of net store growth has accelerated significantly during the first half of this year. When you look at it on a trailing four-quarter basis our pace of net store growth has increased from 624 in Q4, 2020 to 884 in Q2, 2021. During the quarter we also completed our $1.85 billion refinancing transaction, lowering the cost of our debt and giving us the capacity to return $1 billion to our shareholders through our recently completed accelerated share repurchase transaction. Overall, the Domino's brand continues to deliver as our strong same-store sales, store growth and resulting retail sales growth deliver great returns to our franchisees and our shareholders. I'll turn the call over now to Jessica Parrish, our Controller and Treasurer. She will take you through the details of the quarter. And then after that, I'll come back and share some additional observations about the quarter and some thoughts around how we are approaching the business going forward. Jessica, over to you.
Jessica Parrish: Thank you Ritch, and good morning everyone. We are excited to share our strong second quarter results with you today. Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world generated impressive operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.06 for Q2. Our diluted EPS, as adjusted for certain items related to our recapitalization transaction completed during the quarter was $3.12. In Q2, we continue to see positive momentum in both the U.S. and International businesses in both same-store sales performance and net unit growth leading to strong global retail sales growth. Global retail sales grew 21.6% in Q2 as compared to Q2, 2020. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 17.1%. Breaking down total global retail sales growth, U.S. retail sales grew 7.4% and international retail sales grew 39.7%. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, international retail sales through 29.5% rolling over a prior year decrease of 3.4%. The prior year decrease in international retail sales excluding foreign currency resulted primarily from temporary store closures, changes in store hours and service method disruptions in certain international markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Turning to comps. During Q2, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 41 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 110 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. Same-store sales in the U.S. grew 3.5% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 16.1%. Same-store sales for international business grew 13.9% rolling over a prior year increase of 1.3%. Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 3.9% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 2.6%. As we noted on our Q1 call, we continue to observe a larger spread between the top-line performance of our franchise stores and our company-owned stores than we have historically seen. We believe this is primarily a function of the heavily urban and higher income footprint of our company-owned store markets relative to be more diverse mix across our franchise space. The U.S. comp this quarter was driven by ticket growth due to increases in items per order and our transparent delivery fee, as well as the mix of products we sell. Order counts on a same-store basis were consistent with Q2, 2020 levels, which were higher than Q2, 2019 levels as a result of customer ordering behavior during the pandemic. The international comp was driven by order growth due to the return of non-delivery service methods, the resumption of normal store hours and the reopening of stores that were temporarily closed in certain of our international markets in Q2, 2020. Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 35 net stores in the U.S. during the second quarter, consisting of 39 store openings and four closures. Our international business added 203 net stores comprised of 217 store openings and 14 closures. Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the second quarter were up approximately $112.4 million or 12.2% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which generated higher revenues across all areas of our business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $4 million in Q2, 2021 as compared to the prior year quarter. Our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 39.5% in Q2, 2021 from 38.8% in the prior year due primarily to higher revenues from our U.S. franchise business. Company-owned store margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 24.5% from 23.1% primarily as a result of lower labor costs partially offset by higher food costs. Recall, that we incurred additional bonus pay in the second quarter of last year for team members on the front lines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 11% from 11.9% in the prior year quarter resulting primarily from higher insurance and food costs, as well as higher fixed operating costs driven by depreciation and our new supply chain facilities opened last year. These increases were partially offset by lower labor costs. G&A expenses increased approximately $12.3 million in Q2 as compared to Q2, 2020 resulting from higher labor costs, including higher variable performance-based compensation and non-cash compensation expense partially offset by lower professional fees. Additionally, as we discussed on our Q1 call, we completed our most recent recapitalization transaction during the second quarter in April. In connection with the re-capitalization, we incurred approximately $500,000 of pre-tax G&A expenses for certain professional fees, which is included as an item affecting comparability in this morning's earnings release. Net interest expense increased approximately $6.7 million in the quarter driven by a higher average debt balance. This increase in interest expense also includes $2.3 million of pre-tax incremental interest related to the recapitalization transaction, which has been adjusted out as an item affecting comparability in this morning's earnings release. Our weighted average borrowing rate for Q2, 2021 was 3.8%, down from 3.9% in Q2, 2020. Our effective tax rate was 19.6% for the quarter as compared to 4.7% in Q2, 2020. The effective tax rate in Q2, 2021 includes a 2.3 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. This compares to an 18.5 percentage point positive impact in Q2, 2020. This decrease was due to significantly fewer stock option exercises in Q2 of this year. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits. Combining all of these elements, our second quarter net income was down $2 million or 1.7% versus Q2, 2020. On a pre-tax basis we were up $20.6 million or 16.5% over the prior year. Our diluted EPS in Q2 was $3.06 versus $2.99 in the prior year. Our diluted EPS, as adjusted for the impact of the recapitalization transaction was $3.12, an increase of $0.13 or 4.3% over the prior year. Breaking down that $0.13 increase in our diluted EPS as adjusted, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.53. Net interest expense adjusted for the impact of the items affecting comparability I discussed previously, negatively impacted us by $0.08, a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.12. And finally, our higher effective tax rate resulting from lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation negatively impacted us by $0.44. Shifting to cash. Our strong financial model continued to generate significant cash flow throughout the second quarter. During Q2, we regenerated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $143 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $126 million. Regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on CapEx in Q2, primarily on our technology initiatives including our next generation's point-of-sale system. As previously disclosed, during Q2, we also entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction for $1 billion. We've received and retired approximately 2 million shares at the beginning of the ASR. The ASR settled yesterday and we received and retired an additional 238,000 shares in connection with this transaction. In total, the average repurchase price throughout the ASR program was $444.29 per share. Additionally, and as noted in this morning's release, subsequent to the end of the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of our common stock. We also paid a $0.94 quarterly dividend on June 30th. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share to be paid on September 30th. In closing, our business continued its strong performance during the second quarter, and we are very pleased with the results our franchisees and team members around the world delivered. Thank you all for attending the call today. And now, I will turn it back over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thanks Jessica. And I'll begin my comments with a look at our U.S. business. For months now many of you have been asking, how we would lap the tough comparisons from Q2 of last year? My answer has always been that we're not focused on managing to a 12-week quarter. We are focused on building the business for the long term. And that long-term focus on great product, service, image and technology is precisely why we were able to deliver a terrific quarter, highlighted by 7.4% U.S. retail sales growth, lapping 19.9% from Q2, 2020. Turning to same-store sales. Perhaps the thing I'm most pleased about when I look at the 3.5% U.S. comp, is the fact that we were able to hold orders flat while overlapping the big gains from Q2, 2020. I'm also pleased that our ticket growth was driven by a very healthy balance of more items per order and modest menu price and delivery fee increases. We achieved positive comps in both our delivery and carryout businesses with delivery driven by ticket and carryout driven by a balance of order count and ticket growth. We continue to see strong growth across our business in the quarter. You've often asked, if our sales growth might be weaker in markets that had more fully reopened. But to the contrary, the opposite trend emerged through the second quarter where we saw higher levels of sales growth in the second quarter in the markets with fewer COVID-related restrictions. Similar to Q1, we saw that comp growth in rural areas outperformed urban areas and less affluent areas outperformed more affluent areas. These differences combined with the impact of more aggressive fortressing accounted for much of the same store sales gap between our corporate store and franchise store businesses. We saw sales benefits during the quarter from the federal government stimulus particularly the checks that were delivered back in March. It's difficult to quantify the magnitude of the impact of the one-time distributions and the ongoing unemployment and other government payments to consumers, but we believe that they do continue to have some positive sales impact on our business. Due to the strong sales throughout the quarter, we once again elected not to run any of our aggressive boost week promotions, but instead remain focused on providing great service and offering great value to our customers every day. As we continue to experience COVID overlaps, we believe it will be instructive to continue to look at the cumulative stack of comparable U.S. same-store sales anchored back to 2019 as a pre-COVID baseline. At 19.6% for Q2, we saw a material sequential improvement of the two-year stack when compared to the first quarter. Beyond the comps when you look at the absolute dollars, our second quarter same-store average weekly unit sales in the U.S. exceeded $27,000, another sequential uptick from the levels seen in the first quarter. Now turning to the other critical component of our retail sales growth, new store openings. Our addition of 35 net stores was softer than we expected. We have a very strong pipeline of future openings, but had a number of stores delayed due to store level staffing challenges and construction permitting or equipment delays. We hope to accelerate the pace of openings during the second half of the year as some of the delays in unit growth may subside. I'll turn and speak now about the carryout and the delivery businesses. We saw the return of carryout order growth in Q2 and we continue to build awareness of Domino's Carside Delivery. We ran a brief 49% off Carside Delivery awareness campaign during the quarter. And just region just recently launched a campaign highlighting our Carside Delivery, two-minute guarantee. This campaign hits on two key elements of the Domino's brand, service and value. Our franchisees and operators have fully embraced Carside Delivery and we are consistently averaging below two minutes out the door and on our way to the customer's cars. This is a great technology enabled way to serve our customers and will remain an important part of our strategy as we continue to evolve the carryout experience, not only to enhance the loyalty of our current carryout customers, but also to reach a new different and largely untapped drive-through oriented customer going forward. For the delivery business, I was also very pleased to see positive delivery same-store sales growth during Q2, while facing very difficult overlaps. We brought back The Noid to highlight our partnership with Nuro for autonomous delivery. This campaign hits on our technology and innovation leadership, while having a little bit of fun with our old nemesis, The Noid. We continue to learn as we pilot a true autonomous pizza delivery experience to select customers in the Houston market. Now turning to staffing. I'll reiterate something I said back in April. We continue to operate in a very difficult staffing environment for our stores and our supply chain centers. The combination of COVID, strong sales, the accelerating economic growth across the country and the ongoing government stimulus continue to result in one of the most difficult staffing environments that we've seen in a long time. And frankly, this led to higher margins in our corporate store business than we would like to see. The reality is that we were operating during the quarter with fewer team members than we would like to have in many of our stores. This puts pressure on our operators to meet demand while continuing to deliver great service. In the back half of the year, we expect to implement additional wage increases across certain corporate store markets and positions. In the face of these challenges I want to thank our U.S. franchisees and our corporate store operators for their ongoing efforts to attract and retain great team members in a very tight labor market. And as we look forward in the U.S. business, we will continue to make the necessary investments to drive retail sales growth into the future. We recently announced our plans to build another supply chain center in Indiana, which we expect to complete by the end of 2022. We are making solid progress on the rewrite of our POS, point-of-sale system and we'll continue that multi-year investment along with additional investment in our enterprise systems to support the business. We will continue to invest in technology, operations and product innovation to support our carryout and our delivery businesses. We are continuing to raise wages and invest in our hourly team members. And of course as always, we will remain focused on value for our customers. So I'll close out our discussion of the U.S. business by simply saying that the Domino's brand has never been stronger. And I remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth. Now let's move on to international. It was an outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. Our 29.5% international retail sales growth excluding foreign currency impact was supported by an exceptional 13.9% comp, continuing the momentum we had in the first quarter. As I discussed earlier with our U.S. business, we're also watching the two-year comp stacks for international anchoring back to pre-COVID 2019 and will continue to do so throughout 2021. Q2 represented a 15.2% two-year stack, a sequential improvement over the first quarter. I'm particularly pleased with our strong momentum on store growth as international provides a significant push toward our two to three-year outlook of 6% to 8% global net unit growth. Our 203 net stores in Q2 increased our trailing four quarter pace of international store growth to 653 net stores. Our accelerated store growth continues to be driven by our outstanding unit level economics and the strong commitment of our international master franchise partners. During the quarter, COVID continued to have a significant impact on many of our international markets and we expect COVID to remain a challenge in many parts of the world for some time to come. At the end of the quarter, we had fewer than 175 temporary store closures with many of those located in India, which has been hit particularly hard by COVID. And I want to take a minute here to thank Jubilant Food Works, our master franchisee in India for their outstanding commitment to their team members during this very difficult time. The company mounted a series of initiatives to support their employees and families through this unprecedented crisis. This included a cross-functional team that provided employee assistance 24x7, as well as several COVID isolation centers with oxygen concentrator banks. Jubilant mounted a massive vaccination drive for all their employees and dependent family members. Challenging times always bring out the best in Domino's franchisees and I could not be more proud of our leaders in India and how they have responded to this crisis. I'd also like to highlight a few international markets that drove terrific growth during the quarter. China passed the 400 store milestone during Q2 and once again Dash, our master franchise partner delivered outstanding retail sales growth for the brand. China is without question one of the most exciting businesses in the Domino's system with significant long-term runway for growth. Japan reached the 800-store milestone in the weeks following the close of our second quarter and continued the outstanding performance under master franchisee Domino's Pizza Enterprises ownership. The U.K., Germany, Mexico and Turkey were also large market highlights in a strong quarter of performance across our international business. I am proud of our master franchisees and their operators for their great work thus far in 2021. And I remain optimistic about our international retail sales growth opportunity over the long term. So in closing, I'm very happy with our Q2 results. Great franchisees and operators combined with outstanding unit level economics place us in an enviable position within our industry and give us a strong foundation for future growth. There is absolutely no question that Domino's is the global leader in QSR Pizza. But there is still so much opportunity ahead of us to drive global retail sales growth and to grow market share around the world in both our delivery and carryout businesses. As we look to the back half of the year and beyond, you can be confident that we will remain focused on winning the long game. So thank you again for joining us today. And we'll now be happy to take some of your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. You may proceed with your question.
Brian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning, congratulations. Ritch, you highlighted the importance of paying attention to the two-year same store sales trend both in the press release and on this earnings call. And that trend obviously accelerated meaningfully in the second quarter? Is pegging this two-year trend relevant in your mind for the rest of the year including the fourth quarter, because sustaining it would imply a pretty big jump in the one year same store sales in the fourth quarter. And I just think in general, folks remain a bit confused, how this accelerated business performance that Domino's is generating is able to occur in this reopening environment? You actually suggested that more reopen footprints are outperforming. So can you just put some insights into the core drivers of this dynamic that you're seeing within your business?
Ritch Alliso: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. We do feel that it's instructive to take a look at the business, comparing back to that pre-COVID anchor if you will of 2019. Because there's so many dynamics that have occurred over the last 18 months that for us as we look at the business internally and we think constructive for our investors as well, really understanding what is that longer term trend and the growth in the business is important. We're not making any statements or projections today about the third or fourth quarters of this year. Just merely sharing with you how those trends are unfolding on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Because there's still so many factors there that are driving the business. Obviously, those things that we have under our control, but there are also many factors externally outside of our control that are difficult to predict. What happens with -- as COVID continues to unfold with the delta variant for example, what happens with respect to ongoing government stimulus and intervention in the economy, all of those things will continue to play a factor as we look at what happens with comps and what that resulting one and two year comp, a profile looks like over time. You asked about the dynamics going on in markets that are reopening. Like many of you, we've obviously been watching very studiously. What happens as some of these markets around the country reopen. And I think it's important to remember that our business is a -- it's a delivery business, but it's also a very robust carryout business. And so, when markets close down, and I've talked about this several times over the last year. It had a negative impact on our carryout business. So as we see markets reopen, we get some positive tailwind on the carryout business. And then also for our delivery business, the fact that we've been able to stay very focused on value for our customers, we saw a positive comp in the in the second quarter on the delivery business as well, even though markets had reopened. So we'll keep tracking the one and two year basis looking across both of those businesses and as the year unfolds on a quarterly basis we'll continue to share those insights back with you.
Brian Bittner: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. You may proceed with your question.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks. Ritch, I wanted to ask about the competitive environment. Now that it seems like the economy is somewhat reopened or mostly reopened. How do you feel the competitive environment is looking right now? Especially with respect to independents. Do you feel like independents are stronger today or weaker post-COVID? Just trying to get a sense on if you feel like you guys are taking share from independents or where those market share gains are coming from? Thanks.
Ritch Alliso: Sure. Thanks Peter. It's still -- as the market continues to unfold here, there's still a lot of moving parts. And so, we're always a little careful to make definitive statements about market share movements until we see a few quarters behind us. But at least some of the indications that we have now are that the larger chains are driving most of the growth in the pizza category right now, with independent kind of more flat to down. So, best we can tell, growing market with share being gained by the larger chains and certainly as the largest chain we are taking some of that share.
Peter Saleh: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question.
John Glass: Thanks very much. Ritch, I wanted to go back to your comments about the labor and the wage environment. One, you talked about how much you're taking some pricing yourself at company stores, maybe what that is to contextualize that? And how are franchisees managing that? You said that they're taking moderate amounts of pricing or there's moderate amount of pricing in your -- and maybe it's your company comps maybe assumed that's the franchise as well. Does that open the conversation about what the price point should be at Domino's given this unique market environment should -- is you're sort of locked into these 599, 799 price points. Is there more friction around that conversation given the cost of labor? And if there is how do you answer that question or the franchisees might ask about pricing?
Ritch Alliso: Sure. Thanks John. And this is certainly something that we think about all of the time. To the first part of your question, most certainly when we look at the labor and the wage environment, wages are only going in one direction over time and that is up. Some of that obviously is dictated by some of the minimum wage changes that are happening, another round of which occurred in here in July. But also just the general supply and demand equation in the labor market is causing wages to go up. And we're certainly continue to invest more in our hourly team members in our corporate store business to make sure that we can remain staffed and serve our customers. When we think about how do we offset those wage increases and still deliver a terrific four-wall economic model? Pricing is certainly one of the levers that is out there. And at the local level we do this in our corporate stores. And our franchisees have -- they have the latitude to do this for their businesses. We have taken some increases in our single transparent delivery fee. We charge -- wherever we are we charge a single fee. It varies significantly market-to-market based on the local dynamics. But that's certainly a lever that we and our franchisees have pulled. And then menu pricing, our franchisees have control of that. And in the higher wage markets you will find higher menu prices -- generally higher menu prices at Domino's. As it relates to the national offers, our 599 and 799 hero offers, we continue to test those on a very frequent basis. Not just looking at which offers would drive the most top line, but more importantly, what's going to drive the strongest four-wall EBITDA for our stores. And 599 and 799 have continued to emerge from the many, many offers that we test on a frequent basis. But what I'll tell you is, if we find an offer or if the dynamics change stuff that such that a different offer drives higher levels of profit for our franchisees then we would move to that offer. 599 and 799 are not sacred. The only thing that is sacred is that we're going to bring value to the consumer. Because that's what drives order counts and ultimately order counts over time are correlated with sales and with profitability at the store level. So something we are always looking at John and always talking to our franchisees about.
John Glass: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.
Jared Garber: Hi. Thanks for thanks for the question. It's a little bit of a follow-up on some of the previous questions as it relates maybe to the competitive landscape. We've seen a little bit more menu innovation maybe from some of the larger direct pizza LSR competitors recently, maybe over the last six months or so. And I think the consumer is seemingly willing to pay more for some offers now and for some more maybe surprise and delight. So I wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about menu innovation going forward? Obviously, like the operations and the simplicity of everything makes sense from a franchisee economics perspective. But wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about innovation from here?
Ritch Alliso: Sure Jared. Appreciate the question. Our overall philosophy and approach really hasn't changed around menu innovation. We are constantly testing a robust pipeline of new products and platforms for the menu. But we hold it to a pretty high standard in terms of what ultimately gets on our menu. Because we're not just looking to put things on the menu to drive sales for a limited amount of time. So that's you don't see us use LTOs and you shouldn't expect to see us using those into the future. What we are looking for products that can drive incrementality in revenue and in profit. So we test products not only for where they would mix on the menu, but more importantly once you take into effect the potential cannibalization from other menu items, are we delivering incremental revenue and profit at the store level? You asked a little bit about premium and customers willing to pay more. When we introduced our two new specialty pizzas, the chicken taco and the cheeseburger. Those were all about bringing some more premium products to that specialty line, which gives the franchisee an opportunity for some incremental revenue over and above our more traditional products that are offered on the 599 menu. So, we'll continue to look for opportunities there. And when we introduce something like those two specialty pizzas, it's not just to drive sales of those two pizzas, but we also see that that elevates sales of the specialty line in general, which is a more premium line. So as we look forward you should expect to see us continue to roll out new products. As has been the past, you probably won't see us rolling them out or as fast or as in as significant quantity as some of the other players in the industry, simply because we've just got a different strategy in terms of how we look at it. And I suspect it goes without saying. But a big part of that strategy is also just managing the level of change and complexity on our operators in our 6,000 plus stores across the country.
Jared Garber: Thanks Ritch. Appreciate the color.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. You may proceed with your question.
Andrew Strelzik: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious how your conversations more broadly are going with franchisees at the moment. I guess, it wouldn't surprise me if kind of going into this period against the tough compares. There was maybe a little bit of uncertainty among the U.S. franchisees. But now obviously that you're demonstrating the performance against those comparisons, I'm just curious how those conversations are unfolding? Has it kind of unlocked anything with respect to the development pipeline or anything else with those conversations?
Ritch Alliso: Sure. Sure. Thanks for the question. It's something that we're always actively engaged in discussions with our franchisees and those relationships. And frankly, one of the best things about the second quarter for myself personally is that I've been out on the road a lot. Out in stores and visiting with our franchisees as we've gotten ourselves vaccinated and are able to get out there and interact a lot more. And franchisees, I think certainly pleased with the top line growth that we've seen in the business. And the fact that we've seen the sustained levels of sales that we've had here in the first and second quarters of the year. You won't be surprised because to hear that franchisees are just as we are, concerned about staffing, about labor rates and where those are going over time, thinking about commodity costs and where those are going. All the things that you would expect, restaurant operators to be concerned about. But when we take a look at the business in total, the four-wall economics the business are still incredibly strong, the cost of entry or what it takes to get a Domino's Pizza opened relative to other QSR's still very modest. So the cash-on-cash returns in the business are still very strong. And that's really what drives the appetite for development. So I still see a strong appetite for development. And that's not just true in the U.S. business, but it's around the globe. And really kind of tying back some of the comments I made earlier on this call. The real gating factor right now in terms of getting stores open is not the desire to do so. It is some of those other factors around staffing and just having teams ready to be in those stores day one when they open, given some of the labor constraints. But also, we have seen some continued delays in construction and permitting. And then also just in some specific equipment categories, they go into our stores, you probably won't be surprised to hear that there are still you know some significant supply chain disruptions out there and some of those have hit some of the equipment that we use to build out a Domino's Pizza store.
Andrew Strelzik: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. You may proceed with your question.
Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Ritch, just to follow-up on the labor side, is the company able to monitor franchisees staffing levels? And what's the company doing to kind of help franchisees with staffing, so that it doesn't become a service issue?
Ritch Alliso: Sure. Chris, we don't monitor our franchisees staffing levels or really have any say or direction in what they do with their own people outside of the of the brand standards. So what we try to do is lead by example with what we do inside our corporate store businesses. And so, one of the most important things about running corporate stores is that we're out there across the country feeling exactly what our franchisees are feeling. And so, when they're feeling pinched on staffing and wages and other things, we feel it in our own business as well. And it allows us to maintain a level of alignment that it's just impossible to have if you've sold all your corporate stores over time. And so, we communicate what we're doing in the corporate store business and do our best to lead by example with respect to the things that we're trying to do around hiring and wages and other things that we've got going on out there in the marketplace. But ultimately, they're going to make their decisions about how they choose to pay and staff their stores.
Chris O'Cull: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Your first - it's just -- I guess a topic I'd like to address not really a question and secondly a question. First, Ritch, I mean, could you address some of the senior level turnover that you've seen and it has been fairly chunky. And it kind of came in a wave more or less and maybe that some of the challenges, but also opportunities that may bring as you kind of think about the Domino's over the next five to ten years. So that's I guess is the first topic. It would be great to address. And then secondly, your app gives you a lot of data that others would love to have. And some of that data may show customers that abandon their orders once they see a delivery time that has got to be quite long. Talk about how much of an issue that's become? And if there is a way for you to think, just like how much sales you could actually recapture or I guess in this case actually grow if you were to get service levels materially down, which I assume would come through increased delivery driver staffing? Thanks.
Ritch Alliso: Sure, John. And that's good creativity around a topic and a question since we said one question. So to address the first topic, we've had some turnover among the management team. But what I can tell you is, that also creates opportunity for great leaders that we've had on the bench and who are ready to step up and take -- and really take things to the next level. So, as I look across our team and that's not just the direct reports to myself, but also as I look broadly across our senior management team within the company, we've never been stronger than we are today. We like -- I'm sure some others out there we've still got a few positions that we still need to fill. But when I look across, I feel very good about the leadership team at Domino's Pizza. And I don't think we could deliver the kind of results that we've been delivering if we didn't have a great leadership team. The second question around taking a look at service and what we're seeing there in the business. With the challenges that we've had in staffing, we haven't made the service gains and improvements that I would like to see here in 2021. And we've slipped a minute or two in some places with respect to the average times in terms of getting food to our customers. And that is a big area of focus for us as we look going forward. We know because we got all the data. As you as you referenced, we know that when our mean delivery times get better and when our standard deviations around delivery times get tighter, we get more delivery sales per household for those customers that are in our delivery area. So there's clearly an opportunity to continue to grow delivery by driving those service times down. Some of that will come from getting our staffing levels back to where we need them to be. But also I can tell you we are spending a lot of time looking at how we can get more efficient in our stores. And frankly, how we can deliver better delivery times with the same or in some cases even fewer drivers. Some of that is examining all of the wasted time that we have. If we want to be as efficient as we can possibly be then a driver should never get out of his or her car, and should spend all of their time getting pizzas to customers. So we're trying to take some of those other things out, some of those other tasks, some of those things that drive in efficiencies, so that we can keep the drivers moving. That's better for the customer in terms of delivery times, but it's also a lot better for the drivers if we can get more deliveries per driver per hour that means more tips for those drivers. And we know that when they earn higher wages the retention rates get better for us also. So, we're working on all of those things John to try to continue to drive improvements in service, because we know what the value of that is over time.
John Ivankoe: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. You may proceed with your question.
David Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. I was wondering, Ritch, if you could comment on where the U.S. business is in terms of carryout sales relative to where you were pre pandemic? And then in particular, I guess the related question would be -- what do you think this Carside Delivery option is doing for you in terms of growing that business and the opportunity going forward?
Ritch Alliso: Great, David. Thanks. And if you take a look at where carryout is. And the most important metric that we look at around it is, where are we in terms of carryout orders per store? And basically when we take a look at the Q2, we were pretty well back to where we were in 2019 on carryout orders, slightly positive. A lot of a benefit in ticket growth that we've seen in carryout really driven by customers ordering more product per order. But we did see in the second quarter that we got back to the pre-COVID levels in terms of orders. In terms of the mix of our business, when you look at carryout orders versus delivery orders. We're still a little bit below where we were pre-COVID. And that's really driven by the fact that our delivery order counts on a two-year basis are significantly higher than they than they were back in 2019. So, what I would say is that we are in kind of the first phase of that carryout order count growth resurgence that we've been thinking about and forecasting for a while internally. Carside Delivery. For us is something that was on -- it was on our work plan even before COVID hit. Because we were looking at Carside Delivery really as the way at Domino's to compete for that drive-through customer. Now when COVID hit, we kind of reshuffled our work plan and pulled all of that forward to get it rolled out more quickly, because it also provides a safe and contactless experience for the customer, which became so important during COVID. But we look at Carside as a as a fantastic way to compete against the drive-through. Because while we've got pickup windows in a number of our stores out there, the reality is we're never going to get to 100% pickup windows in Domino's Pizza stores. And so, we've got to have a way to get the product out to the customer. I have been incredibly pleased with our franchisees and how they have embraced this, in particular leading up to and now during our Two-Minute Guarantee that we're running on TV, we're averaging well below two minutes across our system of getting those pizzas out the door. And I don't know, David, if you've sat in the drive-through line recently, but I've sat in them at some QSRs for five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. And if you can pull into our order ahead, pull into our parking lot and we can get that pizza in your car in two minutes, I think that's a great customer experience. And then for us another fantastic benefit of Carside is the fact that these orders are -- they are pre-ordered digitally and they are prepaid. So pre-ordering digitally allows us to drive a higher ticket. Because we do a much better job of driving ticket for those digital orders, because we've got all the technology built in there based on the A/B testing and everything else we do to give the customer a great experience and make sure they get in their basket the things that they would enjoy that even for dinner. And then on the prepayment, that's also great for us as well. Because it shortens the transaction time in the store and lets us get the customer out the door faster and using less labor. And the digital obviously also gives us an opportunity then to invite those customers into our loyalty program. So early stage is a Carside. But I'm really happy with the adoption across the system. And what this could mean for us as we continue to compete for more occasions with our consumers.
David Tarantino: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. You may proceed with your question.
Dennis Geiger: Great. Thanks. Ritch, wanted to ask you a little bit more about customer loyalty and new customer acquisition that you're seeing. And how you're thinking about the go forward from here. Maybe if you could talk a little more about the opportunities that you have to continue to attract new customers and also keep those that you have gained over the last let's say 15 months or so? I'm sure it's a bunch of things. But any thoughts around kind of what factors are most important for this, if it's that service level opportunity that you mentioned? If it's new menu items, value, boost weeks. Just curious how you -- what you're seeing and how you think about the opportunity? Thank you.
Ritch Alliso: Sure. That's happy to touch on that. As you take a look really over the course of the last year or so, the bulk of the growth in our business really has come from existing customers. And that customer retention and purchase frequency and even more concentrated within our loyalty customer base, that 27 plus million active loyalty members that we have at Domino's. So, I'm really pleased with what we've been able to do as the pandemic has unfolded in terms of driving customer retention, staying relevant and keeping those orders, that order frequency up over time. When I look forward, I think we do have more opportunities to continue to prime the pump further around customer acquisition. Some of the most important tools that we've used historically to do that have been some of these periodic boost weeks that we've used. And we haven't run any of those for quite some time. So that's certainly an arrow in the quiver that we have going forward. Product introductions, certainly another opportunity to invite new customers in. And we do have some robust products in the pipeline. So you should expect to see some news from us on that in the quarters to come as another potential opportunity. And then what I would tell you also, just kind of underlying all this it's not a specific action or a catalyst for driving customer acquisition, but I fundamentally believe that staying focused on value is perhaps our greatest customer acquisition vehicle over time. Because as you see you know prices being raised significantly at a number of other restaurant chains around the country and as we start to see some of this government stimulus come away as we go into the back half of this year, I think it's going to be really important for the families that we serve to stay focused on value. And I think that's always a consistent message from us and an opportunity to continue to bring new customers into the fold.
Dennis Geiger: Great. Thanks Ritch.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.
Lauren Silberman: Thanks for the question. So within the context of the current labor environment, can you talk about some of the in-store technology or back of house technology that you're testing or recently launched to enhance the in-store operating model? And then related digital represents 75% of sales now, increased about 5% each year over the last several years. So, how are you thinking about how high that penetration can go? Could it be 90%, 95% just given some of the labor benefits?
Ritch Alliso: Thanks Lauren. You're first on the labor environment, we're absolutely working on technologies and operating procedures to help us run our stores more efficiently and with less labor. One of those I spoke about earlier as it relates to our delivery drivers, which is that, we're trying to take a lot of things off of their plates that cause them to do anything other then being in a car delivering a pizza or on a bike delivering a pizza to a customer. So, an example of that is -- that drove me crazy for years was pre-folding boxes, which was often a task that delivery drivers did. We've made enormous strides within our system and now have more than 2,000 of our stores in the U.S. that no longer pre-fold boxes. So that's taken work out of the store. And by the way, it also makes for a much cleaner and better work in store as well. Other things that we've been working on, we've rolled out our GPS software out to our stores and its in the hands of our drivers on their smartphones. That allows drivers to get proficient much more quickly. In the old way at Domino's the driver might take two, three months to learn the delivery area. But with the GPS capability that we have, we can do a better job of routing and getting drivers to the location that they're headed to. We're working on other things as well, around how we schedule and staff the store using machine learning to really help us to do a better job of predicting what our sales are going to be. And therefore, more appropriately matching the number of team members at the store at the times when we need them. So lot going on there. Your second around digital. Yes, around 75% of sales, how high its high? I don't know. But I know its higher than 75%. The benchmark that we use is a Domino's world to kind of inspire everybody else is China, where more than -- more than 19 out of every 20 orders come in through digital channel. So, that's really the inspiration for us. So, I guess, until we get close to a 100, I'm not going to stop pushing.
Lauren Silberman: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Carril with RBC Capital. You may proceed with your question.
Chris Carril: Great. Thanks. So returning to the [Indiscernible] and perhaps in the light of the reopening and the gradual return of in-restaurant dining [Indiscernible].
Ritch Alliso: Hey, Chris, there's kind of static on your line.
Chris Carril: Is that better?
Ritch Alliso: Yes. That's better. We couldn't hear anything you were saying.
Chris Carril: Sorry about that. So, just returning to the theme of competition, Ritch, just curious to get your latest thoughts on third-party delivery competition. And your latest thoughts and how they're shifting dynamics around the reopening, will drive the next phase of delivery competition just broadly, that would be great? Thanks.
Ritch Alliso: First on third-party, I mean, I don't think there's any question at this point that third-party delivery is here to stay. You can pretty well get any type of food delivered anywhere in the county. And frankly now, broadly just about across anywhere in the world today. So we don't think that competition is going away. And in fact in many ways, we look at that as our primary competitive set. As the leader in the pizza category, obviously we still continue to look at the pizza competition. But frankly, the biggest competition over the long term for us in delivery is that third-party aggregator channel. So, when I think about what we got to do. So let's assume, regardless of where their economic sit today, we believe, they're going to be here for the long haul. So we have to continue to make sure that we are the best value both for the consumer and for the restaurant operator. So, we continue to believe that our owned fleet for us and our corporate stores and for our franchisees and their stores having our own delivery drivers running point-to-point back and forth to the store, we continue to believe that's the most efficient operating model and gets even more efficient as we continue to fortress our markets. And so having very efficient model is important in order to put us in a position to continue to offer a very competitive delivery fee and overall value proposition to the customers. We also believe that the fact that we use a single transparent delivery fee, we think overtime is an important competitive advantage. When I was a third-party delivery, I have to really get my calculator out to figure out what I've actually paid to have that food deliver, because maybe I got a discount on the delivery fee, but maybe I paid a service fee, maybe I paid the small order fee, maybe I have paid a fee, because I happen to be in a city where they were charging an incremental city fee. We very much believe around a single transparent delivery fee overtime. We think it will be important to customers. And then back on the other side of equation, staying is the best value for the restaurant operator. We charge for a digital order, we charge our franchisees just a little bit over 1% a ticket. That's $0.275 digital order fee. That is so much lower than what you're going to see in terms of what third parties are charging restaurants out there. So we think that gives us a competitive advantage in terms of continuing to make sure that we've got great four-wall economics for our operators. Because that's the only way we grow the business overtime and they open more stores as if the four-wall economics continue to be strong. So, I think, Chris, we don't exactly know yet, how all this ultimately shakes out and what all of the dynamics that may shift overtime. But we really focused on maintaining a competitive position with both of those groups, the customers and the restaurant operators.
Chris Carril: Great. Thank you. Appreciate all the detail.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question.
David Palmer: Thanks. I think this one touches on some of the things you've been talking about with regard to a third-party delivery. But you mentioned sales trends were best in less affluent and less dense population areas. And I wonder if you could give us your best thinking about why that might be. And in your answer if you could really catch on the influence of third-party deliveries competition. And I don't want to leave the witness too much. But I'm thinking that the restaurants and the third-party players themselves may be passing along particularly rapid menu price inflation lately, which is perhaps less accepted in the less affluent areas. And that third party may also be pulling back in service levels in these less profitable, low density markets. But I'm just guessing there and you might have better data on this? Thanks.
Ritch Alliso: Sure, David. Thank you. I think, if we start with less affluent versus more affluent, I think certainly to the extent that these third-party delivery fees get more complex and increase over time that less affluent customers absolutely going to feel more of a pinch on that. And I think is -- and with the brand, the size of Domino's, a big portion of the customers that we serve out there are -- these are not you know super wealthy folks and values really, really important to them. And so I suspect that in many of these less affluent areas, we stack up very favorably in terms of the all-in value of having delivered food to serve to your family. Whereas in some of the more affluent areas there may be less price sensitivity to some of these more significant delivery charges, and/or if those consumers are ordering a higher overall ticket. If they're ordering $75 worth of food from a casual dining restaurant then paying the fee is less a pinch on a relative basis. So, we're still looking at this and seeing how it evolves. But I suspect that your hypothesis and ours there are reasonably well aligned. And then, I think as it relates to the urban versus the rural, I do believe there that in those more rural environments there's -- where there is less density, I think our -- the cost model around how we deliver probably shines even more in some of those places, where we can keep drivers busy running point-to-point back and forth from our stores. So, we're continuing to watch it and evolve it. There may be some other dynamics there, David, that we look at such as some of the just the migration of people out of some of the urban areas during COVID, and not all of those folks have returned yet back to the big cities or places where they previously lived. So still watching it, trends are still evolving. Well folks, we really do appreciate your time. And thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. And we look forward to getting back together with you again in October to discuss our third quarter 2021 results.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 2021 Domino's Pizza, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Brandon, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, and please go ahead.
Chris Brandon: Appreciate it, Samantha, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our conversation today regarding the results of our first quarter 2021.

As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q also apply to our comments about today. Both of those documents are available on our website. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be referenced on today's call. Our request to our coverage analysts. We want to do our best this morning to accommodate as many of you as time permits. So we encourage you to ask only one-part question on this call, if you would, please. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Stu Levy.
Stu Levy: Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. We're excited to share our strong first quarter results with you today. Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world generated impressive operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3 for the first quarter. Global retail sales grew 16.7% in Q1 as compared to Q1 2020. As a reminder, global retail sales growth includes both comp growth and unit growth, which I'll break down for you in a moment. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 14%. Breaking down that global retail sales growth, our US retail sales grew 15.3% and our international retail sales grew 18%. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, International retail sales grew 12.8%. We continue to see positive momentum in both our U.S. and international businesses in Q1, leading to both strong same-store sales performance and net unit growth. Turning to comps. During Q1, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 40 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 109 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. Same-store sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 1.6%. Same-store sales for our international business grew 11.8%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1. 5%. Breaking down the US comp a bit further. Our franchise business was up 13.9% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were up 6.3%. We observed a larger spread than we've historically seen between the top line performance of our franchise stores and our company-owned stores, which we believe was primarily a result of the heavily urban and higher income footprint of our company-owned stores relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise base. The corporate store comp was also disproportionately impacted by store splits resulting from our fortressing efforts as we opened more new corporate stores as a percent of the total corporate store base than we did franchise stores in 2020. The US comp this quarter included a healthy mix of both ticket and order growth. The ticket growth was driven by both an increase in items per order and a higher delivery mix, which also includes a transparent delivery fee. The 11.8% international comp was driven by ticket growth. Similar to our US business, that ticket growth was driven by a higher delivery mix and an increase in items per order. Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 36 net stores in the US during the first quarter, consisting of 37 store openings and the closure of one of our corporate stores. Our international business added 139 net stores comprised of 160 store openings and 21 closures. We're very pleased with our with our net unit growth during Q1, which was an increase over the prior year quarter. Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the first quarter were approximately $984 million, and were up approximately $111 million or 12.7% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which generated higher revenues across all areas of our business. Changes in international royalty revenues by $2.1 million in Q1 2021 as compared to prior year. Our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenue increased to 39.6% in Q1 2021 from 39% in the prior year due primarily to higher revenues from our US franchise business. Company-owned store margin as a percent of revenues increased result of strong sales leverage. This was also up sequentially from 21.9% in Q4 2020, driven by lower labor costs as a percent of revenue in Q1 2021. Supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenues decreased to 10. 5% from 11.5% in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, in 2020, we opened two new supply chain centers in South Carolina and Texas, respectively, as well as a new pressed product line in New Jersey, which increased our overall fixed operating costs as a percent of revenue. G&A expenses increased approximately $2.8 million in Q1 as compared to Q1 2020, resulting from a combination of higher advertising expenses and labor costs, partially offset by travel. Net interest expense increased approximately $0.9 million in the quarter, primarily the result of lower interest income. As previously disclosed, in Q1 2021, we invested an additional $40 million in Dash Brands, our master franchisee in China following their achievement of previously established performance conditions. Accordingly, we remeasured the original $40 million investment we made in Q2 of last year due to the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investment. This $2.5 million gain was recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2021. Our effective tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter as compared to a negative 3.7% in Q1 2020. The effective tax rate in Q1 2021 includes a 0.6 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation as compared to a 26 percentage point positive impact in Q1 2020. This decrease was due to significantly fewer stock option exercise in Q1 of this year. And we expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits. Combining all of these elements, our first quarter net income was down $3.8 million or 3.2% versus Q1 2020. On a pretax basis, income before provision for income taxes was up $32.3 million or 27.6%. Our diluted EPS in Q1 was $3 versus $3.07 in the prior year, a decrease of 2.3%. Breaking down that $0.07 decrease. Most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.61. The gain on the Dash Brands investment benefited us by $0.05. Net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.02. A lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.03. And finally, our higher effective tax rate resulting from lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation, as I mentioned previously, negatively impacted us by $0.74. Shifting to cash. Our economic model continued to generate significant cash flow throughout the quarter. During Q1, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $153 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $136 million. Regarding our capital expenditures, We spent approximately $17 million on CapEx in Q1, primarily on our technology initiatives. As previously disclosed, during Q1, we also repurchased and retired approximately 66,000 shares for $25 million. As a reminder, in February, our Board approved a new $1 billion authorization for future share repurchases. We also paid a $0.94 quarterly dividend on March 30. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share to be paid on June 30. As it relates to our capital structure, on April 16, we refinanced our debt to keep pace with our growing business. We're very pleased with our gross issuance of $1.85 billion which includes $850 million of 7.5-year 2.662% fixed rate notes and $1 billion of 10-year 3.151% fixed rate notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to retire our 2017 floating rate notes in our 2017 5-year fixed rate notes to prefund certain interest payable and to pay transaction fees and expenses. We expect to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include distributions to holders of our common stock, other equivalent payments and/or stock repurchases. This recapitalization will reduce our weighted average borrowing rate from 3.9% as of the end of the first quarter to approximately 3.7%, and it will return our leverage to approximately 6x EBITDA, consistent with our leverage model following previous recapitalizations. Additional information on this transaction is included in our Form 10-Q, which was filed this morning. Since the onset of the pandemic in previous earnings calls, we've provided updates on the impact of COVID-19-related expenses, including safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and other compensation for our team members, and support for our franchisees and our communities. The estimated impact of these items in the first quarter of 2021 was not material. In closing, our business continued its strong performance during the first quarter. And while we continue to closely monitor all aspects of our operations in these ever-changing times, we're confident in the strength and resilience of the Domino's brand and of the Domino's franchisees, their team members and our corporate teams worldwide. Our results would not be possible without their tireless efforts each and every day, and we sincerely appreciate them. Thank you, again, for joining the call today, and I'll turn it over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thank you, Stu, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Overall, I am very pleased with our results this quarter and our strong start to 2021. We are now more than 1 year into the COVID pandemic, the most challenging operating environment we've ever experienced as a brand. I continue to be extremely proud of our global franchisees and their extraordinary efforts around product, service, image and day-to-day execution. We remain focused on providing outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences. And as a brand, we are also proud to continue our position as an industry leader on value at a time when our customers need it the most. Today, I'll keep my comments rather brief, as I highlight the first quarter results for our US and our international businesses. And then after that, Stu and I will be happy to take some of your questions. Let's start with the US business. Our US business performed extremely well during the quarter, highlighted by 15.3% retail sales growth and a 13.4% comp This marked our 40th consecutive quarter of positive US same-store sales growth. We continue to see strong growth across our business in the first quarter, and we did not witness any material differences between those markets that have largely reopened versus those that have remained more restricted. We certainly saw some sales benefits from the federal government stimulus at the beginning and at the end of Q1. And which were partially offset by the negative impact of the significant winter storms in February that impacted such a large portion of the country. Due to the positive sales impacts from the stimulus, we elected not to run any of our aggressive boost week promotions during the quarter, but instead, we remain focused on providing great service and offering great value to our customers every day. Now like many of you, we are also watching the 2-year stack on US same-store sales. At 15% for the first quarter we saw a slight sequential improvement of the 2-year stack when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Given the COVID overlaps, we will continue to look at the business through both, the 1- and 2-year lenses as we report to you throughout 2021. Now beyond the comps, when you look at the absolute dollars, our first quarter same-store average weekly unit sales in the US exceeded $26,000. I am also quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter on the other critical component of our retail sales growth. That's new store openings. Our addition of 36 net stores was a nice improvement over Q1 of 2020, and we anticipate a strong pipeline of future openings. I want to highlight that we had only one corporate store closure in the US during Q1, and we had 0, 0 US franchise store closures, an impressive testament to the continued health of our US system. On many occasions, you've heard me say that net unit growth and by extension store closures are one of the most important ways to measure a brand's health within our industry. A single store closure in the quarter on a base of over 6,000 units demonstrates the elite economic proposition that we offer to our franchisees. And on that note, I'm thrilled to report yet another record-setting year of franchisee profitability. With our final 2020 estimated average EBITDA number for US franchise stores coming in at just over $177,000, the highest in our history. While this result was certainly aided by the COVID demand tailwind, it clearly demonstrates not only the power of the brand, but also the incredible work of our US franchisees and operators and their relentless efforts throughout an incredibly busy 2020. Our fortressing strategy continues to build best practice case studies showcasing franchisee enterprise growth and ROI, which is a big part of the momentum and excitement behind the strategy. But equally as important, it sets us up extremely well to compete in 2021 and beyond as we continue to drive lower relative costs, better service, higher runs per hour and therefore, better economics for drivers, along with meaningful incremental carryout within our stores in fortress territories. While carryout order count remained pressured in Q1 as it was throughout the last year, we continue to grow awareness of Domino's Carside Delivery. This has created a new option to serve our customers effectively during COVID and will remain an important part of our strategy as we continue to evolve the carryout experience. Not only to enhance the loyalty of our current carryout customers but also to reach a new, different and largely untapped drive-thru oriented customer going forward. On the advertising front, I'm excited about the national TV campaign we launched this week. highlighting our very exciting partnership with Neuro. We are delivering a true autonomous pizza delivery experience to select customers in Houston today, demonstrating our forward-thinking approach to innovation, as we build and evolve the brand for the future. We also brought back our old nemesis, The Noid, in this ad campaign, and it is already generating some incredible buzz around the Domino's brand. Now the final thing I'd like to acknowledge is we close out the discussion on our Q1 results in the US is the very difficult staffing environment that we are in today. The combination of COVID, strong sales, the broader economy reopening and the high level of government stimulus is creating one of the most difficult staffing environments that we've seen in a long time. This puts pressure on our operators to meet demand while continuing to deliver great service to their customers. I thank our US franchisees and our corporate store operators for the work they are doing to attract and retain great team members in a very tight labor market. As we close out our discussion on the US business, I would simply highlight that the Domino's brand is strong as it has ever been, and I remain confident in our ability to drive long-term growth. Let's move on now to the International business. It was an outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. Our 12.8% retail sales growth was supported by a very strong 11.8% comp, continuing the momentum we saw towards the end of last year. Q1 also marked our 109th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales in international, a tremendous accomplishment by our international franchise partners. And in fact, the Q1 comp was the strongest result we've seen in more than a decade in that business. As I discussed earlier with our US business, we are also watching the 2-year comp stacks for international and will continue to do so throughout 2021. Q1 represented a 13.3% 2-year stack, which was a 430 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2020. We also continue to build momentum on store growth in our international business. Our 139 net stores in Q1 was a 100-store improvement versus the first quarter of 2020. We expect that COVID will continue to have a significant impact on many of our international markets for some time to come and will bring ongoing challenges to new store openings. But this acceleration in growth speaks to our outstanding unit level economics and the perseverance and commitment of our international master franchisees. We continue to have temporary store closures around the world, but those have come down dramatically over the last few quarters, and we're below 100 at the end of the first quarter. Now I'd like to highlight a few markets that drove terrific growth during the quarter. India, China and Japan, once again, led our system in net unit growth. And I'd like to highlight another market, Guatemala that also delivered terrific store growth. China, Japan, Turkey, Colombia, Germany and France all drove impressive retail sales growth during the quarter. So once again, I am very proud of our master franchisees and their operators for a great start to 2021. They are the best in the business, and that's why I continue to be bullish about our international retail sales growth opportunity over the long-term. So in closing, I'm very pleased with our quarter one results. Our incredible base of franchisees and operators, combined with outstanding unit-level economics, place us in an enviable position of strength within our industry. Q1 reinforced our position as the global leader in QSR pizza, but there is still so much opportunity ahead of us to drive global retail sales growth and to capture additional meaningful share within the category. As we look ahead to the rest of 2021 and beyond, we will, as always, stay focused on winning the long game and we remain confident in our 2- to 3-year outlook of 6% to 8% annual net store growth and 6% to 10% annual global retail sales growth. So thank you, once again, for joining us today. And at this time, Stu and I will now be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, Ritch, good morning, Stu. Obviously, the US business continues to be a phenomenal engine and the long-term outlook there is pretty clear. But the topical question that I must ask is related to the US business as it begins to lap the meaningful upswing in strength from last year that really began around this time. As we kind of sit here and we analyze your two-year trends in the first quarter, it does suggest actually an improving likelihood of – of successfully lapping that strength, at least with maybe the ability to perhaps hold on to those gains more than we all thought originally. Can I get your reaction to that thought? And what specific weapons do you have in your arsenal that you plan to deploy over the rest of the year to fight this lap? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Hi, Brian, and thanks for the question. And you're absolutely right. We've got some pretty strong laps ahead of us from the second and the third quarters of last year. But what we're really focused on are continuing to make the investments to drive long-term growth in the business. And as I look out across the rest of the year, we are really in an enviable position. We've got a fantastic advertising war chest. We have not deployed some of the tools this year so far that we've used in the past around our boost weeks to drive incremental customer acquisitions. So we have those in our arsenal. And I think very importantly, the carryout business, which on a relative basis, when you look at order growth during 2020 was weak, relative to its historical run rate. And so we've got an opportunity to continue to drive that carryout business, along with some day and day parts during the week as well. As it relates to last year weekends and late night were relatively weak versus weekdays and the earlier in the dayparts from last year. So as customer patterns continue to change, as the economy continues to open up, we feel confident that we've got a set of tools to allow us to continue to grow our business.
Brian Bittner: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks. Ritch, I think you mentioned that the store level EBITDA was about $177,000 per store, which I think that number was almost 20,000 higher than the original estimate that you guys provided back in January. Could you just give us a little bit of sense on maybe what the difference is between the original asset and the new figure that you guys actually reported this morning?
Ritch Allison: Sure, Pete. When we give the original estimate, which comes back in early January is based on a pretty limited sample of the franchisee P&Ls that come in. And over the course of the first quarter, as those begin to roll in, we collect them and rarely does it move this much from the original estimate to the final number, but just the way the sample played out over time, the result ended up coming in quite a bit stronger. And when I think about where we sit within the industry today, that $177,000 in store-level EBITDA really puts our system in an incredible position of strength. And when you see it, you're not surprised that we only had one store that closed in the US throughout the entire quarter.
Peter Saleh: Very impressive. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein.
Sara Senatore: Great. Thank you very much. I just had a quick question, I guess, about some of the commentary about carryout versus delivery in the US. I guess in terms of the strength of the business, you said you're not really seeing any variability across US markets, but I would have associated sort of softer carryout with mobility restrictions. I'm trying to kind of reconcile those to that overall, I would think carryout might be affected by restrictions but those vary across markets. And maybe if you can just talk about the share within the carryout versus with delivery within pizza; that category, so I can sort of understand what might be going out on between those 2 businesses. Thank you. 
Ritch Allison: Sure. Sarah, what we saw across the US was continued pressure on carryout order count in total. But when we broke it down and looked state-by-state at a different pace of reopening across the country. There really were no discernible differences in our business overall. So we still see a lot of opportunity for carryout to continue to grow and come back as mobility increases broadly across the country. And I can also tell you that we have -- we've not been as aggressive as we've been in the past on promoting that carryout business also. And so there are opportunities there for us as we look across the rest of the year as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
Q – John Glass: Talk about the international business and you think about those 2-year trends, those materially inflected, how much of that was just a result of maybe the increased international lockdowns? Do you have any anecdotes as this -- is there underlying business trends just broadly strong, or is it really just those lockdown markets are getting a benefit? And maybe if you want to just highlight a few of the key drivers. I know you talked about development, but just on a comp perspective, what really contributed to that significant acceleration in the international markets.
Ritch Allison: Sure. John, thanks for the question. And it really is -- it's -- performance is still quite mixed across the markets within the international business, as you might guess that the dynamics as it relates to COVID are still quite different depending upon what parts of the world that we're in. But what we have seen is, as we were able to, over the course of 2020, reopen our markets, you may recall this time last year, we were gosh, 2,000-plus units that were temporarily closed. And as we've been able to get units reopened and then to get the pipeline of new development going and turn the marketing back on across the international businesses, we've seen a strong resurgence in sales in many of the markets that we operate in. And it's going to continue to be choppy market by market as we look out across 2021 because in some places, we're going to be lapping very weak comps in retail sales from last year. And in other places on the planet, we're going to be lapping very strong numbers from last year.
Q – John Glass: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs.
Jared Garber: Thanks for taking the question. Actually a follow-up on that prior question on international. Several years ago, Ritch when you took over, you came in from the international business. And I wanted to get a sense from you if you think that there are any sort of structural changes that are happening in some of these key international markets, be it maybe Japan or Australia or India for that matter has talked about unit opens there that we should be thinking about the level of comps and unit growth in those markets remaining at a higher level over the kind of the medium term?
Ritch Allison: Yes. As I look across the globe, Jared, we still see so much opportunity for continued growth and share gain in that international business. So, while it's grown rapidly, certainly over the last decade, you're still looking at an international business in total that grows in that kind of low -- the market overall that grows in that kind of low to mid-single-digits. And then you've got much share gain opportunity as well. Our share in the international business in total is significantly less than where we are in the US today. So, as I look at it now, I still see a significant amount of opportunity to continue to grow the business. We're hitting scale in some of the key markets around the world. If you look at the places where we've been really strong, recently, like Japan, like India, we're starting to get there in China. We've started to hit some really nice scale points in some of those markets as well that give us the wherewithal and the ability to invest at a high level in the business going forward. And then finally, I would just highlight, once again, as we talk about all the time, the growth really comes back to the unit level economics in the business. And while we still got some challenges in a few places around the globe, by and large, the unit level economics remain really strong across the world and with COVID loosening up certainly in some places, not as much in others. As it loosens up, it really gives those franchisees the opportunity to release some of that pent-up demand for unit level investment and growth.
Jared Garber: Thanks for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Strelzik with BMO.
Andrew Strelzik: Hey good morning. I was hoping you could share some color or maybe some metrics on the frequency and retention of newer lapse customers that you gained during the pandemic here in the US now that the environment is starting to normalize with the vaccine rollouts, et cetera. Are you seeing higher retention and the CRM initiatives driving frequency the way you would have expected? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Yes, I think as we mentioned in the -- back in February when we released the fourth quarter, dynamics remained pretty consistent in the first quarter in that we're getting a lot more of the growth out of retained customers versus newly acquired customers. And again, we've turned down some of the more aggressive promotions, which drive a lot of customer acquisition. What I am pleased to see is that our active loyalty membership continues to grow. And also, we continue to see really strong and steady order frequency among those active loyalty customers. So, strong continued engagement and sales from our existing customers and we've got some opportunities, I think, as we look out through the course of the year to really turn the volume back up on new customer acquisition as well.
Andrew Strelzik: Yes. I mean when you look at our loyalty numbers over the course of the last year and having not run some of those boost weeks and the things that we've traditionally done to attract new customers. Obviously, pleased that the loyalty numbers continue to grow. But when you look at that relative to our sales, that obviously had to come from more repeat business and greater frequency from our core loyalty base.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel.
Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning guys. Ritch, it was my understanding that the carryout pizza segment overall grew at a pretty healthy pace last year. I’m just curious why you think Domino's is struggling to grow that business, especially in light of the systems marketing efforts, not just recently, but over the past few years and just the fortressing strategy. Curious if you feel like there needs to be any changes in the approach to going after that business?
Ritch Allison: So Chris, thanks for the question. We are continuing to grow sales in the carryout segment. It really is the order counts in the carryout segment that were under more pressure in Q1 and then also looking back into last year. So we still -- we're still capturing growth in that segment, but it's come more from ticket through customers adding more items per order for the first quarter and also back into last year. As I mentioned earlier, we have not been as aggressive in our marketing of the carryout segment, just given some of the challenges around operating in the COVID environment, But we see a lot of opportunity as we look across this year to continue to crank that back up. And our new service method of Domino's Carside Delivery, we see as a critical weapon to do that. We brought that forward to address the safety concerns that customers had around picking up their food in a COVID environment. But over the long-term, that's really a great tool for us as we compete for carryout business against the drive-thru lanes of other QSR concepts.
Stu Levy: The other thing just to keep in mind, and this is a very COVID unique thing, but all of that demand that was dine-in for a lot of restaurants, their choice was to figure out how to do carryout or delivery. So you've got players in carryout, players in delivery that we're all still wondering whether they stay there permanently, whether they shift back into dine-in, how they split their dining rooms, et cetera. But it essentially changes that market in terms of the group of players playing in there as well, which is one of the reasons you see that increase in the carryout market has.
Chris O'Cull: It’s helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. The question is on U.S. labor. And I'd like to ask it, one in terms of supply chain and your ability to have people that work in the commissaries themselves and also distribution. And if you have a pricing mechanism with the franchisees to cover those costs, I think you're doing commodities, but mention whether you do on labor. And then secondly, Ritch, something that we've talked about in calls before is things like service levels to the U.S. consumer. Can you talk about the current labor market is changing some of the service levels, in other words, lengthening delivery times that you're seeing the pendulum swing in an unfavorable direction and if there's anything you can do to continue to improve the service times that I think we used to discuss on a pre-COVID basis. Thanks.
Stu Levy: Yes. Thanks. John, I'll grab that. Thanks for the question. Let me start on the supply chain side. We don't explicitly price with our franchisees based on a breakdown that says, well, this piece is labor and this piece is food. And as I've mentioned previously, while we're trying to grow our overall profit dollars for the supply chain business, we're not trying to do it at the expense of our franchisees. We're trying to do it with our franchisees through the overall growth. So we're absorbing a piece of that labor increase, versus passing that automatically through, the same that we do with food cost inflation. In terms of store level, certainly, I think everybody right now, you see it the news everywhere is challenged from a labor perspective and a hiring perspective. We still believe that, at the -- when all is said and done, you've got to be focused on service, services where you drive your differential customer engagement and drive that loyalty. Part of -- one of the structural things that we do, which helps us from a service perspective, because we don't want to take our eye off that ball, is fortressing. And we've obviously talked a lot about fortressing, but you get closer to your customers and you have the ability to serve them better. The second thing that we do is, I think, everybody sees a lot of the technology investments that we make on the front end. There's a lot that we do on the back end to try and improve the efficiency of the labor in store, take some of the labor out on store and enable s that same labor to be doing other things. So whether its tools related to the make line, or other initiatives that we're doing to try and drive throughput in the stores and trying to reduce the labor required on a daily, hourly basis. There -- it's at the forefront of everybody's mind right now. But I don't think sacrificing service is the way to do it.
Ritch Allison: Definitely not. And as Stu described, John, some -- a good bit of the work that we're trying to do around tech and around the store operating model is, basically to keep drivers moving 100% of the time, with the long-term goal that they never get out of their cars, are delivering pizzas constantly, as opposed to other tasks and other activities, kind of, that they had to perform in the old operating environment.
John Ivankoe: And if I may, I mean have the service times materially changed to the customer from the time that they order to the time that they get their pizza. And I guess, is that a risk or an opportunity at this point?
Ritch Allison: Yes. John, no material change, which for us, is not good enough, because they've got to continue to get faster. And so, that's really what we're focused on. We've absorbed the volume without any material change in the service times, but we got to get faster.
John Ivankoe: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird.
David Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. My question is for Stu, on the capital allocation. Now that you've done your refinancing transaction, I think a lot of excess cash on the balance sheet and you have a big buyback in place. But I guess I don't want to assume anything. So could you just kind of walk us through what you're thinking in terms of capital allocation, and how quickly you might deploy that cash that you have?
Stu Levy: Yes. I mean, there's no fundamental change to our strategy from a capital allocation perspective, and we were pretty upfront about this even as we went through our recapitalization, we will deploy that that capital for investments in the business and then generally speaking, in one form or another, returning that to shareholders over the course of time. But we don't have an intention of sitting long term with a huge amount of excess cash on the balance sheet.
David Tarantino: Okay Thank you.
Stu Levy: Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS.
Dennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for your question. Ritch, I wanted to ask a bit more about your comments on taking market share going forward. And just kind of curious how you're thinking about share gain opportunities in US this year and perhaps over the next few years, if you care to kind of segment it, delivery versus carryout. Stu, I know you kind of mentioned some players are kind of coming in and out of different channels. Just kind of any latest thoughts on maybe where that share comes from, whether it's independent small chains, continues or if it's larger players, Curious to the latest thoughts there.
Ritch Allison: Sure, Dennis. Thanks for the question. I guess I'll start by saying we're relatively agnostic as to where the share gain comes from. And we see opportunities to continue to take share across the category. And it's why we – why we're so focused on retail sales growth as the key metric not only because it drives all the economics in our business, but obviously, that's how we ultimately gain market share over time. As I look this year and ongoing, fortressing is going to continue to be a big part of that strategy to gain share. As we've talked about in the past, we are still relatively underpenetrated in terms of share in the carryout business specifically. And fortressing gives us an opportunity to go out and grab that largely incremental carryout business. And then on the delivery side, we believe that we've got to continue to offer great value to our customers and terrific service to continue to gain share on the delivery side. And we've talked about how fortressing helps that over time. We're going to continue to invest in our technology initiatives and operating practices, procedures to continue to help us do a better job of service with our customers as well. And then you combine that with fantastic unit-level economics, which allow franchisees to invest in service and an incredible war chest in terms of our advertising fund to go out there and drive customer awareness and acquisition, and we feel like we're in a very strong position to continue to grow.
Dennis Geiger: Thanks so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse.
Lauren Silberman: Thanks for the question. Ritch, appreciate your commentary on staffing. Part of the labor challenges certainly seen transitory nature given the environment stimulus. How do you think about the longer-term structural headwinds given more optionality for delivery drivers, whether that be ride-share or food delivery, at least the perception of these alternatives could offer a bit more flexibility?
Ritch Allison: Yes, Lauren, it's a great question and something we think about a lot is both the availability and the cost of labor and in particular, the real pinch point in the business is drivers. So part of what we're doing and working on is, trying to continue to make that a great job with the best economics for drivers, relative to the other alternatives that they have out there. And we've talked about a number of strategies around that. We continue our work around fortressing to give drivers more deliveries per hour, which translates into higher wages. We're working on technology and operating practices that keep drivers in their cars. So imagine a world where they don't come back into the store, we run the pizzas out to their cars and then go and take the next order. So we're trying to work on those economics for our drivers to keep them keep them busy and earning higher level wages. And then also a big part of -- what makes Domino's different and has made us different over time is that, being a driver at Domino's or a pizza maker inside the store is an opportunity to become an entrepreneur over time. And so, a big part of our job and our franchisees' jobs also is to sell the opportunity going forward because 90-plus percent of them started office drivers or insiders. And then the final thing I'd say about labor is that, we'll present an ongoing challenge, not just for Domino's, but for others across the industry is the -- just the changes in minimum wage around the country, as that moves differentially from one market to another, certainly, it puts pressures in some places and not in others. And as we operate as a national brand, we always have to take those things into account as we plan our ongoing marketing and promotional calendar over the course of the year.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital.
Chris Carril: Good morning. Ritch, you mentioned the strong pipeline for store openings earlier when discussing the US business. So could you provide a little bit more detail around the composition of the pipeline? Are you seeing a step-up in demand from existing franchisees on the back of the very large increase in average store EBITDA that you highlighted earlier? I presume you're also seeing more demand from potential new franchisees as well. So curious to hear more – about what the pipeline looks like moving forward?
A – Ritch Allison: Sure. Great question. And it really is, it's a mix of both. So certainly a lot of demand within our existing franchisee base given the economics of our stores today, And also the fact that the stores have gotten a lot busier. That creates a lot of ongoing opportunity for fortressing territories that are operated by existing franchisees. You've also got here in 2021 some pent-up demand that wasn't satisfied in 2020 as we had so many more restrictions around construction and permitting and everything else. And then what you add to that is a healthy number of new franchisees coming into the system every year. And one of the things that makes us a little different from the rest of QSR and of franchising is that, those new franchisees all come from within our system. So they could be corporate employees. They could be team members of our franchisees. But we've got a steady pipeline of folks that want to become Domino's franchisees who already have the skills necessary and the experience necessary to run our stores.
Chris Carril: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI.
David Palmer: Thanks. Thanks for your comments, too, on the two-year trends, and I do think it makes sense to track those going forward. Perhaps you can help us think back to 2019, if we're going to look at those two-year trends and compare what you saw back then, what you did back then to what you're seeing in terms of your internal plans this year starting in the second quarter. I know last year was a weird year in terms of maybe not doing as many boost weeks and then, of course, the innovation has not been as robust as you might have had been doing lately and what we're seeing from your competitors lately. So perhaps you can talk about how much thunder you're going to be making in your business over the next few quarters versus what you did in 2019 as a benchmark? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure, David. We have a lot of things did change in our approach in 2020 relative to what we were doing back in 2019, driven by COVID and I talked about some of those a little bit earlier on the call, some of the things that we turned the volume down on a little bit with the carryout business being one of them, you might recall back at the beginning of 2020, we were running advertising on TV called, I can't call Pie Pass, where folks would walk into the store and see their name up on the screen as they pick their pizza, but we had to turn that off immediately when we couldn't allow customers to come into our stores. And then throughout the remainder of the year, we were developing new safe service methods for carryout, but we weren't pushing that business as hard as we had pushed not just in 2019, but in the years -- the five or six years that preceded that. Secondly, we turned off the more aggressive promotional weeks that we had typically peppered across the annual calendar. We ran those in 2019. We didn't run those in 2020. So those may give you a little bit of a sense for some of the things that we – arrows that we have in the quiver, if you will, that we can bring back and deploy in 2021 as we get to a more normal operating environment. We'll also continue to look at new product development and other relevant news to bring out to the market to attract customers into the brand. We actually did do a little bit of that in 2020 and looking forward to doing some more of that here in 2021.
David Palmer: So summing it all up, you'd say that it feels like it will be relatively comparable in terms of the energy on boost weeks and innovation the remainder of the year versus 2019, remainder of the year?
Ritch Allison: Well, we've still got -- David, things are still evolving on a real-time basis. And there's a lot of factors that we bring into play when we think about what we're going to deploy going forward. We're certainly still as -- not just at Domino's, but across the economy still riding a bit of the wave of government stimulus. And then we've still got COVID to deal with. We're making good progress with vaccinations across the U.S., but there's still a lot of work to be done there. So one of the things that we always look to do and that we have the ability to do here is to be flexible and to be adaptive. And we've got a number of arrows in the quiver, as I mentioned, to drive the business as we look out across the year depending upon how things unfold.
David Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Rutherford with Stephens Inc.
James Rutherford: I wanted to follow-up on the comment you made earlier about not seeing sales deterioration in markets that are more fully opened. Given there were a lot of puts and takes throughout that first quarter, including weather stimulus and many other factors, can you share anything about more recent trends given that we're seeing a real spike in dine-in behavior? And it also puts a little more distance between us and those stimulus checks. I mean have you seen any impact on your more recent average weekly sit in light of that reopening?
Ritch Allison: James, we're not going to comment today on anything post-quarter one. But we did -- during quarter one, as I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks, we certainly saw a quarter that was not an even quarter. You had stimulus on the beginning and on the end and then you had some rather extreme weather events in certain parts of the country in the middle. And then alongside all of that, you had the country reopening at different speeds all around. So, a lot of moving parts in the first quarter of the business. We, obviously, continue to stay on top of it, not weekly, but daily and hourly. And we'll have more to share, obviously, about the second quarter when we get together again in three months.
James Rutherford: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo.
Jon Tower: Thank you for taking the question. Just a quick clarification and then a second question on clarification, the franchisee EBITDA of $177,000 per store, does that include any benefit from government support like PPP loans? And then secondarily, following up on the loyalty conversation, with others in the limited service space kind of adding programs later this year, do you plan to alter some of the new loyalty member acquisition tactics, or perhaps change the rewards programs to some of the rewards themselves to ensure that the high level of engagement you have today doesn't slip.
Ritch Allison: Hey Jon, on your first question on the $177,000, we don't count any government money in that number. That's the EBITDA from running Domino's Pizza stores. And as a company, DPZ, we didn't take any government money through the course of this -- through the course of the pandemic. And on loyalty, the loyalty program has to be a living thing over time. We're little over five years into our loyalty program. We launched it back in 2015. And so we are constantly looking at different ways that we can turn the dials on that program to attract customers into the program to keep them engaged. So, constantly thinking about how customers earn and burn points over time. As we -- and we do learn from what we see out there in the marketplace as well as continuing to do an extensive amount of customer research on our own customers. We've been very pleased to see that the active enrollment in that program has continued to grow. So, it's continued to have appeal for new customers coming in. And then also, as I mentioned earlier, We've been pleased to see that the order frequency of active loyalty members has continued to remain steady because once you get your program to 27 million active as we have today, big part of that value comes from the -- just the ongoing and continued engagement and frequency of those customers.
Jon Tower: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Ritch, you guys have previously spoken about the ad fund surplus in 2020 from the better-than-expected sales performance that would likely be deployed in 2021. And I recognize that you were on air 52 weeks last year and presume will be on 52 weeks this year. But how are you thinking about deploying that surplus across the year? And in particular, are you concentrating in 2Q and 3Q when the toughest compares are lapped?
Ritch Allison: Andrew, thanks for the question. I won't comment on quarter-to-quarter and how we're going to deploy it, really for competitive reasons, if you will. But we are in a fortunate position to have a very strong war chest and surplus going into the year. And that gives us an opportunity as we look out across the year and we see what happens with sales trends in the business, it really does allow us to put a little bit more muscle against things when and where we need to.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners.
Brett Levy: Thanks for taking the call. You've talked about -- you talked a lot on this call and over the years about technology and your innovation. Can you give us a little bit more clarity into how much of what you have. Right now, you're more about talk and how much you can really start to put into play and drive greater efficiencies and show up more in the sales and the operational numbers. Obviously, things like Nuro are good, they showcase you're forward-looking. But for some -- for right now, it's probably not something that's going to be material for sometime. Just how are you thinking about that framework? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure. Brett, it's a great question, and one that, when we sit down every year and make our investment decisions around technology, we are always trying to invest against a portfolio both of near-term things that can have immediate value, but then also some of the longer-term investments that may not drive any immediate value, but that we want to make sure that we're out in the forefront on. When I think about the near-term component of that, we've got a significant amount of technology investment that is going to our stores today and improving the efficiency with which we operate our stores. When you think about what some of the kind of the key pinch points or constraints are in the business, right now. It is labor, it is availability and labor costs at the store level. So we're focusing a lot of time and energy on running more efficient stores, such that we can drive higher order counts and higher sales per labor hour. So there’s a lot of effort there and a number of things that are rolling out through our system today. And then on the longer term, Nuro is a great example of that. We are doing some autonomous deliveries as we speak, in Houston, right now, but it's going to be a while before autonomous delivery is broadly deployed across the Domino's system, but we want to make sure that we're investing and learning today, in particular, how the customer will interact with the robot and how the robot will interact with our operations at the stores. And those are the key learnings that we're trying to drive now, such that when we are able to more broadly deploy the technology, we're ready and have a good understanding of how it can impact our business and our customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about unit growth. We know that 2020 was a tough year, ultimately sub-4% versus, I think, your guidance two, or three-year guidance for 6% to 8% growth thing like COVID caused a one-year setback for you guys and others as well. But I'm just wondering whether there's any lingering effects in terms of sites or I think you mentioned permitting and construction delays. You would think the pent-up demand would be huge and the big uptick in the store level EBITDA would obviously help. But I'm just wondering whether you think 2021, it's reasonable to assume you get back within that range whether you have any color on the US or more importantly, on the international. Whether or not that hiring issue comes into play. We know that you're obviously struggling as everybody is to hire. I'm wondering whether any franchisees are talking about slowing down growth just because they need to staff those stores or whether they have creative ways to get labor in the stores. Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Sure, Jeff. You know, on the unit growth, we have already seen an acceleration in the pace. If you look at last year, we had 624 net openings for the year. And if you look in the first quarter of this year, when you look back trailing four quarter was 730. So that pace has already accelerated up by more than 100 units. And when we look at the pipeline in the US and we look at the pipeline in our international markets, we see a really strong pipeline ahead and an opportunity to continue to accelerate that pace of unit opening. The unknown for us as we look out across the year, still relates to COVID. And you turn the news on, you'll see there are some places around the world where COVID is really still raging and in some places, getting worse. To what extent that impacts our pace of unit growth, we're still monitoring and still have some uncertainty around that. But the good news for the brand is that the unit economics are incredibly strong, the demand for franchisee investment is there, and we expect to continue to see the pace of unit growth accelerate. The final part of your question was around the staffing and that’s always a challenge but one that we are franchisees feel comfortable that we can manage overtime. Part of the beauty, particularly as it relates to the US of opening these new stores is that the majority of these are opening in our – as part of our fortressing program and giving us an opportunity to do two things. One is to shrink the territory, so we get more deliveries per – per hour of delivery driver labor, but also you get that incremental carryout business, which is a much less labor-intensive business for our stores, which is one of the reasons we want to continue to grow and build that business.
Stu Levy: The other thing that I would just add to that is – and you've seen the increase in the growth, particularly Q4 last year in terms of new units. There is the unfortunate practical reality of even if you have the ability to grow, you have the demand or desire to grow, just the sheer bandwidth of trying to get that done, you don't – it just takes a while to make up for what stopped last year. You can't – our franchisees, our master franchisees internationally can't just double their numbers because they want to. They need the resources to go build it, the time to go build it. So it's going to take a while, while we continue to accelerate. It's going to take some time before we make up for the period of time that we lost last year.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Todd Brooks with CL King & Associates.
Todd Brooks: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. We spent some time on the call talking about arrows in the quiver to kind of drive traffic against this period of tougher compares coming up. We've talked about Boost weeks, talked about focusing on carryout. I'm wondering with the incremental advertising dollars that you're carrying into the year? Just wondering about anything you can share about shifts in tactics, whether more personalized marketing, more one-to-one marketing or through CRM platforms really trying to simulate frequency at the individual level. Are more resources going to that versus broader medium and getting the message out that way, when you look at kind of the mix of your spend in fiscal '21?
A – Ritch Allison: Hey, Todd, thanks for the question. And it's stuff that we think about all the time because the vast majority of the dollars in that advertising fund are franchisees dollars. So we spend it with great care. And it's one of the areas also – we talk a lot about how we use analytics to make decisions at Domino's. It's an area where we've got terrific analytics in terms of understanding the return on spending those dollars across a range of different channels or opportunities that we have to invest them on the part of our system. And so, we are constantly looking at that and managing the dials to use that investment for the greatest return for our system.
Todd Brooks: Okay. Great. Thanks Ritch. 
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ritch Allison for any additional or closing remarks.
Ritch Allison: Thank you very much, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on the call this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again in July to discuss our second quarter 2021 results. Have a great day.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-25 10:00:00) =====

Thank you. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Stu Levy.
Stu Levy: Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. We're excited to discuss our fourth quarter and annual results with you today. Overall, we had a very strong Q4 and full year 2020, despite the ongoing global challenges presented by COVID-19. Before we jump into the numbers, I would first like to remind everyone once again that our fourth quarter included an extra week this year, which also included New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. Both of which are typically major sales days. We have an extra week in our fiscal year every 5 or 6 years, depending on how the calendar falls. Typically, our fiscal year consists of three, 12-week quarters and a 16-week fourth quarter. But in 2020, our fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks. In the earnings release we filed this morning, the impact of this additional week has been adjusted out of our 2020 results as an item affecting comparability. The next time this will happen is in 2026. Turning to our results. Overall, our team members and franchisees around the world generated strong operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.85 for Q4 and $12.39 for the full year. Our diluted EPS, as adjusted for the extra week in our fiscal year, was $3.46 for Q4 and $12.01 for the full year. Here's some additional detail on the components of our earnings. In Q4, global retail sales grew 21.7% as compared to Q4 2019. As a reminder, global retail sales growth includes both comp growth and unit growth, which I'll break down for you in a moment. Our global retail sales in Q4 were benefited by the extra week and also by a weaker dollar. When excluding the extra week and the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 12%. For the full year, our global retail sales grew 12.5%. When excluding the extra week and the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 10.4%. Breaking down our global retail sales growth. Our US retail sales grew 22.8% during Q4 and 17.6% for the full year. When excluding the extra week, US retail sales grew 14.3% in Q4 and 15% for the full year. Our international retail sales grew 20.7% during Q4 and 7.5% for the full year. When excluding the extra week and the impact of foreign currency, international retail sales grew 9.9% for Q4 and 5.9% for the full year. During Q4, we continued to see positive momentum in our international business, including a reduction in temporary store closures and other operating restrictions, which contributed to sequentially stronger same-store sales performance and an increase in net units, which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily. Turning to comps. During Q4, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry, with 39 straight quarters of positive US comparable sales and 108 consecutive quarters or 27 years of positive international comps, both truly remarkable achievements. Same store sales in the US grew 11.2% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 3.4%. And same store sales for our international business grew 7.3%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.7%. As a reminder, our same store sales growth is not affected by the extra week. Breaking down the US comp, our franchise business increased 11.4% in the quarter while our company-owned stores were up 8.1%. The US comp this quarter was driven by a healthy mix of both ticket and order growth. Within that mix, our ticket growth was driven by an increase in items per order and a higher delivery mix, which often comes with an associated transparent delivery fee. The 7.3% international comp was driven by ticket growth. Similar to in our US business, that ticket growth was driven by both a higher item count and a higher delivery mix. Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 116 net stores in the US during the fourth quarter, consisting of 118 store openings and two closures. For the full year, we and our franchisees opened 229 net US stores. Our international business added 272 net stores during Q4, comprised of 328 store openings and 56 closures. For the full year, we added 395 net international stores. In total, we and our franchisees opened 624 stores globally in 2020. We're very pleased with our ability to continue to grow units during the pandemic and particularly encouraged by our strong growth in Q4. However, we do still face some challenges opening stores in certain markets, including delays in construction and permitting, which we will continue to monitor moving forward. Regarding revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion and were up $206 million or 17.9% from the prior year quarter. Total revenues for the year were $4.1 billion and were up $499 million or 13.8% from prior year. The extra week increased revenues by an estimated $88 million. The remaining increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which in turn drove higher revenues across all areas of our business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $0.4 million in Q4 as compared to Q4 2019, and negatively impacted our royalty revenues by $3.9 million for the full year as compared to 2019. Our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenues increased to 39.5% from 38.9% in Q4 2019, due primarily to higher revenues from our US franchise business, partially offset by investments made related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Company-owned store margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 21.9% from 24.4% in Q4 2019 and was negatively impacted by higher COVID-related labor costs. As we announced in December of 2020, we paid a special bonus to our front line workers to thank them for their contributions throughout the pandemic. Supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenue increased to 11.6% from 11.1% in Q4 2019, driven by operating efficiencies and reduced fuel expenses. G&A expenses increased approximately $19 million in Q4 2020 as compared to Q4 2019. For the full year, our G&A was $407 million, an increase of approximately $24 million as compared to prior year. We estimate that $6 million of these expenses were incurred as a result of the extra week this year. The remaining increase primarily related to higher variable performance based compensation expense and professional fees and was partially offset by lower travel expenses. Net interest expense increased approximately $8 million in the quarter as compared to Q4 2019. We estimate that $3 million of this increase was driven by the extra week this year. The remaining increase was driven by a higher weighted average debt balance resulting from our 2019 recapitalization transaction and was partially offset by a lower weighted average borrowing rate. Our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.9% from 4. 0% in Q4 2019 due to the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in Q4 2020 as compared to Q4 2019. Our reported effective tax rate was 19.9% for the quarter as compared to 17.8% in Q4 2019. The reported effective tax rate in Q4 2020 included a 1.8 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity based compensation as compared to a 3.9 percentage point positive impact in Q4 2019. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits. When you combine all of these elements, our fourth quarter net income was up $22.6 million or 17.5% over Q4 2019. For the full year, our net income went up $90.6 million or 22. 6% over 2019. We estimate that the 53rd week positively impacted net income by $15 million in the fourth quarter and for the full year due to the additional week of sales and the associated operating leverage, which is included as an item affecting comparability in our earnings release. Our diluted EPS in Q4 was $3.85 versus $3.12 in the prior year, an increase of 23.4%.  Our diluted EPS as adjusted in Q4 was $3.46 versus diluted EPS as adjusted of $3.13 in Q4 2019, an increase of 10.5%. Breaking down that $0.33 increase a bit. Most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.34. Our lower diluted share count, driven by share repurchases during 2020, benefited us by $0.16. I'll provide more detail on share repurchases in a moment. Higher net interest expense, resulting primarily from the higher average debt balances I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted us by $0.10. And finally, our higher effective tax rate, resulting primarily from lower tax benefits on equity based compensation, as I mentioned previously, negatively impacted us by $0.07. For the full year, our diluted EPS was $12.39 versus $9.56 in the prior year, an increase of 29.6%. Our diluted EPS as adjusted for the full year was $12.01 versus diluted EPS as adjusted of $9.57 in 2019, an increase of 25.5%. Shifting to cash. Our economic model remains strong, and it continued to generate significant free cash flow throughout the quarter. During full year 2020, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $593 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $504 million. Regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $89 million on CapEx in 2020, primarily on our supply chain centers and technology initiatives. During Q4, we also repurchased and retired approximately 568, 000 shares for $225 million or $3.96 per share on average, bringing our 2020 total repurchases to $305 million. Subsequently, we've also repurchased an incremental 66,000 shares for $25 million year-to-date in Q1 2021. Related to our repurchases, we're also pleased to announce that, as you saw in this morning's earnings release, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which has replaced the remaining authorization under our existing program. Additionally, during Q4, we returned $61 million to our shareholders in the form of two $0.78 quarterly dividend payments, bringing our 2020 total dividend payments to $122 million. As we move into 2021, we're excited to announce that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share, to be paid on March 30, an increase of 21% over the previous quarter's dividend. When you add the share repurchases and quarterly dividends, the cumulative impact is that we returned more than $425 million to shareholders in 2020. Before wrapping up the financial update, I'd like to walk you through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Q4 results, as we have done in previous quarters. During Q4, the estimated total impact from safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and other compensation for our team members and support for our franchisees and our communities was $7 million. As we look ahead, we would like to remind you of the 2021 outlook items that we communicated in mid January, as well as provide you with a longer-range outlook. We currently project that the store food basket within our US system will be up 2.5% to 3.5% as compared to 2020 levels, and we do expect some volatility around that range quarter-to-quarter. We estimate that foreign currency could have a $4 million to $8 million positive impact on royalty revenues in 2021 as compared to 2020. We anticipate our gross CapEx investments to be approximately $100 million, as we continue to invest in strategically growing our business, including in technology, innovation, new stores and supply chain capacity. We expect our G&A expense to be in the range of $415 million to $425 million. Keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down depending on, among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that affects variable performance based compensation expense, as well as other areas such as corporate store advertising. In addition, in this morning's earnings release, we also announced our two to three year outlook of 6% to 10% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, and 6% to 8% global net unit growth. We anticipate providing additional outlook measures if and when we have the appropriate visibility into the broader environment such that it would be meaningful for the investment community. In closing, our business continued its strong performance during the fourth quarter and for the year, and we remain in very good shape financially. Obviously, we will continue to closely monitor all aspects of our business operations given these uncertain times. And finally, as I intend to do in each of these calls, I want to take a minute to thank our incredible team members and franchisees around the world. They're the reason our brand is able to generate these results. Thank you again for joining the call today. And I'll now turn it over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thanks, Stu. And thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning. 2020 was a milestone year for us at Domino's. It's our 60th year in business, and it certainly was a year like no other. We and our franchisees entered the year with great optimism and solid plans to continue to grow the Domino's brand around the world. As COVID-19 swept across the globe, we were forced to adapt quickly to a new and more challenging operating environment. As we continue to deal with the pandemic, we were also confronted with profound issues around social justice that could not be ignored. Throughout the year, my team and I led with our values. And we stayed focused on our core stakeholders. Those are our customers, our team members, our franchisees, our communities and our shareholders. And despite the many challenges, our franchisees and team members rose to the occasion and delivered exceptional results during 2020. I am so grateful for the hundreds of thousands of committed people around the world who wear the Domino's logo every day. The year like no other really brought out the strength and determination that makes the Domino's culture so unique. Now I'd like to do a few things on the call this morning. I'll share some reflections on our performance during the quarter, but I'll focus most of my commentary on 2020 in total, across both our US and our international businesses. And I'll discuss some of the things we are focused on as we look forward into 2021 and beyond, and then following that, as always, we'll take some Q&A. So with that as our road map for the morning, let's get started with our US business. Over the past 60 years, we've worked very hard to earn the trust of our customers, built on our commitment to high quality products, service and image, along with our industry leading value. In 2020, that foundation of trust was as critical as ever. This trust allowed us to connect with our customers in unique ways and to communicate and to execute a safe, quality delivery experience for them and their families. We never took their trust lightly, and through innovations such as contactless delivery and Domino's car side delivery, we remain focused on ensuring that our customers felt as confident and safe as ever when they ordered from Domino's. We gave our customers more options, expanding our menu with three new product launches in the back half of 2020. Our new wings and sauces have been enthusiastically embraced by our customers. And our new cheeseburger and chicken taco pizzas are now among our best-selling specialty pizzas. Now innovation wasn't just limited to our delivery options or menu in 2020. We also delivered a number of operations in technology innovations to our stores. Those included our GPS driver tracking, our enhanced make-line and cuttable technology and tools, and our AI-enabled forecasting to better match demand with capacity in our stores. These innovations are all designed to increase speed, accuracy and efficiency, allowing us to continue to better serve our customers. We, along with our franchisees, also remain dedicated and disciplined on the value we're known for when our customers really needed it the most. Our core 5.99 and 7.99 platforms have been a reliable, important part of the Domino's brand experience for many years. While we certainly brought new customers into the brand over the last year, the story of 2020 was more about the frequency and loyalty of our existing customer base. Our customers ordered more often. And when they did, they also ordered more items. And we saw that specifically among our loyalty program members. We now have over 27 million, 27 million active members in our Piece of the Pie Rewards loyalty program. Notably, we achieved continued year-over-year growth in our loyalty program without running any of our more aggressive week long promotions during the last three quarters of 2020. Now despite the challenges associated with construction and permitting during the pandemic, store growth was once again a significant driver for us of growth in the US. We and our franchisees both new and existing, continued to invest in our businesses, resulting in 229 net new stores for the year. If you look back over the last 5 years, we've opened nearly 1,200 new stores in the US and we have closed fewer than 80 over the last 5 years. We continued to invest in our supply chain business to support the growth of our franchisees, opening two new US centers in 2020, on time and on budget. And that's despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We opened in Columbia, South Carolina in March. We opened in Katy, Texas in December. And in September, we also added a thin crust production line to our existing supply chain center in Edison, New Jersey. We also invested in the safety and well-being of our frontline corporate store and supply chain team members throughout 2020. We invested in equipment and processes designed to ensure their safety and an enhanced sick pay and benefits and enhanced hourly wages, recognizing the unique challenges of working during the pandemic, including the nearly $10 million in bonuses that we paid to our corporate store and supply chain team members in the month of December. And we invested in our communities throughout 2020, partnering with our franchisees to donate 10 million slices to first responders, frontline workers and families in need, responding to natural disasters by getting food to people in need, launching a national hiring campaign to provide 30,000 jobs to workers who may have been displaced from theirs, committing $3 million to support black communities in the US, including $1 million to establish the Domino's Black Franchisee Opportunity Fund, and partnering with our franchisees to raise $100 million over the next 10 years for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We and our franchisees raised $13 million for St. Jude in 2020 alone. Now looking ahead to 2020 in our US business, we will continue as a work in progress brand, striving to get a little better each and every day. And I'll highlight a few focus areas. And not surprisingly, most of these areas will not be new news to you. First, we will continue to fortress our markets, driving faster and more consistent service, lower delivery costs, better economics for drivers and incremental carryout traffic. Fortressing will continue to drive overall store growth into 2021, including in our company owned markets. We will continue to deliver new product innovation in 2021. We will continue to produce world-class advertising. And we're excited to begin our relationship with Work In Progress as our new advertising agency. We will continue to invest in technology to enable great customer experiences, to drive speed, accuracy and efficiency inside our stores, to improve our corporate store team members' ability to support our business. Value is always a key focus for us, and that won't change in 2021. More than ever, with many Americans out of work in these uncertain economic times, value matters. And we are committed to maintaining our unquestioned position of value leadership within the QSR pizza segment. We're ramping up our focus on service in 2021, getting pizzas out the door to our customers hotter, fresher and more reliably than ever before through innovation within our stores. We're doubling down with technology, with training and with communications. We will continue to invest in our frontline team members across our corporate stores and supply chain centers, increasing hourly wages in many markets and enhancing our team member benefits. We will also be taking a comprehensive look at our environmental impact. Within the next one to three years, we will set science-based, time-bound commitments in accordance with the science-based targets initiative process to reduce the company's total contribution to climate change, and as always, we will remain obsessed, absolutely obsessed with franchisee profitability. Stu shared our initial 2020 store level EBITDA estimate with you in January. And we will share the final number with you when that figure is ready. But we do expect it to be higher than the estimate that Stu shared with you last month. While we believe this level of profitability and associated cash-on-cash returns exceeds any player in our category, we recognize that some of our franchisees and our corporate stores are under intense cost pressure. Despite higher overall levels of unemployment across the country, many local labor markets remain tight and wages continue to rise across the country. Fixed costs such as rent and insurance also bring added pressure. But my team and I recognize these challenges, and we remain intensely focused on helping to drive efficiency and profitability at the store and enterprise level for our franchisees, just as we are for our corporate markets. As I look back on the fourth quarter and on the full year, I'm very happy with our US performance. We achieved our 39th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth and we surpassed $8 billion in US retail sales for the very first time. I am confident that we are well positioned to continue playing the long game in our US business. Now I'm going to move on to International. During the fourth quarter, our pandemic recovery continued, as we reopened stores and delivered the strongest quarterly comp we've reported in four years. We marked our 108th straight positive quarter. That's 27 full years, an incredible run that seemed in doubt when COVID struck early in the year. And I'm particularly pleased that our master franchisees continued to invest in the business, opening 272 net stores in the quarter and 395 net for the full year. Now when you consider that we had about 2,400 stores temporarily closed back in Q2, this is truly a remarkable achievement. And it highlights the terrific unit level economics that our master franchisees have built in many markets around the globe. There is no question that we had more closures in 2020. In fact, we had over 300 than you would normally see from Domino in a typical year. This was driven by strategic choices in several markets to close some previously underperforming units, including a number of units with formats that admittedly would have struggled in the new operating environment rather than reopening them after the pandemic. So when I look forward, I am very optimistic about our master franchisees' ability to ramp-up our unit growth across the international business. And I want to thank our international partners for their engagement throughout the year. We dramatically increased our communication across the system. And master franchisees from all over the world really leaned in, sharing best practices throughout the year to help their peers and to help our US team manage through the pandemic. This truly demonstrated the power of the global Domino's system. And we could not have responded so effectively to COVID without this level of partnership. Now I'd love to share a few 2020 market highlights. We opened for the first time in Croatia, welcoming the team there to the Domino's family. We opened 95 net stores in China and grew retail sales by over 30%, accelerating growth in this very important market. We were also very pleased to invest in DASH brands, our master franchise partner, with a $40 million investment in 2020 and the subsequent $40 million investment, which we completed in Q1 of this year. We are excited to partner more deeply with their terrific management team and investors. And I am more optimistic than ever about the potential for Domino's in China. Japan was an incredible success story in 2020, passing the 700 store milestone with 100 net stores and over 40% in retail sales growth. Germany is another market that saw outstanding retail sales growth of over 25%, with 100 - excuse me, where we are fast approaching 350 stores with much potential for future growth. I'd also like to thank our teams that worked incredibly hard to reopen stores throughout the year following the COVID-driven closures; India, France, Spain, Mexico, New Zealand and Panama are a few of the markets, along with many others around the world, that have pushed hard to bounce back from significant temporary closures and to position themselves for growth in 2021. Based on the latest reports, we now have fewer than 150 temporary international store closures. Now when we look at this recovery in our international business, India deserves a specific mention. After some strategic store closures earlier in the year, Jubilant Foodworks, our master franchise partner, dramatically accelerated growth with 50 net stores in their most recent reported quarter. And as we look forward into 2021, I remain very optimistic about the long-term growth potential of our international business. The opportunity is there, our unit economics are strong and our master franchisees are committed. Combined with our corporate support and best practice sharing around the globe, we have the recipe to take this business to its full potential. So in closing, 2020 was a year like none other, but Domino's is a brand like none other. I am proud of our franchise partners and our team members who once again proved to me that they are the best in the restaurant business. And as we look ahead to 2021, we aren't sure exactly what the new normal will look like or when we'll get there, but we will remain diligently focused on delivering for our customers, our team members, our franchisees, our communities and our shareholders. At Domino's, we have a long track record of profitable growth, driven by a disciplined operating model. This model served us well in 2020 and will continue to be the foundation for our growth in 2021 and beyond. This gives me a great deal of confidence in our ability to grow the Domino's brand over the long-term. That confidence is demonstrated in this morning's release, where we announced our new two to three year outlook of 6% to 10% global retail sales growth and 6% to 8% global net unit growth as well as our new $1 billion share repurchase program. So I'll leave my remarks this morning with a heartfelt thank you to our franchise partners and team members. And that's not just for your efforts in 2020, but also for your continued perseverance in 2021 as we battled COVID and the recent winter storms across the US. I am proud to serve you each and every day. And with that, Stu and I will be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Brian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning, Ritch. Good morning, Stu. Appreciate all the remarks. And I appreciate the reinstallment of a two to three year sales outlook. And I understand that this year, you'll be lapping an unprecedented situation from 2020 and that the visibility may not be as high as normal. But when you're talking about 6% to 8% unit growth, 6% to 10% retail sales growth, does this view also specifically apply to how you are thinking and we should think about 2021? At least on the unit growth side, it seemed like you had a really nice step-up in trends in the fourth quarter. So any additional color would be helpful? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Sure. Thanks, Brian. I appreciate the question. And our new outlook that we've published is a two to three year look. But specifically to your question on the unit growth, we were really pleased to see some significant momentum building in the fourth quarter of the year, as you saw in the store growth numbers that we published, both for the US business and for the international business. And the reality is there was a lot of pent-up demand out there throughout the course of the year where we just had challenges getting stores opened up due to construction and permitting and other issues. But the fundamental unit level economics in the business have never been better. Stu shared a preliminary look at US store level EBITDA last month. And as we tabulate the final numbers, we expect it to be at least that 158,000 or higher. So terrific economics in the business. Our approach to fortressing in the US and in our international markets is still working very, very well for us. And then as it relates to the global retail sales growth number, while COVID gave us some tailwind on that in the US, it was actually a headwind in the international side of the business when you look at all the temporary store closures that we had back in the second quarter, where we were up around 2,400 units that were closed, which had a significant impact, as you know, on retail sales back then. So we're optimistic, Brian, as we look forward, and that optimism is reflected in that new outlook that we published this morning.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Sara Senatore: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the US kind of competitive background. I was interested. You said the star [ph] of 2020 was really about increased orders and spend from existing customers. I know that you always get a lot of questions about consolidation and independence. But I guess my sense would be then based on what you're talking in your business, that maybe the whole category saw a nice tailwind, including both big competitors and independents. So maybe less about share shifts to Domino's and more about an aggregate kind of rising tide. And I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about that now that we're a year into the pandemic, if you have a better sense of maybe where the traffic was coming from or going to and what the intra-segment dynamics look like? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Sure. Thanks, Sara. And what I'll - as I answer your question, I'll break it down a bit across the two businesses that we run out of each of our boxes across the country. So if you start with the delivery business, most certainly, the pandemic brought a tailwind in the delivery business, not just for Domino's Pizza, but across the category, and frankly, across categories. And during the year, we saw strong growth in both order counts and also growth in ticket in that delivery business as customers tended to order more pizzas. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we also saw that, in particular, our 27 million active loyalty members ordered more from us. Their frequency increased during the year. If you contrast that with the carryout business, in the carryout business, COVID actually brought a headwind for us in terms of customer activity. As fewer customers during the pandemic were comfortable going out and walking into restaurants even to pick up carryout, we did see some pressure on order counts in the carryout business. And the growth story there in 2020 was really around ticket. Now prior to the pandemic, that carryout business has been a terrific source of customer acquisition and order count growth for us. So as we look forward into 2021, that is one of the important drivers that we see in terms of our ability to continue to grow sales in the US, is the restart of that growth on the carryout side of the business.
Stu Levy: And the one thing I'd add to that is, keep in mind, I think, as we've said before, in a lot of cases, the carryout customer is different from the delivery customers. So it's not necessarily a shift from carryout to delivery with the same customer base. It's an increase in delivery and a headwind in carryout. And that's one of the reasons that we have such a high degree of confidence and kind of excitement about what that business can bring to us moving forward.
Sara Senatore: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Your line is open.
Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Ritch, several restaurants have accelerated their investments in technology given the increase they've seen in digital orders. And some of these companies are probably starting with newer technology that I'm guessing Domino's might have even. So do you believe Domino's needs to ramp up its investment or accelerate plans to ensure its tech does not get surpassed by some of the competitors?
Ritch Allison: Yes. Chris, great question. And the answer is we've been investing for a long time, and we continue to increase that investment each and every year in technology, because you're absolutely right. The half life of any lead that you have is pretty short on that side of the business. And our investments will continue. They did in 2020 and will continue going forward. We're continuing to make great progress with the development of our next-generation of our Pulse software, which is really the heartbeat of our stores. We're continuing to invest in our digital ordering platforms as well. And we saw a really nice growth in digital ordering. During 2020, our digital sales for the year went up about 5 points over 2019. We ran about 75% digital sales throughout 2020. So we will continue to make investments there to drive the business on the customer side. We're also ramping up our investments in technology as it relates to how we operate our stores. So I've talked a little bit about GPS tracking. We invested in that in 2020, substantially rolled that out across the entire US system. We'll continue to invest there, and also additional technology tools at the make line and at the cut table inside our stores to make the jobs easier for our team members and to help us to get pizzas out the door faster to our customers.
Chris O'Cull: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Lauren Silberman: [Technical Difficulty] incremental competition from the third-party delivery, customer restaurant acquisition, geographic expansion…
Ritch Allison: Hey, Lauren, we can't hear you here. I wonder if you could start over maybe a little closer to your mic.
Lauren Silberman: Is this better? Hello?
Ritch Allison: Yes. You're breaking up.
Lauren Silberman: Okay. I'll go back in the queue, hopefully.
Ritch Allison: Why don't we go to the next question? And Lauren, will come back and try again later.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open sir.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. I know you guys aren't going to, for a lot of logical reasons, give quarterly comp guidance, especially with the comparisons that are about to change so meaningfully in coming weeks. But I did just want to get your overall thoughts, especially as you do have some leading indicators of markets that have reopened. And most people talk about the reopening trade of people going back, and dining in restaurants. And a lot of the consumer packaged food companies seem to suggest that they're not going to lose very much of their own business that, they've generated through grocery in 2020. So the question is, as we think about second half of ‘21 versus second half of ‘19 or even if we think about ‘22 versus ‘19, what's your sense and listen, and I guess at this point, it's a guess. But you guys get to make an educated guess using some of the early market data that you have of kind of being able to grow sales versus the ‘19 level, even if we do say, hey, comping against high-teens comps is just always going to be difficult for any business, and we just shouldn't expect that. But how are we feeling second half of ‘21 and ‘22 versus ‘19, given what might be a way for at least certain groups of people to go back to dining inside of restaurants?
Ritch Allison: Hey, John, yes, thanks for the question. And I guess, what I would say at a high level is that, we see a lot of - even with the tailwind that we had in 2020 in the delivery business, we had a headwind on the carryout side of the business, as I talked about earlier. So when I look across 2021, one important growth driver for us is going to be to reaccelerate that growth on the carryout side of the business, because we know lapping some of the delivery tailwind is going to be difficult. We're also going to continue to invest in value in the business, as we always have and making sure that as our customers continue to manage their households through what is going to be a fairly difficult economic time for a lot of Americans, we believe that continuing to stay focused on value is also going to help us. As a lot of folks who have been paying a lot to have food delivered to their houses, as behaviors start to change and other options open up. We're going to continue to have Domino's as the unquestioned value leader in the QSR pizza segment. And frankly, broadly across the restaurant industry, when you think about what it costs to have food delivered to feed a family of four, we really like our positioning in that space. We'll also look throughout the year to reinitiate some of our boost weeks, our aggressive value weeks that have been an important part of our strategy to acquire customers, over the last number of years. So we're not going to do anything, John, just a lap a comp that’s not how we manage the business here. Everything that we do is going to be around how do, we continue to drive sustained and profitable long-term growth for our franchisees and ourselves.
Stu Levy: And the only - the other thing I'd just add to that is, we also think we benefit from the fact that our store base is everywhere. We're not urban dominated or suburban dominated. We hit all markets. And when you hear folks talking about the wave of people that are going to rush back into dine-in restaurants, they're generally coming from a more densely populated urban perspective where those restaurants are more prevalent. As you start looking across the landscape and you look at that relative to our store footprint, it gives us a lot of confidence to be able to weather some of that.
John Ivankoe: And do you have any evidence in markets like Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, maybe certain parts of Florida, that suggests that you are holding on to that business as '19 as some of the dine-in business in those areas is strong?
Ritch Allison: John, less - we see kind of less, I guess, you would say, less trends about region in the country, but what we - when you take a look at urban stores versus second city or suburban or rural, our business has been strongest in that rural and suburban area. It really is the urban centers where we've seen the most pressure on our business, frankly, across the carryout and the delivery businesses.
John Ivankoe: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.
David Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Ritch, I was wondering if we could go back to your fourth quarter performance. And while still healthy, it was lower from a comps perspective in the US relative to the elevated levels you had during the middle of the year. And I was wondering if you could just opine on what the reasons were you saw a slower trend exiting the year and whether that has any implications related to kind of your brand and the positioning in the market?
Ritch Allison: Sure. So David - and I hope I have a lot of quarters where I can talk about an 11% comp. So we're pretty proud of the comp as it is. But I will talk a little bit about some of the deceleration relative to the third quarter. And there is a couple of things. One is that there is no question that the stimulus dollars and the enhanced federal unemployment insurance certainly puts money in consumers' pockets and allows them to go out and buy food. And as we move further and further away in the fourth quarter from that stimulus that had been enacted earlier in the year most certainly, that had an impact on our business. As we continue to aggressively open stores, as that accelerated, certainly, the impact of some of those splits weighs a little bit on the comp. And then frankly, as we got deeper into the fourth quarter and you started to see the COVID-19 pandemic in a significant resurgence across the country, that has a material impact on the carryout business when folks get less comfortable getting out in their cars and going to visit places of business.
David Tarantino: Great. Thank you, very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Your line is open.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thank you and thanks for taking the question. Ritch, I wanted to ask about service times and delivery times. Maybe you could just give us how those trended throughout the year and into the fourth quarter, and really in the context of the fortressing strategy that you've been implementing for a couple of years now, as well as a pretty sizable increase in demand for delivery and the availability of drivers. So any details you could provide on that would be helpful? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure. Thanks, Peter. Well, we've been working really hard on service times across the business. And what I'll tell you is that, when we got the initial rush of demand back in the second quarter, we certainly saw our service times suffer a little bit. But team, both on the corporate store side and our franchisees as well, worked really hard to claw back and improve those times relative to the first wave of the pandemic. Service time improvement is going to continue to be a significant not just in 2021, quite frankly, but longer-term effort for us, that really is one of the important moats that we have to build around our business. And fortressing is certainly a big part of that. And we do continue to see, where we fortress our markets, we do see service time improvements, material improvements as we shrink the radius around the stores, allowing us to travel fewer miles and get to our customers with not just faster, but hotter, fresher food.
Stu Levy: And on top of that, delivering our own food enables us to drive better service, right? Because we can go from the oven out the door without having to wait for a third-party to come in and pick it up.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
John Glass: Thanks and good morning all. I wanted to come back, Ritch, in state of the market share question. I think you shared ICR some market share to the delivery, and it was, if I remember correctly, like 36%. And that really didn't change from ‘19. So if that's correct, or if it's not correct, let me know. But why - you're growing share in the past. And this year, you think will be a year where you could have grown share more just given your capability. So why do you think that's the case? Is it just everyone got better? Was it independents suddenly got stronger? What is it in that dynamic that maybe changed in 2020? And how do you think - why - what the causes of it?
Ritch Allison: Yes, John. I think what we saw in 2020 was just broad growth across the category. So while we had terrific growth in our delivery business, there was broadly across the category a lot of growth. A lot of independents that maybe didn't have a big delivery business back in ‘18 and ‘19, they jumped with both feet into delivery to stay alive in 2020. And through the use of third-party aggregators to deliver their product, that certainly resulted in some delivery growth coming from some of the independents and regionals that maybe wasn't there in the past.
John Glass: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Eric Gonzalez: Hi. Thanks for the question. And good morning. Regarding the potential wage increases, I was wondering how that might impact your ability to hold on to those 5.99 and 7.99 price points. Or said a different way, recognizing that all good things might eventually come to an end, what would have to happen from an inflation perspective for you to need to back away from those platforms? And what can be done to protect those price points without having materially widen gap versus other items on the menu? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure, Eric. So the interesting thing is, today, as it relates to wage environment, we've operated in a really wide spectrum of wage rates across the country as it is today. And I know minimum wage, in particular, is certainly a topic that everybody is thinking about out there. But today, we operate in states that are at the federal minimum wage, all the way up to places like Seattle, which are already in excess of $15, $16 an hour. And we've still been able to offer the 5.99 and 7.99 platforms across the country. And there is a couple of things that enable us to do that. One is the volumes that we run at, there's no way you can stay at that value level without having a high volume business like we have today. Second is that our franchisees at the local level have flexibility around menu pricing and around delivery fees. And their transparent delivery fees at the local level, they're going to be higher in these higher wage markets than they are in some of the others. So we've been able to manage our way through a lot of minimum wage increases across the country. And I'll tell you, quite honestly, in our corporate store business, we're not paying the federal minimum wage anyway. You can't go out there and hire people at that rate anyway. We're above the minimum wage, both for our folks that work inside the stores and our tip drivers on the road. And then in our supply chain business, we're in excess of $15 an hour everywhere we operate.
Stu Levy: Yes. I mean, if you think about the offers, they've been -- we've had them for years. And every year, we basically have wage rate increases and food cost increases and continue to drive additional profit. And for us, it's - we do a ton of deep market research and analytics around where that profit maximizing price point is for us. So it's not - it's certainly not set arbitrarily. And that is certainly a place where we provide a ton of value to the consumer, and we've been able to do it profitably and continue to do so.
Eric Gonzalez: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Lauren Silberman: Thanks. Can you guys hear me better now?
Ritch Allison: Yes. It’s much better. Thanks, Lauren.
Lauren Silberman: Okay. Awesome. Sorry about that. So coming into COVID, Domino's and the pizza category in general is facing incremental competition from the growth in third party delivery. Richard you mentioned that COVID, the delivery channel overall has benefited with the acceleration of adoption? So as you look at the competitive environment today, do you think Domino's is any better positioned with respect to third party delivery now that restaurants will likely be more focused on bringing back in-store traffic and there's some kind of regular more regulatory requirements, or in a more challenging position given the breadth and depth of competition has increased?
Ritch Allison: Yes, Lauren, for us, it's I guess, a little bit less about regulatory. I think for us, we -- be honest, we struggled a little bit understanding the long-term economics in some of the aggregator businesses. In 60-years, we've never made a dollar delivering a pizza. We make money on the product, but we don't make money on the delivery. So we're just not sure how others do it. And in a world where we're trying to shrink our delivery area to get closer to our customer for better service, a lot of these third-parties are trying to expand to reach more customers, which we think just takes away from service. And when you think about the profit equation, you get somebody who inserts themselves into the value chain, and they have to make their money somewhere. And it's either got to come from the restaurant or it has to come from the customer. And we think overtime, that's going to put a lot of pressure, particularly on the independent restaurants to be able to continue to make margins in rising cost environments, while paying these aggregators. And the customers overtime are going to start looking at the free delivery that cost them $15 to get $12 worth of food when they start digging in to look at service fees and service charges. So we're just not sure how it all plays out. And you've seen that with some of some of the public players in that space who have commented about the challenge of driving long-term profitability as an aggregator. So for us, we continue to just be the low-cost delivery provider, provide great value. And we think as long as we're providing a great product with great service at a great value, we'll let everything else shake out. And certainly, we don't know how long it will take to all shake out. But from our perspective, we're in a pretty good spot.
Lauren Silberman: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open. 
Dennis Geiger: Great. Thanks for the question. Ritch, I wanted to ask a little bit more on loyalty and new product innovation as we think about 2021 and even going forward. I'm just wondering if you could talk more about those two opportunities and kind of how those might allow you to keep some of the new customers that you might have gained in 2020, I guess, and or attract new customers going forward. Just how those initiatives may help you to kind of hold or even gain category share going forward? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure. Thanks for the question. So I'll talk about loyalty, maybe just even a little bit more broadly because there were a couple of metrics that I shared earlier that I think are important on this front. One is the increase in the number of active members of our piece of the pie rewards program, which was up to 27 million plus. We also saw an increase in engagement and frequency among that group as well, which is a big focus of ours. Once that program gets to that level of scale, 27 million plus. And we've got - beyond that, we've got 40 million plus that at some point have been enrolled in the program, and we've got 80 million plus customers that are in our database. So we spent a lot of time on initiatives thinking about how can we continue to mine that treasure of customers and find ways to better serve them at their time of need to drive higher frequency. Another metric I shared earlier that is also important is, the increase that we saw in digital engagement with our customers, with digital sales going up from 70% to 75% during the year broadly across the customer base that see another opportunity because those customers tend - our ticket tends to be higher because we do a better job with upsell on them. And once they start ordering digitally, they tend to be stickier with us over the long-term. So we'll continue, as we always do, many efforts focused in that space. And then you asked about new products also. We had, as I mentioned earlier, three that we successfully launched in 2020 and that's going to continue to be part of our playbook going forward. We've got some exciting things that our culinary team has been working on that I certainly like, and based on our testing, a lot of our customers do as been working on that I well. So you'll see some more news coming from us in that space during 2021 as well.
Dennis Geiger: Thanks, Rich.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Chris Carril: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. So just following up on the comments around carryout as well as on labor costs. How are you thinking about the carryout opportunity in the context of carryout margins versus delivery margins? Just - especially with the increasing focus on minimum wage and potential for incrementally higher labor costs?
Ritch Allison: Yes. It's a great question. And prior to the pandemic, we had taken the carryout mix up to about 45% of our orders. And that mix came down a bit during COVID, as we talked about earlier, given just the changing customer behaviors. We are very much focused on growing that carryout business in 2021 and forward. And while the ticket is lower on a carryout order, to your point, there's so much less labor cost associated with each of those carryout orders. That the higher the average hourly labor rate gets in your market, the more of the profitability equation tilts toward those carryout orders. And this is something that we've seen, frankly, in some of our international markets as well which have much higher labor costs than the US does. Driving that carryout business has been a really important part of continuing to grow profitability at the store level for our franchisees.
Stu Levy: But we are profitable on both channels.
Ritch Allison: Absolutely.
Chris Carril: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Brett Levy: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just following up on, I think it was Eric's question. With all of the moving parts that are going on there throughout the system, with tough comparison, just rising cost. How flexible and what are you hearing from the franchises in terms of how they're thinking about approaching 2021, whether that is from a marketing standpoint or a pricing or a willingness and ability to add to their labor pool? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Sure. Great question. What I would tell you is that we have such a fantastic base of franchisees across the US who are excited and eager to lean in, in 2021. And that's in a couple of ways. One that you mentioned, adding team members to their stores. I can tell you that everyone I go out there and talk to is aggressively trying to hire and add to their teams. Because funny thing happens when you add more delivery drivers to your business, your sales go up over time. But also, franchisees are also excited about continuing to invest in their businesses and in building new stores. Because as we continue to grow sales and as profits have increased, the equation around those new store openings, particularly when we've got places where we're fortressing or splitting, gets even more attractive. So we've got a committed group that's ready to lean in and invest in 2021.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Just a follow-up on the aggregator question. I know you had previously talked about consolidation within that subgroup and maybe promoting more aggressively. And you guys were keen to remain solo. With that said, I think we will have seen that COVID has driven large increases in at least traffic on these sites. So even if you were to never allow aggregators to do your delivery, as Stu mentioned, which would – it allows you to retain the service levels and make sure you're still profitable. But would you ever think about having your brand on their platform just to reach the additional eyeballs and generate the sales? I'm just wondering what the risks might be on that front just to drive the traffic, but not necessarily pay the risk – or pay the fees and have the risk of it impacting service. Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Yes, Jeff. We've looked at it many, many times over the last couple of years. And as some of our international markets do gather some of their orders through aggregators. We don't allow aggregators to deliver our food anywhere. But in some context, in our international markets, it's made some sense. Every time we look at it here in the US, it just doesn't make sense for us or our franchisees economically. And if it doesn't make sense economically, it certainly doesn't make sense to take the risk of sharing all of our customer data with these third parties.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
David Palmer: Thanks. I guess this is a follow-up on a lot of questions about market share, but also the legacies of COVID in terms of your business going forward. Do you view any of these market share shifts as perhaps more sticky than the others? You meant – you've shown at the ICR presentation that you gained a lot of share of overall QSR pizza, which probably means that the independents got hammered pretty hard on the pickup at store. I'm wondering maybe, are those scars that remain? Or do you expect a big snapback? And then conversely, you've talked about delivery share remaining flat in pizza. I would imagine it's down in overall delivery, and that might have some influence or some stickiness long-term or not. How are you thinking about these things? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Yes. Sure, David. So the way we look at it is, we are executing against strategies to continue to drive market share in both segments of the business, both the delivery and the carryout segments. And certainly, 2020 was a very unique year in terms of how some of this shifted around, in particular, with so many restaurants jumping into delivery, and frankly, with so many consumers having no choice but to go pick up food or have it delivered. But we feel very good about the plans and strategies that our teams have put in place to continue driving market share in both of those segments of our business.
Stu Levy: And it's hard to really make a generalization on the independents because it really does vary market to market and area to area. And a lot of that data is not yet in or really hard to get. I do think, certainly, to the comments we made before on the aggregators where you have the smaller independents that jumped into delivery by using a third party, like I said, we have some questions about the viability of that long-term if you're an independent paying exorbitant fees for a third-party to step in your value chain. So when does that all shake out? Your guess is as good as ours.
David Palmer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jared Garber: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to know, if you guys could give us an update on the part usage and how that's trended throughout the pandemic. And maybe some color around fourth quarter, maybe what you saw, any potential shifting trends with the ebbs and flows of COVID? I would imagine that the weekend and the late night day parties took more of a hit this year. I wanted to know if you saw any changes of that during the fourth quarter? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Thanks, Jared. Yes, story has been the same. We've really had some downward pressure on that evening and late night day part, really throughout the pandemic, with dinner and lunch staying really strong.
Operator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.
Jeff Farmer: Thank you. Looks like your Carside delivery has been in place nationally for roughly eight months at this point. I'm just curious, if you guys can share some more color on how customer adoption is progressing more specifically as it continued to build with awareness? And could you share, hopefully, where your curbside delivery mix stood in the fourth quarter? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Yes. Jeff, we're really excited about Domino's Carside delivery. And this is something that didn't even exist at the beginning of 2020. It was an idea, a concept that the team just pulled forward and accelerated the development on. And now we've fully rolled out across our system. And not only has it helped us in the pandemic to do safe carryout for customers.  But frankly, over the long haul, we look at Carside delivery as the way we will compete against the drive-through. We've only got about 10% or so of our Domino's in the US to have a drive-through window. So this is a great way for us to serve customers without them getting out of their cars.  Post the rollout, we have continued to improve our service times in Carside delivery. And our aspiration here, which is well within reach, is that we get to a point where you can get a Carside delivery at Domino's faster than you can wait in line at a QSR drive-through to get your food through the window.  And to your point on mix, we don't - we're not sharing that externally yet for competitive reasons. But we have seen a dramatic increase in customer usage of Domino's Carside delivery since we launched it. And part of our 2020 plans are going to be to drive that even higher.
Operator: All right. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. You mentioned that you guys grew the loyalty program in 2020 to a record 27 million members from about 25 million at the end of 2019. But it looks like the level of growth slowed from roughly 20 million members in 2018 to the 25 million in 2019. Can you help reconcile this given efforts utilized in 2020 to help enroll customers in the program while there is obviously a more sedentary US population? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure, Andrew. So part of it is, with these types of programs, as they get bigger and bigger, the growth in active membership gets more difficult year-on-year. But a couple of things that we were most pleased with when we look back at the loyalty program over 2020 was, one, that we grew it without in the final three quarters, the use of any of our more aggressive boost weeks, which are an important tool to drive customer acquisition. And then the second thing is that we were able to grow the number of customers active in the program, while also still growing the frequency with which those customers order. And when you take a look at driving volume in the business, it really is those two metrics in combination with one another that drive the overall increase in engagement and sales with those loyal customers.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Alex Slagle: Yes, thanks. Good morning. On the franchisee profitability, obviously, 2020 was a knockout year. Just curious how much the reduced discounting and promotional efforts impacted the franchisee profitability and kind of thoughts on what you think it will look like into ‘21 and beyond. 
Ritch Allison: Yes. We did terrific year on franchisee profitability in 2020. And what it's really driven by, it is driven by increasing order counts across the business, particularly on the delivery side of the business. But also increasing ticket, but smart ticket, not increases in prices, but increases in the number of items that customers bought on average for each of their orders. So even in the face of some increases in labor costs and other fixed costs in the business, it really is that volume increase that drove the uptick in profitability during the year.
Stu Levy: Yes. And that item - that uptick in the item count really basically gets you operating leverage in the store.
Alex Slagle: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of James Rutherford with Stephens. Your line is open.
James Rutherford: Thanks for taking the question. I'm curious about how Domino's will navigate this mix shift that you're expecting back toward carryout after the big year of delivery gain. It seems like from previous comments, the carryout transaction is possibly more desirable than delivery from an operator's perspective given the margins. But I'd love to hear more color about the top line impact, I mean, to the extent that certain customers turn a delivery order during COVID into a carryout order, for example, in the way home for work or something like that. What's the typical check size difference there? And what are some things you could potentially do to elevate that carryout ticket without compromising the value proposition? I'm just trying to understand that potential impact to your royalty revenue stream. Thanks so much.
Ritch Allison: Sure, sure. And the objective for us will be to grow both of those channels. COVID, we don't have all the data out of COVID yet to fully understand all of the customer behavior changes. But prior to COVID, there is only about 15% of customers that were both delivery and carryout, because customers tend to be one or the other. So as we look at the business going forward and think about how do we grow it in 2021 and beyond, it is going to be through a unique set of strategies around each of those two channels. So while we're certainly going to be aggressive on the carryout side with Domino's car side delivery and other initiatives that we have in place, we absolutely are not stepping away from the delivery side of the business also. And we've got a set of strategies that we're going to continue to execute on the delivery side as well so that we could hold on to those customers that we gained during the course of 2020.
Stu Levy: We're not looking at it so much as a shift from one or the other as it is a reemergence or kind of gaining back some of those carryout customers that have been on the sideline. The most notable difference, obviously, from a ticket perspective is just the delivery fee.
Ritch Allison: And typically, it's just slightly - a little bit lower item count in those orders as well. But both channels, very attractive and profitable businesses for our franchisees.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Chief Executive Officer, Rich Allison, for closing remarks. Go ahead, sir.
Ritch Allison: Thank you. And listen, thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call this morning. And Stu and I look forward to speaking with you in late April, when we'll discuss our first quarter 2021 results.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Third Quarter 2020 Domino's Pizza Incorporated Earning Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And now I will hand the conference over to your speaker today, Chris Brandon, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Chris Brandon: I appreciate it, Carmen, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our conversation today regarding the results of our third quarter 2020. I am also joined today by our Vice President of Finance, Michelle Hook, who recently took on an expanded role within our finance organization, that includes oversight of our Investor Relations function, in addition to her other responsibilities. Today's call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Ritch Allison and Chief Financial Officer, Stu Levy. As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in this morning's earnings release and 10-Q also apply to our comments on the call today. Both of those documents are available on our website. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the 8-K earnings release to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that maybe referenced on today's call. Our request to our coverage analysts, we as always want to do our best to accommodate all of you today. So we encourage you to ask only one, one part question on this call if you would please. Today's conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Ritch Allison.
Ritch Allison: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. First, this morning, I'd like to welcome Stu Levy to the call. This will be Stu's first earnings call as our new CFO. As all of you know, Jeff Lawrence announced his retirement from Domino's on our Q2 call. And while we will miss Jeff and we wish him well, we're excited to welcome Stu, as our new CFO. Stu brings a very successful operational track record and a strong connection to the Domino's culture, having led our supply chain division since January of 2019. Under Stu's leadership, we have significantly improved the operational and financial performance of our supply chain business. Stu also has deep experience in strategy and planning from his work at Republic Services and at Bain & Company. Stu is supported here at Domino's by a very talented and experienced group of finance professionals. I know all of you will enjoy working with Stu and his team in the months and years ahead. Now before I turn the call over to Stu, I do want to take a moment this morning to express a very well deserved thank you, and that's first to our customers for continuing to give us and our franchisees the privilege to serve you around the world. To our franchisees and operators, I want to thank you for your continued energy, hustle and for the passion you have for this brand, for your teams, and for your customers. And finally to our corporate teams, for your incredible efforts in support of the brand, our customers, our franchisees and our many operators around the world. In the face of this unprecedented pandemic, you have all continued to lead with our values first. And I am extremely proud to serve you as your CEO. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Stu for his remarks on the third quarter. And then I'll come back to share my thoughts on the quarter, and more broadly on the Domino's business around the world. Stu, over to you.
Stu Levy: Thank you, Ritch, and good morning, everyone. I'm really excited to step into this role, and I'm looking forward to working with all of you in the coming months and years. In the third quarter, we continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 38 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales, and 107 consecutive quarters of positive international comps, a truly outstanding accomplishment and a testament to the overall strength of the Domino's brand, and the incredible hard work of our franchisees and team members around the world. We also continue to increase our global store count, opening 209 gross new stores and 83 net new stores in Q3. Our diluted EPS in Q3 was $2.49, an increase of 21.5% over Q3, 2019, primarily resulting from strong operational results and partially offset by COVID-related expenses. Let me provide a bit more detail regarding our financial results for Q3. Global retail sales grew 14.4% as compared to Q3, 2019, pressured by a stronger dollar. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency global retail sales grew by 14.8%. Same-store sales in the U.S. grew 17.5% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 2.4%. And same-store sales for our international business grew 6.2%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.7%. Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business increased 17.5%, while our company-owned stores were up 16.6%. The U.S. comp this quarter was driven by a healthy mix of both ticket and order growth. During the quarter, we continue to see a benefit from remaining relentlessly focused on providing good value for our customers and doing so in a safe and convenient way, both through our delivery and carryout channels. This has resulted not only in overall order growth, but also in an increase in items per order, which drove our overall ticket growth in the quarter. In our international business, we were pleased to see a sequential improvement over Q2 in retail sales, reflecting fewer temporary store closures and in some markets fewer service method and other operating hour restrictions, relative to those seen earlier during the pandemic. The 6.2% international comp was driven by ticket growth, which was largely a result of a shift to more delivery orders, which tend to include more items and a delivery fee, thus yielding a higher ticket. Shifting to unit count. We added 44 net stores in the U.S. during the third quarter, consisting of 47 store openings and three closures. Our international business added 39 net new stores during Q3, comprised of 162 store openings and 123 closures with those closures primarily occurring in India. We believe the pandemic has had a net negative impact on store openings globally, in part due to government restrictions, as well as general permitting and construction delays. Overall, our unit economics remain strong, particularly in the U.S., and we continue to work with our franchisees to sustainably grow their businesses. Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the third quarter were up 17.9% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by higher retail sales in the U.S., which in turn drove higher revenue in our supply chain and U.S. store businesses. Our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenues decreased to 37.4% from 38.5% in Q3, 2019, due primarily to investments made related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher revenues from our U.S. franchise business. Company-owned store margin as a percent of revenue was down year-over-year and was negatively impacted by higher COVID-related labor and supplies costs. Sequentially, operating margins saw additional pressures from higher food costs, as we've continued to see significant fluctuations in commodity prices throughout the pandemic. Supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenue was also down year-over-year and was negatively impacted by higher food costs, as well as similar COVID-related expenses. G&A expenses increased approximately $8 million as compared to Q3, 2019, primarily due to higher variable performance-based compensation expense. Net interest expense increased approximately $6 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by a higher weighted average debt balance resulting from our 2019 recapitalization transaction, and to a lesser extent, borrowings under our variable funding notes during the quarter. Our reported effective tax rate was 19.9% for the quarter, down 1.8 percentage points from the prior year quarter. The reported effective tax rate included a 2.8 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits. When we combine all of those positive elements, our third quarter net income was up $12.8 million, or 14.8% over Q3, 2019. Our diluted EPS in Q3 was $2.49 versus $2.05 in the prior year, an increase of 21.5%. Let me break down the $0.44 increase a bit. Most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.35. Our lower effective tax rate, resulting primarily from higher tax benefits on equity-based compensation, as I mentioned previously, positively impacted us by $0.06. A lower diluted share count, driven by share repurchases prior to the pandemic benefited us by $0.13. And finally, higher net interest expense, resulting primarily from higher average debt balances negatively impacted us by $0.10. Shifting to cash, our financial standing remains strong. We continue to generate positive cash from operations during the third quarter, and as of the end of the quarter, we had more than $330 million in available cash, and an additional $160 million of available borrowing capacity under our variable funding notes. During the third quarter, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $158 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $141 million. During Q3, we also returned $31 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.78 per share quarterly dividend. Finally, while we have not repurchased any shares under our board authorized share repurchase program since the first week of January, we have $327 million remaining under the program for future repurchases. Before wrapping up the financial update, I'd like to walk you through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Q3 results. As we've mentioned previously, we are steadfast in our commitment to do the right thing for our team members, our franchisees, our customers and our communities. During Q3, the total impact from safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and other compensation for our team members, and support for our franchisees and our communities was $11 million. Separately, the estimated Q3 impact on international royalty revenues from partial store closures was $2 million. And while we withdrew our original annual guidance measures earlier this year, due to the uncertainty surrounding the business in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, given the growth in our overall business and the corresponding increase in G&A expense from Q2 to Q3, I wanted to provide some visibility on the anticipated full year G&A number. We currently expect our full year G&A expense to be in the range of $405 million to $410 million for the 53-week fiscal year. Keep in mind, the G&A expense can vary in either direction depending on among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that impacts our variable performance-based compensation expense. In addition to the G&A guidance, we currently estimate that FX for the 2020 full fiscal year could have a $5 million negative impact on royalty revenues, which is lower than previous estimates, driven by the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In closing, our business continued its strong performance in the third quarter, and we remain in very good shape financially. Obviously, we will continue to closely monitor all aspects of our business operations given these uncertain times. And finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't take a minute to thank our incredible team members and franchisees around the world. It's their dedication and commitment to our customers and our communities that allows us to generate these results. Thank you again for joining the call today. And now I'll turn it over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thank you, Stu, and once again, congratulations on the new role. I'm certain our analysts and investors are going to enjoy getting to know you better in the days ahead. Now moving on to our results. I'll briefly discuss our U.S. and international businesses before we take some questions. So let's get started with a discussion about the U.S. business. During the third quarter, the pandemic continued to drive a favorable tailwind for food delivery, coupled with a challenging operating environment. Our focus as a brand across our corporate and franchise stores remained squarely on serving our customers and our communities with a convenient, affordable and safe, food and service experience. We continue to put our people first, making investments in our teams across our corporate stores, our supply chain centers, and our support resources. Around the country, we were also pleased to see our franchisees stepping up to support their teams. The third quarter marked our 38th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth. And 17.5% is the strongest same store sales number we've posted in our U.S. business, over the course of that almost decade long run. We achieved this remarkable level of growth without running any aggressive promotions during the quarter. During Q3 of last year, we ran two 50% off-boost week promotions. Now while we expect these boost weeks will continue to be an important part of our customer acquisition strategy in the future, the underlying demand and our strong everyday value messages allowed us to focus on store level profitability and on service during the quarter. Now we still have work to do on service levels, but I am very pleased with our execution in absorbing the unprecedented volume in both our stores and our supply chain centers. During the quarter, we launched some terrific new products. Our new chicken wings with improved sauces launched on July 7, and we launched two new specialty pizzas, our Cheeseburger pizza and our Chicken Taco pizza on August 24. Customer feedback thus far has been very positive on these new products. And I have to tell you, as one of our most frequent customers, my new personal favorite pizza is our chicken taco pizza with jalapenos added to it. We continue to roll out technology to enable contact with service methods and to improve the operations of our stores. Our Domino's Carside Delivery has been overwhelmingly embraced by our franchisees, and is available today and over 95% of our U.S. stores, providing a convenient contactless carryout experience across the U.S. We are working to continue to drive customer awareness of contactless delivery. Our GPS technology is now in place in approximately 90% of our U.S. stores, giving customers a better experience and allowing our operators to better optimize the routing and dispatching of our deliveries. Our enhanced make line tools are rolling out across the country, and are now present in nearly 80% of our U.S. stores, allowing us to get pizzas in the oven faster, and improving our service levels. These are just a few of the many innovations, our team is driving to improve the customer and the team member experience. Now we've talked a lot about the opportunity to create frequency and loyalty with customers that have discovered or reengaged with the Domino's brand during this time. We believe value, convenience, quality and our new product news are bringing customers to us, and hope it will continue to bring them back. Digital and loyalty adoption give us a good proven opportunity to drive additional customer frequency. And we continue to see strong growth and performance in both areas during the third quarter. Now we have to continue to focus on service as our category remains fragmented and customers often switch brands. Executing the blocking and tackling of service is as critical for us as anything else. Unit growth remains a challenge, given the many obstacles that the pandemic has placed on construction and permitting across the country. But given those circumstances, I'm very pleased with the efforts of our franchisees and our corporate teams. Collectively, we still managed to open 44 net new stores in the U.S., consisting of 47 openings and only three closures during the quarter. This is a terrific result when you consider what is happening across the category and more broadly across the U.S. restaurant industry. Our development team and our franchisees continue to work closely on data driven assessments around fortressing, which continues to prove out strong results and tied to carryout, to delivery service, delivery costs, runs per hour for drivers, and most importantly, a great economic return for our franchisees who are making an investment in the brand. Now while obstacles presented by the pandemic will create uncertainty in the short-term for unit growth for the foreseeable future, I remain highly optimistic around our U.S. unit growth potential for the medium and the long-term. So to close out our discussion on the U.S. business, while we don't have all the answers on the future, we're going to continue to execute on our fundamental strengths. And as a work-in-progress brand, we will work diligently on the areas where we can and need to improve. All-in-all I'm proud of our third quarter U.S. performance and very optimistic about our ability to continue driving profitable retail sales growth, for our franchisees and for Domino's over the long-term. Now let's move on to international, where I was pleased to see the momentum build across the business during the quarter. Thanks to the great work of our international master franchisees. We have now achieved 107 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales, ended 6.2% the highest international same-store sales result since the third quarter of 2016. As the pandemic continues to evolve around the world, we continue to see wide variations in performance across the international business. And forward visibility continues to be quite challenged compared to normal. We had a number of markets that continue to generate strong retail in same-store sales growth, including China, Japan and Germany among others. In these markets, our ability to remain open and operating throughout the pandemic has allowed us to benefit from the delivery tailwind in these markets. In several other markets, we are still fighting our way back from significant temporary unit closures and service restrictions to regain our sales momentum. India and Spain are two large markets where our master franchisees and operators have worked diligently to reopen stores and continue to build order counts during the quarter. In markets where we have been disproportionately impacted, we've stepped in to support our master franchisees and true Alliance for the long-term success of the brand. Now turning our attention to stores. Coming off a peak of approximately 2,400 temporary closures in late March, we have reopened the vast majority of those stores and now have fewer than 300 that are still temporarily closed. We’ve regained some momentum in new store openings during the quarter with 162 gross store openings. However, those were offset with a higher than unusual, not higher than usual number of closures, resulting in 39 net new stores. Those closures were concentrated in India, where our master franchisee took the necessary steps to close some underperforming units that were also negatively impacted by the pandemic. In the near-term, our retail sales growth will continue to be pressured by the slower pace of store growth that we've seen thus far and anticipate for the foreseeable future. Visibility will continue to be difficult and the unit growth environment could remain choppy. While I am highly optimistic regarding the growth potential for our brand, given these delays and the choppiness in international store openings that we've seen as the pandemic has continued to persist over the past months, we are currently reassessing whether we will be able to achieve the timing of our previously articulated goal of having at least 25,000 stores open by 2025. Now, I want to be very clear, I see this as a timing as opposed to a capacity matter, and I have a great deal of confidence in our international business and in our master franchisees. They are eager to ramp the pace of store growth back up to our pre pandemic pace, as we continue to pursue our long-term goals. All things considered, I'm very pleased with the resiliency and performance of our international business, and I applaud our best-in-class master franchisees. It is their incredible commitment to invest in the brand that has allowed us to serve our customers, and our communities across the globe at a high level, even in the face of so many challenges. The global fundamentals around delivery adoption and market share upside, coupled with our strong value positioning, service delivery and unit economics all position us well for long-term growth and success in our international business. And to sum it up, the third quarter was a true testament to the unquestioned strength of our international business model, and I remain very optimistic about the future of this business. Stepping back to look across the global Domino's enterprise. The global backdrop around food delivery, digital ordering and the pizza category specifically continues to be favorable. Now, we don't know how long the pandemic will continue, and we don't know how long we'll continue to feel the related demand tailwinds and operational challenges. However, make no mistake, we will continue to build on our strengths and we will continue to invest to position ourselves to win in the long game. We'll be leading with our values, delivering high-quality menu offerings to our customers, delivering a strong, consistent and reliable value proposition, driving sustainable order and transaction growth, investing in technology to support the consumer and our store operators, relentless focus on unit economics and franchisee help, and continuing to fortress our market positions in the U.S. and around the world. These are the areas, regardless of the external, economic and competitive landscape, where I believe we will continue to differentiate ourselves from the competition and drive shareholder value over the long-term. In closing, our global franchisees and operators continue to rise to the challenge every day, and it continues to motivate me and my team. I am proud to serve them each and every day. And with that, we'll be happy to open up the line and take your questions.
Brian Bittner: Good morning, Ritch, and good morning, Stu. Congratulations on your new role as CFO. Your domestic comps, they continue to be very impressive. But I want to focus my question on the profit flow through constraints this quarter that caused EBITDA growth to trend below revenue growth. We haven't seen that in many, many quarters, the financial model. Can you talk a little bit more about the nature of these COVID expenses? How much is potential structural changes to cost versus transitory? And separately on the G&A outlook, Stu gave for fourth quarter. It looks to be stepping up in a material way about $20 million year-over-year on the G&A line. Can you also just flush out the inflection in that expense in the fourth quarter? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Hey, Brian. Good morning. I'll start with your question around the U.S. store side and the flow through. As Stu outlined in his discussion earlier, we did see some significant costs in the quarter related to operating in the pandemic. And that relates to frontline, hourly compensation, team member, enhanced sick pay benefits, protective equipment, cleaning supplies, et cetera, that are just a reality of operating in a pandemic environment. The position that we've taken there is that we are going to focus on serving our customers, taking care of this demand that's been presented to us in the face of COVID, and also very much on supporting our team members and taking care of our team members in the store. If we do those two things, then we believe that we position ourselves for the long-term to continue to accelerate growth in the business on the back of this unprecedented short-term boost in demand. As long as we're operating in a pandemic environment, I do expect to see at elevated level of operating costs in the stores. But we don't see structural changes in the business over the long-term. It's simply the reality of operating in a pandemic environment. And the second part of your question around G&A, I'll let Stu comment on that.
Stu Levy: Yes. And actually, before I do that, let me add just a little bit more color on the margin. And this is detailed a little bit more in the Q. But, relative to Q2, the food basket for us was up significantly in Q3. And that's been an effect that we've seen, just volatility in the commodity markets during the pandemic. So, in Q2, the basket decreased year-over-year 1.2%. Q3, it was up 3.8%. And if you break that down a little bit, cheese, which is obviously a huge input for us, was at an all-time low in Q2, and it's been at all-time highs in Q3. And we've seen similar volatility across a lot of other commodities. So that obviously puts a headwind on the business both in terms of store operations and our supply chain business. On the G&A side, the largest driver there is higher variable performance-based compensation, but the other driving force here is a 53rd week, which obviously drives increased G&A year-over-year, so that it's something we get once every handful of years, but we happen to have it this year in the middle of a pandemic. So it adds a little bit of additional complexity there.
Brian Bittner: Thank you, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Eric Gonzalez: Hey, just a quick question on the international store closures. I think, given the number of closures in the segment to-date, should we expect to see an elevated number of closures in the next few quarters? Do you think those master franchisees in those volatile markets like India have already made the necessary adjustments?
Ritch Allison: Yes, great question. And, yes, we've been very pleased to see the resiliency in that international business. And as you know, we had about 2,400 temporary closures back about six months ago. And as the teams have worked very hard to get those stores reopened, they've also taken a look and assessed, are there stores in the portfolio that are structurally challenged in the near-term and the long-term. And I applaud the team in India for taking the necessary steps to go ahead and take some of those closures and we were supportive of that. As I look broadly across the business, we still have a great deal of optimism around the medium and long-term growth potential in international. But as we look out across the near-term, I do expect to see some continued choppiness, as it relates to getting stores open due to construction and permitting delays. And then also we expect to see a few more closures as the markets reassess their portfolios, and make sure that we're focusing resources going forward on the stores that are going to drive growth.
Eric Gonzalez: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Gregory Francfort: Hey, thanks for the question. I had a question for Stu. I see and I think most companies in the space have kind of paused the share buyback. And I guess you guys, I don't think bought back any stock in the quarter. What are you looking for, I guess, to consider restarting that program? Is it just conservatism for maybe why you haven't started back up so far? Just thanks for the thoughts.
Stu Levy: Sure, no problem. I appreciate the question. Yes, for us, we're always going to look at what the right way to deploy our cash is, whether -- and how to return that to our shareholders where it's appropriate. I think earlier in COVID with the uncertainty, as a lot of companies did, we wanted to preserve cash and figure out until we kind of had a better understanding of how things looked like they were going to play out. And obviously, now we've got better visibility and we'll continue to evaluate the best ways to deploy that cash to the business or how to return that to our shareholders.
Gregory Francfort: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Sara Senatore: Thank you. I was just trying to understand a little bit more on the margin question. Obviously, investments in people are absolutely the right thing to do. And they are on the frontlines, and I think you said you didn't see this as a structural change. But just from like a practical standpoint or modeling, how do we think about the ability to reverse any of these -- when the pandemic recedes. Just having some kind of maybe color on whether these are increases in wage rates, which I assume would be really hard to turn back or just kind of the order of magnitude of the different factors that are contributing to that, just as they really just from a practical or mathematical perspective from next year. Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure. Hi, Sara, thanks for the question. As Stu outlined in his remarks, we had during the quarter about $11 million in costs that were associated with this COVID-related operating environment. And as you think about how to look at that going forward, as long as we're operating in a pandemic environment, we're going to continue to see some elevated costs around safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay. And then also during the pandemic, we've continued to make sure that we are taking care of our frontline team members with some enhanced compensation as well. And so as long as we're operating in a pandemic environment, we expect to see that also. Now, over the long-term, certainly we will continue to take a look at the overall value proposition for our frontline team members, and that certainly evolved over time, some of it driven by minimum wage increases across the country and changes such as that. But also with us taking a look at the value proposition that we offer our team members and making sure that we are employer of choice going forward. So, you'll certainly see post pandemic, some of these costs pare back. And then what we'll do as a management team is we'll focus then from there on continuing to make sure that this is a great place to work for our team members, and that our team members are appropriately rewarded for their efforts.
Sara Senatore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Please go ahead.
Chris O'Cull: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys, and congratulations Stu. Ritch, would you talk about the performance of markets in the U.S. that have largely lifted restrictions? And in particular how order size and transaction performance has been impacted once restrictions are lifted?
Ritch Allison: Yes, sure. Chris, it's interesting, and if I look across, if I look across the U.S. business, and where we've had kind of differential levels of performance, it's interesting. As you know, our brand tends to be less urban focused than a lot of other brands. We've got higher concentrations of our stores, and rural and second city type of markets. And certainly, those markets have performed better than the urban and suburban markets have over time. So, we saw throughout the third quarter. We saw that in the second quarter as well. That dynamic continued to persist. And then some of the other dynamics that we've talked about in the past also continue. We continue to see a higher ticket, in both our delivery and our carryout businesses. And I'm really pleased that that higher ticket was not coming from price increases. Price increases around food and delivery charges have been really moderate and in line with inflation, over the course of the third quarter. But really, what we've seen is that continued increase and we've continued to see that increase in basket size. And then the other dynamic around the ticket, overall is just a higher mix of delivery orders relative to carryout orders in the business. And delivery just by its very nature comes with a higher ticket, and with that delivery, albeit modest that delivery charge still added to the ticket. So that's a little bit about the dynamics and what we've seen across the course of the quarter.
Chris O'Cull: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Lauren Silberman: Thanks for the question, and Stu, congrats on the new rule. How do you expect the recent return of the NFL in college football will impact trends given ongoing restrictions at bars and restaurants across the country? And then are you willing to provide the cadence of comp trend throughout the quarter? And to the extent you're willing any color and quarter-to-date trends given football rally started first quarter end?
Ritch Allison: Yes. So, hi, Lauren. We won't comment on any quarter-to-date trends this morning. But most certainly we are glad to see televised sports back. It certainly creates occasions for people to gather and when people have occasions together, they love ordering Domino's Pizza. And so, I'm certainly happy to see that coming back. And as you know, for us, it's less about, fans being able to sit in the seats than it is about, the sports being on TV and folks being able to gather and watch it. So, without the ability really, at this point to parse out, any results based on that I can tell you that we certainly view it as favorable relative to not having those sports on television for us.
Lauren Silberman: Great. And are you willing to provide the cadence to comp trend throughout the quarter?
Ritch Allison: I'm sorry, Lauren, I could not hear your question.
Lauren Silberman: Sorry. The cadence of comp trend throughout the quarter?
Ritch Allison: No. But what I can tell you is, we had strong growth throughout the quarter, but I won't comment on period by period specifics.
Lauren Silberman: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Peter Saleh: Thanks. And Stu, congrats on your first conference call. I want to ask about loyalty and loyalty memberships. I know earlier in the year, we were discussing that you guys had about 85 million unique users in your database, but about 23 million or so loyalty members. Can you talk about the cadence maybe of signing up more or retaining more loyalty members throughout the year? Has that accelerated through the pandemic? And what exactly are you guys seeing from the loyalty guests in terms of their behavior in terms of spending recently?
Ritch Allison: Hey, Pete. Thanks for the question. We certainly saw -- as the pandemic hit, we saw a pickup in loyalty enrollments at the beginning of the pandemic. And that leveled off some during the third quarter. But interestingly also we saw fewer folks who were exiting or becoming inactive in the loyalty program over time. So the overall number of customers in our piece of the pie rewards program continued to increase. And then as we took a look at what was happening with our heavy and medium and light users, we were also pleased to see over the course of the quarter, that customers in each of those buckets were ordering from us more often. And the ticket was higher also in each of those buckets. And that occurred in the third quarter, despite the fact that we didn't run any boost weeks in the third quarter of 2020. And that compares to running two of them of our 50% off promotions back in the third quarter of 2019.
Peter Saleh: All right, thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
John Glass: Good morning. Thanks for the question, and congratulations, Stu. Ritch, you talked a couple of times about service and service opportunities and obviously challenges in the business. I wasn't sure if it was a comment about you saw some service slipping for some reason, or this is just a work-in-progress company. But can you just talk about, has there been unique challenges that have created service delays for example, in the business? And can you maybe make that into how you think the performance of some of the new products are doing? Does that create greater complexity? Or maybe how do you grade yourself? Or how do you think the new wings, the new pizza launch have contributed to sales today?
Ritch Allison: Sure, John. First, on the service piece, most definitely at the beginning of the pandemic, when volumes in our business jumped up significantly, we definitely slipped a little bit on our estimated average delivery times. We have since, thanks to the great work of our franchisees and operators over the second and third quarter. We've improved our service and gotten back to where we are as good or better than we were pre-pandemic, which is pretty significant when you think about the overall increase in the business that we've seen, and the fact that we deliver our own food. So we're making sure that we've got trained and uniformed delivery experts bringing that product to the customer. I suspect that, as long as I'm the CEO of this company, you will always hear me talk about wanting to improve service at Domino's, because, until we're getting to a place where we're delivering pizzas and not 30 minutes, not 25 minutes, but 20 minutes or less, I'll never be satisfied with where we are on service. So, we're always going to be a work-in-progress there. Second part of your question around new products. I'm very pleased with the new products we've launched. Our wings, and our two new specialty pieces have been very well received by our customers. You haven't seen us promote wings, because we're selling all the wings that we can get our hands on today. So very, very positive performance on the wings business. And then, we've launched specialty pizzas obviously just within the last couple of weeks of the third quarter. But, those specialty pizzas are already at the top end in terms of mix of our specialty pizza range. So very pleased with where we are today, and also really pleased -- and I think you asked a great question. These do not add operational complexity within our stores. In fact, the wings actually reduced operational complexity in the store, given how we package it. And each of the two specialty pizzas required only one incremental ingredient that we didn't have on the make line already.
John Glass: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird. Please go ahead.
David Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Ritch, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your comments about the 25,000 unit target you laid out a few years ago. And in particular, I understand the issues with delays in terms of international market openings, but you also mentioned potential for some closing. So, I wonder if you could talk about how much of your, I guess, pulled back on the target might be related to the closings you expect to see, and whether you're willing to frame up the magnitude of those closings?
Ritch Allison: Sure, David. It really does relate to the pace of openings, much, much more so than concern about closures going forward. Now, hitting the closures first, we've certainly seen a higher number of closures in 2020 relative to normal in our international business, but I expect that we will work through those over the short-term. So the real issue around the pace to getting to 25,000 is just the pace of the gross openings, which slowed during 2020 given some of the similar construction and permitting challenges that we've seen in markets all over the world. But also for those countries that had temporary closures, the effort has really been directed in the short-term on getting those stores reopened, and ramping them back up to their full run rate. So, I'm optimistic over the medium to long-term, that we'll get back to the very strong pace of unit growth that we had in the international business. It's just that the step back that we've had to take in 2020, does cause us to take a look and reassess the timing of that 25,000 milestone. Not the milestone but just the timing of reaching it.
David Tarantino: It makes sense. And I guess one follow-up, I guess a lot of companies have talked about potentially accelerating the pace of opening, given the opportunities they see on the other side of the pandemic. So I guess your comments might imply that that might not be possible or might not be desirable in the international markets, in a sense to catch up for the lost ground in 2020?
Ritch Allison: No, I wouldn't take it that way, David. And if I break it down a little bit, first of all, starting on the U.S. side of the business, I see a heck of a lot of opportunity to accelerate our unit growth on the U.S. side of the business, where while we've been in a difficult operating environment, if you look at our trailing four quarter net unit openings in the U.S., it's still very strong and consistent with where we were a year ago. The international business, when you take a look at that, you really have to break it down, because if you talk about it, just in total, you lose some of the nuances evident. And we have multiple markets in international that in fact have maintained pace and are accelerating on unit growth is just when you take into account some of those countries that had to take a step back with respect to temporary closures, I just expect it to take a bit more time to ramp back up in those markets. But all around the world, our teams are taking a look at the real estate opportunities that are presented to us by the fact that there are quite a few other restaurant and retail businesses that are closing out. They're certainly at a much higher rate than we see inside our own business.
David Tarantino: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead.
Dennis Geiger: Great, thank you. Ritch, you gave some really good color on the loyalty program. But just wondering if you could talk a bit more about new customer acquisition in recent months, kind of how that's trended since 2Q? And how you're thinking about the stickiness of those new customers as we look ahead? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure, Dennis. Well, we've had -- if you look, if you break our business down, and I talk about it a lot in terms of the two businesses that we run inside each of our boxes, which is one is a delivery business, and the other is a carryout business. If we take a look at our delivery business, what we've seen is a nice tailwind in customer acquisition, but also, just as important and in a lot of cases more so, our retention of customers and order frequency has also increased as well in the delivery business. And then if we look at the carryout business, the story is a little bit different. We've not seen the tailwind on customer acquisition in carryout, and that's not surprising, as customers stayed in their homes much more often during the pandemic, but what we've seen is increase in retention and in the frequency of orders of on the carryout side for our customers. Now, one of the reasons that we have rolled out our Domino's Carside Delivery, frankly, a lot earlier than we had originally planned to was so that we could get out there and you've seen us on TV talking to customers about a very safe and convenient way to come and get carryout at Domino's. And the early results that we've seen in Carside Delivery in the third quarter have been very positive in terms of the customer receptivity to that service method.
Dennis Geiger: Thanks, Ritch.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Chris Carril: Thanks. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Can you provide any further detail around how the value platforms performed over the course of the quarter? And did you see any change in utilization of the $5.99 and $7.99 platforms?
Ritch Allison: Hey, thanks, Chris. The $5.99 platform continued in the quarter to be an incredibly important statement of value and driver of the business. And in fact, it was more important in Q3 than probably any time, because we didn't run any boost week promotions during the third quarter. So very important in terms of customer acquisition. And we're always kind of taking a look at and thinking about how can we enhance that value platform. And as you've seen with the launch of our two new specialty pizzas, we took a look at how those could integrate into that value platform. And the customer research that we did, gave us a high level of confidence that we could offer those pizzas at a $3 upsell to the $5.99, which gives great value to the customer and also really a nice margin opportunity for our stores as well. Those pizzas -- and you'll also see them on our -- if you go on our homepage at $11.99 for a large, which again our research tells us is a great value for those high-quality specialty pizzas, and also gives our operators a terrific opportunity for a very profitable offering. And then if I shift gears on the carryout value proposition, the $7.99, you saw us bring our wings to that platform at $7.99 for carryout as well, which you can now get wings along with all of our crust types, three topping pizza across all of our crust types in that $5.99 platform. When I think about what's happening with the consumer right now, and looking forward with this recession that we are sitting in today, and the fact that there has been no incremental stimulus brought to the consumer, I look forward and believe that our value platforms and sticking to those platforms will only be more important, as we look out into the months and quarters ahead.
Chris Carril: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Levy with MKM Partner. Please go ahead.
Brett Levy: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the call. And Stu, best of luck in the new role. You started to discuss a breakdown of where you are in some of your customer facing investments. Would you care to give any quantification in terms of how they're doing in terms of either efficiency, savings or driving sales? And also, how should we think about what's next in terms of new initiatives that you're investing in? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure, Brett. We are very pleased with the rollout and adoption of these technology platforms. And actually it's an interesting kind of pivot for us, and how we're thinking about innovation at Domino's. So, much of the innovation -- if you think back to 2010 and forward when we were driving rapid increases and digital adoption in our business, much of the innovation was around the ordering platforms and what we put in the hands of customers. We're still doing that, but we've also significantly ramped up our efforts around technology innovation to support the operations of our stores. And that's where you get to GPS, you get to our enhanced make line tools, you get to our Carside Delivery. Certainly they have customer benefits, but they've got frankly benefits to our operators that I'm even more excited about than the customer facing aspects there. And as we think about that innovation pipeline going forward, a good bit of what we're going to be focused on is innovation that does make our stores at the incredible volumes, that we're managing today that makes our stores easier to run for our operators and our store managers. They're resulting in a better quality of life for them, but also ultimately a better service experience for our customers.
Operator: All right. Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. Just a follow-up and a question, the follow-up is quick. You mentioned that delivery fees, I think basically increased in line with inflation. That surprises me a little bit considering, some of the delivery and service fees specifically being taken by third party. Do you think that's an opportunity, as we go forward to kind of think about your delivery and service charge being put together, maybe having a little bit more of a sliding scale going forward versus the fixed cost it is now? So that's the follow-up. And the question, could you talk about the competitive intensity if there's a way for you to measure it in terms of the customer acquisition by third party, whether in the U.S. or any particularly important international markets, whether you think that intensity is getting more intense or perhaps even easing?
Ritch Allison: Great. Hi, John. Yes, on the delivery fees, we look at this as a competitive advantage for us going forward. When we think about the relatively low and transparent delivery fee that we charge our customers versus what you're seeing with the aggregators, this really is a key part of our value proposition for our customers. And all of us have ordered third party delivery and most of the time is really hard to figure out what you're being charged, because you might be getting a free delivery. But then you go in and you see a line that says, taxes and fees. And then if you're industrious enough to click on the little question mark, you figure out that it's not just taxes to the government, but you're also being charged a service fee. And for those of us that have been in the delivery business forever, we don't know what the service fee is if it's not paying for having the delivery brought to you. So, I think it's an area that we've got to continue to be out there and educating our customers around the fact that, this is that we're a transparent brand. And if we tell you the delivery is $3.49, we're not going to be lump in on any additional fees there. Certainly our delivery fees do vary market by market based on labor rates. We operate in places, where we've got $7.25 an hour labor in places where we have $15 plus. So we do adjust those fees, our franchisees adjust those fees up and down. But transparency is going to continue to be a big part of how we present ourselves to our customers. The second part of your question around the competitive intensity, I would say, John, it's every bidders intense as it was in the second quarter and as it was in the first quarter, in particular with the third party aggregators continue to be very aggressive in the offers that they have out in the marketplace and in their advertising. And when we take a look at our competitive set in pizza delivery, it's a different game than the game that we were playing five years ago. The number one competitor we look at is not any of the pure play pizza players, but it really is competing against delivery from the third party aggregators.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. And congrats Stu, on your new role. The question on the outlook. I mean, we hear a lot that peers of yours that maybe operate their own restaurants are talking about doing more with less on the heels of, I guess, efficiency learnings through the pandemic and maybe achieving pre-COVID EBITDA dollars at sales levels well below the prior 100%. So I think about your business, you're running a franchise model, obviously, but is there an opportunity there? I mean, and your sales being well above prior sales levels, I'm just wondering, what are the greatest drivers to further enhance your profitability? Obviously, after the unique COVID cost ease kind of any efficiency opportunities that you see to be more efficient in terms of learnings through COVID? Or if maybe that's just not realistic when you run the franchise business versus the flow through of a company operated model? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Jeff, thanks for the question. Most certainly, we're very focused on driving dollar profitability at the store level. We talk about that all the time and we've been fairly transparent about it over time as well. So in our corporate store business and then also as we work with our franchisees, we're absolutely looking at ways that we can more efficiently operate our businesses, coming out of COVID. Some of the store technology tools that I talked about earlier, are a part of that. I'll take GPS for example. By utilizing the GPS technology inside our stores, our store managers know exactly where the drivers are at any given time. And that allows us to get more efficient in how we do our routing, how we pre-bag and get the orders ready to go once the delivery driver returns. And also in cases of our best run stores today, our drivers aren't even coming at the rush back into the stores, our operators, because they know that drivers are coming back or running those pizzas out to the cars, handing them into the drivers and saving a minute, maybe two minutes on the turn, which ultimately results in better service and better labor that you run in the stores. We're also working on some advanced forecasting and labor scheduling tools in our corporate stores, where the early results of our pilots and test there have been very positive, to help us to get better on service while reducing the labor costs associated with that service. All of that gets thrown into a little bit of disarray as we talked about earlier in a pandemic, when you've got all of these additional costs that are layered on to the business, but as we look forward coming out of COVID, our expectation is that we will continue to drive efficiency and therefore, higher levels of EBITDA and operating cash flow in the stores.
Stu Levy: And just to add to that though, the one thing we won't do is reduce the quality of what we're providing as a way to cut costs. You mentioned, thinking about the menu, as we launched new wings, that was to improve the quality of the product that we were providing, not because we thought we could take a little money out of the cost of the ingredients.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jon Tower: Awesome, great. Thanks for making the time. Just real quick, a clarification. Ritch, I think earlier in the conversation, in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned the idea that the company stepped in to support master franchisees and international markets. So I was hoping, one, you could expand upon that. And then two, can you discuss in the U.S. side of the business, how perhaps the delivery versus the carryout mix might have impacted store level labor during the quarter, particularly relative to the second quarter, or even last year? And perhaps maybe the curb side business stepping up the cost of labor in the stores during the period? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Thanks, Jon. So, first on support with our international master franchisees. We've had several of our international markets that were disproportionately hit by COVID, and had to have either a whole or a substantially partial shutdown. And in those cases, we have a very long-term view on the partnership that we have with these international master franchisees. And so, there have been some instances where we have leaned in with royalty and fee relief, for some of our international franchisees, because it's just the right thing to do in the short-term for our partners that are around with us for decades, over the long-term. Second part of your question, delivery and carryout mix. Certainly, we've seen in terms of order mix, delivery in the third quarter was certainly a higher percentage by a couple percentage points of our order mix versus what we were running pre-pandemic. And certainly, delivery orders bring with them on a per order basis, higher dollar labor costs, but those are also associated with higher ticket as well and also the delivery fee that comes along with it. And then finally to your question on curb side. The terrific thing about our Carside Delivery is, we've been able to handle that business really without any significant increase in labor costs, at the store level. Ultimately, somebody when a customer walks into the store is going back to the rack and grabbing that pizza and greeting the customer and handing it to him. Well, with this technology, we know when the customer pulls into the parking lot, a team member can get out and back into the store very quickly and we're not using incremental labor to do that.
Jon Tower: Great, thanks. And then just one quick one. Can you quantify the amount of royalty or fee relief you've provided for these franchisees in the international markets during the period?
Ritch Allison: No.
Jon Tower: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Brooks with CL King and Associates. Please go ahead.
Todd Brooks: Hey, thanks for the question. Ritch, I was wondering now that we're about eight months into this pandemic window, what are your thoughts on the U.S. businesses, as you look out to '21 and beyond about just in general survivor bias in the pizza industry, as far as over half the units out there being independently owned and operated? And thoughts on market share opportunities due to competitive closures but also real estate opportunities? And how that supports maybe an enhanced unit growth rate in the medium-term in the U.S. market? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure. We certainly look at 2021 and forward as an opportunity to continue to gain share in the pizza category. And I'll preface it by saying, none of us want to see independent pizza restaurants close due to the pandemic. We'd love to compete and fight it out every day, but we also love to go out and eat at independent restaurants as well. And I feel for the challenges that a lot of these independent restaurants are going through and their proprietors that have put their livelihoods into those businesses. But the reality is, if you were operating an independent pizza restaurant with a significant amount of your business dine in, and if you were relying on beverage mix and alcohol to bring a good bit of margin to your business. If that business has now been shifted to where you have to do most of it off-prem and if most of that has to come by paying very high fees to third party aggregators, it's just a really difficult operating environment. And I know all of you see a lot of the same industry analysts and prognosticators who predict the percentage of independent restaurants that may not reopen or may close permanently. We don't know where that ultimately lands, but I do believe that the shakeout and the turmoil is going to create opportunity for us to further take share and continue to grow. Our teams, both our corporate store team, and our franchisees are out there every day, looking for real estate opportunities that are opening up as a result of the pandemic, and also, in some cases, opportunities where we've shifted in some cities and towns from a more sort of landlord-friendly rental environment for it to more of a renter-friendly rental environment, an opportunity for us to get potentially some more favorable terms on leases going forward as well for some of the stores that we continue to operate.
Stu Levy: The other thing that I would add is, our development team is working pretty rigorously with our franchisees going through a ton of analysis and pretty detailed modeling and determining where we actually want to be opening those stores. And that's got to be -- for the long-term value of the business that has to be the priority. And if where we want to be there are real estate opportunities that gets evaluated the same way we would look at, do we build something freestanding. Do we take existing real estate? Do we take advantage of a business that may have been less fortunate, et cetera? But it starts with where we want to be, and then shifts to what are the real estate opportunities there.
Todd Brooks: Great. Thank you, both.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Congrats Stu and Ritch. I'd echo the jalapeno hack on that chicken taco pizza. It's very good. Stu, can you help rectify the 12.6% supply chain growth with domestic system sales growth of about 21%. There's about a $6 million gap there and was curious if there's efficiencies or inefficiencies or additional costs we should be thinking about, potentially with the two distribution center openings in the back-half of 2020? Maybe it's a mix issue just given, obviously more wings being sold to that as well. And then I know you said no two-part question, so I'm going to phrase this as an extension of my question. On the longer-term, what is your broad observation having run supply chain? And where you think you could see margin percentage for the supply chain segments settle out longer-term?
Stu Levy: Yes, thanks for the questions. I like the extension part that you did there that was effective. The pressure in supply chain, and first of all, let me just comment, you mentioned the center openings. So we obviously opened the new center in Q2. We have a new center that we intend to open in Texas in Q4. We also added capacity to our thin crust production in Q3. And that for us is an investment we're more than happy to make, because that means we're continuing to grow and we need that capacity. On the margin side, it's an interesting dynamic, because what we're trying to do is provide the best value for our franchisees. If they can grow profitably, we as a company are going to benefit from that. So we're not trying to take advantage. Generally speaking, when we drive operating efficiencies or other improvements in the business, we're trying to share that with our franchisees so that they aren't negatively impacted. During the course of COVID we saw a couple of things, one of which was the high increase in commodities. And what we were attempting to do with our franchisees again with sharing a little bit of that pain. So we were passing through commodity increase, but not taking additional margin on it. So as the food basket goes up, the margin percentage comes down. So we're generating more margin dollars, but at a lower percentage so that savings can be passed along to the franchisee base. So that was one piece of it. The second thing that we did was all of the additional supplies that were related to COVID, we were basically passing through to our franchisees at cost. We didn't feel we should be layering on additional costs for them, again, trying to make sure we can drive profitability to the stores, and then in turn, that helps the system overall. So, are there other efficiency opportunities? Yes, it's impossible to run a supply chain the size of ours and not always have other opportunities for efficiency. And that's what our team works at every single day is how do we get more efficient, remain safe, be more efficient and more effective in delivering for our franchisees.
Andrew Charles: Thanks, Stu.
Stu Levy: Sure.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from James Rutherford with Stephens. Please go ahead.
James Rutherford: Hey, yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I just was curious directionally how you think about the demand picture for Domino's? And how that will evolve as the country reopens? Now, there was a question about this earlier, but when you have a few states that have completely removed restrictions on dine in capacity, and more will likely to follow. A vaccine, of course, is in the work. So just what have you observed about consumer behavior as certain markets have lifted restrictions? And what directionally does that tell you about the normalized steady state AUVs for dominoes post-pandemic? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Sure, James. It's still really early on in terms of cities and states reopening. And given the purchased frequency and cycle in our business, it's still early for us to draw any observations from cities that may have flipped from 25% capacity to 50% capacity over the course of the last month or two. So what I'll do is I'll step back a little bit, just kind of give a perspective a little bit more broadly. And, I think some things that have happened here during the pandemic have really been the acceleration of some trends that were in place already. So when we think about how customers want to order food. There was a trend toward digital ordering pre-pandemic, and that significantly accelerated during the pandemic. I don't expect customers to go back to calling on the phone, I expect digital ordering to continue to grow post-pandemic. And I feel that we are very well-positioned in that space today with 75% of our sales in the U.S. digital as we sit here today. I also think that the trend around off-premise consumption, which was their pre-pandemic has accelerated during the pandemic. And I don't think we're going to see an immediate snap back. Certainly people are going to go or some people are going to want to go and sit down in a restaurant again. And I'm one of those people for sure. But I think we're going to continue to see a movement in the QSR space toward off-prem consumption. And I think our business with the strength and delivery and in carryout, I believe also positions us very well for that trend to continue going forward. So what we're trying to stay focused on here is, taking the opportunity that we've been given through customer acquisition during COVID, and to convert those customers into long-term loyal customers of Domino's Pizza. So far, the early results in that have been very positive. As I mentioned earlier, our retention is up, our frequency is up across medium, heavy and even light users. And really, the challenge for me and my team ahead and for our franchisees and operators is, we've got to continue to do a great job serving those customers and we believe they'll continue to come back to us going forward. And honestly, given the share that we have in the restaurant industry today, even as the number one player, we've got so much room for upside and share growth within a growing category that I'm far less concerned about the reopening of sit down restaurants than I am about us doing a great job on execution every day.
James Rutherford: Excellent. Thank you for the thoughts.
Operator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Jared Garber with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Jared Garber: Good morning. Thanks. Thanks for all the color on the call today. Really great commentary. Most of our questions have been asked and answered, but just wanted to get a little bit more color on China maybe. Obviously, we heard the news last quarter of the strategic investment there and maybe any color on how the business is trending or how you're seeing the opportunity to shape up there, especially versus some of the commentary today on the timing of the 25,000 units by 2025? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Thanks, Jared. China really has been a terrific success story in 2020, while we've had some slowdown in some of our markets around the world, China is definitely not one of them. Sales growth and unit growth have been very strong in China this year. We've got a terrific management team over there in place with our master franchisee, Dash. And we've got a lot of optimism around the future growth of our business in China. China also back at the beginning of the year when the pandemic obviously hit China first, China really was -- our leaders over there really were the architects of a lot of the contactless service methods that we're using in the U.S. and around the world. So not only have they delivered great results, but they've also stepped up to be thought leaders in our business. And, as I look forward on China, I expect that there will be a point in the future where China will be the second largest Domino's Pizza business in the world behind the U.S.
Jared Garber: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Ritch Allison for his closing remarks.
Ritch Allison: Thank you. And thanks to everybody, for joining us on the call this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on November 12th, when we host our virtual investor Q&A event. So we hope we'll get a chance to talk to all of you in just a month's time. And then, of course, in February, we'll get back together to discuss our fourth quarter and our full year 2020 results. And until then, I hope all of you stay safe and healthy and we'll talk to you again next month.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for participating in today's program. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-16 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 Domino's Pizza's Earning Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Jeff Lawrence, CFO. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Lawrence: Thanks Katherine, and hello, everyone. This is Jeff Lawrence, CFO of Domino's. Thanks for joining the call today about the results of our second quarter of 2020. As you know this call is primarily for our investor audience. So I kindly ask that all members of the media and others be in a listen-only mode throughout the call.  If forward-looking statements are made today, I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement you can find in this morning's release and the 10-Q. We will start with my prepared comments which will be followed by prepared comments from CEO, Ritch Allison, followed by analyst questions. We ask that our analysts limit themselves to one question please during this call. With that I'd like to walk you all through the results for the second quarter, while reminding everyone that we've communicated flat preliminary estimated information for the first eight weeks of the second quarter in a business update that we released on May 26th. As we stated in the last business update, we intend to return to our normally quarterly earnings cadence going forward effective with today's release.  Before I dive into Q2 results, I am sure most of you have now seen the announcement this morning that after more than 20 years with the company and five as the Domino's CFO, I've decided to retire from Domino's. Domino's is about opportunity. And in the past 20 years I've had the chance to learn, grow and lead at one of the best brands and companies in the entire world. From a lead role early in my career in our IPO, to traveling the U.S. and to more than 50 countries around the world helping our global franchisees grow to number one to helping the team shape our digital transformation over the past decade. I could not have asked for more and I'm proud of the results we've achieved together.  Like anything you cannot do it alone. I want to thank our Board of Directors, Ritch and his leadership team and my global finance team. And I'd like to personally thank all the franchisees and frontline team members worldwide, you are the heart of this great brand. And most of all my wife and my family who've gone along with me on this unbelievable and awesome ride. I've achieved every goal I've set out for myself here at Domino's and I am going to take a well-earned break with my family and see what the next adventure is for us. We are very, very excited. I've agreed to stay on until year end and to assist to Ritch and the Board in identifying my successor and know that Domino's will be in great hand and that our best days are yet to come.  I'll remain Domino's number one and biggest fan. Thanks to everybody again. With that let's get into the second quarter. In the second quarter, we continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 37 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparables sales and 106 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. A truly outstanding accomplishment and testament to the strength and resiliency of the Domino's brand globally. We also continue to increase our global store count as we opened 125 gross new stores and 84 net new stores in Q2.  Our diluted EPS in Q2 was $2.99, an increase of 36.5% over the prior year quarter, primarily resulting from strong operational results and a significantly lower effective tax rate.  With that let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q2. Global Retail sales grew 5.9% as compared to the prior year quarter pressured by a stronger dollar. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency Global Retail sales grew by 8.1%. Retail sales were positively impacted by strong U.S. same store sales, but were negatively impacted by temporary store closures in our international markets. Same store sales for the U.S. grew 16.1% lapping a prior-year increase of 3% and same store sales for our international business grew 1.3% rolling over a prior-year increase of 2.4%. Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 16% while our company owned stores were up 16.9%. The U.S. comp of this quarter was driven by both ticket and order growth and was significantly impacted by customer ordering behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, we have continued to attract new customers to our brand, while focusing on safety, convenience and value. We also note that existing customers, many of whom are part of our best-in-class loyalty program continue to order in larger order sizes. Our delivery comp was also positively impacted by higher order counts in addition to larger order sizes. The accelerated levels of demand we saw during the middle of the second quarter remained elevated through the end of the quarter with no discernible drop-off. The International comp was driven by ticket growth during the quarter. We were particularly proud of our international comp for the quarter as it was positive despite the negative impact on the comp in many markets from partial week openings and closings, abbreviated store hours and limited service methods. Other markets in our global portfolio saw dramatic increases in sales much like the U.S. business. We continue to believe we are well positioned to grow our global market share both during and after this pandemic. On the unit count front, we opened 39 net US stores in the second quarter consisting of 40 store openings and only one closure. Our international division added 45 net new stores during Q2 comprised of 85 store openings and 40 closures. We believe the pandemic has had a net negative impact on store openings globally in part due to delays in approval and government restrictions in addition to general construction delays. Importantly, unit economics remain strong in most markets particularly in the US business and we will continue to work with our franchisees to responsibly grow their businesses. Turning to revenues. Total revenues for the second quarter were up 13.4% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher retail sales which drove higher supply chain and US store revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower international franchise revenues resulting from temporary store closures, as well as pressure from the negative impact of changes in FX.  Moving on to operating margin as a percentage of revenues consolidated operating margin for the quarter decreased slightly to 38.8% from 39% in the prior year quarter due primarily to investments made related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by higher revenues from our US franchise business and the positive impact of the sale of our New York stores to franchisees last year. Company owned store margin was down year-over-year and was negatively impacted by higher labor costs, partially offset by lower food and occupancy costs. Supply chain operating margin was up year-over-year and was positively impacted by lower delivery costs. G&A expenses decreased approximately a $1 million as compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower travel expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and $2.4 million pretax loss recorded in the prior year related to the New York store sale. These decreases were partially offset by higher professional fees. We continue to see the benefit of improved discipline and focus in this important area, while continuing to invest in strategic initiatives throughout our business. Interest expense increased approximately $6 million in the quarter driven primarily by a higher weighted average debt balance resulting from 2019 recapitalization and borrowings under our variable funding notes during the quarter. Our reported effective tax rate was 4.7% for the quarter, down 8.2 percentage points from the prior year quarter. The reported effective tax rate in the quarter included an 18.5 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity based compensation. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these tax benefits. When you add it all up, our second quarter net income was up $26.3 million or 28.5% over the prior year quarter. Our second quarter diluted EPS was $2.99 versus $2.19 in the prior year, which was a 36.5% increase. Here's how that $0.80 increase breaks down. Our lower effective tax rate resulting primarily from higher tax benefits on equity based compensation positively impacted us by $0.32. Lower diluted share account resulting primarily from share repurchases in 2019 benefited us by $0.14. Higher net interest expense resulting from higher average debt balances negatively impacted us by $0.11 and most importantly our improved operating results benefited us by $0.45. Let's turn to cash. We continued to generate positive cash from operations through Q2 and as of the end of the second quarter we had more than $306 million in available cash and an additional $102 million of available borrowing capacity under our variable funding notes. Our financial standing is and remains strong. During the second quarter, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $116 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $100 million. We also invested $40 million in Dash Brands Ltd., our master franchisee in China. For accounting purposes this is an equity investment, recorded their cost and will be adjusted in the future for impairments. We have agreed to invest another $40 million in Q1 of 2021 subject to certain performance conditions being met and may alternatively invest this amount in Q1, 2011 at our option if such conditions are not met. During Q2, we returned $30 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.78 per share quarterly dividend and finally we have not repurchased any shares under our authorized share repurchase program since the first week of January. As a reminder, we have $327 million remaining under our Board authorization for future share repurchases. Before wrapping up the financial update, I want to give you current and some estimates we shared with you on the last earnings call. We remain steadfast in our commitment to lead with our values and invest in our team members, our customers and our communities. We had previously estimated that the total Q2 impact from frontline bonuses, safety and cleaning equipment, community giving and enhanced sick pay would be approximately $15 million. The actual Q2 impact for these items came in at $11 million. Separately, we had previously estimated that the total Q2 impact on international royalty revenues from partial store closures would be approximately $5 million. The estimated Q2 impact came in at $7 million. Finally, we continue to estimate that FX for the full 2020 fiscal year could have a $10 million negative impact on royalty revenues.  Going forward, we do not anticipate providing additional forward-looking estimates on the aforementioned items. In closing, we remain in very good shape financially and we will continue to closely monitor all aspects of our business as we operate in these uncertain times. We will continue to focus on doing the right thing for our team members and communities today, while ensuring we not only survive but our best position to thrive coming out of this crisis tomorrow. Thanks again for joining the call today. And now I'll turn it over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thanks Jeff. You've been a trusted teammate for more than two decades. A true Dominoid with pizza sauce in your veins. Over the course of your career you have been a key contributor to the success of our global brand, working across all aspects of the business. As our CFO, you have an outstanding track record of creating strategic value for our great system. Your accomplishments speak for themselves. And I want to thank you on behalf of the entire Domino's global community. We wish you all the best. I also want to personally thank you for staying on through the end of the year as we identify a worthy successor and also for agreeing to serve as an advisor to me personally through the end of the year. All right. Let's now talk a bit about the business. The COVID-19 pandemic set the background for the second quarter, creating challenges that were certainly unlike anything we've ever seen as a brand and unlike anything I've ever seen as a leader or frankly would hope to see again. We operate in over 90 markets and across six continents none of which were spared by this virus. And our hearts go out to those around the world that were directly impacted. Throughout the quarter, our focus as a global brand and the focus of our local operators remain steadfast on serving our customers and our communities and doing that with a convenient, affordable and safe food and service experience. Given the unprecedented nature of the conditions surrounding the quarter.  I do want to take a few moments to say thank you. First to our customers for giving us and our franchisees the privilege to serve you around the world. To our franchisees and our operators for your incredible resiliency, your passion, your innovative spirit, willingness to support each other and share best practices and for your commitment to your teams and your communities. And to our corporate teams truly across every aspect of our business from our supply chain to corporate operations to our functional support teams for leading with our values. And for your unyielding commitment to supporting the brand around the world. I have never been more proud than I am today to wear the Domino's logo and to serve as your CEO.  I also want to share some of the work that we've been doing as a brand aligned with our purpose and values. Our purpose as a brand is to feed the power possible one pizza at a time. Our values are do the right thing, put people first, create and inspired solutions; champion our customers and grow and win together. During the quarter, this purpose and these values drove us, drove us to partner with our franchisees to feed the need in giving away 10 million slices of pizza in our local communities. Drove us to pay out nearly $8 million in thank you bonuses to frontline hourly team members in our corporate stores and supply chain centers. And drove us to speak out against racism and to commit $3 million over the next three years to make a difference in black communities including $1 million which will be invested to establish the Domino's Black Franchise Opportunity Fund. We sold a lot of pizza in Q2 but I can tell you I'm even more proud of the good that our company, our team members and our franchisees did along the way. Now I'm going to turn my attention to our second quarter results. I'll discuss our US and our international businesses, while weaving in a few additional topics and some perspectives on the dynamics around food delivery and the pizza category in these times, which certainly have been a tailwind for many of us within the industry. We'll share some of the latest updates related to operations and execution as we continue to navigate our way through the pandemic. And also I'll talk about the areas where I believe we can continue to differentiate ourselves from the competition and drive shareholder value over the long term. And following that as always we'll be happy to take some Q&A. So let me get started with a discussion about our US business. The second quarter marked a rather unprecedented acceleration for food delivery in the US and we were certainly no exception. Our 37th consecutive quarter and strongest in that nine plus year run for same store sales, with evidence of this tailwind in delivery. Beyond the numbers, I'm most proud of our energy and execution at the store level. We absorbed unprecedented volume, while maintaining high service levels and continuing to provide tremendous value for our customers. And I can't say enough about our supply chain division, which did a terrific job handling heavy volumes and ensuring continued supply of product to our stores. So while there remains much to sort out and still much left to unfold regarding the future of customer behavior, we realize there's an opportunity to capitalize on the engagement with both new and returning customers. We believe value and convenience are bringing customers to us. And we hope it will continue to bring them back. Nearly 75% of our sales in the US are coming through digital channels. Through the second quarter, this combined with loyalty adoption give us a good proven chance at driving additional customer frequency. And I am glad more than ever that we have this direct digital and loyalty relationship with our customers and that we're not dependent upon a third party to bring us orders. Beyond anything else executing a terrific delivery and carryout experience will be the ultimate way to convince these customers to come back and to remain Domino's customers for the long term. I'll now turn my attention to operations. We spent much of the quarter retooling almost 60 years of standard operating procedures and doing that over a matter of weeks. Our teams and franchisees have done an outstanding job of implementing many things rather quickly, including protocols around contactless delivery, including the innovation of the pizza pedestal to deliver pizzas to our customers' front doors. The roll out of Domino's car side delivery, which provides an incredibly convenient and contact-free carryout experience for our customers. And many digital enhancements that our teams have developed to make ordering, selecting service methods, paying and tipping even easier. During all of this, our innovation and supply chain teams continue to work on our menu. Just last Monday we began rolling out a new product. Our new chicken wings with a greatly improved wing and terrific new sauces. We've added these to our $7.99 platform offering a 10-piece wing option in addition to our pizza offerings. And we're promoting the product and the offer today through our digital channels. Wings are a rapidly growing category as many of you know in delivery and carryout. And as we're honest with ourselves our wings needed to improve. And this is a sign that continued menu innovation doesn't always have to be something brand new, but can be a major renovation of existing products that customers have simply told us need to be better. Our customers are mixing and matching within our value platforms more than ever before and our new wings are a nice addition to our $7.99 carryout offer. We're very excited about this launch and we look forward to bringing additional new product news to our customers over the next few months. Let me remind you once again how we think about new products. Now while product innovation is very important for any restaurant brand, at Domino's we don't launch new products just to create news. Our strategy and launching new products focuses on first driving incremental sales and orders and incremental profitability for our franchisees at the store level. We focus on permanent menu items and simple operations. And very importantly whenever possible fitting new menu items into our existing value platforms.  Now turning to store growth. The pandemic certainly created obstacles for new store openings during the second quarter, but I'm very pleased that we and our franchisees still managed to open 39 net new stores in the US during Q2. Our development team and our franchisees did a great job remaining focused on smart growth across our markets. And while near-term challenges remain in many cities and towns, I'm optimistic about the medium and long-term opportunity to accelerate unit growth and to take advantage of the certain opportunities that we're seeing in the marketplace. Looking forward, I can tell you that we don't know exactly what the new normal is going to look like in the US. COVID-19 has accelerated some of the trends that we were already seeing in motion around delivery, carryout and digital adoption. And we expect that customer expectations around safety and contactless experiences will remain heightened for the foreseeable future. Now while we don't want have all of the answers on the future, we will continue to focus on the fundamental areas where we know we have to compete aggressively. Value, we talk about value often; it's always important but even more so when we're facing a recession and the high unemployment that we see today. Fortressing and unit growth will continue to be a focus. And the higher sales levels that we're experiencing and the service expectations that we have for our business make this even more important. We will continue to expand our supply chain capacity. We opened our Columbia South Carolina supply chain center in Q2. And we are on track to open another supply chain center in Katy, Texas and a thin-crust manufacturing facility in New Jersey during the back half of this year. Innovation across all areas of our business in digital and delivery and carryout and in food will continue to be important and a focus on service, a constant focus on service with plenty of opportunities still for us to improve is always a focus for us at Domino's. So in closing for the US business, I'd like to highlight a special recognition we receive this summer for the first time since 2009. We've been recognized as the leader in customer satisfaction for the pizza category as part of the ACSI's most recent restaurant report. That just makes me incredibly proud of our US business leaders, our franchisees and our operators. Turning our attention to International. We've now achieved 106 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth and to be honest with you back in April, I thought this incredible run was in doubt. I'm in my 10th year here at Domino's and I have never observed such wide variations in performance across our international business.  During the quarter, we had several markets which saw significant increases in sales driven in part by pandemic, driven changes in consumer behavior. China, Japan and South Korea are leading examples. And these markets are also responsible for pioneering many of the contactless delivery and carryout innovations. The US and dozens of international markets have benefited from the incredible ingenuity and creativity in these markets. However, we've had other markets which have had to deal with complete shutdowns for significant closures across their businesses. France, Spain, New Zealand, Panama and several others were completely closed for a period of time. India and Saudi Arabia and others had significant portions of their markets temporarily shuttered. And dozens of markets had to deal with service method restrictions and business hour restrictions during the quarter. In an environment with so many challenges, I am very pleased with the resiliency and performance of our international business. Our global group of terrific master franchisees once again demonstrated that they are the absolute best in the restaurant industry. At our peak, we had about 2,400 stores closed in the international business as markets and stores have gradually reopened over the quarter and as service methods have resumed we've seen consistent improvement in the business. Now there is still much work left to return the business to where it was pre-pandemic. We are at fewer than 600 stores fully closed as of July the 8th. At the same time, however, many markets are partially closed or still restoring service methods. These factors have continued to pressure retail sales and we expect continued volatility in the international business in the months ahead. In addition to the pressure on retail sales and same store sales, the pandemic has also slowed our international store growth momentum. We opened 45 net new stores in the quarter and that's far below our typical performance. We expect that it will take some time for store growth to ramp back up in the markets that have been most impacted by COVID-19. But with all that said, as I look forward I remain very optimistic about our international business and about the growth opportunity ahead. The pandemic has accelerated delivery adoption around the world and that is good for our business. Good for our business over the long term. We're the clear number one in QSR pizza on a global basis and we're number one in roughly half of the international markets where we compete. And while we're number one in all of those places, we still believe that we have significant room for market share growth within the pizza category around the world. We feel that unit economics, cash on cash returns and franchisee profitability fundamentals are still very strong in the majority of our international markets. Over the recent weeks, I've spoken with many of our international master franchisees and they remain very optimistic and very committed to investing in the long-term growth of their businesses. We've also taken advantage of an opportunity to invest in an international market as Jeff shared with you earlier. We now hold a minority ownership interest in Dash Brands, our master franchisee in China. We're very happy with where the business stands today. We've recently opened our 300 store in China and we are excited about the long-term growth potential there. We believe that we can play a role in helping Domino's China reach that potential and view this as a good long-term investment for DPZ. As I wrap up the discussion on our international business, I just want to say thank you to our incredible master franchisees and to the operators of our more than 1,100 store network outside the US. So in closing, we will likely never forget the second quarter of 2020 as a chapter in our path toward dominant number one. We're rising to the challenge of today and we are looking forward to capture the opportunities of tomorrow. And that opportunity is driven by the fact that we continue to bring more customers into this incredible brand. Each day we have more opportunities to delight our customers and to convert them into loyal Domino's fans. We're still very much a work in progress brand with plenty of areas to address and improve. And while we cannot predict the future nor will we try to do so. We will do all that we can to come out of this challenging time period even stronger than we've ever been. The resiliency of our brand and our business model, the strength to fortitude the bigger of our global franchisees and operators has never been more evident in the 60 year history of our company. And most importantly, we're going to continue to lead with our values and the health and safety of our store team members, franchisees and customers will remain our top priority. And with that Jeff and I will be happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is now open.
BrianBittner: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Jeff certainly going to miss your positive energy and definitely going to miss your wittiness. So congratulations on a terrific career at Domino's. Ritch, I understand the tailwind from the pandemic on your business in the US. They make sense but what can you specifically do to take advantage of these tailwind and retain and convert these new customers and really enable this current strength to pay dividends in the future in the form of future sales gains. 
RitchAllison: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Yes, we are getting an incredible opportunity today to bring more customers into the brand. As you look at the delivery business in particular we've seen a significant increase in new customer acquisition over the course of the second quarter. And our task there is to take those new customer opportunities and convert them into the second purchase and the third and ultimately loyal customers going forward. We've been working hard on that and the second quarter was our best quarter for driving new active loyalty members. Best quarter we've had since Q1 of 2019 when we ran our Points for Pies promotion. So working hard to convert these customers into loyal customers such that we can continue to earn their business over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
MattDiFrisco: Thank you. Congratulations Jeff on a great run as well and your next chapter and the time ahead that you get to spend with your family, very envious. I was hoping to learn more about the Dash investment. Can you share with us the percentage of the ownership that it gives you now with Dash? And then also just to clarify your development comments. It sounds like Q2 was obviously a very tough environment for development both domestically and internationally. Is it correct to assume the environments gotten better that Q3 it would be logical to have an environment that could support more growth both domestically and internationally on net basis? Thank you.
JeffLawrence: Hey, Matt. It's Jeff. I'll take the China, a part of that then I'll kick it over to Ritch for the development outlook. We're not disclosing the percentage ownership. It is a minority investment. We put in $40 million. We may be required and/or we have the option to put in another $40 million at the beginning of 2021. And listen; as Ritch said in his prepared remarks, this is just a very exciting growth market for us. Ritch and I have a lot of personal experience spending a lot of time there. And we know that if we want to hit our long-term aspirations as a brand, we have to have China be a thriving market for us. So we're viewing this very strategically in addition to being what we think will be a good financial investment. But more importantly, really a strategic investment where we can bring to bear all of our capabilities, our centers of excellence and really partner with that master in just a more intimate and close way to help accelerate the growth long term. So very excited about the investment. We think that it will be great for all of our stakeholders and with that I'll kick it over to Ritch to talk a little bit about development outlook.
RitchAllison: Sure. So, Matt, I'll talk about that in kind of two parts. First on the US side of the business, certainly during the quarter we had challenges around the country with construction delays, with permitting delays et cetera driven by the pandemic. But still really pleased with the store growth that we were able to achieve during the quarter and as I look out into the future I expect us to see more and more opportunities to accelerate unit growth in the US. When you look at the increase in the business that we're seeing today and I think also as you look at some of the real estate opportunities that may present themselves that weren't available in the past, I think. We've got a strong opportunity to continue to accelerate that US store growth. On the International side, the situation is very different from market to market. In markets around the world where we did not have significant store closures or trading restrictions, the business has been very, very strong. And those markets have continued to press ahead with their development goals in the near term. And then we've got other markets where we've had significant numbers of temporary store closures where really the near-term focus of those master franchisees is to get those stores open again and re-establish those operations. So I expect on the international side for things to remain choppy here in the near term. But when I think about the medium to the long term, I still have a very high level of confidence around our growth opportunities that we've got outside the US.
Operator: Our next question comes from Nick Setyan with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.
NickSetyan: Hi. Thanks very much. Any way to give us a little bit more incremental clarification around the new customers you've acquired. Just looking at the digital mix it's not quite clear where those new customers have been coming. So maybe if you could maybe disclose some of the loyalty numbers that would be helpful.
RitchAllison: Nick, the new customer acquisition during the quarter was really concentrated around our delivery business which is probably not surprising to many of you as customers sought a contactless experience and an experience where they didn't have to leave their homes to get their food. So more so than in the carryout side of our business where there was a lot of caution out there among customers about going out into public, into places of business during the quarter. So that's really where the bulk of the customer acquisition came in. And then also we saw improvements in our customer retention across the delivery side of the business as well. So a strong quarter really on both fronts as it relates to our delivery business. The digital, in our digital percentage ran about 75% during the quarter popping up as much as 80% in any given week, which has given us yet another opportunity to grow that engagement with our customers and an opportunity to continue to bring them on and into our loyalty program. And as I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, Q2 was that the best quarter we've seen in over a year in terms of adding active new members to our Piece of the Pie Reward loyalty program.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff farmer with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.
JeffreyFarmer: Great. Thank you and best of luck Jeff. Good luck with everything moving forward. You guys did briefly touch on it but can you compare consumer behavior in some of your largest international markets? I'm thinking about places like India and Mexico just as two examples to do what you're seeing in the US. Just trying to figure out how consumers are behaving there and those important international markets versus what we've seen in the US.
RitchAllison: Yes. There are, Jeff, there are a lot of consistent patterns when you look around the world. The desire on the part of customers to have a contactless experience is certainly high and when our international master franchisees do their customer research, they see a lot of the same things that we see in the US, which is safety, has really risen very high in terms of customer needs. The other things that have always been there like value, consistent service, great products still there but safety has risen pretty high on the list. So generally what you do see then is more growth on the delivery side of the business and then in some of our international markets where we had more of a dine-in component and again we don't really do table service anywhere around the world. But we do have in a number of our emerging markets larger dining rooms and a higher percentage of customers who choose to sit down and eat their food in our stores.  That part of the business certainly saw a lot of pressure in a number of cases where those dining rooms were closed or where customers were just very cautious about going in and eating in a public place. And you take all those things into account and you end up with some, as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, some fairly disparate impacts with some markets really seeing a tailwind as we have had in the US and then some other markets which you've seen a lot more pressure on their business, in their comps.
Operator: We have a question from Chris O'Cull - Stifel. Your line is open.
ChrisO'Cull: Thanks. Good morning. Jeff, I would also like to offer my congratulations on a very successful career at Domino's. We're going to miss the interaction. Ritch you mentioned additional new products plan for later this year. Is this a change from your original plan for this year? And could you explain maybe why product innovation just become -- seems it become a higher priority for the company.
RitchAllison: Yes. Chris, so no, it isn't, to the first part of your question not a change from our plan this year. We had planned to have several new products coming out during 2020. And as I mentioned earlier very excited that we've began the rollout last week of our new wings. And we'll have more product news coming over the course of the next couple of months. We take it, I talked a lot about and I talked in my prepared remarks about the approach that we take to new product development. We don't do it just for news but we're looking for products that can remain on the menu and deliver great incremental sales and profit to our franchisees. One of the things that we've observed as we've seen this huge boom in delivery over the course of the last couple of years is we're trying to keep an eye on product categories that customers are really adopting at higher rates for delivery. And certainly wings are one of those -- one of the fastest growing categories out there. And so we saw an opportunity number one to improve our wings based on the feedback that we got from consumers. But also a great opportunity to bring terrific value by putting a ten-piece wing offer in to our $7.99 platform. And you'll recall that we started some years ago with our large three topping pizza at $7.99. And then over time we've expanded that across the remaining crust types and now we're looking at wings that yet another great opportunity to add to that mix-and-match platform. So I think you're going to see us, we're going to continue to stay focused on new product development but with the parameters that I always talk about which is we don't do it just for news. We're going to do it if we think it brings sustained sales and profit to the franchisees.
Operator: Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
LaurenSilberman: Thanks and Jeff, congratulations on next steps. A great tenure at Domino's. You mentioned comp to stay in momentum through the end of 2Q. Are you seeing any differences regionally on how customers are engaging with the brand? And what changes do you see in customer behavior as markets reopen for dine-in? Any shift and carryout or delivery performance?
RitchAllison: Yes. So, Lauren, we've not seen honestly a lot of discernible difference when we look across, regionally across the US in the second quarter. I will say that our rule and suburban locations have generally performed better then some of the denser more urban centers around the country. And as all of you know, our brand relative to some of the other restaurant brands is more tilted in terms of our sales coming from more of those rural and suburban locations. And then as it relates to how our business performed in the quarter relative to what was going on with sit-down restaurant reopening and things like that. I would tell you that it's still pretty early to draw any discernible conclusions there. As Jeff said, we didn't see any slowdown in momentum all the way through the end of the second quarter. And that was as a number of states and cities around the country were reopening dine-in. But even with that said, those that were reopening were only reopening at 50% and at most 75% capacity. And as we're all aware some of those things are actually being reversed as we speak and as we another spike unfortunately in COVID-19 cases. So still a very dynamic and evolving marketplace out there for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Your line is open.
PeterSaleh: Great. Thanks and congratulations, Jeff. You'll definitely be missed. I want to ask about the -- looks like announcement couple days ago a partnership with Vonage. It sound -- this sounds like it might be related to the voice ordering and Dom capability. Could you guys elaborate on what you're seeing there and your expectations on rolling out the voice ordering capabilities?
JeffLawrence: Hey, Pete. Appreciate the counting words and I'll take a shot at this one. You know that we continue and have for as long as Ritch and I've been here and before that to be very serious about investing in our technological capabilities going forward. I think everybody who follows Domino's knows that we are a believer, a big believer in voice technology generally. You can order obviously on your digital or your mobile phone right now using a voice assistant. And we've been working on phone Dom trying to use artificial intelligence to take a full order. We've made great strides in that.  The partnership that you referenced again is just part of our overall strategy to continue to invest and get smarter in this area. But more than that starts to get into kind of future strategic stuff that we're quite frankly not going to disclose because of competitive reasons. But do know that one of the great things that we've been able to do and even during this pandemic is continue to invest with the long-term, the long-term brand in mind. We have not slowed down in our technological investments and in some ways we've actually accelerated as you've seen us rolled GPS. You've seen us roll car side delivery. So I think that this crisis has really shown us that we can move faster. We can with our great franchisees execute a little bit faster. And we're meeting the customers where they want to meet us on technology and voice is just part of that. So that be the color I give you on that. But just know that we are and remain committed to all the technological investments that we talk to you all about, really encouraged by what we've been able to roll out over the last three or four months. And quite frankly gives us a lot of confidence that we'll be able to do some more that in the future.
Operator: We have a question from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.
DavidTarantino: Hi. Good morning and my congrats to Jeff as well. My question comes back to the strength you're seeing in the US business. And I was wondering Ritch or Jeff if you can help us understand how much of the increase that you saw during Q was related to the new customers you're acquiring versus potentially existing customers increasing their frequency or order sizes. So could you help bucket those two things for us. Thanks.
RitchAllison: Hey, David. It's Ritch. We're not going to break down those specific numbers for competitive reasons. But back to some of what I was describing earlier. If you take a look at the delivery business, we saw a significant uptick in new customer acquisition on the delivery side of the business and also very strong retention or repeat purchases from existing customers. If you look on the carryout side of the business, great repeat purchase from existing customers but not as strong on the acquisition side on the carryout business. And that's not surprising honestly when you think about the fact that during the quarter many consumers were very reluctant to go outside of the home and to places of business. Now as we watched those patterns evolve over the course of the quarter, we moved very aggressively to implement our Domino's car side delivery. And we're actually on TV advertising that today you've probably seen our ads. But that is really an effort to number one; create a terrific carryout experience for the customer where they never even have to get out of their car. It is contactless in that our store team members will bring the pizza out of the store and will put it in the customer's trunk or backseat wherever they want to put it. So in the near term it really is all about driving customer acquisition in frequency for the carryout business. But over the long term, it's a great way for us to compete against the drive-through that so many other QSR have but that we have in a very limited number of our US stores. So just one example of an innovation there that we are focused on not only to address the demand dynamics of the near term. But also as we think about how we position the brand for success in the future.
DavidTarantino: Great. Very helpful. If I could ask just one follow-up? Ritch, when you acquire a new delivery customer, what's been your historical retention rate on that? Do you have any metrics you can share on that front?
RitchAllison: David, we've got a lot of metric going but we don't share them publicly.
Operator: We have a question from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
JohnGlass: Thank you very much. Jeff, wow and hats off. And my question, it's really two things. One is how does this pandemic change your view or modify if you maybe on the fortressing strategy, right? This is a moment where deliveries expanding and accelerating. Is it still right to do fortressing? I understand one of the primary reasons purchasing originally was that carry out business. Are you as enthusiastic about that business as you were a prior? And Ritch, I'd also be very interested your comments and thoughts on what's happening in the third-party aggregator business. There have been a couple of acquisitions and transformations in those businesses. What do you think that means for Domino's as that industry gets consolidated, but you also you get some new competitors in the US.
RitchAllison: Thanks John. First on the fortress thing. I am if anything more enthusiastic about fortressing given what we've seen during the pandemic and the increased sales and momentum that we've had there around our delivery business. And carryout has been growing in a very strong way for quite some time also. So when I take a look at it I just see more opportunity to get more stores on the map from a demand standpoint. Also when we think about the real estate environment out there, I also think that we are going to have in the near and medium term a fairly unprecedented opportunity in terms of the availability and affordability of real estate out there. As an unfortunate reality of the pandemic is that there will be a number of retail stores and restaurants that will close, quite a few of which will be in a similar footprint kind of environment to what we look for. And then I think also we may see a more favorable market in terms of rents that we can go out there and get with landlords. So I'm as optimistic as and even more so than ever around fortressing. On your second question around the third-party aggregator market, certainly it has been a very interesting quarter as it relates to news out there about possible consolidation. I've been talking for a long time about the fact that the only way that business gets to profitability is through some form of consolidation over time. Given what has happened recently with a couple of deals that have been announced, frankly, I don't see that change in the competitive dynamic a whole lot. Certainly for the near term I expect those aggregators to still remain very promotional in terms of how they're going out to acquire customers. And I expect them to remain pretty aggressive in particular with how they go out and cut deals with the largest QSRs. So when we take a look at it from Domino's perspective, we expect it to continue to be a highly competitive environment that we will participate in and we expect it to continue to be a pretty tough environment for the third-party aggregators in terms of their ability to drive profitable transactions.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open.
DennisGeiger: Thanks for the question. And, Jeff, congratulations on a great run and great and good luck. Just wondering if you guys could share any thoughts on how important the enhanced unemployment checks have been on the business. I guess more importantly how you're thinking about any kind of strategy tweaks as and if they roll off. Does this change your strategy with respect to marketing or promotional activity? Anything you can comment there on a high level. Thank you.
RitchAllison: Sure. Dennis, I think certainly the initial stimulus checks and additional unemployment I think no doubt have enabled a lot of consumers to continue to eat, to eat out, to order food delivery et cetera. How much of the business is driven by that, we honestly don't know. I can tell you that as we look forward, there's a lot of uncertainties obviously around what that stimulus might look like post July. But we're remaining very focused on value. Frankly, as we always have been because we're going to be in a recession for some period of time here where consumers' pocketbooks are going to be under pressure. And so we've got to have great value with our national offers, great value on our menus and we got to have great value with respect to what we charge customers to deliver that food. And I feel very good about where Domino's is positioned on those fronts.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
ChrisCarril: Thanks. Good morning and, Jeff, congratulations on a great career at Domino's and all the best in next steps. So as a follow-up to John's question on fortressing, given your commentary around real estate opportunities and together with presumably another strong franchisee cash flow year, does the current environment change or thinking at all about the long-term store development opportunity in the US?
RitchAllison: Chris, I think if anything it increases potentially the opportunity over time. Obviously, we don't know exactly how long we're going to be in this COVID-19 pandemic. We don't know when we're going to have a vaccine or effective therapeutics. But significant disruptions like this do tend to accelerate changes in market share and create opportunity. And as we take a look at this, we are looking for opportunities to move even more aggressively to get stores open. And so if anything, I see an opportunity that could only grow over time.
Operator: We have a question from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
KatherineFogertey: Great. Thank you. So, Jeff, congratulations on an impressive tenure and track record at Domino's. Best wishes on your next step. I have a few questions here. So the first is can you help us understand the cadence in the quarter on both the carryout and the delivery business in the US? Given us a split historically and just kind of wondering a few things how was it tracking now? The commentary you gave suggest that delivery was the strongest business and intuitively that makes a lot of sense, but as the economy started to reopen in the back half of the quarter, are you seeing improvements in carryout and also on the delivery side? Did that improvement kind of continue and accelerate of as the economy reopened or have you seen some moderation? And I have a follow-up question.
JeffLawrence: So, Katy, I think we heard you a little bit on that. I'll take a shot at it. What I would tell you is this; customer behavior that we're seeing during the pandemic is really meeting Domino's where we already were with great carryout, great delivery, a frictionless technological experience. Great value and so in many ways I think this pandemic has just accelerated a lot of what we thought we probably would have earned over time. But that it came to us quickly. And as it relates to delivery versus carryout, those two different service methods. When we see places that have restrictions lifted around carryout, we sell more carryout, while still having a great delivery business. So to us, it's less about is a certain day park shutdown, as a certain regulation happen, we know that when customers have unfettered access to Domino's that we will build, we have every chance to build sustainable relationships and sales with these customers over time. We clearly saw that during Q2 again with no discernible drop-off in demand through the end of the quarter. And that a lot of confidence that for the foreseeable future customers are going to continue to really value both delivery and the carryout experiences as allowed by local and state ordinances depending on where you're at. So for us, again, we feel like this has just been us meeting the customer where they were already going the pandemic, I think, is accelerated that. And then again on our side, we've tried to meet the customer where they want to be by rolling out the innovations faster and more efficiently. And by the way kudos to our 800 franchise partners in the United States. The job that they have done as Ritch mentioned in his prepared remarks with rewriting operational procedures, executing at a high level, keeping service up during this pandemic has been nothing short of just outstanding. So that would be the commentary that I think we could give you around that, but we're in the right businesses. You want to be in carryout; you want to be in delivery whether there's a pandemic or not and with that I'll pause. And I think you had -- I think we will allow you quick a quick follow-up if you talk louder.
KatherineFogertey: Great. Thank you. So on the point you kind of mentioned that. That color by the way is very helpful. You talked about higher tickets being a helpful contributor to the comp. Can you help us understand the extent of which that was helpful? And even if you would dive into delivery versus carryout, do you see the ability to sustain the ticket growth in the US in the coming quarters, maybe that's many innovation; maybe it's bundling or should we factor that in dying down as the recovery plays out?
RitchAllison: So, Katy. It's Ritch. On the ticket dynamic, a little different across the two businesses. Growth in delivery really driven both by order count growth and also ticket, but with a pretty heavy growth in order count. On the carry out business growth for the court are really driven more by ticket. And in both cases it is -- it's more items. Customers are ordering larger basket sizes and it's really interesting. One of the things that we have heard over the quarter is that customers are actively putting more food in the basket to have leftovers the next day. So they're thinking about not just that evening's meal but how they're planning for the following day. How much of that dynamic continues following COVID-19, we honestly don't know today. We're continuing to obviously track it and follow it, but at this point it is really hard to say given where we are in the cycle of this pandemic.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
JohnIvankoe: Just one question. Congratulations, Jeff, I can't wait to hear what's next. Just -- the comment on Dash obviously you guys are investing from a position of strength or accelerating unit development from a position of strength. Do you think that you could have the potential would you want you to have majority ownership stake at some point? And obviously ask the question this is the first time you have made the direct investment in an international franchisee. And this is a related question, are there any opportunities for you to provide capital or cash flow assistance to any large your franchisees elsewhere outside of China that could also be converted into a significant equity stake as clearly some operators must exist that that could benefit from some cash flow from a working capital perspective.
RitchAllison: Hey, John. It's Ritch. First on Dash, we're quite happy to be a minority partner in that business. It's got -- there's a great group of partners that own the rest of the equity in that business and a terrific management team on the ground to lead that. So we see this is -- it is a great opportunity to create value for DPZ but also to be a great thought partner and strategic partner with the Board there and the management team as we grow the business. Looking elsewhere around the globe, we've never said never on investing in these international businesses. Dash happened to be a terrific opportunity to do that. If others were to come around at some point in the future, we would we might consider that but the bar is very high. You've only seen us do this one time in any recent memory. So it's not something that you should expect us to do in wide-scale.
Operator: Our next question comes from Greg Francfort with Bank of America. Your line is open.
GregoryFrancfort: Yes. Thanks for the question. And, Jeff, congrats on retirement. I'm definitely going to miss our interactions. Ritch, I had a question for you just there seems to be a lot that's changing with COVID and I'm curious what you think are the biggest changes to the Domino's strategy post COVID versus pre-COVID. I don't know if that's a greater focus on unit growth or focus on the supply chain or focus on value. If you could just kind of comment on what you think is the biggest change and how Domino's is approaching kind of the strategy to grow that would be helpful? Thanks.
RitchAllison: Sure, Greg. When I think about what's going on at least so far with COVID, I think, the reality is it has accelerated a lot of trends that were already in place in our industry. When you think about a digital adoption, when you think about the migration from on-premise to off-premise through delivery and carryout, those things have just accelerated and leapt forward by a year or two or three years. So what I look at what we need to do going forward, a lot of it is doubling down on the things that we've been doing. Fortressing for example, to make sure that we continue to get closer and more convenient to our customers. We haven't slowed down a bit in terms of our investment in the digital side of our business and making the ordering experience easier for customers, ordering all the way through paying and receiving your food both for the delivery and the carryout experience there. I will tell you that one thing that is very different in COVID is just the heightened sensitivity around food safety and contactless methods. So we've invested heavily there and my expectation is that is going to continue to be important to customers for quite some time to come. So I think that is one thing that is likely to be a bit different. As customers have -- many customers have ordered delivery that had never ordered delivery before. I think our ability to offer variety is going to be even more important in the future than it is today. So that's why you've seen us renovate a product in wings that needed to be renovated. It is a category that is growing rapidly here as we look through COVID. And we're looking to other opportunities around menu innovation as well to take advantage of the fact that the customers are just choosing to order delivery more often and across a much wider variety of food. So, Greg, doubling down on some of the same strategies but then also leaning in maybe a little bit more on some of the other things that we believe we need to do to be very competitive going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.
JeffreyBernstein: Great. Thanks very much. And, Jeff, congratulations. Hard to imagine any future endeavors as much fun or successful as your years at Domino's. My primary question is just on the US delivery business. Ritch, just wondering you commented on the third-party aggregators and perhaps a little bit of consolidation going on here. I'm just wondering whether your thoughts have changed at all in terms of perhaps using an aggregator to generate some incremental sales on different platforms as we've seen their popularity increase, even if you continue to be the one doing the delivery. And the just to clarify did you make any mention of, I know you did last quarter you talk about weekday, weekend, lunch, dinner for any third quarter, quarter-to-date momentum, any color would be great. Thank you.
RitchAllison: Sure. Jeff, hey, first on the third party. It's only strengthened by point of view that we don't need to be on those platforms. I cannot imagine that we would have been able to move as quickly as we have and meeting our customer as Jeff described where they wanted to be, if we didn't have full control over that digital experience and the actual contactless experience at the point of delivering the food. And we've had pretty strong growth in demand without having to pay significant -- without having to ask our franchisees to pay high fees to a third party. So my point of view is strengthened. Your second part of your question around day parts, since the last time Jeff and I spoke to you about the business, at that time I think we talked about lunch growing pretty rapidly. Dinner being softer; we've seen more balance there in terms of growth at lunch, growth at dinner. I will tell you that the evening day part is still relatively weak versus what in terms of growth compared with the growth that we're seeing across some of the other day parts in the business but by and large continuing to see strong at lunch and strong at dinner.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Your line is open.
BrettLevy: Great. Thanks for taking the call. And, Jeff, best wishes to you. When you think about the franchisees right now obviously they're all, as you said, the profitability is relatively quite strong. What are they asking for right now? What are they think you need to do from an investment standpoint aside from just the new product and as you implement more of this technology, is there a need to reassess the digital fee? Thank you.
RitchAllison: Yes. So, Brett, franchisee profitability as I think we shared last time, 2019 was our strongest year. So, we were pleased to come into this pandemic in a position of strength and that has really continued through the course the pandemic. Certainly, some franchisees see stronger profits than others depending upon where you're located around the country. But continues to be very strong with the sales growth that we have seen. When you -- you are asking what franchisees are asking for. Well, I'll tell you during the second quarter it really was about helping them adapt to this new environment. So we were -- we've been on a cadence of more frequent franchisee communication than we probably ever had in the history of our brand of really working together literally day-by-day, hour-by-hour to implement new operating procedures across the business. Working together to implement new technology solutions to better enable these contactless experience and those were things that franchisees were craving and where we worked very hard to meet their needs and work together to get those things rolled out. And as we look forward, we're going to continue to invest in tech across our business from the technology that you hold in your hand with your smartphone when you order from us all the way through the store. And how we run and operate our business inside the four walls of the box. That's going to continue to be a big focus for us in an area where our franchisees would love to have us continue to help them when we think about how they continue to run efficient businesses and continue to drive their bottom-line profitability.
BrettLevy: If I could sneak in one other quick, where you are on capacity within the supply chain given that these are, as you said, unprecedented sales levels and yes just where you think you are in terms of the existing, you've already mentioned where you're building out. Thanks.
RitchAllison: Yes. I can tell you we're awfully glad that we had already opened our centers in New Jersey and that we got the center in South Carolina opened this year to help us keep up with all of this unprecedented demand. As I mentioned earlier, we're going to open in Katy, Texas later this year. We're going to add some thin crust capacity to our system. We are continuing to look at and our supply chain network and as we've talked about in the past you should expect to see us continue to add centers over time, which is a great problem or opportunity depending on how you want to describe it. We're going to have to continue to add more capacity to support our franchisees around the country.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
JonTower: Great and Jeff, echo everybody else congratulations. I hope you have fun in retirement or whatever it is you decide to do next. I am curious I know you guys aren't necessarily tied directly to any specific sports but we are coming upon a season where pizza consumption seems to be a bit higher fall and winter than rest of year. And the sports schedule seems to be a bit up in the air. So can you discuss how you plan on attacking this during a period where viewing particularly on the weekends might be gone or significantly lower than it's been in years past?
RitchAllison: Yes. Jon, I mean it is so hard to tell is what's going to happen with respect to sports. For us, it doesn't matter if people are sitting in the stands at all, if it's on TV, people will gather and order pizza. So from where we are today, here in the summer I guess there's only upside as we look through the back half of the year as sports come on to TV. It is remarkable what we find ourselves watching on TV now as we kind of as we crave live action sports. But I wish I knew Jon. I really wish I knew and hopefully we'll get back to more of a state of normal around some of those sports as we work through the fall and winter.
JonTower: And then just following up to your earlier comments, Ritch, on kind of the landscape or at least real estate landscape potentially easing up a little bit in future windows. It does seem like the whole pizza category itself has thrived during the pandemic both chain and independent. But I'm curious to see or hear from you if you're actually seeing something else in the marketplace perhaps how independent they are faring versus the chains right now in the pizza category. 
RitchAllison: Yes. Jon, what I would say is that the stronger you were in digital and the stronger you were and off-prem the better off you're doing. If you go down the scale on both of those two dimensions, I think whether its chains or independence there's more of a struggle. If you are weak in digital and weak in off-prem.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen. Your line is open.
AndrewCharles: Great. Thank you. And just echo everyone else, Jeff, it's been a pleasure working with you and wish you the best of luck to your next endeavor. And hopefully some time to enjoy the time off. I want to ask question are you able to disclose how many active U.S loyalty members you had at the end of the quarter. And as you look globally, are there penetration levels that you've seen in some international markets on a per capita basis with loyalty program that suggests there is more room for growth in this program and especially opportunities obviously as well from conversion to make these users more active.
RitchAllison: Hey, Andrew. We're not going to disclose today the number of active members. We do that about once a year or so, it has been our past practice and we'll stick with that. When you -- you talk about penetration in other markets, as we look across the globe and we have -- we're the number one pizza player in about half of the 90 odd international markets that we operate in. And we have a number of markets where our share is significantly higher than the share that we hold in the U.S. business today. And that is one of the things that continues to give us some confidence that there's a big opportunity to continue to earn more business from the customers in the U.S. We still only serve about one out of every five QSR Pizzas that are going to get eaten tonight and our share is significantly better than that in a number of the international markets around the globe, which gives us a lot of confidence.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Ritch Allison for any closer remarks.
Ritch Allison: Well, listen, thanks everybody. It certainly has been an eventful Q2 and we really appreciate all of you for joining us this morning. I'll offer one more time my thanks to Jeff Lawrence. Jeff, thank you for everything you've done for the business. And I look forward to speaking with all of you in October when we get together once again to discuss our third quarter 2020 results. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-04-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Domino's Pizza First Quarter 2020 Earning Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Lawrence: Thanks Sonia, and hello everyone. This is Jeff Lawrence, Chief Financial Officer of Domino's Pizza. Thank you for joining the call today to talk about the results of our first quarter of 2020. Given the unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 crisis throughout the world, in addition to discussing our first quarter results, we are also going to share with you some preliminary estimated results of the first few weeks of the second quarter. As you know, this call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others be in a listen-only mode throughout the call. If forward-looking statements are made today, I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement that you can find in this morning's release and the 10-Q. We will start with comments from Chief Executive Officer, Ritch Allison, followed by an update for me, then we'll go back to Ritch for closing remarks before taking analyst questions. We ask that our analysts limit themselves to one question during this call. With that I'd like to turn the call over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thanks Jeff, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Given the extraordinary circumstances, we are going to take a different approach to the call this morning. I'm going to speak first to share some perspective on the business and how we're responding to the COVID-19 crisis, both here in the U.S. and around the world. I'll then talk about some of the investments that we're making in our team members and in the communities that we serve. I'll then hand it over to Jeff, who will walk you through the details around our Q1 performance and Jeff will also share some preliminary estimated results from the first few weeks of our second quarter. I'll then come back to discuss some of the things that we're focused on as we look forward to the remainder of 2020 and then following that, as we always do, we'll be happy to take some of your questions. So with that as a roadmap for our call this morning, let's get started. And I'll begin with some perspectives on the business and how we're responding to this COVID-19 crisis. On 30th of March, we released a preliminary first quarter business update. We pride ourselves on being transparent with our stakeholders and we hope that information was helpful to you. So, I won't spend much time on Q1 in my comments this morning, as I've already shared some of my perspective on the quarter in that release. The reality is that the world is changing very rapidly and we are much more focused on the present and on how we're going to continue to navigate this crisis going forward. The restaurant industry is facing an existential crisis and no one knows how many restaurants will survive or what form the industry will take as this crisis eventually abates. We also don't know how consumer behaviors and purchasing patterns may evolve during and then after this COVID-19 crisis. We were fortunate to enter the year and this crisis in what we believe to be a very strong financial position, both at the brand and at the franchisee levels. Our U.S. franchisees averaged an estimated $143,000 in EBITDA per store and over $1 million in average EBITDA at the enterprise level in 2019. Both of those figures are increases over the 2018 levels. Now we know that profit levels vary significantly across the country based on wage levels and a number of other factors, but we're pleased that our franchisees remained healthy and strong throughout 2019. Looking forward here into 2020, we know our business, along with our franchisees and stores, will face new costs as we respond to COVID-19 with new service methods and a number of investments in items such as masks, gloves and thermometers both for corporate and franchisee team members. We are well positioned as a brand with the delivery and carryout business model and this has allowed us to continue serving our customers and employing our team members in the sizable majority of our markets and our stores around the world. As we manage through this challenge across the globe, I'm very proud as our CEO to say that we are leading with our values. Our first two values at Domino's are: number one, do the right thing and second, put our people first. And for us that means prioritizing the health and well-being of store team members, franchisees and the communities that we serve. During this extraordinary time, we take our responsibility for continuing to provide convenient, reliable delivery and carryout experiences to the communities where those services have been deemed essential. We take it very seriously. Fewer than 20 stores in our U.S. business are currently facing temporary closures. All others remain open and are serving customers. Now with that said, our U.S. business model has adapted to this new environment and our standard operating procedures have changed considerably over the last two months. I say to folks here inside Domino's, we're a 60-year-old brand that has rewritten most of our standard operating procedures in the last six weeks. We've moved to 100% contactless delivery model across the country. We have made our contactless drive up carryout technology available to all U.S. stores. We have temporarily banned customers from sitting and eating in our stores. We're asking our customers to practice social distancing when they visit us to pick up their carryout orders. We have implemented social distancing protocols in our store and supply chain for our team members there. And in addition to thermometers, we are supplying them with masks and gloves to protect our teams and our customers. At Domino's, food safety and cleanliness have always been top priorities, but recently we've devoted additional resources toward our efforts and our procedures there. I'm incredibly proud of our U.S. franchisees. They continue to embrace change at an unprecedented rate, but I'm also not surprised to see that they have elevated their commitment to safely serving their team members and their communities. It is at times like these when our U.S. franchisees truly shine brightest. All of our U.S. supply chain centers also remain open and are fully operational. Through the remarkable efforts of our supply chain team, we successfully opened our newest supply chain center in Columbia, South Carolina on March 29. We're working very closely with our suppliers to maintain a safe and stable flow of product into our stores. I'm so proud of our supply chain team. They've done it a just a tremendous job of continuing our core operations, while also responding to this crisis in new ways. They put significant effort into sourcing masks, gloves, thermometers, contactless delivery supplies and cleaning supplies at a time when these items are under just incredible demand pressures. In an effort to provide ongoing transparency to you in the midst of this crisis, this morning, we released our preliminary estimated U.S. sales results for the first four weeks of the second quarter. Sales have improved relative to the last two periods of the first quarter as detailed in our March 30 business update. And Jeff is going to share more details around this later this morning in our call. We continue to observe and analyze the rapidly-changing trends in consumer purchasing behavior. Across delivery and carryout service methods, dayparts days of the week, the U.S. will continue to be impacted by many factors such as shelter and place orders, business and school closings and event cancellations, which vary in magnitude across the cities and towns in the U.S. that we serve. Across our international business, the unique circumstances in a number of markets have necessitated the temporary closing of stores and in some cases, entire markets have temporarily closed for varying periods of time. We continue to stay in contact with the master franchisees operating these affected markets in stores. Some have already reopened and we look forward to them reopening the remainder of their stores as soon as possible. At our peak, we had almost 2,400 international stores closed. And as of April 21st, that number was approximately 1,750. This morning we also released our preliminary estimated international sales results for the first three weeks of the second quarter. The sales impact stemming from COVID-19 varies quite dramatically across our international markets. Some markets, where we have significant service method and operating hour restrictions, we have seen major declines in same-store sales. In other markets. We've seen strong recovery in steady gains in same-store sales over the recent weeks. China was our first market to be significantly impacted by COVID-19 and we are pleased to see our sales there recover and accelerate in the last few weeks of the first quarter and to remain strong early in Q2. I'm very proud of our international master franchisees and their resiliency as they manage through this crisis in their markets around the world. I'm also grateful for the best practice sharing and rapid adoption of new ideas across the globe. Much of what we're doing today, right here in the U.S. has been informed and inspired by our international markets that found themselves on the forefront - on the front end of this crisis. I'm going to turn our attention now to some of the investments that we're making in our teams and in our communities. Throughout this uncertain time, we are committed to supporting our teams and the communities we serve. In our corporate stores and supply chain centers, we are investing heavily in our teams during this crisis. We have committed to pay additional bonuses to our corporate store and supply chain hourly team members over a 10-week period from mid-March through at least the last pay period in May. We're also providing enhanced sick pay benefits to our hourly corporate store and supply chain team members through at least the remainder of the year. At Domino's, we don't want anyone to have to choose between their health and their pay check. Now most of you probably are not familiar with the Domino's Pizza Partners Foundation. It's a registered 501(c)(3) that was established to help Domino's team members in need during a time of crisis. Its mission is summed up in the phrase team members, helping team members. And its primary source of funding is through payroll deduction from corporate and franchisee employees. I'm very proud to say that our Company is making a significant donation to the Partners Foundation to help team members at this particular time of need across the globe. We're grateful as a brand that we're in a position to be able to make these investments and we are very proud of our independent franchise business owners, many of whom are making similar investments in their team members. Our supply chain centers, corporate stores and franchisees are also hiring and have been looking to add more than 10,000 employees across the U.S. With still many Americans newly unemployed, we feel privileged to be in a position to offer employment and a career opportunity within the Domino's Pizza system. We're also committed to supporting the communities around the U.S. where we live and work. We recently launched our Feed the Need program. This is in partnership with our franchisees to provide 10 million slices of pizza across the U.S. We're making a significant investment as a brand by supplying the food for this program, while our franchisees and corporate stores are being generous in providing the labor. We've empowered our franchisees in stores across the country to identify the needs specific in their communities. In some places, it's school children, who are no longer receiving free or reduced lunch. In others, it's hospital workers and first responders. In some places, it's essential workers in grocery and retail and many other areas. This isn't new because Domino's has always given back in times of crisis, this isn't an exception. While these are some highlights from the U.S., I would be remiss this morning if I didn't also thank our international master franchisees, many of whom are doing similar things in their markets. From the U.K. to India to Australia and really all over the world, the Domino's system is stepping up to support our communities. As a system, we are happy to make these investments in both our teams in our communities and will continue to search for ways to invest and to feed the need during this crisis. These investments are expected to be material during the second quarter. Jeff will comment on the financial impact of these investments in just a moment and we will provide more detail to you during our next earnings cycle in July. So, with that I'm going to hand it over to Jeff, who will walk you through the highlights of the first quarter and some preliminary estimated results from the first two weeks of - few weeks, excuse me, of Q2 and then I have to that I'll come back and share a few more thoughts with you before we move to Q&A. So Jeff, over to you.
Jeff Lawrence: Thank you, Ritch, and good morning again everyone. I'll cover off the first quarter financial results as well as provide a brief preliminary financial update for the business for the first few weeks of the second quarter. Starting with the first quarter results, we continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 36 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 105 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continued to increase our global store count as we opened 178 gross new stores and 69 net new stores in Q1. This net store growth number includes the closure of the 71 stores, comprising our South Africa market during the quarter that was unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our diluted EPS in Q1 was $3.07, an increase of 39.5% over the prior year quarter, primarily resulting from a significantly lower effective tax rate and strong operational results. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q1. Global retail sales grew 4.4% as compared to the prior year quarter, pressured by a stronger dollar. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 5.9%. This global retail sales growth was driven by both an increase in the average number of stores opened during the quarter and higher same-store sales. Same-store sales for the U.S. grew 1.6%, lapping a prior year increase of 3.9%. And same-store sales for our international business grew 1.5%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.8%. Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 1.5%, while our Company-owned stores were up 3.9%. The U.S. comp this quarter was driven by ticket growth. We continue to see robust growth in our carryout business, while our delivery comp for Q1 was slightly negative, consistent with previously-discussed market dynamics. Our international comp for the quarter was driven entirely by order growth. We estimate that the international comp for the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 1 point to 1.5 points by the COVID-19 pandemic. On the unit count front, we opened 30 net U.S. stores in the first quarter, consisting of 35 store openings and just five closures. Our international division added 39 net new stores during Q1, comprised of 143 store openings and 104 closures, including the closure of the 71 stores comprising our South Africa market. Turning to revenues. Total revenues for the first quarter were up 4.4% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher global retail sales, which drove higher supply chain and global franchise revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower Company-owned store revenues, resulting from the New York store sale in Q2 of 2019. International royalty revenues were pressured by $1.4 million during the quarter by foreign currency exchange rates. Moving now to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 39% from 38.6% in the prior year quarter and was positively impacted by the New York store sale and higher revenues from our global franchise business. Supply chain and Company-owned store operating margin percentages were relatively similar year-over-year. G&A expenses decreased approximately $1 million as compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to see the benefit of improved discipline and focus in this important area, while continuing to invest in strategic initiatives throughout our business. Our reported effective tax rate was negative 3.7% for the quarter, down 18.8 percentage points from the prior year quarter. The reported effective tax rate in the quarter included a 26 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. We do expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these tax benefits. When you add it all up, our first quarter net income was up $29 million or 31.2% over the prior year quarter. Our first quarter diluted EPS was $3.07 versus $2.20 in the prior year which was a 39.5% increase. Here is how that $0.87 increase breaks down for the quarter. Our lower effective tax rate, resulting primarily from higher tax benefits on equity-based compensation, positively impacted us by $0.58. Lower diluted share count, resulting primarily from share repurchases over the past 12 months, benefited us by $0.14. Higher net interest expense, resulting primarily from higher average debt balances, negatively impacted us by $0.08. And most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.23. Now turning to cash. During the first quarter, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of more than $95 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of almost $78 million, which was pressured by normal balance sheet movement. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 271,000 shares for $80 million or about $294 per share on average. It's important to note that these repurchases were made during the first week of the first quarter. All in all, a good quarter for the business in Q1. As we now move away from our Q1 financial discussions, I'd like to remind folks that we did issue a business update on March 30, which contain preliminary estimates of selected Q1 information, including comps, store growth and global retail sales information. We also inform the market that due to the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and our business operations, considering COVID-19, we withdrew our 2020 guidance measures related to G&A, CapEx, store food basket pricing and the impact of foreign currency on royalty revenues. We also announced that as a precautionary measure we borrowed the remaining funds available to us under our outstanding variable funding note to further strengthen our already strong financial position. I'd like to now switch gears and give a financial update on the business for the first few weeks of the second quarter for which we have available results. This information contains preliminary unaudited estimates and is being provided to assist our stakeholders with a high level understanding of how the business is performing during these extraordinary times. In the U.S. business, comps were up 7.1% during the first four weeks of Q2. U.S. retail sales were up 10.7% over the same time period. Sales trended up significantly over this four-week period. As it relates to U.S. customer behavior during this crisis, this is what we are generally seeing thus far. Delivery and carryout mix are holding relatively steady on average. Weekday sales have been significantly up, while weekends have generally been more pressured. Lunch and dinner dayparts are up, while late night had been more pressured. And we are seeing larger order sizes throughout the week. Again these are initial observations regarding consumer behavior and we may experience volatility in our sales going forward as a result of this dynamic environment. In our international business, comps were down 3.2% during the first three weeks of Q2. Important to note here that we are only reporting three weeks of international sales information due to the normal reporting lag in that business. To be very clear, the international same-store sales comp for the last two weeks of Q1 and the first three weeks of Q2 was negatively impacted by COVID-19. The negative impact primarily occurred from stores that had sales in a week, but we're were limited due to a service restriction, carryout and/or delivery and in some markets even dining restrictions, a part of the week temporary closure and/or a change in store hours. If a store was closed the entire week and had zero sales for that week however, it is not included in same-store sales definition or results. Moving on to retail sales for international. Retail sales, excluding FX were down 13.2% over the same time period, reflecting the many stores internationally that have been temporarily closed or have some other operating restriction, impacting sales. Turning now to our franchise partners. We have not provided widespread economic relief to our franchisees globally. While we acknowledge that this could change depending on the time period that this crisis persist and its overall impact on our results, we attribute our current situation to the underlying strength of our business model and the overall economics that our franchise partners have earned alongside of us over the past many years. The strength and resiliency of the Domino's brand has never been more evident. As Ritch discussed earlier, we are making significant investments in our team members and our communities during this time of crisis, including frontline bonuses, enhanced sick pay policies, community giving in partnership with our franchisees and investments in supply such as face coverings and gloves. We anticipate pressure on our Q2 earnings related to these investments of approximately $15 million. Based on trends we've seen to date, we also anticipate pressure on our Q2 earnings of an additional approximately $5 million related to lost revenues from our international franchise stores due to those temporary store closures. These are current estimates and are preliminary and could very likely change. We would also be remiss if we didn't comment on what we're seeing in the FX markets. If FX rates hold for the remainder of the year, we believe it could be a substantial headwind to 2020 cash flows and earnings of approximately $10 million. This current estimate is preliminary and could very likely change as foreign currency rates continue to fluctuate. Shifting now to cash and liquidity matters, we currently have more than $325 million in available cash and we note that our ongoing operations have provided positive net cash flow to the business during this crisis so far. Out of an abundance of caution, we have not repaid amounts on our variable funding notes and that cash is included in the available cash balance I just mentioned. We continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and we paid our shareholders our previously declared dividend on March 30. Additionally, earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a $0.78 per share dividend to be paid on June 30. Separately, we have not repurchased any shares under our authorized share repurchase program since the first week of January. As a reminder, we currently have $327 million remaining under our Board authorization for future repurchases. In closing, we remain in good shape financially and we will continue to closely monitor all aspects of our business as we operate in these uncertain times. We will continue to focus on doing the right thing for our team members and our communities today, while ensuring that we not only survive, but are best positioned to thrive coming out of this crisis tomorrow. Thank you again for joining the call today and I'll turn it back over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thank you, Jeff. I would now like to turn everyone's attention to our focus looking forward. Across the globe Domino's will remain steadfastly focused on the health and safety of our franchisees, team members and our customers. That is always priority one. We'll also remain focused on execution, service and value as we continue to navigate through these headwinds created by COVID-19. 2020 will continue to bring more uncertainty to the restaurant industry than any of us have ever experienced. And we do not have clear visibility into the duration and magnitude of the impact of this pandemic on our industry or our business and continue to assess each on an ongoing basis. We do expect that the sales impact will continue to vary greatly across the cities and communities in the U.S. and in our 90 markets around the world. Given general economic conditions, along with uncertain timing of the infection curve, the shelter and place orders, business interruptions, school and university closings and so many other factors make forecasting sales more difficult than ever. We do expect to see a significant impact on our store openings this year as construction and municipal permitting have slowed down dramatically during the crisis. We should have better visibility around unit growth in the months ahead. So given all of this, as noted in this morning's release, we are withdrawing our two to three year outlook for global retail sales growth, U.S. same-store sales growth, international same-store sales growth and global net unit growth. I want to be clear, do not mistake that as a lack of optimism about the Domino's brand and our business looking forward. I remain very optimistic about the long-term growth and success of our brand. There is just too much uncertainty in the current operating and economic environment for us to provide an outlook at this time. In this uncertain environment, you can rest assured that we are carefully managing our balance sheet, cash flow and all areas of the business to ensure that we are doing what we believe will help us best manage through the near-term and as always position ourselves for long-term success. We are committed as a brand and as a system to managing through COVID-19 and to emerging even stronger in the future. I have extraordinary confidence in our franchisees and in our teams around the world. There is simply no group of people that I would rather stand beside than the approximately 350,000 individuals that wear the Domino's logo. I am proud and I'm grateful to serve them each and every day. And now Jeff and I will be happy to take some of your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is now open.
Brian Bittner: I know that there is a lot of moving pieces when we look at short windows on your comps. But your trends to start 2Q have clearly seen this measurable improvement versus 1Q and I appreciate the color that you gave, Jeff in your prepared remarks on what you're seeing from a day part perspective, etcetera. But can you unpack this recent improvement is a little more for us? What do you think has clearly changed recently that's driving the positive impact on your business? I know the underlying restaurant industry has gotten a little bit better than the last several weeks, but I just wouldn't expect there to be a huge factor for you guys. So, any additional color like maybe stimulus impacts or anything else that you can provide on recent trends will be helpful.
Ritch Allison: Brian, it's Ritch. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think there are several things that we're seeing in recent weeks. And again, it is a very dynamic situation that we're all living in. But certainly, I think some of the improvement results from the fact that there was a lot of pantry loading that consumers did as the pandemic really first started to come to the U.S. And I think as we've seen in some of our Asian markets in particular that were more on the front end of this. As time goes forward, people start to get a bit tired of cooking and eating the same thing, some of the pantry loading that they've done, it starts to bleed down a bit over time. I also think we, and I suspect the rest of the industry, probably are seeing some near-term impact here from some of the stimulus dollars that have gone out. So there are some factors that I would characterize as being more outside of our control, but then I think that there are some things that are inside of our control. And if you've taken a look at what we've done as a brand over the course of the last three or four weeks, we have pivoted very quickly to implement contactless delivery and carry out procedures across our system to protect our team members and also to give our customers confidence in the experience that they will have with us. We pivoted our advertising quite significantly to focus on those important cues, which are very important to customers right now to have a safe and pleasurable food experience for their families. So, Brian, I think a combination of some factors outside of our control, but I think also some things that we're doing here at Domino's as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
Matt DiFrisco: Jeff, can you speak a little bit about those charges, I guess, or the $15 million and the $5 million. I just want to understand how you're coming about with those? The math would suggest about 1,700 stores or so. It's closer to 15%, but you're lower than 10% on that sales head. So is it correct to assume that you're expecting leads to continue to open and not be closed to the full quarter in that estimation? And then also the $15 million, I guess, can you just sort of bracket that? I want to better understand that in the new normal that these costs wouldn't necessarily be an ongoing quarterly charge that it's mostly front line stuff and the bonuses, not necessarily new investments that are required in what maybe investors might perceive as a new normal?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. Thanks, Matt. I hope you're well and I appreciate the question. You know, the first thing I would just caution everyone on is we don't know what the new normal is going to be. The information that we shared with you today, it's preliminary, it's estimated and it's the best that we can give you right now. But we wanted to give you our best shot at what we're seeing kind of live. So I'll break it down in kind of the three big buckets that I talked about during my prepared remarks. The biggest bucket that we expect - again, we don't know yet, we're only four weeks into a 12-week quarter here so a lot build out to happen in an uncertain environment, is the $15 million related to do in the right thing for the safety and well-being of our team members, our customers and our communities. This is the 10 million slices of pizza, this is masks and gloves, this is bonus pay for our frontline team members in our stores and in our supply chain centers and it's just stuff that we're proud to be able to do and it's going to have a pretty significant impact and we're okay with that, it's the right thing to do. I'd then try and to get into the next bucket, which is the international business has been clearly impacted more on the whole than our singular market of the U.S. business, right. It's an average there, they are not new markets there. There are lots of different things going on, but as we look at the first four weeks in the quarter two and known that we have again eight weeks to go, our best guess is that we're going to take a haircut of about $5 million in royalties. It could be higher, it could be lower, it's preliminary, but it's super dynamic and that's what we're seeing today. The last thing we could argue it's COVID-related or maybe indirectly COVID-related, but it's just the impact of FX and that want to I gave you at least a preliminary view for the whole year, $10 million kind of year-over-year of a bad guy there, again preliminary, estimated, don't know if that's going to be the number. But when you add all three of those up, it's - as we look today, it's a $30 million headwind. Some of it within our control and we're proud to do, some of it kind of happened into us. So that's the best we can give you right now. We'll continue to assess whether we give any additional business updates between now and July. We're not promising anything today, but for sure you'll hear more detail from us in July and by then I'll tell you and Ritch will tell you exactly what happened for the four, 12 weeks of Q2.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris O'Cull of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Chris O'Cull: Ritch, does the Company still plan to launch a new product in 2020? And if so, is the timing changed at all?
Ritch Allison: Yes, we are still planning to launch new product in 2020. And still anticipating to do that in the summer time. Obviously managing through a different operating environment today as we were to make that happen, but we are still targeting summer for that launch.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Sara Senatore: I wanted to follow up on the business patterns you're seeing in the stronger weekday versus weekend. I guess my interpretation is that you're benefiting on the weekdays from people being at home more, but maybe weekends perhaps lower incomes are something of a headwind when to spend. So I was just hoping you could help me contextualize this whether you're seeing anything across different income cohorts and may be talk about in the past, the resilience of your category to when income, well, it's a little tricky, because I know you are in the midst of a turnaround back in '09, but just trying to understand could - to parse out what role is sort of lower income playing versus more of the sort of stay at home, shelter and play? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sarah, it’s Ritch, thanks for the question. Yes, we are still assessing this literally day by day. As these is these patterns continue to evolve quite rapidly and Jeff highlighted some of them. Higher sales growth during the week than on the weekends. And I think a lot of that is driven by the fact that there are more families at home during the week, eating together. And then on by daypart, our late night business is down significantly, while lunch and dinner are much better. There just aren't evening gatherings of people or sporting events to watch and things like that. So, certainly those are having some impact. We haven't seen any discernible patterns across income categories as you asked, but interestingly enough, order sizes are up significantly and I think that's because more people are at home eating together, but also we're finding at Domino's and I think some of our peers in the restaurant industry are finding, people are ordering extra food to have leftovers around also, which is a really interesting dynamic in the market today. But it's really early Sara and one of the things about this COVID-19 phenomenon is at least for a period of time, I think it's appending a lot of the patterns that we have historically seen in our business and broadly across the restaurant industry. So we are watching it every day, every minute of every day and responding and adapting as we go.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alex Slagle of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Alex Slagle: Just wanted to get your perspective on operations in the restaurants and discuss any potential issues with delays in delivery times or longer carryout turnaround times and inventory management stuff like that as demand's likely been a bit less predictable and more volatile.
Ritch Allison: Sure. I'm really proud Alex of our corporate stores and our franchisees who I think you've just done a tremendous job with their operations in responding to this crisis. As I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks, we've taken 60 years worth of standard operating procedures and we've had to rewrite a good many of them in just the last six weeks around contactless delivery and carryout, no sitting down and dining in our stores, our drive up carryout feature, which we've now been rolling out aggressively across the country. And our franchisees and corporate stores have responded and done a terrific job even despite the more recent increases in sales, they've done a very good job of continuing to provide high levels of safe and responsive service out there to our customers.
Operator: And our next question comes from Nick Setyan of Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.
Nick Setyan: You guys talked about obviously the near-term impact on unit openings. But could you maybe comment on the pipeline and medium to longer term what some of the chaos across the industry means or the domestic unit growth rates? We're already starting to hear much more favorable terms, better site selection and could that potentially mean a higher unit growth rate especially domestically in the medium to longer term for you guys?
Ritch Allison: Yes. Nick. So our unit growth here in the U.S. near term, it really is all about just the slowdown in construction and permitting in terms of the near-term slowdown in the openings. No fundamental changes as we look out over the medium to long term, in terms of the appetite of franchisees to open stores in the U.S. Stores over the medium and long-term are going to open based on strong unit level economics as they always have. Certainly, we are taking a look as we look out through the remainder of the year and into next, and trying to assess what incremental opportunities might be available because of some of the changing dynamics in the real estate market and whether or not that means some sites are - may become available that weren't before or also some opportunities potentially around how we think about lease extensions and rent opportunities going forward. It has been a pretty tight real estate market for a while now and we don't know exactly how much that's going to open up, but our guess is that it probably does open up a bit as we look out in the medium to long term.
Operator: And our next question comes from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Your line is now open.
Peter Saleh: I just wanted to ask about the pizza, I guess, landscape right now as you guys see it. I know 50% or so of the category is still run by many of the independents, while you guys are the leaders and you've been taking share. I'm sure to see if anecdotally at least that you guys are seeing any closures in some of the markets or some pressure on the independents, they feel like you're taking the share or do you feel like the pizza category in general is fairly healthy at this point and the sales of the sales lift that you're seeing is kind of being reflected across the entire category?
Ritch Allison: Yes, it is still really early to tell because we don't know. When we take a look across the restaurant landscape, there are a lot of restaurants out there that are not open right now. And we don't know how many of those honestly are temporary and how many of those will turn into permanent closures. And I tell you know, I did a lot of independent restaurants out there so I think the last thing any of us in the industry want to see is a lot of independent restaurant closures. We do - here at Domino's, we do believe that we are a pretty resilient brand. In a time like this, I think the positioning that we have as delivery and carryout player has certainly helped us in the early part of this crisis. And I think will continue to help us because I don't think consumers are going to snap right back to the old patterns and behaviors. I think the capability that we're building in contactless delivery and contactless carryout I think are going to continue to be important for many months to come, when we think about how this ultimately evolves. So as we think about the capabilities that we're putting in place today, it's not just to be competitive in the next couple of months. It really is to set ourselves up in what may end up being the new normal in our industry.
Operator: And our next question comes from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Lauren Silberman: A point that you just made, you said contactless delivery will be something that will be available permanently. And then contactless delivery changed the economics of the delivery transaction or productivity and turnaround plans at all? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: So, yes Lauren, right now contactless delivery is the only type of delivery that we do in the U.S. We've actually made it mandatory across the country. And I do think that even at a point if we pull back on that and no longer mandate it, we are still going to offer it to the customer, because I think for some extended period of time, there is going to be some portion of the customer base that is going to want that contactless experience in delivery and/or in the carryout side of the business. As it relates to the economics around contactless, we have - we've just rolled out an innovation we call the Pizza Pedestal, which is a pretty simple cardboard pedestal so that our delivery experts don't put your pizza directly on the ground or on some other surface that we don't know if it's been cleaned or not. So there are some minor costs associated with things like that. In addition to the actual physical operation of contactless, I'm also incredibly proud of our technology and innovation teams who have rapidly moved to bring that contactless experience to the customers' handheld device or however they choose to order from us. And that includes some rapid innovation also to make tipping of our delivery experts easier and more prominent in the ordering experience, because the last thing that we want to see come out of this is any of our delivery experts to see a decline in income as customers move away from cash transactions and more toward digital and either credit or debit card transactions.
Operator: And then a question comes from Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Gregory Francfort: Just personal clarification, did you say China is running positively in recent weeks? I wasn't clear with I guess that description. And then in the U.S., are you seeing any differences regionally or urban versus suburban that are standing out in terms of how customers are using the brand or sales trends? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure, Greg. So on China, we did see a pattern early on in the pandemic where China sales were pressured, but we have seen positive sales in China and improvement in the latter part of the first quarter and in here into the early weeks of the second quarter. And I got to tell you I am incredibly proud of our team in China. Much of what we are doing across our 17,000 store footprint was based on innovations around contactless delivery that our team in China brought forward. So really, really proud of not only their business performance, but also how they have contributed to our system. And then in terms of regional differences, the answer is yes. We've seen all kinds of differences and it really is based on how this pandemic has moved across the country with the pace of that movement and the severity of its impact in different places. If you turn the news on, we all see that there are certain places that have been significant hotspots for COVID-19. We've seen some places peak and start to level out, while others ramp up and most certainly those have impacted some of the trends in our business performance in those geographies. And it's still - as we sit here on 23rd April, it's still an evolving situation in many of the communities that we serve. There is also some very significant differences as I'm sure you all are aware, just in terms of how states and local municipalities have responded to the crisis and what restrictions they have put in place in terms of what business can be conducted and what customers can do in terms of travel and other things in those states.
Operator: And our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is now open.
David Tarantino: I hope everyone is doing well. My question, Ritch, is on the international business. It's really kind of two parts to it. First is related to how they're managing through are the ones that are seeing large or widespread closures. How they're managing through that from a financial perspective? And do you see signs of strength or stress in the system related to that? And then secondly and relatedly is just the outlook for unit growth internationally with all the stress that appears to be occurring in the system, do you think we will see a moderation for time being as they work through this?
Ritch Allison: Yes, David, on the first part of your question. I think going into this, we are really fortunate to be in a place where we've got a significant amount of our international business there is managed by a publicly traded master franchisees who came into this crisis with very strong financial positions so - relative to perhaps some other brands' strong ability to weather a crisis like this. Now that said, most certainly, when - in a country, when you have to close all of your stores or close some substantial number or even in some places, as Jeff described, our stores are open, but with very limited trading hours, or very limited service methods, those do result in significant declines in retail sales for a period of time. Our master franchisees are doing all the things that you would expect them to do. They are prioritizing first and foremost the safety of their team members and their customers, but they are also taking the appropriate steps to manage cash appropriately and to manage - make sure that they're being mindful of the liquidity in their operations. They are also working really hard to get those stores reopened and we've already seen a couple of large international markets. Spain and France would be two where we were completely closed for a period of time, but have begun to reopen stores in each of those countries. We are staying very actively in touch with those international master franchisees and talking with them daily about their financial position. And we'll continue to do so as we work together through the course of this crisis. The second part of your question around unit growth most certainly in the near term, we will see an impact on unit growth. Much as I described in the U.S., where there are construction delays and there are permitting delays, the same holds true in many of the international markets. And then certainly in some of those markets that have been under more pressure, where we've had a significant number of store closures or the entire market shuttered, certainly that results in some near-term slowdown in store growth there. But over the long term, I come back to what I always talk about with you is that the unit economics will ultimately drive the store growth over time. And as we come out of this COVID-19 crisis which, I believe we will do with a very healthy brand around the world, my expectation is that we still have a significant opportunity to grow our brand footprint across the globe. As you know, we've got a lot of share growth opportunity outside the U.S., and we've got well capitalized and well managed master franchisees who are going to be eager to get back after that as this subsides.
Operator: And our next question comes from James Rutherford of Stephens & Company. Your line is now open.
James Rutherford: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Just one from me. I'm curious, Jeff if you can share how much of the U.S. sales mix prior to COVID-19 was related to large group orders for parties have been meetings and the like and I ask that because I assume those occasions have gone down dramatically, which makes the improvement in your other kinds of orders, more impressive to drive that 7% comp here in the first four weeks of the second quarter?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, James. Thanks for the question. We're trying to be as transparent as we can and I've given you guide, the peek into the consumer behavior at least during the first four weeks of Q2 here, but the insights aren't anymore fancies and kind of related out already. You can imagine that people that used to get around television to watch your favorite sporting event, those orders aren't there. If you are ordering in your sheltered in home with your family, those orders are larger, because you might be looking for some leftovers for the next couple of days. If you had an occasion that you'd buy pizza for the folks that you work with in an office building, those occasions are gone. So it's - it really is no more complicated than that, although I will still tell you it is early in this crisis. We just don't know how that consumer behavior will ebb and flow as we continue through this and get out of this. But what I can tell you as Ritch just alluded to is, we believe that the global pizza industry is super resilient. People are going to want to eat Pizza before, during and after this crisis. And there is no one better positioned with our franchise partners around the world to hopefully fill that demand than we do. So, we'll be there for all the occasions. We'll continue to more of our standard operating procedures as Ritch talked about to make sure that we give the consumers what they want now and in the future. Again being vertically integrated in tech, having real innovative business partners around the world give us a huge advantage versus a lot of the other competitors in the industry. So, we feel like if anybody can get it done, we can get it done and we're going to continue to put our customers first, our team members safe in all that we do.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
John Glass: How many of the customer visits you're seeing recently are coming from new customers or lapsed users? And what are you doing to maybe capitalize on that opportunity to get new customers? Are you incenting them to sign up in the loyalty program in a different way and maybe any metrics around that loyalty growth during this period of time would be helpful? Thanks.
Jeff Lawrence: Sure, John. We absolutely are seeing an uptick in new customers, and I'll talk about it on a couple of dimensions. You know, I am sure you know that we are seeing some folks trying us for the first time or trying us again just given the availability of restaurants and food types out there. We're getting, a shot with some customers that may be weren't doing business with us before. Also what we're seeing is we are getting new digital customers as well. The digital percentage of our business has ticked up pretty significantly in the last several weeks. I think I reported to you, for the fourth quarter, we touched 70% digital in recent weeks, we're running at 75%. And we've had at least one week where we were over 80% digital. So, that's also another benefit we're seeing is that customers are coming to that digital channel as we go into this contactless space that we're in. And we are absolutely actively working to - for that - we got the first order from that customer to get the second digital order and for those customers that are ordering digitally, actively working to migrate them to our Piece of the Pie Rewards loyalty platform as well. So, it's still early john. But certainly, we are seeing some opportunities with customers that we didn't have in the previous couple of months, leading up to COVID-19.
Operator: And our next question comes from Chris Carril of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Chris Carril: I wanted to ask about aggregators and specifically any updated thoughts on how the current environment will shift the competitive dynamic in delivery? So with the rising demand for off-premise here, is there any more opportunity for Domino's to highlight its value positioning, especially in a more pressured macro environment?
Ritch Allison: Sure, Chris. Well, one thing I could tell you is in the current environment we're operating in I am so glad that we are not on these aggregator platforms as Domino's. When I think about what matters to our customers, the trust and knowing how that food, where it was prepared and who delivered it to them. It certainly comforts me needs to know that it is our uniformed and trained Domino's delivery experts that are bringing the food to the door in a time like this. I'm also very glad that we've made the decision over time to continue to own that customer relationship on the front end, particularly now that we're talking about 70 - run rate of 75% plus digital. We think even more than ever that it is critical for us to continue to own that digital relationship with the customer as well. That said, certainly in the current environment with virtually all restaurants closed to dine in, there are lots and lots of customers that are trying delivery for the first time, and many of them through the aggregators. So this is going to be a very dynamic environment as we look over the months ahead. And ultimately to all learn what ultimately sticks in terms of these changes in customer behavior because my guess is customers don't immediately go back to what they were doing before. In that environment, we're staying focused on the things that we know are so important to the business for the long term, on value, staying very focused on value, staying committed to our delivery and our carryout value offers. We're also remaining very focused on service. One of the things that is happening right now across the Domino's U.S. business is the very aggressive hiring of additional delivery experts. The labor market has been incredibly tight for a couple of years. As that has loosened up in recent weeks, we've just sensed announcing our effort to hire 10,000 team members in the U.S. - our corporate store business has hired 100 people in that limited period of time. And that is really a key element of how we continue to provide great service to our customers during this time. And then staying out on the forefront of safety through all of these contactless methods through the enhanced cleaning of our stores, we've changed from operational audits to safety awareness, visits during this time. So, we believe all of those actions will continue to position us well as we move forward through this crisis and into the time period beyond.
Operator: And our next question comes from Katherine Fogertey of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Katherine Fogertey: I mean if you can comment, you mentioned a little bit about the 10,000 delivery expert hiring, if you could give a number of how many the whole system has hired and if you've seen any change in turnover either positive or negative at the stores given the current environment. And on that point wanted to get your thoughts on how you view your benefit package and the fact that you employ your drivers with a competitive advantage vis-à-vis the aggregators? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Sure. Katy. So on the 10,000 folks that we're trying to hire across the system, we don't have perfect visibility into our franchisee hiring, because that really is their job, their team members to hire and to train. But what I can tell you from the conversations that we have is that the applicant volume has increased significantly since we began that effort. And unfortunately we just saw the another 4.5 million file for unemployment this morning. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people out there that are out of work right now. And I am certain that that is contributing to the increased applicant flow that's coming into our stores. As I think about what our value proposition is relative to someone working in the gig economy. I think now in an environment where so many people are losing their jobs having a set schedule and having a job getting a W-2 from Domino's or from one of the Domino's franchisees I think is probably valued probably more than it has been in quite a long time. We've tried to make a very strong commitment to our corporate store team members that's drivers and everybody in the store with enhanced bonuses over a 10-week period as folks worked through this crisis we've been have enhanced our sick pay benefits during that time as well. So, we are also looking for opportunities here in the near term, but then also over the long term to continue to make that a very attractive employment opportunity. And then finally, we've talked about it so many times. Well over 90% of our U.S. franchisees started off as delivery drivers or folks working inside the stores and that's a career opportunity that is out there that just isn't available and the gig economy.
Katherine Fogertey: And then just my question around turnover. Are you seeing turnover so up, be flat or go down in the stores? Maybe if you can just comment on the Company's stores here.
Ritch Allison: Katy, we haven't seen any major shifts in turnover. It's still a really short period of time that we've been in this crisis. So, we'll probably know more in the months ahead as things continue to unfold there.
Operator: And our next question comes from Alton Stump of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Alton Stump: Thank you most of my questions have been asked, but just sort of just going to follow up on last couple of your answers Ritch. Is there an opportunity on the labor cost front for savings? You've given the fact that there are obviously, to your point, an awful lot of people especially in the restaurant industry that are looking for work currently. Is that an opportunity potentially for you guys and/or your franchisees to kind of bring the average cost down a little bit on labor front?
Ritch Allison: Alton, it's Ritch. We're going to ask you to - your line was breaking up a little bit. If you could just slow down just a little bit and repeat that question. We just want to make sure I think Jeff and I heard about 60% of it.
Alton Stump: Okay, sorry about that. I was just asking if there is an opportunity kind of labor cost front to save money given the fact that there obviously are a lot of people at your point, especially in the restaurant industry that are looking for work currently?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, Alton, thanks for repeating that. You know I want to be very clear and we want to be very clear that this crisis is not a time to lower the rates that we pay our valuable team members, and we don't think that way, our franchisees don't think that way. If anything we want to employ more people and as Ritch mentioned, we're paying a bonuses, we're paying them more. You know I'm a finance guy, I would think about efficiencies and things like that, but right now, quite frankly, it's not about that. For us it's about continuing to run as an essential service taking a very seriously hiring more people paying them more actually right now, giving people more jobs, that's really what we're focused on. We're proud of all of the small role that we are playing, keeping people employed and FAD. And we'll leave it for another data to get efficient on any kind of labor rate stuff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan, your line now open. And John Ivankoe, if your line is on mute, please unmute. And again our next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Our next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Jon Tower: Great hope, you can hear me okay. Just a couple of quick ones from me. Ad budgets are down across the restaurant space as a whole, but also all the advertising dollars seem to be pivoting towards this off-premise or delivery channel. So can you talk about how you're managing through communicating to consumers that you're valued there that and frankly breaking through to consumers in this time when everybody seems to be focused on this one channel? And then just pivoting to the U.S. unit growth. I'm curious if you could talk about - you mentioned the health of the franchise community is very strong coming into this crisis. And we're taking a pause, right now, but is there any reason to believe that you can't ramp growth faster on the back end, particularly rents are going to be lower and/or you see some independent store closures at the end of this whole crisis? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Thanks, Jon. On your first question around the advertising spend out there in the market. We look at a couple of things around that as we think about it. One is we view it absolutely as a time to continue to lean in hard on getting our voice out there. So, we're not pulling back one bit on advertising during this. And frankly, one of the things as you look broadly across not just restaurants, but across all of the folks out there that spend a lot of money on advertising, there's been a heavy demand out there for a lot of the same customers that we want to reach. And therefore GRP delivery has been little spotty out there in the marketplace over the course of the last couple of years. We expect that we may see some benefit in that and just getting the full delivery of the GRPs that we want to buy anyway. And then as it relates to share of voice within the category, most certainly all of the spend out there wallets, some of it's come down overall. It really is focused on this - on the delivery channel. We've just got to continue to invest against it. We've got to continue to talk about value, to talk about service, to talk about safely serving our customers. And I am really proud of our advertising team. I mean they have pivoted so quickly. And if you look back over the last six weeks or so they produced about an ad a week. Normally we go through a much more prolonged cycle to produce advertising. So we're trying to stay very nimble and we've just got a terrific team that is that's making that happen for us. And then your second part of your question was around U.S. unit growth. We're certainly assessing what the back end of the crisis opportunity might be. Ultimately as I talk about all the time, the unit growth is going to be driven by the cash on cash returns at the unit level and how our franchisees view the economics. I can tell you that for our corporate store business, I would love to accelerate and go even faster. And if there are opportunities to do that, we are most certainly going to.
Operator: And our next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
John Ivankoe: Okay, first a clarification and then a follow-up on the theme we've been talking about. First, you mentioned increased transaction size a number of different times. I mean can you comment on same-store transactions and delivery same-store transactions and carryout. I mean it does sound like we got some outsize ticket gain, just wanted to see what was happening in terms of transaction count.
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, John. So again, very early, very dynamic, but as we look as we looked at period for the increase that we reported the 7.1% for the entire U.S. system, that's more ticket certainly than it was orders. But the important thing to remember here in this new environment is that the ticket part of the overall comp includes way more food now in the same order. So, when you think about - an order used to be in order, well now in orders kind of more than an order because people are - people looking to put some stuff in their zip lock bag. So again, early we're giving you as much as we can, trying to be as transparent as we can. But it's larger orders is what we're seeing so far and we're happy to get that to you in a safe contactless way.
John Ivankoe: Yes, definitely and it would make sense to amortize some delivery fees as well so that would make sense from many different perspectives. And then secondly we have, I guess, the economic situation that many of us would have never anticipated where a number of people will make more money on unemployment for four months being at home than they would actually working in a lot of different cases. So I wanted to ask this from here from two perspectives. One, if you are seeing kind of a pickup from a consumer perspective and maybe the type of consumer that would be benefiting economically from a weekly basis of basically not working versus working? And then secondly, if there is a way to comment on it appropriately, has that influenced or do you think it might influence on the margin your ability to attract employees that what you might offer them might not be equivalent to their state plus federal unemployment benefits?
Ritch Allison: John, it's Ritch. On the first part of the question, really too early and would be hard to tell. I suspect that the stimulus that was just released out there is probably having more impact than the unemployment benefits thus far. Yes, that you just described in terms of money going into consumers' pockets, which they could choose to spend with us or with others. And then the second part of your question around does it make it harder to hire folks? We tried to lean into that a bit. As we mentioned a couple of times earlier for 10 weeks in our corporate stores and in our supply chain business, we've got bonuses for our hourly team members and also for our store managers as well. And we've done that first and foremost to say thank you to them for continuing to serve our customers in what is a relatively crazy time. But also we recognize that we've got to continue to earn their loyalty to work for us as there are other alternatives potentially out there as you described. So haven't seen any, pullback there. And as I mentioned earlier, we've actually seen a very significant increase in applicant flow because even with those near-term unemployment benefits, I think a lot of folks are looking beyond that into August and September. The months beyond the expiration of those benefits and I think I want to make sure that they've got a job, when they get to that point in time.
John Ivankoe: It definitely makes sense, Ritch and maybe as a couple of quarters ago, maybe the second quarter of '19, we talked about delivery service times and just overall delivery metrics. I think you touched on it a number of different times this call, but on an apples-to-apples basis, where are we in terms of delivery metrics at this point time to household order accuracy just the things that are not necessarily health and safety-related, but just the call it the old fashioned core of the way you guys used to measure yourself?
Ritch Allison: Sure. So yes, John, as I've mentioned before, we didn't get a lot better from '17 to '19 on delivery times, but started to see some improvement there. And particularly I'm really proud of our corporate store business, where we've seen a good bit of improvement with a lot of focus around delivery times and look we've got some franchisees out there that are averaging every week under 20 minutes delivery time. So there are a lot of really strong proof points out there across our system. The data, like the data in every other aspect of our business, can be pretty choppy here with - in this COVID-19 time. And a lot of that gets driven by the fact that we see these shifts across days and across dayparts when we and a lot of our franchisees are still working really hard to figure out those new patterns and make sure we've got delivery driver schedules balanced appropriately against them. So, what I can tell you is the system is very focused on service. We're making some improvements there and we are bringing safety to the forefront does not - it does not mean that we're not also focused on those service times because we do know that's going to be a critical way that we'll continue to grow our business and compete against the aggregators.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Ritch, you talked about in your prepared remarks the independents and the existential crisis the industry is facing and obviously the impact of the future. So it seems like you would have good insights into more the independent side of things and each of your franchisees. In many ways is more of a mom and pop, but your comps are clearly solidly positive. So I was wondering how you think about the independents survival with comps down significantly, whether it's within pizza or just thinking more broadly as a restaurant CEO, the ability for them to keep their doors open for an extended period and kind of survival whether that would help the industry supply-demand imbalance that people have been talking about for years? Any thoughts on kind of the broader industry and the independents' ability to survive would be great.
Ritch Allison: Yes Jeff, I'll stay fairly brief on that. Restaurant business is a tough business and there are a lot of restaurants out there that were struggling even before this crisis got here as labor rates have increased significantly across the country. And so, I think there is a lot of pain in the industry right now as folks - a number of independents came into it, not particularly strong going in, but now being faced with this existential crisis. So, certainly as someone who has been in the restaurant industry for a long time and someone who loves to eat out, I sure hope independents to survive because the - I think all of us here want to be able to go to an independent restaurant. We want to be able to go to a Domino's Pizza, we want to be able to go to an independent restaurant as well.
Operator: And our next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen. Your line is now open.
Andrew Charles: Most of my questions have been asked, but Ritch, I totally understand the fluidity of upcoming development that leads you to suspend the two to three year outlook. But just to be clear, is the target for 25,000 global locations by 2025 still on the table, just given your continued optimism on the long term and the potential for the unit developments you've made up kind of past the next two to three years?
Ritch Allison: Yes, Andrew. Thank you for asking that question. Absolutely, I still have great optimism around our 25,000 store target. The brand came into this crisis in a very healthy place with strong growth momentum. We're going to work our way through this, but I still have a ton of optimism about the long-term health and growth of Domino's Pizza.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ritch Allison for any closing remarks.
Ritch Allison: Thank you. Thanks everyone for joining us on the call this morning. It's an incredibly dynamic time in our business and across the industry, but if I could leave you with one thing this morning, it is that I, and our management team and our franchisees at Domino's Pizza have a great deal of optimism around the future of our brand. One of the things that I've had a front-row seat to for the last six weeks or so is the incredible resiliency, the incredible innovative spirit, the hustle the passion of our Domino's Pizza franchisees and team members around the world. So while a difficult time for all of us, I sit here today never more optimistic about this great brand. So, again appreciate you being with us. And Jeff and I look forward to speaking with you in July as we will then discuss our second quarter 2020 results.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-20 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 Domino’s Pizza Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Tim McIntyre, EVP of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Tim McIntyre: Thanks, Katherine, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today about the results of our fourth quarter and full year 2019. Today's call will feature CEO, Ritch Allison, who will be joined by Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence. As you know this call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others to be in listen-only mode throughout the call. In the unlikely event that any forward-looking statements are made, I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement you can find in this morning’s release, the 8-K and the 10-K. We will start with prepared comments from CFO, Jeff Lawrence and then from CEO Ritch Allison followed by analysts questions. As always we ask that you limit yourself to one part question this morning. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff Lawrence.
Jeff Lawrence: Thank you, Tim, and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued as we delivered solid results for our shareholders. We continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 35 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 104 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continued to increase our global store count at a healthy pace as we opened nearly 500 net new stores in Q4. Our diluted EPS in Q4 was $3.12, an increase of 19.1% over the prior year quarter, primarily resulting from strong operational results. As previously disclosed, we also completed a $675 million recapitalization transaction in Q4, increasing our leverage to match our growing business and locking in a long-term favorable fixed interest rate which lowered our cost of capital. We also returned nearly $650 million of cash to shareholders during Q4 comprised of share buybacks and dividends. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q4. Global retail sales grew 6.9% as compared to the prior year quarter pressured by a stronger dollar. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency global retail sales grew by 7.6%. This global retail sales growth was driven by both an increase in the average number of stores opened during the quarter and higher same-store sales. Same-store sales for the U.S. grew 3.4% lapping a prior year increase of 5.6% and same-store sales for our international business grew 1.7% rolling a prior year increase of 2.4%. Breaking down in the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 3.3%, while our company owned stores were up 3.9%. The U.S. comp this quarter was driven by both ticket and to a lesser extent order growth. Both our delivery and carry out businesses continued to grow overall. And our carry outcome continues to grow at a particularly impressive rate. Our delivery comp was positive in Q4 and up sequentially over Q3 demonstrating resilience in the highly competitive food delivery marketplace. Our international comp for the quarter was also driven by both order and ticket growth. On the unit count front, we opened 141 net U.S. stores in the fourth quarter consisting of 146 store openings and five closures. Our international division added 351 net new stores during Q4, comprised of 382 store openings and 31 closures. We opened 1,106 units in 2019, an acceleration over 2018 which we believe demonstrates the broad and enduring strength of our four wall economics combined with the efforts of the best franchise partners in the restaurant industry. Turning to revenues, total revenues for the fourth quarter were up 6.3% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher U.S. franchise retail sales and higher international retail sales which drove higher supply chain and global franchise revenues. The increase in international royalty revenues was partially offset by an $800,000 negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies. These increases were also partially offset by lower company owned store revenues resulting from the previously disclosed sale of the 59 corporate stores in our New York market to existing franchisees during the second quarter of 2019. Moving on to operating margin, as a percentage of revenues consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 38.9% from 38.2% in the prior year quarter and was positively impacted by the New York store sale and higher revenues from our global franchise business. Supply chain operating margin was down 0.1 percentage points year-over-year while our company owned store operating margin was up 1.3 percentage points year-over-year driven primarily by the New York store sale. G&A cost decreased approximately $2 million as compared to the prior year quarter. G&A was benefited by the New York store sale and a pretax gain of approximately $2 million on the sale of three company owned stores to existing franchisees in Q4. These decreases were partially offset by higher performance based compensation. Our reported effective tax rate was 17.8% for the quarter up 0.8 percentage points from the prior year quarter. The reported effective tax rate in the quarter included a 3.8 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective patch rate related to tax benefits on equity-based compensation. When you add it all up, our fourth quarter net income was up $17.7 million or 15.8% over the prior year quarter. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $3.12 versus $2.62 in the prior year, which was a 19.1% increase. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS as adjusted for our 2019 recapitalization transaction was $3.13, which was a 19.5% increase versus the prior year. Here's how that $0.51 increase breaks down. Lower diluted share count resulting primarily from share repurchases over the past 12 months benefited us by $0.08. Higher net interest expense resulting primarily from a higher average outstanding debt balance resulting from the 2019 recapitalization negatively impacted us by $0.03. Our higher effective tax rate negatively impacted us by $0.02 and most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.48. Transitioning for a second from Q4 to the full year, I would like to hit on a few financial highlights for 2019. In a more challenging and dynamic competitive environment, we were able to grow our global retail sales 8% when holding currencies constant, same-store sales for the U.S. grew 3.2% and same-store sales for our international division grew 1.9%. We also opened our 17,000 store globally during 2019. Our continued sales growth and improved discipline around our G&A investments led to healthy growth in our diluted EPS year-over-year and strong and consistent free cash flow generation. We are pleased with our performance for the year, including our ability to continue to fund critical strategic investments while driving efficiencies throughout the business. Now turning to cash. During full year 2019, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of nearly $0.5 billion. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of $411 million, which was a 50% increase over our 2018 free cash flow. On average that is more than $1 million in free cash flow generated per day, which we believe demonstrates our outstanding financial model and performance. We also completed a recapitalization transaction in Q4, which included the issuance of $675 million of new 10-year fixed rate notes with a 3.668% pre-tax interest rate. We are very pleased to have locked in as additional low rate debt well into the future. Our strong free cash flow generation and net proceeds from our recapitalization transaction allowed us to continue our long-term commitment of returning cash to shareholders during 2019. For the full year, we repurchased and retired approximately 2.5 million shares for $699 million or $280 per share on average, including $594 million repurchased in Q4. We also repurchased an additional $80 million worth of shares in Q1 of 2020 as we have exhausted the net proceeds from the recapitalization. As a reminder, we now have approximately $327 million remaining under our board authorized share repurchase program. For the full year, we also returned to $106 million to our shareholders in the form of $0.65 quarterly dividends, including two dividend payments totaling $52 million that were paid during fiscal Q4. On average, during 2019 we have not only generated more than $1 million per day in free cash flow, but when you add share repurchases and dividends together, on average, we have also returned more than $2 million per day to our shareholders or $805 million in total. As we move into 2020, we are pleased that our Board of Directors just yesterday declared a quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share, an increase of 20% over the previous quarter's dividend. Before I turn it over to Ritch, we would like to remind you of the 2020 annual outlook items that we communicated in mid-January. First I would like to remind everyone that 2020 is a 53 week fiscal year. We currently projected the store food basket within our U.S. system will be up 1% to 3% as compared to 2019 levels. We estimate that the impact of foreign currency on royalty revenues in 2020 as compared to 2019 could be flat to negative $5 million. We expect growth CapEx investments to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million as we continue to increase supply chain capacity as well as invest in technological innovation. We expect our G&A expense to be in the range of $400 million to $405 million based on a 53 week fiscal year. Keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down depending on among other things our performance versus our plan as that affects variable performance based compensation expense as well as other areas such as corporate store advertising. Overall, our solid consistent momentum continued and we are pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. We will remain focused on relentlessly driving the brand forward and providing great value to all of our stakeholders including customers, franchisees, team members, shareholders and the communities we serve. Thanks for joining the call today and now I'll turn it over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thanks Jeff, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. On the call this morning, I'd like to do a few things. First, I'll share some reflections on our performance during the quarter and for 2019 in total across both our U.S. and our international businesses. And then, I'll discuss some of the things that we're focused on as we look forward into 2020. Following that as always, we'll be happy to take some Q&A. So with that as our roadmap for this morning, let's get started with our U.S. business. I am extremely proud of the commitment and the passion demonstrated by our U.S. franchisees, not just during the quarter, but throughout all of 2019. As we discussed on prior calls, 2019 marked an unprecedented acceleration of competitive activity across restaurant delivery. It was a year where our alignment and our focus as a system was more important than ever as we fought back against a new group of competitors that we believe we're not bound by the constraints or requirements associated with running a profitable business model. While delivery grew rapidly across the restaurant landscape as we reviewed a variety of third-party industry research, we saw no observable inflection in restaurant industry transactions. Now certainly some players benefited with incremental customer occasions, but many more restaurant brands who aggressively pursued delivery produced flat or declining traffic. With that as a backdrop, the alignment and unified focus of the Domino's system really shine through as we continued to grow at a faster pace than the restaurant industry and took meaningful share within our pizza category. We delivered our 35th consecutive quarter and tenth consecutive year of positive same-store sales in the U.S. During the quarter, I was also pleased to see the sequential improvement in the comp versus our Q3 results. U.S. retail sales grew at 6.8% for the quarter and 6.9% for the year, significantly faster than the restaurant industry. And while same-store delivery orders were slightly negative for the year, overall, U.S. delivery order account increased 1% in 2019. Carryout growth was strong throughout the year and was driven by traffic. Our carryout order count was 3.9% positive during 2019 on a same-store basis and 8.1% positive in total across the U.S. system. Store growth was also once again a significant contributor to our retail sales growth in the U.S. Our franchisees both new and existing alike continued to invest in their businesses resulting in 250 net new stores for the year. During the fourth quarter, we also passed the 6,000 store milestone in the U.S. As we look back over the last five years, we have opened over 1000 net new stores in the U.S. And this kind of sustained growth only happens with strong unit level economics. Those economics also drove a remarkably low level of store closures. In 2019, we closed 15 stores in the U.S. and over the last five years we closed fewer than 100 stores in total across the U.S. business. I'm going to repeat that one. Fewer than 100 stores in total across the last five years have been closed in our U.S. business. I'd also like to share a few highlights from our ongoing digital efforts. We reached a milestone in 2019 with 25 million active loyalty members. We now have 40 plus million enrolled in our program and over 85 million customers in our database. We ended the year at a run rate of 70% digital sales in our U.S. business. And our corporate store business, which is more concentrated in urban markets, hit a run rate of 75% digital sales in the final period of the year. Overall, we finished the year strong as evidenced by a good quarter of top-line sales growth. While we still have plenty of work to do and getting back to consistent traffic based comps order count in the fourth quarter showed sequential improvement in its contribution to the overall same-store sales mix. As we look back on the quarter, it does appear to us that while we see continued headwinds in delivery that are difficult to forecast, aggregator pressure appeared to level off on our delivery orders in Q4, while carryout traffic was outstanding during the quarter as our strategy to grow that business continues to pay off. You will always hear me say that we are an imperfect and a work in progress brand with plenty of areas to get better. But with that said, I'm happy with another strong year of growth and profitability for our franchisees and our operators. As I look ahead to 2020 in the U.S. business, I'd like to highlight a few areas of focus for us. First, we're going to continue to fortress our markets. Our strong four wall and enterprise profitability for franchisees should continue to position them well for continued growth. We continue to see favorability and key metrics for our fortress stores and territories as we compare them to our non-fortress territories. We see faster and more consistent service, lower delivery costs, better economics for our drivers and incremental carryout traffic. Fortressing will continue to drive overall store growth in 2020 including for our company owned markets where we plan to further accelerate our investment in store growth. We're also opening three new supply chain centers in 2020. We opened a new center in Winnipeg in January. Our Columbia, South Carolina center will open in the first half of the year. Our Katy Texas center will open in the second half and we're also adding a thin crust line to our existing Edison New Jersey supply chain center and that is also scheduled to open in the second half of 2020. We're also excited to deliver some new menu news this year and look for that to come this summer. Value's always top of mind for us as you know, more than ever as we navigate through the current landscape value matters and I'm pleased with our continued discipline and unquestioned position of value leadership within the QSR pizza segment. We're ramping up our focus on service in 2020. Getting our pizzas to our customers, hotter, fresher, and more consistently than ever before. Fortressing will help us position the business for success through tighter delivery zones, but that's only part of the battle. We're doubling down on training, communication and connection points with our operators. This is a very high priority for me in 2020. We'll also continue to roll out technology to our stores to help our operators get pizzas in the oven and out to our customers. Innovation has been and will remain a key investment area for us in 2020. We recently rolled out our GPS technology and it's already in use in over half of our U.S. stores. You may have seen the ad that we're running now highlighting our GPS technology with a really fun take on the movie Risky Business. Our Pie Pass technology is also in stores and went on air earlier this week. This brings personalization to the carryout customer greeting them by name on our digital menu boards. You may have seen Norm from Cheers in our commercials, if you've seen him, if you've been watching a little TV this week. We also continued to make progress in areas related to autonomous delivery. Dom order taking and other behind the curtain technologies that will help our store level talent operate more efficiently. Now the last focus area I want to highlight is franchisee profitability. Jeff shared our 2019 store level EBITDA estimate with you in January. And we'll share the final number with you on our earnings call in April, but we now expect to land more towards the high-end of the 136,000 to 139,000 per store range that Jeff shared with you in January. Now, while we are pleased that our unit level profitability and cash on cash returns remained strong by any comparison within the industry, we recognize that some of our franchisees are under intense cost pressure in their markets. The labor market is very tight right now and minimum wages continue to rise across the country. Fixed costs such as rents and insurance also continue to increase and a number of other above level -- above store level costs continue to bring added pressure. My team and I recognize these challenges and we remain intensely focused on helping to drive efficiency and profitability at the store and enterprise level for our franchisees just as we are for our corporate markets. So all in all, I'm happy with our U.S. performance in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. We will continue to play the long game and we will remain focused on what matters, the fundamentals, our franchisee health and making disciplined decisions. I'll move on to international now where we had another solid quarter of retail sales growth driven by unit growth, positive performance from our regions and a meaningful improvement in order growth relative to the first three quarters of the year. Same-store sales in our international business was positive for the 104th consecutive quarter. That's a remarkable 26 year run in this terrific business. Our 351 net store openings in the quarter and 856 for the full year, reflect a terrific unit level economics we continue to enjoy in many markets around the globe. We only closed 83 international stores for the full year on a base of almost 11,000 when you add that to our U.S. number, it's less than 100 closures for our 17,000 store global brands. And now for a few market highlights, we opened for the first time in three new countries, Bangladesh, the Czech Republic and Luxembourg welcoming these great new teams to the Domino's family. We passed the 17,000 store milestone globally and we hit some important milestones in several of our key markets I'd like to give a shout out to those teams now. 800 stores in Mexico, 500 in Canada, 400 stores in France, 300 each in Germany and Spain and we opened our 200th store in Russia. I also want to highlight the outstanding year we had in two of our emerging markets, China and Brazil. Both had breakout years in store grow with 80 net new stores in China and 60 net new stores in Brazil. Among our more established markets, Japan and India delivered exceptional growth, 117 net new stores in India surpassed 1300 total stores more than any other Domino's market outside the U.S. and an outstanding 92 net new stores in Japan surpassed 600 total in that market during 2019. Our teams in France, South Korea and the Netherlands celebrated their 30th anniversary as Domino's markets. And while we continue to address the opportunity for same-store sales improvement in international, our 9% retail sales growth, excluding the foreign currency impact during 2019 shows that our business is very healthy and fundamentally sound. We're actively working with our international partners to help reverse the recent softness in same-store sales in certain markets and that will be necessary to take an already outstanding business to new heights. So I continue to feel confident that our global terrific group of operators combined with our corporate support and best practice sharing will produce the desired results to help the international business reach its full potential. In closing, Domino's is now a $14 billion global brand with the vast majority of our stores owned and operated by an incredible collection of franchisees around the world. I'm proud of the way we continue to operate with passion and offer a homegrown opportunity for store team members to fulfill their dreams of business ownership as a Domino's franchisee. I'm proud of the way our franchisees are committed to be a number one in each of their respective neighborhoods. I'm proud of the way we continue to innovate aggressively across all aspects of our business, including GPS, e-bikes, AI in-store technology, great food, and an always evolving digital experience. That's second to none. I'm proud of our track record of profitable growth and our long standing commitment to franchisee economics. With a disciplined operating model and a focus on the long-term, we've demonstrated as a system that you don't have to choose between top-line growth and bottom line results, Domino's delivers both. And with that Jeff and I'll be happy to take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Brian Bittner: When I look at your 3.4% comp this quarter, it is impressive when you consider the marks -- the first acceleration in six quarters. And the fourth quarter's historically been a much tougher quarter for you. You touched on the driver of the acceleration this quarter being sequentially improving traffic. Can you dive into that a little bit more? Was that acceleration and traffic primarily driven from the leveling off of competitive delivery externally? Or would you call out anything internally like incremental loyalty or the change up in marketing that you did as driving the acceleration.
Ritch Allison: It's Ritch. Really a combination, but I think more driven by the things that we were proactively do it in the marketplace. So, as I, as I first look at the external side, we certainly still saw a lot of aggregator promotion and advertising activity out there, both, on your televisions but also digital. So while we felt like that leveled off a bit, you know, relative to Q3, the pressure was certainly still there and quite an intense. When I think about the things that we did proactively to drive the business and we discussed some of these things with you when you were here in September at our innovation garage. We launched our delivery insurance program in the fourth quarter, which really resonated with our customers. Our customers think about Domino's as a brand that is transparent and as a brand that takes accountability when we make mistakes. So this campaign resonated well with them. We also were promoting the carryout business throughout the quarter and in particular bringing to light the crust variety that we have on our menu. And that also resonated and drove terrific results on the carry outside of the business. As always, I'm also going to be transparent with you about some of the things that didn't work as well. We talked a lot about launching our late night promotional program and that did not drive a lot of incremental sales across the business in total, but in certain markets around the country was really effective. So we've dialed that back a bit overall but are using it now more selectively in some key markets around the country. So that's really how I look at it, Brian. External, kind of a lot of pressure still there, staying flat, but it'd be a lot of things we did internally, worked nicely in the quarter.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. And lastly, Jeff, your EBITDA growth basically grew twice as fast as your system sales growth in the fourth quarter. Is that mostly the product of a heavier focus on, on flow through or was there any unique benefits that happened in the quarter that we should be aware of? I know you talked about the small gain on refranchising, but anything else?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. So there was a little bit of a noise in the G&A that I mentioned in my prepared remarks around again on a couple stores sales. Certainly, the New York sale being done earlier in the year helped you a little bit on the G&A line, but make no mistake, we leaned in real heavy on additional financial discipline during 2019. And I think you see the flow through really coming through both in EBITDA and free cash flow. We were able to ratchet down CapEx a little bit more than we thought we were going to originally. But having said all that, I think the most important thing is that Ritch and the other leaders in the business, we still all invested in all the strategic initiatives that we really think will continue to drive the long game in the business. So we took advantage of where we thought there was opportunity. We squeezed it down a little bit, but the level of investment and the seriousness at which we will continue and have continued to invest in supply chain capacity, technological innovation and really a customer centered great experience that hasn't slowed down in 2019 and I don't think you'll see that slow down going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Matt DiFrisco: I appreciate all the color you guys are giving there on the digital and obviously carryout, it's been growing pretty fast. How should we think about that as far as -- is there, what percent of that -- how does 70% look like when you sort of break it out by either carryout delivery, presuming that the delivery probably skews a little higher and then carryout skews a little lower? Is there a way to use some technology in the store to try and drive digital for carryout as well?
Ritch Allison: Hey Matt, it's Ritch. So most certainly, the digital side of the business -- the delivery side of the business has a higher digital percentage mix then the carryout side of the business. And honestly, one of our objectives as we continue to grow carryout is to drive up that digital percentage. So, you may have seen our Pie Pass technology in the commercial, we started running on Monday of this week, in order to being greeted in the store and to expedite the process of picking up your pizza, you have to have ordered ahead of time digitally. And so that's one innovation that we're using to try to drive, more customer uptake on the digital side. There are other things that our teams are working on and investing in here. Because we do see that as a great opportunity to help us to continue to drive that business not only order count but also given us an opportunity for smarter upsells and other things that help us drive smart ticket in the business. So most certainly an opportunity for us going forward.
Matt DiFrisco: Excellent. And then could you also just give us an update you talked a lot in September about some of the new technologies, specifically the Houston test and the driverless cars. How is that going and is there any sort of, what's the timeline on that or the expansion of those tests perhaps?
Ritch Allison: Yes, so we are working hand in hand with Nuro on that. Matt as we talked about a bit in September, testing is going well so far. And I'm going down there personally this month to have a look at it myself but so far so good. And you may have seen, there was an announcement out within the last week or so around, some of the regulatory approvals that they received to conduct deliveries down in Houston. So we're excited about where we are with the partnership to-date and looking forward frankly to learning a lot from this and helping it shape our approach to autonomous delivery going forward.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris O'Cull with Stifel. Your line is open.
Chris O'Cull: Ritch, I appreciate, probably don't want to share many details about new products, but can you help us understand what you're hoping to accomplish with the new product? Meaning, are you focused on addressing a certain customer needs state or a competitive threat? And then also could you talk about the testing process you go through to evaluate the likely success of any new products?
Ritch Allison: Sure, Chris. So what we think about new product development, it is our decision process is centered around incrementality for our franchisees. So, not just incremental sales, but also incremental profits for the franchisee now that of course starts with you identifying products that have strong consumer appeal. But that's not enough, a lot of brands will measure, success of a new product by what mix that product gets post-release. We actually take a look at it a little differently and we measure success based on the incremental profit because a lot of the products that we launch and I'll use a salads for an example. We didn't launch salads to sell salads. We launched salads to sell pizza and the launch of salads drove incremental profitability in our stores. Not through selling salads but through selling pizzas. So that's the lens that we look through. So our testing processes start obviously with the consumer and the appeal there. But really what we're looking for is what were the overall behavior of that customer be? Will it drive incremental traffic into our stores? And what happens with ticket as well? Will it add additional items to the basket that ultimately help the profitability of the franchisees? And it's why we don't launch that many new products because when we go down into the test kitchen, we see dozens of products that taste great and drive a lot -- have consumer appeal. But if they don't drive incrementality in terms of sales and profits for the franchisees, then we're not going to force more operational complexity into the stores without a significant benefit on the back end. So that's the approach that we take to it. And, I'm excited that we're going to have some news coming up this summer that I think will be exciting for consumers and also, I know, exciting for our franchisees.
Chris O'Cull: That's helpful. And then, just quickly on the international unit openings, it was down a little bit year-over-year. Can you provide some color as to why that may have been the case and then should we anticipate fewer openings in 2020 as a result of the Coronavirus? I think you mentioned China was a big source of openings this past year.
Ritch Allison: So if you look at the total year, our international unit openings were actually higher than they were last year. Fourth quarter was lower, but you might recall, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we had a tailwind in the openings coming from some of the conversions of Hallo pizza stores in Germany, which you may remember we were pushing really hard on in the fourth quarter of last year. I still feel very good looking forward about our 6% to 8% global unit growth that we've laid out for you as our two to three year outlook. And that's really driven by the strong four wall economics across the international business. To your question on the impact of the Coronavirus, today China is still a relatively small part of our overall portfolio in terms of store count and also in terms of retail sales. Now, as I highlighted in my comments earlier, China was a big contributor to store growth in 2019. As we look at what's happening over there with the Coronavirus today, I can tell you that I am really proud of how dash brands is handling things. You know, the number one priority right now is not sales or store openings in China. It is the help of our team members and our customers. At the present, we've got fewer than 20 stores that are closed in the market. All of those are temporary closures, none of them are permanent. But, with this virus there is a slowdown in the early part of the year in store openings. It's just inevitable. But I do not see this as a -- I don't see this as a long-term impact on the business. Obviously, our thoughts are with the citizens of China and our team members over there for this virus to get under control. But so some temporary impact, but I don't expect a long-term impact.
Operator: Thank you. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question. Our next question comes from Sarah Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Sarah Senatore: I want to just clarify a comment you made about the aggregator pressure leveling off. I don't want to split hairs, but I guess are you saying sales growth is stable or aggregator dollar sales look to be stable? I'm trying to understand if we're in sort of steady state now, why is 2% to 5% the right constant rate for you? Why not? Why shouldn't it be sort of we accelerating back to where it was before we saw this real heavy step up in an aggregator pressure? Is it fortressing or is it just sort of how I'm interpreting your comments about leveling off?
Ritch Allison: Hi, Sarah. So I'll try to clarify a little bit. When I say level off, I mean relative to the second half of '18 and the first half of '19, when we saw significant push of aggregators into new cities across the country and significant incremental spending on advertising both traditional media and digital and significant increases in discounting in the marketplace. All of that stuff is still there. We just didn't see more of a ramp up, like we had seen on some of the previous quarter. So think about it as the pressure is all still there. It's just not -- we didn't see it as elevating on us from Q3. Now we don't know, what's going to happen in 2020. I'm just going to be honest with you. We don't know how these folks are going to behave. The best metaphor I can think of as they're standing in a circular firing squad right now and they were going to continue to keep advertising going to continue to keep discounting because I don't think they have any choice. And so we expect to while we're not in the middle of the firing squad, we might get hit by a few stray bullets along the way. And, we just don't know exactly yet how to quantify that. So that's why, the 2% to 5%, it is a 2 to 3 year outlook. We're not moving it around quarter-to-quarter. We feel like if we can operate in that range, we got a really healthy business model that can deliver growth and profits for our franchisees and can reward our shareholders along the way.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Silberman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Lauren Silberman: Just to clarify, was the sequential acceleration in comps all attributable to the delivery segment. And then on GPS tracking, what percentage of the U.S. system currently has it and in store that have implemented the technology? Can you provide any color on what you're seeing across relevant metrics, whether that be delivery times, customer satisfaction, labor saving?
Jeff Lawrence: Hey Lauren, it's Jeff. I'll take the first one and then I'll kick it over to Ritch on the GPS. As far as the comp in Q4, the carryout business just was on fire in a greater way. [Indiscernible] and hard into that strategically given our franchise operators the tools and the technology to really make the most of it. And as Ritch mentioned earlier, really advertising heavily behind it. It's what a big cross section of our customers really want. We're getting better at carryout every day that we focus on it and really saw a big surge in the comp for carryout. On the delivery side, tougher competitive environment there. It did sequentially improve over Q3. So we definitely feel like the value that we can provide to our delivery customers in that segment remains very, very strong. And we were pleased to see the resiliency in that business. So I'm glad we're in both of those businesses. Going to continue to invest heavily behind them in advertising technology. The consumer experience but carryout did a little bit better than delivery date in Q4 and I'll kick it over to Ritch on the GPS commentary.
Ritch Allison: Yes. And I've actually -- I've personally been out in quite a few stores over the last couple of weeks talking with our franchisees and with our store managers as we roll out the GPS technology, getting a very, very positive reception out among our operators. Because it is helping them to better manage what is a really complex process around getting food out of the store and to customers. So knowing exactly where the drivers are, knowing when they are close to the store in terms of their returns, enables us to get pizzas ready and in the hands of those drivers and out the door quickly. So we're seeing some reduction in turn times. It's still very early, but some reduction in turn times, in the stores that have really adopted this new technology. And as I look forward and as I think about it, there are two sides to the GPS. One is the consumer side. And if we're honest with ourselves, GPS on the consumer side, it really is a me too thing that we've got there. I mean, you've got GPS anytime you get an Uber or Lyft and competitors have that in place as well. It's important for customers and we have to have it for them. But the real benefit in my mind from GPS is how it will change the way we operate and run the delivery business inside our stores for our managers, but also for our drivers because historically a driver needed three to six months to learn the delivery area. Well, we can accelerate the training of those drivers with GPS in hand. They already know the fastest route to get a pizza to our customers, so more to come on that. It's still early, but I'm excited about where we are today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Your line is open.
Peter Saleh: I think you mentioned -- you're aware of how much pressure the franchisees are under in terms of costs with wages rising. Could you elaborate a little bit on what some of the efficiencies that you guys were putting into place outside of GPS tracking to try and mitigate some of the cost within the four walls of the stores and improve the margins?
Ritch Allison: Sure. So yes, there are a lot and as you guys look across the restaurant landscape, I'm sure all of you see a lot of labor cost pressure out there in the marketplace and it's not uniform as you know. It is concentrated along the coast and in states where we've seen significant minimum wage increases over time. So our franchisees just like restaurant operators across the industry are dealing with those cost pressures. In terms of efficiencies, there are a number of things that we're working on. GPS is one of them that we were just talking about whereby we're trying to shrink the turn time on orders, which provides labor efficiency. We have been piloting in our corporate store business some AI-based labor scheduling algorithms to try to make sure that we are using the right number of hours in each of our stores and there is a lot of inefficiency in our system today if we're honest with ourselves about that. So, a lot of things that are going on there. We're taking a look at with our Innovation Garage which some of you were able to come see. We're looking at every aspect of how we set up and operate our stores, because it is a game of steps and pennies and seconds and we're trying to focus on all of those as we look for ways to help our operators be successful.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.
David Tarantino: Ritch, I think you mentioned that one of your biggest focus areas for the U.S. business in 2020 is on operations or execution of service. And I was wondering if you could give us some context on whether you see the current service levels as an issue relative to where you've been in the past or is this more opportunistic. Anything you can offer there would be helpful. Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Yes, David, be happy to. What I can tell you is, on our delivery service today, we're as good as we've ever been on delivery. But we're not good enough for the future. This is how I would describe it. So, business was founded on this kind of 30-minute promise decades ago. Well, I think as we look forward, when you can get anything, food or otherwise delivered, we've got to be the absolute best at it. And so we're working with our franchisees, fortressing is obviously a part of that and fortress stores we see a reduction of about 2 minutes on average in delivery time versus those non-fortress territories. But that's not all of it. It's using technology like GPS. We now have technology in our stores that enable us to get pizzas in the oven much faster based on what customers are ordering digitally. So we're taking a look at every aspect of it. Paramount to all of that obviously is safely getting that product to the customer. But, we're looking at ways to take out time through every step of the process from the time you open that app to the time that pizza shows up to your door.
David Tarantino: And just a follow-up related to that, when you do make progress on this, do you see a pretty good immediate correlation to the sales in the market, when you see this type of improvement?
Ritch Allison: The correlation is very strong between averaged delivery times and the sales per household, which is a great measure of customer repeat purchase. So, yes. And I'll tell you, when you get down to -- and we have a number of operators across the U.S. today that are delivering in under 20 minutes on average. When you get below 20 minutes, the inflection in the curve is dramatic.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Gregory Francfort: There were some articles last night that the largest franchisee of one of your -- the biggest competitor in the U.S. likely is going through bankruptcy. Do you know how much overlap you have with that system? Is that something you have looked at it all? And then, maybe at the risk of asking a second question, what is your average franchisee leverage stand today. That would be great. Thanks.
Ritch Allison: So, on the first question, Greg, I won't speculate on NPC. It is a really tough operating environment out there in the restaurant industry as we talked about earlier from a cost standpoint. And I can tell you that if we were not growing our sales, profit would be declining. As we talked about, we had pretty good same-store sales growth in 2019. And we expect our store level profits to be roughly flat. So you've got to grow in order to continue to compete and thrive in the business. Given our footprint 6,000 plus stores across the U.S, certainly, we've got territories that overlap with that franchisees units. But, we don't focus this pretty much specifically on one franchisee of a competing brand or frankly even one competing brand, we're out there 5 per share in every community that we operate in across the country. I'm going to let Jeff take the second question around the franchisee leverage.
Jeff Lawrence: Hey, Greg. Good morning. On the franchise leverage in the U.S., we're very fortunate that nearly 800 independent franchisees submit to us their P&Ls, their balance sheets on a regular basis. So we have a pretty good understanding of where they're at. And what I would tell you is, we don't believe that that's a significant risk for our U.S. business and not just because they enjoy the best model and economics that they've earned alongside of us. But because they -- in our opinion, they use a little bit of leverage responsibly. So not a big risk for us as we think about getting to those 25,000 units around the world.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Carril with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Chris Carril: So how much incremental opportunity is there in your view to highlight Domino's value proposition in your advertising, maybe particularly from a delivery perspective relative to aggregator delivery. Will that be a greater part of your messaging going forward?
Ritch Allison: Yes. Chris, it's been a core part of the message now for 10 years. Since we first launched 599 and then we really doubled down on it with 799 around the carryout business. So it's going to continue to be a core part of it. And I think the additional element of this that comes into play I think -- when we think about how we compete against the third parties will be the delivery fee component of it relative to what the third parties are charging customers to have food delivered. There's been a lot of promotional activity in that space with free delivery and for your first order and all those sorts of things. So we've yet to fully see how it shakes out. But when we take a look at the value proposition of feeding a family of four with Domino's inclusive of delivery charges, we feel really good about how that stacks up against what you would pay to have virtually any other type of food delivered to you via a third-party.
Operator: We have a question from Katherine Fogertey with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Katherine Fogertey: A question here about the mix on carryout this quarter, both in terms of ticket and of sales. And then with the increased messaging around carryout, are you guys seeing any accelerating trend in the fortress stores relative to the non-fortress stores? And in fortress store itself, if you could comment on if you're seeing cannibalization to the delivery business or more messaging out there on carryout is bringing in incremental customers or potentially stimulating delivery as well? Thank you.
Jeff Lawrence: Hey. Thanks for the question. This is Jeff. I'll take a shot at this one. On the mix of the two businesses in Q4 again, carryout is just performing extraordinarily well for us. We're in our 60th year of the existence in a lot of ways. We were kind of an accidental carryout company for maybe the first 50 years or so. But with the strategic insight around where the pizza industry was going, really trying to address better the consumer needs about that separate occasion, and they are separate occasions. I think people sometimes conflict the two, but our research says, I think our results show that a carryout customer is absolutely different from a delivery customer. Off lean and into that, as Ritch just mentioned we're many, many years now into the 799 large three topping carryout special, which is all we can get every day of the week. Customers really like it and is really helping to drive some outperformance that you're seeing drop to the bottom in the total comp. On the delivery side of the business, obviously highly competitive food delivery marketplace it's very dynamic over the last year plus there, but our franchisees in our corporate stores are holding their own there. The value proposition really shine and through with the 599 Mix & Match offer and as Ritch mentioned multiple times over multiple calls, the focus on service and making sure that we're delighting our customers really helps us capture that long-term value of the customer. So we were super excited to see the sequential improvement Q4 over Q3 on delivery. So that's what I'd say overall on that. As it relates to fortress stores versus the stores that have kind of been split with our territory, it's really the same stuff that we've told you. The carryout in the new store, the fortress store almost 100% more than 90% incremental. That's what the data shows that we are reaching customers that simply weren't enjoying the Domino's brand there. So that's a really important part of the financial equation to get those franchisees excited about the investment opportunity. The delivery side of the business, certainly we are picking up new addresses, but the addresses that are shifting from an old store to a new store, were simply getting it safely to the customer and better service time there. So, it's really gelling together, our franchisees remain super excited about it and we're going to continue to grow as fast as we can on that strategy.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
John Glass: Can you just maybe talk about the impact of the loyalty program had on 2019 as we sort of think about the year that's just passed. How has the membership grown, how has the impact on sales grown or what the impact has been. And I guess importantly, I think there must have been some discussion of remembering correctly about maybe at some point changing it right from a visitation to more points or something else that might enhance that continue to help it grow. Is that something you're contemplating in 2020?
Ritch Allison: Hey, John, it's Ritch. So we were pleased with the growth in the loyalty program. As you'll recall, in 2018 we passed the 20 million active member mark and in 2019, we passed the 25 million mark. So it continues to grow and resonate with customers. The tailwind impact on sales that you get for loyalty does decline over time. So in '19 its nowhere near what you would have seen in '16 and '17 right after we launched the program. And we're always looking at ways that we might be able to enhance it over time. We ran our Points for Pies campaign in the first part of this year to find another way to give value to our customers and we're going to keep looking at ways to grow and enhance it, because any loyalty program does have a bit of a half-life to it and you have to keep feeding it for it to continue to deliver results.
John Glass: Just to be clear, would it be the kind of change read actually shift though the value of point or the way you earn them or would it be more in evolution as you talked about Points for Pies or some other sort of idea that would get people more reengaged in the program on a near-term basis or short-term basis.
RitchAllison: Well, one thing that won't change, John, will be the purpose behind the loyalty program, which is to drive order count growth in frequency over time. It's the way it's structured. It's why it's a transaction based program where you order 6 times and you get a free pizza as opposed to a spin-based program. So we're going to remain focused on driving transactions with it because we know transactions drive sales, which drives profits in our business. So with that context, we're constantly running research and taken a look at different ways that we can enhance the program. So, I can't tell you today, what will be different about it a year from now, but I can tell you that we're not going to do anything that gives us away from trying to drive transactions through customer frequency.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brett Levy with MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Brett Levy: Just following up on the franchise system a little bit, kind of been trying to ask this a little bit differently. You've talked about a number of things that you're doing for the franchisees, but you've also talked about some of the pressures that they're under. What are you hearing right now both domestically and internationally as the biggest asks from you that you're not already doing and also, are there any areas where you're getting any push back from them? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Yes. So, franchisees, Brett, continue to ask for help around technology and that's something that we brought to the system time and time again. I mean, ultimately it is the franchisees job to serve their customers to hire and staff their teams, to motivate and grow and develop their team members. But we as the brand overall can bring technologies to bear that help them run their businesses more efficiently. So that's why you see, GPS as an example that we've rolled out, that's something that franchisees were hungry for and eager for us to bring to bear. Ultimately franchisees want to grow sales and profits. So our dialog with them outside of specific things like technology is always around how do we work together to continue to grow the system in a healthy and profitable way.
Operator: Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open.
Dennis Geiger: Richard or Jeff, just another one on the strength in the U.S. carryout business and the opportunity. In addition to the fortressing, the service levels, the Pie Pass and some of the other tech that you mentioned. Could we also see greater marketing and promo efforts even beyond the 799 carryout given the success you've seen recently? And I guess particularly given some of your competitors are shifting more towards a delivery focus, does that potentially present an even greater opportunity for you to pick up even more carryouts here? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: I'll try to take that one. The answer on carryout around, are we going to do more to drive that business. The answer is absolutely because we see it as a huge opportunity for us. The trends on a transaction basis, it's 2.5x the number of transactions that are in the delivery segment in the U.S. And I think we've got more opportunities to drive it. We started with this 799 hero offer. We expanded that toward the end of last year to include all five of our crust types that really resonated. So we are definitely thinking about what are the other products or opportunities that we could roll into what is already a great value offer for our customers. We're working hard on technologies to take friction out of the carryout experience. We've got more than 600 of our stores in the U.S. now that have pickup windows, where a customer can pull right up to the window and have the pizza handed through to them as opposed to getting out of the car potentially with the kids and trying to come into the store and pick them up. So we're looking for more and more ways to make it seamless. Pie Pass let's them to jump the line. Get up to the front, get the pizza handed to them and everybody likes to see their name on a screen. If I'm feeling lonely, I'd order carryout and I go into Domino's and I'd love to see Ritch up on the screen in the store. And then to the second part of your question and it is a really interesting question about this competitor shift. So what we see happening in the industry is a huge increase in delivery, but no incremental restaurant transactions rolling in. So sure there is shift across some brands, there is most certainly shift across channels. And if you look at that, particularly in the high wage markets in the U.S., if you're trading drive-through business or pick up business for delivery business, then you are moving your customers to a higher cost channel to serve. So when we think about how we're going to grow our business and continue to have a very profitable base of franchisees; we got to hold serve and defend that delivery side of the business, but we are pushing hard on carryout, because as you approach $13, $14, $15, $16 an hour labor, that carryout business becomes the profit engine over time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe: First, just a very specific question, and I know that you guys don't normally like to talk about it. But quarter-to-date, we have had very unusual restaurant trends, especially on the casual dining side, probably a lot of that driven by weather? Good weather, warm weather and lack of snow isn't necessarily a good thing for you, is there anything that you'd like to call out specifically in the first quarter because expectations could obviously really change based on what you reported in the fourth? And I have a follow-up?
Ritch Allison: John we'll talk about Q1 in April.
John Ivankoe: I got it. In your prepared remarks and I think you touched on this in a few different ways but I would like you to revisit it. You talked about driving efficiency and profitability both at franchisees and corporate. Certainly I understand about GPS being part of that but what other big structural, just not managing pennies and nickels maybe finding bigger ideas do exist that we might be able to see within the U.S. store system and following up on that, what type of efficiencies might exist on the corporate side, that we haven't necessarily talked about?
Ritch Allison: Yes, John, great question. We're spending a lot of time on this. And it's one of the main reasons we built that Innovation Garage in our backyard over here, so that we could accelerate some of these operational efficiency initiatives. I talked about GPS a bit, our AI work and machine learning around team member scheduling, which we've been working hard on in our corporate stores to more efficiently schedule, not only to get improvements and in the pilots, we've done, not only does it result in lower labor costs, but it also results in better service levels. So there is a win-win there on having the right number of team members in the store at the right time. We're also looking at other things that we've done for years and years in our business and asking ourselves if we need to keep doing them? And some of these things are lessons that we learned from our international markets. We've got more than 1,000 stores outside the U.S. that don't pre-fold any pizza boxes. For example, which requires a pretty decent amount of labor in the store to do that and we're taking a look at things like that and testing them in our corporate store business. We're looking at the equipment that we use and how that equipment is positioned in our stores, how we think about preparing our stores for the rush which comes at us at dinner time, every night. So we're breaking down every aspect of the operation to try to find opportunities for efficiency because we know that labor costs are only going up over time. I'm willing to bet that in my business career no state or municipality is going to lower minimum wage. So we got to be prepared to operate in an environment where costs are going to go up and the customers' willingness to pay does not go up linearly with your cost to provide them with that service.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Just a question on the loyalty program. I think you mentioned active now north of 25 million. I was wondering if you'd share any color in terms of whether it's average usage versus a non-active or whether or not you've pushed any greater emphasis on one-to-one marketing in the fourth quarter kind of trying to dial into the benefit of having that loyalty program. And ultimately how do you incentivize greater adoption. I know you mentioned 85 million I guess, total customers in your database. I'm wondering how you go about pushing that 25 million having gone from 20 million to 25 million even higher from there to help increase usage per household? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Yes. So certainly our active loyalty members buy from us a bit more often than our non-active. So that's a big driver of why we want to get them into the program. I think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to drive the program particularly around this growing carryout side of our business, which as I mentioned earlier, digital is not as entrenched in that business as it is with our delivery customers. So we're looking for ways to make the carryout experience digital, experience more helpful and more convenient to our customers as we try to continue to drive adoption that way. You also asked a bit about how do we use the data, how do we get more targeted? This is an area where we're early stage right now, but spending a lot of time and energy. Looking at that data set, not just of the 25 million active, but the 40 plus that are enrolled and the 85 plus in our database to say how can we be more surgical and more relevant and how we present offers and opportunities to our customers. And I think we're on the very early stage of becoming effective in that area Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles: In the last month, the largest domestic carryout only pizza concept launched National delivery through a third-party platform. And I'm curious what gives you the confidence that you can defend against short-term headwinds? Your delivery traffic is an incremental 4,000 Pizza restaurants are now aggressively promoting the value of their delivery offering versus yours, which is unusual as obviously we all kind of know the third-party delivery usually is more expensive versus your ticket?
Ritch Allison: Yes. Andrew, it's Ritch. We take every, every competitor that enters very seriously. And I think for us, it just further reinforces that we and our system have to stay very focused on value. And as we take a look at what the all-in delivered cost of the Domino's Pizza is, we still feel very good about the value that we can offer our consumers relative to any of the pizza players that have been or are now in delivery. But most certainly, we take every competitor seriously that comes into the business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Todd Brooks. Your line is open.
Todd Brooks: As we look at maybe the international store base and the slowing of same-store sales performance across 2019. Can we talk about, is it a relatively homogeneous slowing across most of the international partners or are there a few discrete markets that you would call out as being a bit of a headwind to the international same-store sales. Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Yes, Todd. What I would tell you is that, it's not uniform across the 90 countries that we operate in. And if you start to break it down in the quarter, our emerging markets outperformed our more mature markets. So if you wanted to try to draw a line of distinction there always of course exceptions, but by and large, the emerging markets tended to outperform the more mature markets during the quarter.
Operator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Ritch Allison for closing remarks.
Ritch Allison: Thank you, analysts, and thanks everybody. We really appreciate you joining the call this morning. Jeff and I look forward to speaking with you in late April as we discuss our first quarter 2020 results. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-08 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 Domino’s Pizza Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tim McIntyre, Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Tim McIntyre: Thanks, Sonia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our conversation today regarding the results of our third quarter 2019. The call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Ritch Allison; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence. As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask all members of the media and others to be in listen-only mode. In the event that any forward looking statements are made, I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement you can find in this morning’s release, the 8-K and the 10-Q. In addition, please refer to the 8-K to find disclosures and reconciliations of non GAAP financial measures that maybe used on today’s call. Our request to our analysts, we want to do our best to accommodate all of you today, so we encourage you to ask only one part question on this call, if you would please. With that, I’d like to turn the call over to Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence.
Jeff Lawrence: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued as we delivered solid results for our shareholders. We continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 34 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 103 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continue to increase our global store count at a healthy pace as we opened 214 net new stores in Q3. Our diluted EPS was $2.05, an increase of 5.1% over the prior year quarter, primarily resulting from strong operational results offset in part by a higher tax rate. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q3. Global retail sales grew 5.8% as compared to the prior year quarter, pressured by a stronger dollar. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 7.5%. This global retail sales growth was driven by both an increase in the average number of stores opened during the quarter and higher same-store sales. Same-store sales for the U.S. grew 2.4%, lapping a prior year increase of 6.3%, and same-store sales for our international division grew 1.7%, rolling over a prior year increase of 3.3%. Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 2.5%, while our company-owned stores were up 1.7%. The comp this quarter was driven entirely by ticket growth. While we continue to grow our overall delivery business, we continue to experience pressure on the delivery business comp from our successful fortressing strategy as well as from aggressive competitive activity. Our carryout business continues to grow at an impressive rate. On the international front, our comp for the quarter was also driven primarily by ticket growth. On the unit count front, we opened 40 net U.S. stores in the third quarter consisting of 43 store openings and three closures. Our international division added 174 net new stores during Q3, comprised of 203 store openings and 29 closures. We’ve opened 1,174 units over the past 12 months, which we believe demonstrates the broad and enduring strength of our four-wall economics, combined with the efforts of the best franchise partners in the restaurant industry. Turning to revenues. Total revenues for the third quarter were up 4.4% from the prior year, resulting primarily from the following: first, higher U.S. franchise retail sales, resulting from both store count and same-store sales growth drove increased supply chain and U.S. franchise revenues. Higher international retail sales resulted in increased international royalty revenues but were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. FX negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $1.5 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies. These increases were partially offset by lower company-owned store revenues, resulting from the previously disclosed sale of the 59 corporate stores in our New York market to existing franchisees during the second quarter. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 38.5% from 37.6% in the prior year quarter and was positively impacted by the New York sale and higher revenues from our global franchise business. Supply chain operating margin was up 0.1 percentage points year-over-year, while our company-owned store operating margin was up 2.8 percentage points year-over-year, driven primarily by the New York sale. G&A cost increased $3.4 million as compared to the prior year quarter. G&A was benefited by the New York sale. As a reminder, we recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $6 million on the sale of 12 company-owned stores in the prior year, which was recorded in G&A. Our reported effective tax rate was 21.7% for the quarter, up 6.4 percentage points from the prior year quarter due to lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation. The reported effective tax rate included a 1.1 percentage-point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation in 2019. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to equity-based compensation for the foreseeable future. When you add it all up, our third quarter net income was up $2.3 million or 2.7% over the prior year quarter. Our third quarter diluted EPS was $2.05 versus $1.95 in the prior year, which was a 5.1% increase. Here is how that $0.10 increase breaks down. Lower diluted share count resulting primarily from share repurchases over the past 12 months benefited us by $0.05. Foreign currency negatively impacted royalty revenues by $0.03. Our higher effective tax rate negatively impacted us by $0.14. And most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.22. Now turning to cash. During the first three quarters of 2019, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $325 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of more than $280 million. On average, that is more than $1 million in free cash flow generated per day. I highlight our cash flow story not only to demonstrate our outstanding financial model and performance, but also to remind folks of our long-term commitment of returning cash to shareholders. To that end, we repurchased and retired $94 million worth of shares at an average purchase price of $244 per share during Q3, bringing our year-to-date total repurchases to $105 million and our total share repurchases over the past 12 months to more than $267 million. We also returned $26.9 million to our shareholders during Q3 in the form of a $0.65 per share quarterly dividend. On average, over the last 12 months, we’ve not only generated more than $1 million per day in free cash flow, but when you add our share repurchases and dividends together, we’ve also returned more than a $1 million per day to our shareholders. We are also excited to announce today that our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program which will replace the remaining authorization under our existing program. Before I turn it over to Ritch, I wanted to give you some commentary and update to our previously issued financial guidance for full-year 2019. We’ve provided guidance of 2% to 4% increase for store food basket pricing in our U.S. system as compared to 2018 levels. We now expect, we will be near the low end of this range. We’ve provided guidance of a negative $5 million to $10 million impact of foreign currency on royalty revenues as compared to 2018. We now expect we will come in closer to negative $10 million. We’ve provided guidance of $110 million to $120 million for CapEx investments. We now expect that our CapEx investments will be in the range of $95 million to $100 million. This reflects our ongoing disciplined approach to prioritizing and investing in the projects that will get us to dominant number one. We’ve provided guidance of $390 million to $395 million for G&A expense. We now expect that our G&A expense will be in the range of $380 million to $385 million for full-year 2019. This update reflects the impact of the New York store sale and more importantly our continued prioritization around investments. Overall our solid consistent momentum continued and we are pleased with our results this quarter. We will remain focused on relentlessly driving the brand forward and providing great value to all of our stakeholders, including our customers, our franchisees, team members and shareholders. Thank you for joining the call today. And now I will turn it over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. I’m going to do with -- I’m going to do things a little bit differently -- excuse me, this morning, than we typically do. I will take a few minutes to walk through some highlights from the third quarter. But then I want to turn our attention to the revised outlook that we released to you early this morning, and after that we will take some time for some Q&A. Let's start with the U.S. business and a few highlights there. It is an evolving competitive and operating environment in the U.S. right now. But I continue to feel that our fundamentals are solid and that the priorities that we have around the business are all in the right place. We remain as always steadfastly focused on delivering value to our customers and best-in-class unit economics to our franchisees. The quarter yielded strong growth in our carryout business. This was driven by great value, terrific advertising and also great-looking stores. We continue to build more stores around the U.S. as we work to get closer to our customers. This not only improves our delivery service and economics, but it also brings a significant number of incremental carryout orders into our stores. When we look across the U.S., we now have over 90% of our U.S. system in our modern pizza theater image. This has truly elevated the carryout experience for our customers. Turning to our delivery business, we continue to feel some pressure from the entry of many non-pizza QSR players, who were enabled by the third-party aggregators. September starting with the programs that we shared with many of you last month, all with a focus on driving traffic and order count gains. I will share a few highlights from that. We launched our delivery insurance campaign, which some of you may have seen now the advertising on TV over the last couple of weeks. This is a spinoff of our successful carryout insurance campaign. It reinforces our commitment to delivery with new features that enable customers to give us real-time feedback and also showcases our commitment to make every delivery a great delivery. One of the things I particularly love about this advertising is that it features two of our fantastic franchisees. Second, we introduced a campaign adding additional cross types to our $7.99 carryout deal. We believe that adding more variety at that $7.99 price point will not only drive orders, but also ticket to this rapidly growing part of our business. Our carryout business in the U.S. is now approaching 45% of our total orders, helping us to diversify our business into this carryout segment, which as we discussed with you in the past is significantly larger than the delivery segment today. Finally, we're bringing additional value to the late-night daypart with our 20% off late-night deal. This really is the first time that we've introduced incremental value dedicated to this daypart, 9 PM and later. And then beyond that, we’ve got many more exciting things happening as we look out toward 2020 and we shared some of these things with you just a month ago. We're continuing to progress in the test kitchen on menu innovation products. I personally just did another tasting last Friday afternoon and I am excited about some of the things that we may be able to bring to the market in 2020. Service, as always continues to be a major focus in our business, enabled by technology like GPS and also additional platforms that we are bringing out to our stores with the goal of making the day-to-day running of the business easier for our franchisees and our general managers. And then finally and as always, investments and programs to keep us top of mind with both digital and loyalty across both of our key businesses, delivery and carryout. As I close off on the discussion of the U.S. business, I just want to highlight 6% retail sales growth in the third quarter. With that level of growth, we are clearly continuing to gain share in the pizza category and more broadly growing at a pace that exceeds most estimates of the restaurant industry growth rate for sure. Let's turn our attention now to the international business. We had another solid quarter of retail sales growth in the international business driven by strong unit growth around the globe. We opened 174 net stores in the international business during the quarter. This reflects terrific unit economics that we continue to enjoy in many markets around the globe. And to that end, I'd like to highlight a couple of our emerging markets that I'm excited about, that are leading the way on growth. During the third quarter, we opened 20 stores in China. And when we look at our retail sales growth year-on-year, the third quarter demonstrated 45% retail sales growth in China versus last year. Another one of our emerging markets Brazil, opened 17 stores during the quarter. And growth there continues to accelerate under new ownership. We also have some of our larger and more established markets that are continuing to demonstrate strong retail sales growth. Japan and India are two more terrific examples where the brand is growing around the globe. While all five international regions were positive, our international comps certainly still are a work in progress and remain an area of tremendous focus for us around the world. But as I wrap up international, I do want to highlight the retail sales growth rate of 9.1%. Once again, we are clearly gaining share in pizza and growing at a pace that exceeds the broader restaurant industry. So as we wrap up the quarter globally, our strategy is around fortressing value and best-in-class economics for our franchisees are progressing very nicely. The third quarter once again demonstrated the strength of the Domino's business model. We once again delivered strong retail sales growth, strong EBITDA growth and strong EPS growth even in the face of comps that frankly were below some of our historical averages. And when I look out at our franchisees around the world, I continue to be incredibly impressed with their focus and the competitive nature that they bring to their stores each and every day. I'm also really proud that during the quarter, despite a lot of distractions our team remain focused on the things that really matter, franchisee profitability, our franchisees overall economic health and their ability to maximize the operational performance and their business. We are doing our part to support them with undoubtedly one of the strongest economic opportunities in all of QSR. I also want to highlight what we’ve been doing to continue to build our brand in the direct relationship that we have with our customers. We now have more than 23 million customers who are active users in our loyalty program. And when we look at our broader database of customers, we now have 85 million active users of the Domino's Pizza brand. We have always and we will continue to value this direct relationship that we have with these customers. So that's a bit about the quarter. I’m going to turn my attention now to the revised outlook that we shared with you in our earnings release this morning. Many of you were here with us just a few weeks ago for our Investor Open House. And during that event, I spoke at length about where we are today, how I believe we’re positioned for the future, and some of the important things that we’re working on both for the near-term and also over the longer term. I realize that some of you weren't able to join us. If you weren't, that webcast is still available to you, it's out there at biz.dominos.com and I’d invite you to listen in to hear some of our thoughts about these exciting developments in the business. I will tell you that since that Open House, my views on the health of our business and on the long-term growth potential of the Domino's brand certainly have not changed. So why then you might ask that we changed our approach to the forward outlook? What we believe that the evolving market conditions and the resulting uncertainty have reduced the relevance of a 3 to 5-year outlook. And in our view, the market is more dynamic now than it has ever been. The reality is that we don't have visibility into exactly how long. Some of these new entrants into the quick service delivery segment are going to benefit from the financial support of aggregators who are seeking to buy market share. These players are currently pricing below the cost to serve, offering free delivery or other deep discounts that are currently enabled by investor subsidy. So when we take all that into consideration, we no longer believe that a long-term outlook with a 3 to 5-year time horizon is that instructive to our investors. Therefore we will be using a 2 to 3-year time horizon for our outlook ranges for global retail sales growth, comparable unit sales in the U.S., comparable unit sales in our international business and also global unit growth. I want to be very clear, this is not a reactive decision, but a proactive one to make our guidance more meaningful and more relevant to our investors in light of the current competitive landscape. With all that said, our updated 2 to 3-year outlook is the following: 7% to 10% retail sales growth to be driven by 2% to 5% U.S. comps; 1% to 4% international comps and 6% to 8% unit growth. Let me talk a bit about each of those in turn. The international comp. Our updated international comp reflects longer than expected weakness in some of our markets, recognizing that we fallen below the previous outlook now for four consecutive quarters. And while some of this weakness is driven by the ongoing competitive pressures, I want to be clear that there are many opportunities for improvement that we and our master franchisees can influence. We are working alongside them every day through our centers of excellence, but these efforts are going to take some time to unfold. When we look at the U.S. comp, the updated range for our U.S. comp reflects two things. First, the continued pressure from competitors who are pricing delivery below the cost to serve; and second, the comparable sales drag as we plan to further ramp up our fortressing program. And I want to talk about that for a few minutes. You might ask, why do we intend to get even more aggressive in building new stores? Well, the answer here is twofold. First, these fortress store openings continue to be a compelling economic opportunity, that’s both for us and for our franchisees. Second, we’ve got a unique opportunity right now to solidify market share gains for the long-term as our competitors retreat and as these third parties fundamentally alter the economics of many players in the restaurant industry. We believe that a significant shakeout is coming to the industry and there has never been a better time for Domino's to fortress. Our U.S. system is financially strong. We got terrific four-wall economics and very healthy franchisees who will generate approximately $1 million each in average EBITDA this year. We believe that our franchisees are aligned with the strategies and they continue to invest in stores and invest in their people. I am as always grateful for their partnership. So in closing, we’re playing the long game at Domino's. For our investors and most importantly for our franchisees, we firmly believe that now is the time to go on offense and to take advantage of our continuing strength to drive profitable growth to expand our market share GAAP to the competition and to further solidify Domino's as the dominant Domino's Pizza brand. So with that said, we are happy to take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. Question on the guidance. I assume all of us on this call completely understand the philosophy around changing the structure of how you’re communicating your same-store sales guidance. But just a little more color on how you're approaching this 2% to 5% range. It's really not a dramatic change from what you were communicating and as you know people are going to be using that range to evaluate your performance from here quarterly and annually. So just a little more color on what that 100 basis point change on both sides of the equation is directly attributable to?
Ritch Allison: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Listen, as we take a look at it, it really is -- it really is twofold as I described in my earlier remarks. As we take a look at the U.S. business, first, there is just a level of uncertainty in the near term around some of these competing delivery offers in the marketplace. We know that has an impact on the comp and therefore felt that we needed to adjust that range down a bit. We also -- as we look forward over the next couple of years, we are moving aggressively to continue our fortressing program and this is not just with our franchisees, but also in our corporate store book business, we believe in this so adamantly that we have -- as we look at the seven markets that we still play in with our corporate store business, we intend to fortress those seven markets completely within the next 3-year time horizon. And we know that will also create some drag on -- additional drag on the comp in the near term. So, it really is those two factors that led us to: A, restructure the timeframe around the comp; and then, B, to set the ranges at that 2% to 5%.
Brian Bittner: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Nick Setyan of Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.
Nick Setyan: Thank you. We are starting to see some of the QSR [ph] competition receiving deals that are actually very favorable to the restaurants. And so whether or not the third-party providers can sustain subsidies at that level is a theoretical question, but certainly in the near-term, those deals are going to allow -- those QSR burger players, particularly, too to become incrementally more and more competitive. And so, I guess the question is, in the near-term, what's the plan to compete both on value and around menu innovation?
Ritch Allison: Yes. So, as we highlighted just a few weeks back, we’ve got some opportunities we believe to continue to not only reinforce value in the marketplace, but also to reinforce the Domino's Pizza service and the delivery expertise that we’ve been known for now, almost 60 years. So, in the near-term, it is staying focused on our $5.99 and $7.99 hero price points, aggressively continuing to push on service, working with our franchisees to make sure that we are providing great delivery service to our customers, and really putting our money where our mouth is on that as you see with our delivery insurance campaign that we have on TV now. We know that two of the main frustrations that consumers have around any delivery is the cost of it, and then also getting their food on time every time. And so, we're trying to make sure that we continue to address both of those. As it relates to the menu, we are talking now on air about variety with our crust types, but also we’ve got the team working very hard on menu innovation as well. And just as of last Friday, I tasted some more terrific products. I think we will have some great news coming out in 2020 that I think our customers will find exciting. And then broadly to the opening point of your question around the deals that are out there in the marketplace now, I think the restaurant companies have gotten smart and they’ve realized that aligning with one delivery partner probably doesn't make a lot of sense. If you go out there and get two or three of them, you can get them to beat each other up and give you a better deal, so not surprising to us at all that that’s that's happening in the marketplace. And then long term, we're not sure how sustainable some of those economics are for the third parties, which is part of what drives that near-term uncertainty around to 2- to 3-year outlook. So, we're going to continue obviously to keep a close eye on what's happening in the competitive environment, but to really stay focused on the things that we can do and that we can control to drive value and service for our customers.
Nick Setyan: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris O’Cull of Stifel. Your line is now open.
Chris O’Cull: Thanks. Good morning. Ritch, my question is about the decision to ramp up fortressing. What gives you confidence that U.S. franchisees will execute this plan, especially if comps are expected to slow. It would seem that slower comp performance would eventually weigh on their willingness to develop units, but maybe I'm wrong.
Ritch Allison: Yes. So, what really drives unit development is the cash on cash return. For those new units, both the individual unit, but then also the overall cash on cash return for the cluster or the area of stores that impacts. And what we continue to see in the business is that we’ve got very strong cash on cash returns, and I talked a little bit earlier, we're going to put our money where our mouth is on this as well with respect to our corporate store business. We are getting terrific returns in our corporate stores, and therefore we’re going to push aggressively over the next three years to fortress the territories that we operate in there. And we're hearing the same from our franchisees. And the results around this it is not only the near-term financial returns that franchisees get, but it's also how this reinforces their relationships with their customers locally because of the great service that they provide. And I was just looking at some numbers this morning, one of the things that we’d love to do is, is give you over time some examples from around the business. We’ve talked to you about Seattle in the past, and we talked to you about what we were doing in Las Vegas. And we talked to you about Roanoke, Virginia, and some of the things we're doing there. I’m looking at our Dallas-Fort Worth DMA, and if you lived in Lewisville, Texas last week, where we’ve got three stores, the worst-performing store on delivery last week in Lewisville averaged 16.5 minutes average delivery time with zero deliveries over 45 minutes. So, when we go out there and fortress not only do we create great economics for our stores, our franchisees, and for the drivers that are delivering these pizzas, but also this is just an unmatched experience around customer service. So these are the kinds of things when our franchisees see this and when we see it with our corporate store business, it gives us more conviction that the right thing to do while we are playing in a position of great strength here with our unit economics is to go faster and to take advantage of this disruption in the marketplace.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim. Your line is now open.
Matthew DiFrisco: Thank you. Ritch or Jeff, your comments imply somewhat of an unchanged outlook for the profit growth. I was wondering if: a, can you help us reconcile that with the lower same-store sales outlook, the model's ability to, I guess, sustain EBITDA growth ahead of retail sales? Are there G&A belt-tightening opportunities on an ongoing basis? And then, b, if you could sort of tie that into from a franchise perspective, the $141,000 per store with a lower same-store sales outlook, are there the net benefit still from seeing better carryout and that higher margin sale opportunity? Is that able to offset maybe the headwinds from a lower same-store sales outlook?
Jeff Lawrence: Hey, Matt, it's Jeff. I appreciate the question. The first thing we would say is, on a store by store basis, franchisees are going to make order of magnitude more than anybody else in the QS pizza industry in the United States, we know that for sure. We still got three months ago, so there's a lot of pizza to be sold and lot of money to be made. But there's still going to be from a great position of strength and from an enterprise perspective, as Ritch mentioned, approaching about a $1 million of operating cash flow per independent franchise partners. So great strength, great cash available to reinvest in the brand and we’ve seen that. So, again, whether that comes in ultimately, and we will update you on that exact number early in 2020 once we actually get it. Whether that comes in a $1,000 or $2,000 higher or lower, doesn’t fundamentally change the way their approach in the business as far as running the business and investing in the business. As it relates to G&A on our side, during my prepared remarks, you will note that we brought in our -- both our capital expenditure, 2019 guide as well as our G&A 2019 guide. So as we’ve done in the past, we expect to give you a new view of that for 2020 -- in 2020 once we’ve been able to roll up all the plan. But I think what that shows is we’re always looking to be disciplined and prioritize the investment that we know it's going to take to really take advantage of our number one position and really get to that dominant number one. The last thing I'll say is, I can tell you that even though we brought in the 2019 CapEx and G&A guides slightly down, which we think is a good thing, I can tell you that all of the important projects and investments that we know, we need to make around technology, around image, around product development, all of those things are still getting done and done again from a position of strength. So still investing front footed, but we're doing in a little bit tighter recognizing the current system. But we're not leaving anything on the table. We are going to make sure we invest in everything we need to get to a dominant number one and we feel great about that, our franchisees do as well.
Matthew DiFrisco: So from a G&A perspective, would we -- would it be correct not to assume then you’re just shifting, maybe some $19 into $20 and that there is an implied ramp up into $20 to make up for the $19 or what your cutting or finding the savings in $19 is something sustainable through $20?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. I mean, we will give you a 2020 guide, when we get into 2020 on G&A and CapEx as we’ve always done. But the $19 guide changes are just a result of running at little bit more disciplined, little bit more prioritized. But the important part there isn't the $19 versus $20 thing. The important part is we're investing in all the things we need to do is to get the dominant number one.
Matthew DiFrisco: Thank you so much.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh of Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open.
William Slabaugh: Yes. Thanks, guys. Just wanted a quick update on some of the more recent initiatives such as the 20% off late-night, the delivery insurance, which seem to be more directly going after delivery competition. Just curious how that affected your late-night and delivery business as you launch those? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Hey, Will, it's Ritch. We just launch those in September, so really in the fourth quarter, so we can't really comment on results from those initiatives yet. Certainly the advertising, we think is terrific. So we're optimistic about the programs, but no comments on the results today.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Charles of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.
Andrew Charles: Yes. Just to piggy -- thank you, guys. Just to piggyback a little bit on the last comment. I’m just curious about the timing of the guidance change following the confidence in the prior Investor meeting of 32 days ago. And I can understand that you don’t want to get into the dynamics of what’s going on in the fourth quarter. But you did mention that the guidance, new guidance range is proactive and not reactive, and so can you just confirm that there is nothing in the performance of the first 30 days of 4Q that did in fact provoked the lower guidance?
Ritch Allison: You know, Matthew, we don't talk -- Andrew, excuse me, we don’t talk about the current quarter. I will tell you that there's no real magic to the timing that it's not a reactive decision, it's a proactive decision to change the structure of the guidance all in an effort to make it more meaningful and relevant to our investors.
Andrew Charles: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alton Stump of Longbow Research. Your line is now open.
Alton Stump: Thank you and good morning. Just wanted to ask about your comments, Jeff, that it was a very competitive quarter. Is that a sign that we're seeing even more competition coming from third-party providers, or was that level of competition unchanged in your view in 3Q versus the second quarter?
Ritch Allison: Alton, it's Ritch. No real major change in the level of competition that we see out there. Still a pretty heavy stream of advertising and discounting out there in the marketplace that we see, but no significant ramp up or down from prior.
Alton Stump: Okay. Thanks, Ritch.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
John Glass: Hi. Thanks. Ritch, I appreciate the detail on the carryout business and how large it's gotten relative to the delivery business. Can you dimensionalize how the relative comps are doing in those two businesses, if not absolutely maybe just on a relative basis? Is carryout just growing so much faster that, that’s really the story right now on a comp basis and that’s why you’re legging into fortressing? If you can kind of help us understand where delivery is versus the carryout business? And also advertising spend, I think you noted a couple of quarters ago, aggregators are spending more on advertising. Others have also noted that and that’s sort of elevating them relative to traditional brands? What can you do about that? Is there ways you can shift advertising dollars back to reinforce your message in the marketplace versus what’s going on now?
Ritch Allison: Thanks, John. On your first question around the carryout business, absolutely we're getting terrific growth in the carryout business overall and then also on a same-store basis. When we look at the delivery business, the delivery business continues to grow overall. We had some pressure on the comps, but overall delivery sales are higher than they were a year-ago when we look at it in total across our system. But certainly a more rapid pace of growth in the carryout business. Then to your next question around the share of voice in the advertising, we are fortunate on two dimensions. One is to have a pretty hefty warchest for advertising. And second is, to have some really smart folks who run the analytics about how we spend that money on behalf of our franchisees on an ongoing basis. So we are constantly running our media mix models and tweaking the mix of spend both across channels, but also with respect to how that spend goes across the various messages that we are communicating, be that carryout or delivery for example. So it is a constant thing that we manage on a very active basis.
John Glass: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Katherine Fogertey of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Katherine Fogertey: Great. Thank you. I was hoping if you could kind of comment on the cadence of the quarter, in particular, help contextualize both on the carryout and on the delivery business, the impact that some of the more promotions that you ran during the quarter had, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Katie, no real comments kind of intra-quarter on the cadence of things. We continue to actively manage the calendar against both of our businesses, the carryout and the delivery business, but no real, I guess highlights to callout based on the cadence within.
Katherine Fogertey: Maybe another way to ask it is, when you look at your customer data, are you seeing that these promotions are driving frequency, or a new customer is on to the platform?
Ritch Allison: So we're constantly running programs to drive both with an all-out effort around traffic. So, we have certain things that will often bring new customers into Domino's. And one of the things that you see is that we run -- periodically we will run a 50% off delivery for a week or we will run a carryout special during the course of a week. Those are great vehicles to bring new customers into the Domino's brand. And then we’re also using this incredible database that we have of 23 million active members of our loyalty program and 85 million active customers in total. So we are constantly looking at ways that we can use the power of that data to help us reach out to customers that we've already acquired and identify ways to drive increased frequency. So the answer for us really is both. Our teams are constantly working on both of those levers to drive sales growth in the business.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
Gregory Francfort: Hey, thanks for the question. Ritch, I think earlier in the Q&A you talked about why the economics don't work for third parties or brands that are partnering with third parties. Can you talk a little bit about why the economics work for Domino's, but they don't work for the aggregators? Just maybe explain some of the differences and I don't know if it's brand density or product -- product life or anything like that just in terms of what the major differences are in terms of why your delivery orders are profitable and your competitors are not? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Well, I -- Greg, I'll leave it to you all as the analyst to figure out the profitability of the third-parties, but I will just focus on our business. We’ve got a -- we got a terrific business model and that we take -- and I will try to describe it a little bit holistically and we will get into to kind of contextualize the delivery component. So we build these boxes. They cost about $350,000 or so on average to build. And then we run two businesses through those boxes that complement each other. We run a carryout business and we run a delivery business. Now the dynamics of those two businesses are different. But they complement each other in that they give us a really profitable pizza production engine that then allows us to offer delivery, and it is in any business, some of those delivery orders are going to be more profitable than others. A large ticket order that is 200 yards from the store is going to have phenomenal profitability. If we take a $15 order nine minutes away from the store where labor is $15 an hour, that's not going to be yet profitable at delivery. But because we're running so much volume through this box, both in the carryout channel and the delivery channel, it gives us an opportunity then to drive great economics for the franchisee in a way that also allows us to offer compelling value to the customer. And we just believe that, that captive system is a much more efficient business model, Then a business model that has a restaurant, which is separate from a third-party service that ultimately does the deliveries.
Gregory Francfort: Helpful perspective. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is now open. And Sara, your phone is on mute. Please unmute.
Sara Senatore: Hello. Can you hear me?
Ritch Allison: Hi, Sara, we can hear you.
Sara Senatore: Sorry. Just a question on the international markets, please. You said that the competitive set is -- it's different, but there are other issues too, I guess. Could you just talk a little bit to what those are. I know you’ve mentioned value in the past. And also some of your licensees they’re partnering with aggregator. Is that helping them, is there anything to convince you that maybe that’s the right strategy in the U.S. too. Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Yes. So Sara, on the first part of your question around what we're seeing in some of the international markets? The answer is that the issues are a little bit different depending on what market you happen to be in. I mean, we benefit broadly from having a really diversified portfolio of international markets. But at any given time, we always have some that are blowing the doors off in terms of sales growth and we -- and then we've got something that are a little bit challenged. Oftentimes, more often than not, when we are a little bit challenged, it does tend to come down to the value positioning in the marketplace. And in some of our international markets, we don't have as much capability in place around some of the analytics that we have here in the U.S. that really allow us to sort through the value maximizing price points out there in the market. So we've stood up over the course of the last year, the centers of excellence where we've now got some of our teams here that are working alongside some of our international franchisees. It just takes time for some of that to come through to gather the data, to do the analytics and to effect the change in some of those markets. So I'm optimistic, very optimistic, about the long-term success of that international business. As all of you probably know, it is quite near and dear to my heart having personally spent over seven years leading that business and having personally put my feet on the ground in more than 70 of the countries that we operate in around the globe. But I have a high level of optimism we have terrific master franchisees who are committed to growing their businesses. The second part of your question was around the third parties. Now in none of our international markets do we allow third parties to deliver our food. That's kind of first and foremost, and that is an unbending and unyielding position that we take because we feel so strongly, so strongly about the customer relationship and our ability to show up at the door with a Domino's uniform Delivery Expert. We also feel so strongly about the quality and the safety of that product as it goes from point A to point B. But on the front end, we do have some international markets that are working with third parties to generate orders. Now in some cases, there are structural differences in the market that lead us to that place. China is probably the best example of that where the third parties are quite dominant. And while our business is growing really rapidly right now, on a relative basis, we are still a pretty small player in China with -- approaching -- tracking toward 250 units. So that's still a pretty -- on a relative basis, we are still relatively small. So those third parties are an important source of order of growth. There are some other markets around the world where I think our master franchisees have done an effective job of partnering with the third parties. But we've also got some markets where, to be honest with you, we've been on those platforms for a little while, and we really don't see any meaningful growth in the business. So it is a constant thing that we are working with our master franchisees on. The benefit of having that diversified portfolio of markets is that we can look for lessons learned that we think might come back and be applicable to the U.S. And I can tell you that if I saw any lessons learned out there that, that I -- that would lead me to believe that we should be doing this in the U.S., then we would more actively consider it. But when I take the context of the fact that we've got a database of 85 million active users, a loyalty program of 23 million plus active users, terrific technology that we've spent many millions of dollars building over time, I feel like we are in a place where we are far better served to protect that data to not share that with third parties; and secondly, to protect the economics of our franchisees because while, as was discussed on the call earlier, certainly some of the more recent deals with the aggregators that they have -- with restaurant companies, certainly some of those deals have been more favorable. Let's talk about the deal that a Domino's Pizza franchisee gets when they pay $0.25 per order that we send to them, which is just north of a -- 1 percentage point of ticket. I think it would be hard-pressed to go out there and find third parties that were willing to send orders for just over 1%. So that's our perspective there.
Sara Senatore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Your line is now open.
Dennis Geiger: Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a bit more about the ticket contribution in the quarter and just generally how much of that contribution is from the higher delivery fees and then from pricing and how much of it is from what you're doing to drive mix through things like smart tickets? And I guess more importantly, just looking ahead, how you are thinking about those components at a high level and what kind of opportunities you still have with that smart ticket as you think about the size of your loyalty program and all your digital capabilities? Thanks.
Jeff Lawrence: Hey, Dennis, appreciate the question. This is Jeff. First thing on the ticket for the U.S. business in the quarter, certainly, some franchisees on balance taking some menu price, also some delivery fee there. They use the data that we work with them obviously to try to make a good decision there and as we mentioned it a couple of times today, when you have 85 million active customers in your database, you have a lot to work with when you try to tackle the real thorny issue of pricing in every neighborhood. Always trying to also sell more food, obviously, more mix. I think as Ritch mentioned earlier, with cross variety that we're talking about, we've done the more than pizza television ad mostly during Q3, which really highlights the broad menu for our pizza company, always trying to get additional food in the ticket as well. Having talked about ticket, doesn't change our primary focus, which is the hard stuffed. It is a little bit harder right now, given the dynamism in the industry that especially around the delivery business, traffic is a little harder to get than it was two or three or four years ago, but we remain focused on driving traffic we think we will get back to that spot. But right now, you're seeing a little bit more ticket during the third quarter than traffic, but doesn't change the overall philosophy of what we're trying to chase.
Dennis Geiger: All right. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is now open.
David Tarantino: Hi. Good morning, Ritch, I wanted to revisit the targets for the comps in the U.S., and I appreciate that you've been running inside that range year-to-date. But if I look at the six quarters, the comp trend has been in a gradual mode of deceleration. So I wanted to ask, I think if you think about the targets to be achieved, you need to I guess stabilize this trend of deceleration. So wondering how you're thinking about your ability to do that and what's needed, whether you think that's inside the control of what you have planned, or are you assuming that the environment or competitive environment gets better. I guess how are you thinking about your ability to sort of stay above 2% in the near-term relative to your targets?
Ritch Allison: Yes, David, thanks for the question. And we do take a look at both of those elements, the elements that we can control, and then obviously, there are elements out there in the marketplace that are happening around us. When we take a look at -- if I start with the second part of that, we do still believe that there's a good bit of uncertainty out there. As I mentioned earlier, we didn't see any significant change in the aggregator pressure in the third quarter versus the second quarter. But where we spend the vast majority of our time thinking about is the things that we can control. And so, when we take a look forward, I'm pretty excited about the programs that the team has developed as we go into 2020, which are going to continue to reinforce some of the things that are really important to us. Number one, we are going to stay focused on value as we always do. We've got some technology and some operational initiatives all around service and that is both for our delivery business, but also for this rapidly growing carryout business that we have. And I spoke first about value and about service because as we look at the consumer research out there, the two most things that we hear from customers that either delight them or that cause them not to be so happy about delivery coming from anybody are did they feel like they were charged a fair price; and secondly, did they get great service? So we're going to stay focused on those. Then third is -- and I mentioned this earlier on the call as well, we do have some innovation that I'm excited about on the food front as well. And yes, we haven't brought any new products forward in a while. And so I think some news there is also something that is due and I think will be exciting to our customers. So when I take a look at it all in, we believe that we've got factors under our control that can allow us to continue to grow our business from a same-store sales perspective, continue to get new stores on the map because the economics are great. And when you roll it all together to continue to grow our market share, which is over time as we think about how do we continue to establish this as the dominant pizza brand, but also a long-term taker of share in the marketplace, it really is about all of that rolled together.
David Tarantino: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Your line is now open.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks. Ritch, I think you mentioned new menu innovation, new product news coming in 2020. I think it's been several years since we -- you've launched a new product. And historically, you launch them in the second half of the year. So can you give us some color around, did you plan this to be a first half of the year-type launch or do we need to wait again? So are you guys going to follow a similar pattern, launch in the second half of the year? Any color around it, whether it be entree, dessert sides, anything of that nature would be helpful. Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Pete, really, nothing I can share with you on the call this morning about the timing or the items. Really, from a competitive standpoint, that's information that we would like to keep close to the vest.
Peter Saleh: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Ivankoe of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the comments about service being a major focus. Even market-by-market, have you seen any difficulty of attracting and retaining drivers? That’s kind of the first point. And secondly, something that at least we've heard and some of this may be anecdotal as to how has been an increase in "late orders," orders that are arriving later than at least what consumers perceive a Domino's order should take. Has there been any decrease at all as you guys look at the empirical evidence, not the anecdotal evidence, service levels that may have slipped over the past couple of years and that actually may be an opportunity going forward for you to improve that?
Ritch Allison: Hey, John, thanks for the question. First, on the drivers. It's most certainly a tight labor market out there right now. I think the last statistic I saw was 3.5% unemployment in the U.S., which is as low as it's been in I don't know, maybe 50 years. So yes, it is a tight battle for talent out there and for drivers all over the country. And -- but the interesting thing is, when we go around, the franchisees that are really focused on their teams and investing in the growth and development of their teams. They are fully staffed is what I'm hearing out there in the marketplace. They're making it happen, and we're getting terrific delivery service. We're not doing that all over the country right now. We do have open positions for drivers in a lot of markets around the country where, frankly, we just -- we got to get better. We are seeing drivers, and as I travel around, I visited a lot of stores, I am hearing a lot of stories of drivers who are coming back to us from some of the gig economy opportunities that they may have left us to join and realized that maybe the grass isn't always greener there. And part of what we try to work with our teams on is to make sure that these drivers understand that there is an opportunity at Domino's Pizza that doesn't exist in a lot of these other areas. I mean we have 90% of our U.S. franchisees started as drivers, and we have our franchise management school that we run here in Ann Arbor, which is producing a new crop of franchisees that are coming into our system. We see the same story there. We see folks that started as drivers or insiders and worked their way up through. So the battle is ongoing, but our franchisees, I think, are up to the challenge. As it relates to service, we've recently put more of a focus on making sure that we manage any late orders because it's interesting, those are the orders that can really drive a negative perception in the minds of consumers. And so, we put a heightened focus on that here in 2019 and we're going to continue to do that going forward. So while I would not say that we're seeing any significant negative movements in service, it's not moving positive as fast as I would like it. It is where we are running our -- where we feel our fortressing stride, in certain markets we see some significant improvements, but it's not broad enough across the system right now for me to be satisfied.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Anderson of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Stephen Anderson: Yes. Thank you very much. Just wanted to piggyback on some of the comments you discuss on some of the technology initiatives, I know you talked about in the past year new plan sales system and more front burner supply chain automations. Just want to see what you've picked up recently as you’ve learned from some of the newer -- new Edison, new Jersey location, what you brought over to some of the older supply chain facilities and I wanted to get maybe an update on the -- your new point-of-sale test.
Ritch Allison: Got it. So, yes, Stephen, we’re certainly continuing to invest. As Jeff said earlier, even with little tighter management around CapEx and expense, we are still fully funding all of the key technology initiatives that we have inside the company. Our next-generation point-of-sale system progressing along really nicely. I was in the lab myself where they handed me an order script and I was actually able to enter it in myself with no training. So not only are we building a more robust system, but which one -- but also one that will enable more rapid training of our team members, which I think is critical. We are still tracking toward getting that system in a pilot store by the end of this year. And then as we continue to work through our planning, we will have a -- what will be a multi-year rollout of the system. And when you think about it, this is a system that is present today in over 13,000 of our 16,000 plus stores around the globe. Second, you asked about supply chain technology. We’ve learned a lot in the year since we opened our center in Edison, New Jersey, where we employed really for the first time in the U.S. system some of these new technologies. We've learned a lot, and we are taking the best of that to the next two centers, which we will open in South Carolina and in Houston. So I'm personally excited about where this supply chain team is going in terms of making sure that we've got the capacity that we need to support the terrific growth of our franchisees.
Stephen Anderson: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Slagle of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Alex Slagle: Hey, thanks for the question. Historically, the mix of digital sales in the U.S. seem to grow at 5% annually year-after-year. And it seems like we have been near the 65% level for a few years now. I know it was about 60% at the end of '16. So I'm wondering, has this digital mix been increasing as you expect, or if it has been a little slow in recent years, why would that be?
Ritch Allison: Yes. Alex, it does continue to increase, but as you might guess, once you start getting up to more than two-thirds of your orders already on digital, that kind of year-on-year pace, it's hard to add 5 percentage points and 5 percentage points again and again. But we are pushing up close to 70% in the U.S. And it's interesting in some of our international markets as well, we see incredible numbers. China, over 90% of our delivery business is digital today. So continuing to see great movement there in the U.S. and across the globe.
Alex Slagle: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Ritch, just a broader question, I guess, on the industry. One, I'm just wondering whether you think you're seeing slippage across the pizza category, whether all will be feeling kind of these third-party delivery pressures equally or whether maybe you are perhaps feeling it for some reason differently than others. And if you could just clarify your comment on the supply/demand outlook. I know you talked about significant shakeout to come. Just wondering whether you're talking specifically about the pizza category or the broader industry. I don't know if you've seen the evidence of that already, but any color on that front would be great. Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Well, first off, within the pizza category, we're still gaining significant share inside the pizza category. And if you look in -- and that's in the U.S. and globally. 6% retail sales growth in the U.S. well outpaces the growth of the category. And the 9.1%, when you normalize for currency internationally, also well outpaces the category. And we're continuing to be, as we talked about earlier, aggressive in terms of fortressing the markets that we operate in. And we see so much pizza share out there still left to be taken that we are not going to slow down in that regard. And then in some of my comments, second part of your question was around some of the shakeout, certainly, we do see some pizza competitors that are experiencing more difficulty as evidenced by closures, particularly when we look in some of the higher labor cost markets around the U.S. One of the things that really helps our business model is that we run at a volume that significantly exceeds most of the competition on a per unit level. And as these labor costs rise over time, if you're not running a high-volume business in QSR pizza, it gets more and more difficult to compete. It also gets more and more difficult to compete in a pizza delivery business if you're not shrinking down the radius of your territory for delivery because that is the key -- that wage rate is the key driver. And you really have to improve over time the number of deliveries per driver per hour that you can get. So we look at an industry that's under pressure from labor costs that -- an industry that is transitioning volume from dining in to delivery without any increase that we can see in terms of overall growth in the restaurant industry. So a lot of restaurant companies are trading orders from a more profitable to a less profitable channel, while wage rates are going up. So that is why when we talk about a shakeout to come, this is not an industry that starts with 40% profit margins typically. So there is not a lot of room for some of these players to seed margin to a third-party on one end, while labor costs are going up on the other.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Levy of MKM Partners. Your line is now open.
Brett Levy: Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. If we could go back to -- very impressive numbers, 23 million active, 85 million overall loyalty and email members. So is there anything that you can see out there, either across these different cohorts that's different? And also, do you think that you need to maybe adjust your approach to how you're talking to either the most loyal piece of the pie members or the other 60 million that are out there, because we've seen other competitors who've really stepped up their depths and breadth of loyal members and we've started to see them reaccelerate. So is there something you can do? Is there something you're seeing under the surface that we're not seeing? Any color would be helpful. Thank you.
Ritch Allison: I think there are quite a few things that we can do over time to take more advantage of this incredible asset that we have, which is this database of customer information that we have. And we've challenged our teams here to think about how can we get closer and closer to those customers. So how do we -- I guess the ultimate thing that everybody strives for is people use the term one-on-one marketing. Well, we've still got a long way to go between where we are today and that point over time. So it's something we think about quite regularly. And with the data that we have that gives us a chance to really look at how customers' purchasing behavior evolves over their life cycle with Domino's, we've got an asset here that I think can help us in the months and years to come.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Jon Tower: Great. Thanks. Just hitting on the third-party delivery stuff again. Can you discuss what you've learned about the stickiness of those customers that have tried the third-party delivery services? And I guess I'm trying to go back to your comments about the lower fees or the -- yes, the lower fees or promotional activity driving a lot of the shift in demand in the market right now away from perhaps pizza. But if fees move higher, what are you guys seeing that suggests they're going to come back to the pizza category over time? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Hi, Jon. It's tough to really assess. We look at it hard, as you might guess. What we don't know yet, however, is how will the behavior evolve for customers that are now placing some number of orders through the third parties. As the full cost is -- or at least some measure of the cost is borne by the customer over time, what will ultimately happen to their behavior? We don't know the answer to that yet. But what we do know is, we know a whole lot about the elasticity of demand in the pizza category. We've got -- with 6,000 units around the U.S. and with franchisees around the U.S. who have the ability to set their own prices for delivery charges and their own menu prices, we have a pretty darn good idea about what the elasticity curves look like in the pizza category. Now we've -- and we know that pizza and we believe QSR more broadly is a pretty elastic category. So what we expect over time is that there will be some equilibrium. Once the cost to get food delivered to you has to fully support the effort that it takes to get it there, will -- only then will we know ultimately where this thing falls. But I do not expect the same number of customers to use third-party delivery once they have to pay for it as the number as that use it when it's free. If you offer to mow my lawn for free, I'm going to say, yes. When you come and charge me for it, I might just go out there and push the mower around myself.
Jon Tower: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Ritch Allison for any further remarks.
A - Ritch Allison: Well, listen, thank you once again for taking the time to join us this morning. And we look forward to getting back together with you in February and to sharing the results of the fourth quarter. Thanks so much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-16 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Domino’s Pizza Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim McIntyre, Executive Vice President of Communication. You may begin.
Tim McIntyre: Thank you, Sonia, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our conversation today regarding the results of our second quarter 2019. The call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Ritch Allison; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence. As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask all members of the media and others to be in listen-only mode. In the event that any forward looking statements are made, I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement you can find in this morning’s release, the 8-K and the 10-Q. In addition, please refer to the 8-K to find disclosures and reconciliations of non GAAP financial measures that maybe used on today’s call. Our request to our analysts, we do -- we want to do our best to accommodate all of you today, so we encourage you to ask only one question on this call, if you would please. And with that, I’d like to turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence.
Jeff Lawrence: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued as we delivered solid results for our shareholders. We continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 33 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 102 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continued to increase our global store count at a healthy pace as we opened 200 net new stores in Q2. Our diluted EPS was $2.19, an increase of 19% over diluted EPS as adjusted in the prior year quarter, which excluded the impact of our recapitalization transaction completed in 2018. With that, let’s take a closer look at the financial results for Q2. Global retail sales grew 5.1% as compared to the prior year quarter, pressured by a stronger dollar. When excluding the negative impact of FX, global retail sales grew by 8.4%. This global retail sales growth was driven by both increases in same-store sales and the average number of stores opened during the quarter. Same-store sales for the U.S. grew 3%, lapping a prior year increase of 6.9% and same-store sales for our international division grew 2.4%, rolling over a prior year increase of 4%. Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 3.1%, while our company-owned stores were up 2.1%. The comp this quarter was driven by ticket growth. We continue to experience pressure on the U.S. comp from our successful fortressing strategy, as well as from aggressive marketing of third-party aggregators. On the international front our comp for the quarter was also driven by ticket growth. On the unit count front, we opened 42 net U.S. stores in the second quarter consisting of 45 store openings and three closures. Our international division added 158 net new stores during Q2 comprised of 171 store openings and 13 closures. We are very happy with the rate and pace of our net store growth during the first half of 2019 and note that we have opened 50% more units globally then at the same point last year. We have opened approximately 100 net units per month over the last 12 months, which we believe demonstrates the broad and enduring strength of our four-wall economics combined with the efforts of the best franchise partners in the restaurant industry. Turning to revenues, total revenues for the second quarter were up $32.2 million or 4.1% from the prior year, resulting primarily from the following. First, higher U.S. franchise retail sales, resulting from both same-store sales and store count growth drove increased supply chain and U.S. franchise revenues. Higher international retail sales resulted in increased international royalty revenues, but were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. FX negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $3 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies. These increases were partially offset by lower company-owned store revenues, resulting from the previously disclosed sale of the 59 corporate stores in our New York market to existing franchisees during the quarter. As I mentioned during the Q1 call, this transaction will help us accelerate fortressing the New York market and further allows us to remain focused on fortressing our remaining corporate store markets. Moving on to operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 39% from 37.7% in the prior year quarter and was positively impacted by the New York sale. Supply chain operating margin was up 0.6 percentage points year-over-year and was positively impacted by procurement savings and lower insurance costs, but was negatively pressured by higher labor costs. Company-owned store operating margin was up 0.9 percentage points year-over-year driven by the New York sales. We continue to experience labor rate pressures in many of our remaining company owned store markets. G&A cost increased $2.7 million as compared to the prior year quarter, driven in part by a $2.4 million loss on the New York sales. Interest expense decreased $2.2 million in the second quarter, driven by $3.3 million of incremental interest expense recorded in the prior year related to our 2018 recapitalization. Our reported effective tax rate was 12.9% for the quarter, down 2.2 percentage points from the prior year quarter. The reported effective tax rate included a 9.2-percentage-point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to equity-based compensation for the foreseeable future. When you add it all up, our second quarter net income was up $15 million or 19.3% over the prior year quarter. Our second quarter diluted EPS was $2.19 versus $1.78 in the prior year, which was a 23% increase. As compared to our prior year diluted EPS as adjusted for the 2018 recapitalization of $1.84 our second quarter diluted EPS increased 19%. Here is how that $0.35 increase breaks down. Our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.09, primarily related to higher tax benefits on equity-based compensation. Lower diluted share count resulting primarily from share repurchases over the past 12 months benefited us by $0.06. Higher net interest expense resulting primarily from slightly higher interest rates negatively impacted us by $0.02. Foreign currency negatively impacted royalty revenues by $0.05. And most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.27. It is important to note that operating results do include a $0.04 negative impact from the loss recorded on the New York sale. Now turning to cash, I would like to take a moment to highlight the continuing strength of the Domino’s financial model, in particular our cash flow generation. During the first half of 2019, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of more than $200 million. After deducting for CapEx, free cash flow generated for the first half of the year was more than $175 million. Over the past 12 months we have generated more than $330 million in free cash flow. I highlight our cash flow story not only to demonstrate our outstanding financial model and performance, but also to remind folks of our long-term commitment to returning cash to shareholders. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired $3.3 million worth of shares at an average purchase price of $269 per share bringing our year-to-date total repurchases to $11.5 million and our total share repurchases over the past 12 months to more than $280 million. We also returned $26.7 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.65 per share regular quarterly dividend. As always we will continue to evaluate the most effective and efficient capital structure for our business, as well as the best way to deploy our excess cash to the benefit of our shareholders. Overall, our solid consistent momentum continued and we are pleased with our results this quarter. We will remain focused on relentlessly driving the brand forward and providing great value to all of our stakeholders, including our customers, franchisees, team members and shareholders. Thank you for joining the call today and now I will turn it over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Overall, I am pleased with our second quarter performance. As we discussed the quarter, I will try to put things into context of what matters on our long game journey to drive profitable growth for the Domino’s brand and our franchisees. We continue to lead the pizza category and we continue to gain share around the globe, but we are a work-in-progress in brand, there have been and always will be plenty of areas where we can improve. With that context, let’s talk about the quarter. Starting with the U.S. business, our retail sales performance was once again driven by a balance of same-store sales and solid net unit growth. Our same-store sales performance for the quarter came in toward the lower end of our three-year to five-year outlook, as we continue to navigate through headwinds related to aggressive activity from third-party delivery aggregator’s. I do not expect this activity to ease in the near-term. We also continue to put some pressure on our comps through our own fortressing strategy. As we have discussed in the past, this is an investment that we and our franchisees are happy to make for the long-term growth and profitability of the business. During the quarter our, comp was mostly ticket driven, which does not signal a shift in strategy away from driving order counts, but it does reflect the franchisee flexibility being utilized at the store level related to menu price and delivery charge, having more of an impact. Make no mistake, we remain focused on utilizing data with our franchisees to drive transaction growth coupled with smart ticket opportunities where possible. It is the strategy that got us here, the strategy that is sustainable and the strategy that will help us navigate through challenges in the future. Our Points for Pies promotion extended into the second quarter and while it was a solid sales driver, I am most pleased by the progress toward our additional objectives related to app downloads, awareness and reengagement tied to the Loyalty program. I continue to be pleased with the pace of unit growth in our U.S. business, a solid quarter of 45 openings and only three closures, once again demonstrated our industry leading unit economics. Fortressing continues to be the right long-term answer for the brand and I am pleased with the strong support for this strategy within our franchise system. Our data driven approach to territory assessment has created a meaningful educated conversation around how we can best continue to win the long game by establishing closer proximity to households, driving carryout, shrinking delivery areas, improving service and lowering cost per delivery for franchisees. This approach is also creating meaningful opportunities for our franchisees to grow their enterprise profitability. We remain excited about this initiative and its positive impact on unit growth and retail sales for the remainder of 2019 and beyond. Fortressing is a critical component of our efforts to improve service to our customers, but it is not the only component. Our operators must continue to push harder every day to improve service, getting to door consistently on time with great tasting pizza. As a brand we will also continue to invest in technology to help our franchisees and operators. I am pleased to announce today that our GPS tracking technology will be launched by the end of 2019. This will be an innovation step that will bring even further transparency to the experience of tracking an order and I am pleased that we will be getting it off the ground very shortly. During the quarter, we announced our new pilot program in partnership with Nuro, as we continue to expand the self driving delivery learnings that bring us closer every day to the technology that could truly revolutionize the way we do business. We will be testing this in the Houston area this fall. We will also continue our multimarket testing of DOM voice order taking, now in over 40 company owned stores. Across these and other initiatives, rest assured that we will not slow down. We will continue to invest and innovate aggressively to stay at the forefront of our industry. For the U.S. business as we look forward, we will remain focused on our long game approach to balanced growth via volume driven retail sales, strong unit economics and franchisee help. I want to thank our U.S. franchisees for continuing to dig in, during what has recently been a unique operating and competitive environment. Beyond all other things, my top priorities remain your profitability, your long-term growth potential and staying aligned on what matters, as we head into the back half of 2019. Moving on to international, it was another very solid quarter for unit growth. While near-term challenges continue in getting comps back to levels, we are used to, our retail sales performance showed a blend of units and comps leading to a healthy result. This blend may shift over time, but so long as there is balance coupled with our strong fundamentals related to unit economics and market share, I remain confident in our proven international model. During the quarter, net unit growth of 158 stores was a strong improvement over Q2 of 2018, demonstrating the strength of our unit economics and the terrific commitment of our international master franchisees. Unit openings were strong across all regions. Same-store sales were ticket driven and we continue to stress the importance of data analytics and insights with our master franchisees, and helping to make smart decisions related to pricing and promotional strategy. During the quarter, we gathered our international master franchisees from around the world in Amsterdam for a week of best practice sharing and learning. We discussed many of the successful strategies and tools that have been developed in our leading markets around the world. It is one example of how our various centers of excellence are engaging with and supporting our international partners. Our international model and our partners are very strong. However, it is not lost on me that our comp performance over the last three quarters has come up short of our three-year to five-year outlook. While we may be near the low end of our target for a period of time, our international business remains healthy and poised to contribute meaningfully toward our 8% to 12% global retail sales outlook over time. All in all, as I look across the global Domino’s business, I am pleased with the first half of 2019. I am as encouraged by our many successes as I am by our passion and our focus on addressing the areas where we can improve. We will never stop striving to get better. And with that, we are happy to take some questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lauren Silberman of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Lauren Silberman: Hi. Thanks for the question. Can you talk about where you see the greatest opportunity to drive same-store sales? Is that from your existing customer base, whether that would be higher ticket incremental orders or attracting new customers to the platform? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Yeah. Lauren, it’s Ritch. Thanks for the question. We see opportunity honestly across both of those, both in terms of attracting new customers into the brand and also driving incremental sales with those existing customers. And during the second quarter, we continued our Points for Pies program which was all about continuing to do both of those things.  Number one, driving increased number of royalty program enrolments, resulting in additional customers coming in to the brand and purchasing for the first time, but also continuing to expand our engagement with our existing customer base, as we discussed back in January, we have got more than $20 million active members in that Piece of the Pie rewards program. So as we look forward, we see opportunity on both of those fronts.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is now open.
Mike Tamas: Hi. Thanks. It’s Mike Tamas on for Brian. I think we are sort of all just kind of wondering, what changed in the same-store sales trajectory from last quarter. You mentioned third-party delivery headwind probably peaked last quarter and then you kind of said this quarter is keep going and you don’t see any let up there. So is that -- did something change there or with the fortressing headwind that sort of changed the trajectory of your traffic or how do we think about that? And then how do you think about reaccelerating your traffic going forward just in your overall sales trends? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure. So Mike as we take a look at Q2, no - no material differences in the pressures on our same-store sales in the U.S. business. We continued to progress forward with our fortressing strategy that we have been working on for a while and we have shared with you the range of downward pressure on the comp from that. That honestly doesn’t fluctuate much on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And then we did during Q2 continued to see a significant amount of pressure in the part of third-party aggregators. There is a substantial amount of discounting out there as they drive to gain market share. And second a lot of spending on advertising in the marketplace, which puts some downward pressure on our share of voice, so same -- really a very similar story in Q1 in terms of the pressures on the comp. As I look forward and think about, how do we drive comps in the future and reaccelerate, there is -- the story is going to be fairly similar to what has gotten us here over the past several years. There are some things that are still going to matter a lot, even in this new competitive landscape. We still got to bring great product to our customers each and every day. We are heavily focused on that. We have got to remain intensely focused on value and while -- we certainly see same cost pressures into the business, we and our franchisees have been steadfast with our $5.99 mix and match, our delivery hero offer there and our $7.99 carry out offer, that’s still going to be important. We have got to drive every day to provide consistent and great service, delivery service to our customers. We are working on that every day and we will continue to invest in technology. I mentioned some of those in my prepared remarks on the call. I am particularly excited about our rollout of GPS coming later in the year, which will once again put some fantastic technology not only in the hands of our customers to get better transparency into their pizza order, but also in a lot of ways, I am even more excited about the additional information that it will give our restaurant operators as they manage the efficiency around their delivery operations.
Mike Tamas: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris O’Cull with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Chris O’Cull: Yeah. Thanks. Ritch, I know you talked a lot about the several technology tests and initiatives later this year like the GPS tracking, but are you considering any menu or value messaging changes. I understand you might want to elaborate on it. Is there anything else you’re considering in terms of the business to address the transaction declines and then I have a follow-up?
Ritch Allison: So, we are going to stay consistently, Chris, focused on value without question. As we have talked about in the past, we very regularly use our research and our analytical tools to make sure that we fully understand what the right value offering in the marketplace is to drive transaction growth over the long-term. We will continue to do that and the answer continues to come back that the platforms that we have out there and now the $5.99 and the $7.99 are still very strong and competitive value platforms in the marketplace. As it relates to menu, we don’t like a lot of other restaurant brands roll out LTOs on a regular basis. We just -- we don’t like the economics and the operational complexity of doing that. That said, we do recognize that we are in the food business and menu innovation is important over the long-term. So we are constantly looking at new menu items and platforms that we might bring forward to our customers. We are testing those on an ongoing basis. In fact I was personally in the test kitchen just about a week and half ago looking at the number of different items. And so as we develop and test and prove out those items with customers then we’ll launch them as the opportunities arise. For a product to come onto our menu, it’s got to drive incremental, not only incremental transactions, but also we are very mindful of the profitability of those items to our franchisees P&L. So we will not launch items just to drive short-term comp, we want to make sure that any new items are contributors over the long-term to our franchisees profitability.
Chris O’Cull: Thanks. And then, historically, the pizza category struggled to raise prices without affecting transactions. Do you think Domino’s has more pricing power now because of delivery fees being charged by aggregators or is it critical for the company to reverse transaction declines soon?
Ritch Allison: So I think the pricing power in the category is in the hands of the customer. There are very few QSRs that have pricing power and I don’t see a lot of that in the pizza category. A big part of our success over the last decade has been the fact that you can still get a Domino’s pizza for the same price you were paying nine years or 10 years ago and we don’t see any near-term signs of that changing.  It’s really kind of early to tell around what impact these third-party aggregators are having on kind of setting pricing in the marketplace. There has been so much discounting that even though some of the stated fees for food delivery are quite high relative to the underlying cost of the product you probably get the same push notifications I get all of the time and e mails from these aggregators with significant discounting to try to entice you to order. So we are keeping an eye not only on our traditional competitors as we always have with respect to their pricing practices but we are also keeping an eye on these new set of competitors, these third-party aggregators and we will see over time, but our experience has certainly shown that remaining focused on value is the way to drive long-term transaction growth in the business.
Chris O’Cull: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And out next question comes from David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is now open.
David Tarantino: Hi. Good morning. Ritch, just a follow-up on the last question. I think in the past you have talked about the third-party aggregators potentially creating a lot of trial with these offers that might not be sustainable. And I guess as you get further into what they are doing and see the trend. Do you still have that view, do you think this is maybe a temporary phenomenon related to the discounting they are doing. And then, I guess, secondly, you mentioned that you are not expecting the environment to change much in the near-term and I am just wondering if you would comment on your degree of confidence in maintaining comps kind of near or above the low end of your 3% to 6% target, given this environment? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Got it. So, David, it’s still a bit early to tell how sustainable the trial driving activities are. There still remains a heavy degree of discounting in the marketplace by the third-party aggregators and also heavy degree of advertising spend as well. That group of aggregators has taken a fairly significant share of voice out there in terms of the advertising landscape around food delivery.  So we expect that behavior to continue for some period of time. I think these players while the economics of the business are still I think open to question for the long-term. The near-term activity certainly indicates that investors are very willing to lose a lot of money in the near-term to try to drive trial and market share in those businesses. So we remain attentive and watchful of everything that’s going out and certainly analyzing our own data to better understand what our customer’s behavior is over time. But don’t see any signs that activity is going to slow down in the short-term. When I take a look at our business, our three-year to five-year outlook, 3% to 6% same-store sales, no changes to the outlook for us, I still see significant opportunities in our business to continue to drive solid transaction growth. We have got -- we continue to produce terrific advertising industry-leading advertising that drives awareness of the brand. That advertising is fueled by without question the largest and most powerful advertising budget in the pizza industry. We continue to develop fantastic technologies to put into the hands of our customers and into our stores to better drive operations and we are pushing, I think very importantly, very hard on service within our system, because a critical element, as we look forward into this new world where you can get anything delivered, well, we not only have to be the most economical and lowest cost delivery provider, but we have also got to be the best, getting to the door on time every time. And so, we have got a pretty aggressive push internally to take service to the next level and we have got fabulous operators within the U.S. and around the world that are really setting new standards for how great we can be in terms of our on time delivery performance and the fortressing strategy is really helping us to drive that over the long-term, as well as we tighten down these delivery areas continuing to allow us to get great service, but also improve the underlying economics of each of those deliveries.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. 
Matthew DiFrisco: Thank you. Just wanted something clarified then I do have a question. I think there was a mention early on about the same-store sales being driven not by traffic but by check in within that context some delivery charges, was there a change in the quarter as far as franchisees on aggregate taking up delivery charges, just curious if that had an effect on the traffic? And then, I just want to know, if you could speak a little bit more about the change in your tone about the respect that you are hearing now or we hear now more for the third-party guys. What changed, is it the additions of the fast food brands on those platforms, is it their new regional expansion, is it the level of discounting that they are doing, so maybe that’s temporary and when that goes away it goes away, just want to understand better sort of the anatomy of how their competitive intrusion is impacting the Domino’s brand? Thank you. 
Ritch Allison: Sure, Matt. So, on your first question, the increase in ticket in the second quarter, it was a combination both of some of the delivery charges going up and also some menu price increases that some franchises have taken during the quarter. On the delivery charges, a lot of that is -- those are more pronounced and as of the menu price increases, they are more pronounced in areas where we have seen a significant increases in wages, primarily driven by minimum wage increases, which continue to go up in states and in municipalities across the country. The second -- your second question around, our tone around the third-party aggregators. We still have the same questions that we have always had about the economic viability of the model. Certainly, there is still a heavy amount of investor subsidy that is going into the discounting to the customer and to the -- and into the incremental advertising spend. We also still have significant questions about the viability of that business model from the standpoint of the restaurants or the franchisees that are using third-party delivery. If you take a look at the growth rates and transactions in the restaurant industry and even in sales overall, there has not been a significant change in the growth rate of the restaurant industry with the entry of these delivery aggregators. So there is certainly some shift in how customers are receiving their food, more are getting delivery as opposed to going into the restaurants or picking it up themselves. But there is no real indication that there is an overall growth in demand. We also still continue to hold the belief that ultimately this is extracting profitability out of the restaurant industry for those players that are going on to these third-party platforms. Now for the brands that are going on, you can take a look at the topline sales growth, which will contribute royalties to brands. But I think the ultimate question about the viability will lay with the franchises of those brands and are they in fact making more or less money because they have gone on Board with these platforms. So we still hold a lot of the same questions around the overall business model. When I talk about the fact that we don’t expect the pressure from these third-party aggregators to subside in the near-term that is really driven by the fact that we haven’t seen any slowdown in the pace of discounting or in the pace of their investment in marketing and advertising. And when you think about it, while the behavior at first watch may seem irrational, it is actually quite the rational behavior on their part. These -- there are going to be some survivors in this business and some of these aggregators will not be around in the future, would be my hypothesis and I suspect that the desire to spend to drive share is irrational behavior in the near-term to try to be as each of these players tries to become one of those that will ultimately emerge 
Matthew DiFrisco: Thank you. Thank you very much for that answer.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Your line is now open. 
Gregory Francfort: Hey. Thanks for the question. I am -- maybe going to shift to OpEx a little bit. Can you maybe address the store level margin performance in the quarter and the New York City benefiting to help frame up either what that means for lost EBITDA or what that means for margin benefit on a go-forward basis for the next few quarters. However, you maybe want to frame it up? And then the proceeds were a lot less than I guess I’d expected, does that mean that the profitability of these stores were very low or any help on framing up that sort of multiple pay for the business and profitability change going forward that would be helpful?
Jeff Lawrence: Hey, Greg. It’s Jeff. On the New York sale, we got market price for those assets. I am really excited to get those into the hands of those franchisees who have committed not only to run those stores but also to continue to fortress that market. We are going to take that money and continue to look at the best opportunities for that, but we are definitely all-in on fortressing and that includes the remaining corporate store markets where we compete and what markets those are. When you think about the operating margin change quarter-over-quarter for the corporate stores that we reported, we were up almost a 100 basis points year-over-year, all that in New York, while New York was certainly a good and profitably market, the operating margin percentages there weren’t quite as high as some of our other even better performing market. So a little bit of a math problem there. As we continue to move forward, as Ritch mentioned earlier, labor pressures continue to persist regardless of where you are operating in the U.S. franchise versus corporate East Coast versus West Coast versus the Heartland, whether government mandated or just economically mandated. We are paying more to really attract and retain great team members who continue and not to be missed we continue to take material share in the USP of business in ‘19 just as we have for this decade or so. As we look forward, our operators, we do have the right operator, we have the right business partners, we are getting technology into their hands to allow them to better compete with both the traditional and the upstart competitors. And how money they will make for 2019, we will report to you in early 2020. But what I would tell you is, there is every opportunity in the last six months of the year just as they have had six months in the bag already to put up hopefully another record year and dollar profitability. That’s up to us and our operators to go and execute. But we have all the opportunity in the world. It’s the best economic model out there and we feel good about where the brand is going. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Will Slabaugh of Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open.
Niall Pratt: Hey, guys. This is actually Niall on for Will. Thank you for taking the questions. So, regarding unit growth internationally, as you mentioned opening growth nicely year-over-year. Could you give us a little more detail there in terms of what markets seem to be accelerating at this point or if there any market that could be stolen a bit to me a little more attention?
Ritch Allison: Niall, it’s Ritch. Yeah. We are very pleased with unit growth in our international business. The 158 net units was a really nice increase over the second quarter last year and trailing four-quarter net store growth in the international business at 939 we are very pleased with that. When we take a look across, we had strong unit growth across all of our regions around the world and in particular really pleased to see terrific unit growth in our BRIC markets, which have continued to accelerate back in January. At Investor Day, we spoke with you some about the potential that we see in the business in the BRIC markets. We had strong growth there. But then we also saw some very strong growth in some of our more mature and established markets as well. As a number of those markets are also implementing some similar fortressing strategies that we have been working on in the U.S. business as well. So, all in all, I am very pleased. When I take a look at what drives that growth, it’s the same thing that has driven our growth in the U.S. and has driven what is remarkably low number of store closures both in the international business and in the U.S. business and that is that we have terrific unit economics. The four-wall economics in these Domino’s Pizza boxes in the U.S. and around the world remains incredibly strong. So, I am really pleased with the unit growth and the very healthy contribution that gave us to our global retail sales growth, which ex-FX was 8.4% for the quarter, 9.8% in the international business. So very pleased with that 9.8%.
Niall Pratt: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. We have talked a lot about competition for customers or acquiring customers on this call, but I wanted to see kind of how you felt right now about the competition for drivers, if there are any markets that are particularly competitive for drivers and you felt that that’s impeded your execution levels in anyway and I think it’s completely related to this, but some of your third-party competition has begun to separate delivery fees from service fees, do you think that is an opportunity and whether -- and if so whether the economics because they franchisees maybe there could be potentially some enhancements for the drivers themselves?
Ritch Allison: Thanks John. I will take that one. Absolutely, there is a lot of competition for delivery drivers out there in the marketplace. Record low levels of unemployment in the U.S. and the rise of third-party delivery not only in the restaurant business but in grocery and other areas is definitively heated up the competition for drivers. And we are working with our franchisees everyday to continue to improve our service. And having the right scheduling and staffing is critically important. So we don’t talk a lot about the technologies that we are working on that aren’t customer facing, those technologies in the stores. But we have been working really hard on our store scheduling algorithms, for example, and have started to see some really nice success in our corporate store business around better service, because simply with the labor that we have available we are making sure that they are on the clock at the right times and the right days, and our franchisees are also working very hard in this area as well. There are a couple of other things that we are working on to try to help us mitigate some of the driver challenge. The U.S. market is actually fairly unique in the context of Domino’s globally and that we send the almost all of the pizzas they go out in the U.S. market go out in the passenger automobile. That’s not how we do business most of the other places around in the world. So we take -- we are looking at other alternative delivery methods in the U.S. as well and in a number of cities, we are not delivering on bicycles and then also we have got some E-bikes that we have deployed in some markets, including some of our corporate stores. Now the interesting thing about those is not only is the lower cost way to deliver food, but also it opens up some additional workforce to us, because not everyone has an automobile and increasingly young people and that kind of 18-year to 28-year-old range fewer of them seem to have cars. So we are looking at those types of methods as well. The testing that we are going to do in October with Nuro, another round of autonomous delivery testing as yet another step forward to try to get us to a place where we can reduce the dependency on the labor market and also lower our cost to delivery. When you -- the second part of your question asked about the third parties and their separating delivery fees from service fees, et cetera. We are taking a look like the fees that they charge in the marketplace just as we regularly take a look at the delivery fees that our pizza competitors charge. We take all of that data and use that to inform where we think our delivery fees should be on a market-by-market basis around the country. So we are constantly keeping an eye on that and adjusting the dials with the mindset that we want to make sure that we are not just taking short-term price or profit at the expense of long-term transaction growth over time, that’s always the balance that we try to strike.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is now open.
Sara Senatore: Thanks. I wanted to ask about the international markets use that there were near-term challenges for comps to continue. I think in the past Domino’s has may be disagreed with the licensees about what the source of those challenges might be with respect to whether it’s value proposition or something more pervasive regarding aggregators and the fortressing. Do you have any I guess color or any update on your thinking or the changes that there are being made, because it feels like it is taking some time and I would have thought that if they show value that could be lever you could push pretty quickly. So if you could talk a little bit about what the sources and whether there is any risk to unit growth if those comps do not improve? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: There is -- Sarah, thanks for the question. There is no real -- there is no one answer around the short-term challenges we have had over the last three quarters or so with respect to the international comps. The issues are different market-by-market. What we have been trying to do and it just takes times to get there is working hand-in-hand with our markets to help make sure that we are driving good fact-based decision making around things like products and pricing, et cetera, a lot of those efforts do take some time to ultimately flow through the results in the business. We gathered all of our international master franchisees just last month, where we brought a significant portion of our leadership team and our subject matter experts from Ann Arbor to meet with our master franchisees from around the world over an Amsterdam and had a terrific week of best practice sharing where we are taking tools from the U.S. and our other leading markets to make sure that we are using the best of Domino’s IP around the globe as we think about how we grow the business. Now, with all of that said, the comps which have come in below the 3 to 6 range for the last three quarters, yes, we absolutely need to improve those. The retail sales growth overall has still been quite healthy and at 9.8% in the quarter we continue to gain significant market share around the globe in the pizza category and the unit growth strength that you saw during the quarter, 171 international openings against 13 closures, once again demonstrates the strength of the four-wall economics in the international business. So while we have had some challenges with the comp over the previous three quarters, I do want to reiterate that I still have an incredible amount of confidence in our master franchise business partners, our four-wall economics, our strong, we have got leading market share positions in the majority of the big and attractive pizza markets around the world. And so we will work through the challenges that we have had together with our master franchisees, but the health of that business is still incredibly strong.
Sara Senatore: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Tower of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Jon Tower: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the comments earlier on the Points for the Pies program. Ritch I think you had mentioned that you are pleased with the reengagement in the loyalty program and how it’s having a positive impact on the business. But in aggregate the order counts didn’t contribute to comp growth in the U.S. during the period. So can you discuss what you are seeing with those members coming in through the Points for the Pies program -- Points for Pies program into the loyalty platform and are they using the brand as you expected when you launched this program back earlier in the year? Thank you.
Ritch Allison: Yeah. Thanks, Jon. Yes. So I will start my answer to your question, just to kind of once again reinforce the purpose of that program, Points for Pies, when we established it back in late 2015 we went through a lot of different iterations as to how we might build that program. And if you look at loyalty programs across brands, some are designed to drive spend, some are designed to drive transactions and engagement. Ours is absolutely designed to drive transaction growth over time. It is why it’s very simple that if you order from us basically 6 times you are going to get a free pizza. So, taking that then to Points for Pies, we entered the year with an active member base and loyalty program of over 20 million active users. We know that those members order more often than the average customer. So the goal of Points for Pies really do a couple of things. Number one, once again raise awareness of that program, if they do it in a kind of, oh, yes, we did kind of manner, because nobody gives points for buying things from a competitor, right, only Domino’s would do that. So it was a great message out there in the marketplace, great advertising that raised awareness. Then gave us an opportunity to engage and get more customers to come in and download our app, which we know once we give that app on the customer’s phone that real estate is incredibly valuable going forward. Then the enrolment in the program, getting folks in the program for the first time and then ultimately orders coming after that and we have seen nice movement across all of those metrics, across awareness, across downloads, across enrolments and then across customers ultimately ordering ones and then twice and going forward. And a loyalty program like ours is something that you do have to feed over time. So there is a need to periodically have news in the marketplace and something interesting to kind of refuel those enrolments over time.
Jon Tower: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dennis Geiger of UBS. Your line is now open.
Dennis Geiger: Thanks for the question. Ritch, wondering if you could talk a bit more about the U.S. carryout business given the increased focus there in recent quarters and then given I assume it could be better insulated from the aggregate risk, at least at a high level. Can you at least talk about the performance of carryout, how it has trended perhaps, maybe just beyond fortressing, any opportunities to support that business over the near- and longer term? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Thanks Dennis. Yes. The carryout business is still a critical component of our strategy over time and as we have talked about it we effectively operate two businesses inside the same box. We have got a delivery business and a carryout business, and as we look at them, we designed pricing, promotion, advertising for each of those individual businesses. We have seen healthy growth in our carryout business. Fortressing does play an important part of that, when we open new units the vast majority of that carryout business is incremental and its business that we weren’t getting before. So when I think about how we drive carryout going forward that will continue to be a component of it, but also you will continue to see, you know our carryout advertising on TV. We are going to continue to support that platform on an evergreen basis. And we do look at it as a piece of the business that is more insulated relative to some of the new competition in the marketplace. So, no slowdown in focus or let up on the carryout business going forward.
Dennis Geiger: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you. Just a broader question maybe on the global unit growth, I know, Ritch, you have been encouraged about the strong first half growth, but that it is more difficult to read these numbers on a quarterly basis and I know you therefore focus on annual. So does your bullish comment indicate you except up to full year unit growth guidance for I guess the 6% to 8% long-term, I suppose your both the U.S. and international comps seem to be below plan, and I guess, I asked that question more so focused on the U.S. I am just wondering whether you think your smaller mom-and-pop franchisees are more motivated by the long-term franchise profit that keeps increasing every year versus maybe they will be more cautious by the directional short-term comp trends, any color on that broader unit growth will be great?
Ritch Allison: On the global unit growth, Jeff, we don’t give full year outlook or guidance but our 6% to 8% unit growth outlook over the three-year to five-year timeframe, we still feel very positive there. And we -- based on a couple of different things, first and foremost, it comes back to the underlying unit level economics and at $141,000 per unit in EBITDA in 2018, you combine that with the low cost of getting a Domino’s Pizza store opened, the incentives that we have in place for franchisees, this is a really attractive investment for our franchisees in the U.S. And so we -- therefore we have seen really nice performance over the last couple of years in growth and lot of optimism as we look forward about franchisees continuing to want to invest in the business. And really the same dynamics hold true on the international front, while things may ebb and flow across individual markets, when we look at our portfolio of over 85 countries around the world, very healthy unit economics. And as I said last month, I was with our international master franchisees the vast majority of them and I can tell you that the optimism around the brand remains incredibly strong.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Alton Stump of Longbow Research. Your line is now open
Alton Stump: Yes. Thank you. Actually I just had a question for Jeff just on the buyback front, obviously, of course the pace of buyback has slowed here, and of course, first half versus what you had done over the prior 12 months to 18 months period. Could you just remind us how opportunistic you are with that program i.e. would you use and move like today’s downward move as an opportunity to bolster up your buyback program just maybe not so much what guys are doing today but just kind of in theory as to what your thoughts are behind that?
Jeff Lawrence: Yeah. Thanks, Alton. So we have $150 million of Board authorization left on the current buyback program. You guys know just as well as we do our long and consistent history of getting our fantastic free cash flow back to shareholders in both buybacks and through dividends after of course we invest in the business.  I wouldn’t read too much into the rate and pace of the first six months. We had other things bouncing around. We had -- we paid off our revolver for $65 million bucks year-to-date. The balance sheet -- more than $1 billion balance sheet, you have balance sheet things that move around. So -- and also I will just remind you that year-to-date last year we had about $135 million of buybacks from our recap processed, which of course, we didn’t do a recap this year so. Again, I wouldn’t read too much into the rate and place, we remain committed to generating best-in-class free cash flow and getting it back to you folks the best way we can.
Alton Stump: Okay. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Saleh of BTIG. Your line is now open.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the commitment to the $5.99 price point. I recognize you are still committed to value. But in the past you said that the $5.99 platform really only works if you are driving a positive transaction growth and it seems like this quarter your comp has really been driven by ticket. So are you seeing or hearing pushback from the franchisees at that price point and do you expect that you may change that price point if they start pushing back on that level given it has been the same price for the past decade?
Ritch Allison: Hey, Pete. It’s Ritch. We still got strong commitment in the system to the $5.99 price point and I would not read a single flat quarter on traffic as any more than it is which is a quarter. If you take a look at our performance over any period of time since we launched that $5.99 platform we have driven significant and sustained transaction growth in the business and there is no slowdown on our part relative to the commitment to continuing to drive transactions. Our franchisees understand that that is a long-term healthy way to grow their businesses and to grow their profitability. We have looked at time and time again and proven that sales and profits over the long-term are co related with transaction growth so the commitment remains.
Peter Saleh: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy Scott of Mizuho. Your line is now open.
Jeremy Scott: Hey. Thank you. If I could just follow up on the third-party question, and hopefully, I will ask it a different way. Ritch, you mentioned all the discounts push notifications, e mails that we all see the same thing. I think what is still unclear at this time is when those third party campaigns level out, they dry up or just become less marginally impactful, how that market resets or how quickly customers revert. I know you mentioned Ritch that you don’t expect it anytime soon, but the customer response the e mail number 100 is likely not the same as e-mail one or two. So I wonder if you could share some insight on comp trends in those higher trade areas that have been battling against promotions for two years or more versus those in restaurants and trade areas that have been battling third parties for about six months, maybe you can talk about the life cycle if you see one of the customer response and what would convince you that the playing field in delivery is more permanently worked?
Ritch Allison: Yeah. Sure. Jeremy a good question. I will try to talk a little bit about kind of what we see to-date but then there is also some uncertainty around how it unfolds going forward. So let me try and describe. I think there is a cycle around the third-party penetration where I think at least from what we see in places where these third parties have been in the market for an extended period of time it does tend the level off a bit. I think your point is a valid one that the 100 coupon you get is probably less effective than the second. So there is certainly some of that dynamic that we observe and we track across the many DMAs that we operate in in the U.S. But we still don’t know yet though is what the ultimate demand will be once the customer has to pay a price for the service that exceeds the cost of providing the service and that is still an unknown, as long as this discounting continues in a fairly heavy way where we are continuing to watch and learn, but I suspect it will be a little while before we know what the true customer demand will be. And then, secondly, I don’t think we yet know what supply is going to ultimately be in the marketplace as well, because there has certainly been a big rush of brands large and small to sign on with these third-party aggregators. But ultimately there -- the brands are going to have to see and their franchisees are going to have to see that there is some incrementality or profitability from using those services. And I think there are a lot of questions out there among restaurant operators as to how truly incremental this is or are they just trading a higher margin transaction for a lower margin transaction.  So there are questions still in my mind around both the demand and the supply, and until we see how some of this shakes out the true equilibrium around how much business there actually is to be had through those third-party apps I think it’s still uncertain.
Jeremy Scott: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Anderson of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.
Stephen Anderson: Yes. Just wanted to go take a little different track and discuss your new point of sale system. I know this has been something that has been under test and so I wanted to ask for an update on this test and whether you still see next year as a possible implementation date?
Ritch Allison: Yeah. Stephen, it is Ritch here, we are still -- we are working hard on our next-generation point-of-sale system and our -- with the goal of having a test or up and running by the end of the year. And then will see -- the rollout will take -- we have got more than 13,000 stores on our common point-of-sale system today, but the rollout is going to take some time. So I don’t have an update for you yet on that, but that’s something that periodically as the project unfolds will be sure to brief you all on.
Stephen Anderson: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentleman, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ritch Allison for closing remarks.
Ritch Allison: Listen, thanks to everybody. We certainly look forward to discussing our third quarter 2019 results with you on Tuesday, October 8th.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This concludes today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Domino’s Pizza First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Tim McIntyre, EVP, Communication, Investor Relations and Legislative Affairs. Sir, you may begin.
Timothy McIntyre: Thank you, Bridget, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the conversation today regarding the results of our first quarter 2019. The call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Rich Allison; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence. As this call is primarily for our investor audience, I ask all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. A friendly reminder to our analysts, please stick to one question on this call, because we want to give all 20 or so of you the chance to participate. In the event that any forward-looking statements are made, I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement you can find in this morning’s release, the 8-K and the 10-Q. In addition, please refer to the 8-K to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today’s call. And with that, I’d like to turn it – the call over to Jeff Lawrence.
Jeffrey Lawrence: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued, as we delivered solid results for our shareholders. We continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 32 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 101 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continue to increase our store count at a healthy pace as we opened 200 net new stores in Q1. Our diluted EPS was $2.20, an increase of 10% over the prior year quarter, primarily resulting from strong operational results. With that, let’s take a closer look at the financial results for Q1. Global retail sales grew 4.6% in the quarter, pressured by a stronger dollar. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 8.5%. This global retail sales growth was driven by increases in same-store sales and the average number of stores opened during the quarter. Same-store sales for the U.S. grew 3.9%, lagging a prior year increase of 8.3%, and same-store sales for our international division grew 1.8%, rolling a prior year increase of 5%. Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 4.1% while our company-owned stores were up 2.1%. We saw both ticket and order growth during the quarter. However, we experienced pressure on the U.S. comp from our successful fortressing strategy, as well as from aggressive marketing of third-party aggregators. Our international comp for the quarter was driven primarily by ticket growth and to a lesser extent order growth. As I mentioned on the call last quarter, our Q4 2018 comps were negatively impacted when compared to the prior year, as our fiscal calendar did not include New Year’s Eve. That shifted back favorably in Q1, as comps globally were positively impacted by more than 0.5 point this quarter. On the unit count front, we opened 27 net U.S. stores in the first quarter, consisting of 31 store openings and four closures. Our international division added 173 net new stores during Q1, comprised of 183 store openings and 10 closures. We have opened 1,148 global net units over the last 12 months, demonstrating the broad strength and attractive 4-wall economics our brand enjoys globally. Subsequent to Q1 and as disclosed in our 10-Q filed this morning, we have announced the sale of 59 corporate stores in New York to a group of existing strong franchisees. This transaction will help us accelerate the fortressing of the New York market and further allows us to continue fortressing our remaining corporate store markets, where we remain committed and focused. Turning now to revenues. Total revenues for the first quarter were up $50.6 million, or 6.4% from the prior year, resulting primarily from the following. First, higher food volumes, driven by strong U.S. retail sales, resulted in higher supply chain revenues; second, higher U.S. retail sales, resulting from higher same-store sales and store count growth, resulted in increased royalties and fees and higher advertising revenues from our franchised stores, as well as higher revenues at our company-owned stores; and finally, higher international retail sales resulted in increased international royalty revenues, but were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rate. FX negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $3.7 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 38.6% from 38.2% in the prior year quarter. Supply chain operating margin was up year-over-year and was positively impacted by procurement savings, but was negatively pressured by labor costs. Company-owned store margin was down year-over-year and was negatively impacted by higher labor rates as compared to the prior year quarter. G&A costs increased $5.5 million as compared to the prior year quarter, driven by continued investments in technological initiatives, as well as other areas. Interest expense decreased $4.8 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by a higher average debt balance from our recapitalization transaction in 2018. Our reported effective tax rate was 15.1% for the quarter, up 0.8 percentage points from prior year. The reported effective tax rate included a 7.9 percentage point impact from tax benefit on equity-based compensation. We expect that we will continue to see volatility in our effective tax rate related to equity-based compensation. When you add it all up, our first quarter net income was up $3.8 million, or 4.3% over the prior year quarter. Our first quarter diluted EPS was $2.20 versus $2 in the prior year. Here is how that $0.20 increase breaks down: Lower diluted share counts, primarily as a result of share repurchases, benefited us by $0.10; higher net interest expense resulting primarily from a higher average debt balance negatively impacted us by $0.08; foreign currency negatively impacted royalty revenues by $0.06; and most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.24. Now turning to our use of cash. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 34,000 shares for approximately $8.1 million at an average purchase price of $243 per share. Subsequent to the first quarter, we returned $26.6 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.65 per share quarterly dividend. One housekeeping note. As we discussed in January at our Investor Day, we adopted the new GAAP leasing standard. You will see a significant gross up on the balance sheet in Q1, but no impact on the income statement. Overall, our solid consistent momentum continued and we are pleased with our results this quarter. We will remain focused on relentlessly driving the brand forward and providing great value to customers, franchisees and shareholders. Thank you for joining the call today. And now, I’ll turn it over to Rich.
Richard Allison: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I’ll take a few minutes and speak briefly about what mattered during a solid first quarter for Domino’s. Overall, I’m pleased with our comparisons over a relatively strong quarter a year ago, particularly related to what matters most, the balanced blend of comp and unit growth that drove our overall retail sales performance. During the quarter, we continued to fortress our markets in the U.S. and around the world and celebrated an important milestone in the growth of the Domino’s brand, with the opening of our 16,000 global store on March 4 in Cheektowaga, New York. Looking first at our U.S. business, it was a good quarter for both same-store sales and unit growth. It was our 32nd consecutive quarter of positive comp performance and featured our Points for Pies loyalty-driven campaign. In addition to driving sales in Q1, the campaign grew additional awareness, participation and active membership of our loyalty program, an area we will remain focused on going forward. Our solid franchisee economics were once again demonstrated by another low closure counts with only four U.S. store closures during the quarter, it contributed toward our strong overall net store growth. I want to thank our U.S. franchisees for continuing to do a great job serving our customers and providing a very solid start to 2019 even in the face of a tough operating environment. I traveled around the U.S. quite a bit in Q1, visiting with our franchisees across the country and I remain convinced that we have the best franchisee base and the best operators in the restaurant industry. Moving to international. It was a great start to the year for unit growth with a significant acceleration over Q1 2018. We also achieved our 101st consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales, but make no mistake, I’m not happy with our recent international comp performance and the performance of a few markets, in particular. We expect more from the top line of this historically high-performing business segment and delivering growth at the levels we and our master franchisee partners expect. During the quarter, we continue to see softness in a few large European and Pacific region markets, where we have work to do to better align our value proposition with local consumers. While we certainly have near-term challenges, I want to be clear that my confidence in the model and in the business segment as a whole, has not wavered. We are committed to working with our master franchisees and to doing our part as partners to reverse the recent softer comp performance. I want to highlight one area, where we plan to step up our efforts to advise and assist our master franchisee partners. This centers around the use of and reliance on customer insights, research and data in making big strategic decisions for the business. This has been a huge driver of our success for the past decade in the U.S. Data-driven decision making has improved our performance in many areas, including advertising, pricing, new product strategy, e-commerce and loyalty. Lately, it has enhanced our performance in store sighting and development to support our fortressing initiative. This is an area where our U.S. business is significantly advanced relative to our international markets. Reliance on data and the insights has kept us educated, consistent and aligned with our franchisees in ways that would absolutely benefit many of our master franchisee partners. My team and I are focused on continuing to emphasize this and on doing what we can to help our master franchisee partners establish and grow their capabilities in this important area. With all of this said, I still believe we have the best international model in QSR. We have terrific master franchisees and the fundamentals within our International segment remain strong. I’m very confident in our business model and in the team that we have in place to lead it. We enjoy solid retail sales growth, leading market share positions and strong unit level economics in many key markets around the world. We will work with our partners to address the current challenges over both the short-term and the long-term. Lastly, I want to touch on an additional area that matters perhaps more than any other, our franchisee unit economics. I’m happy to report our final 2018 U.S. store level EBITDA. Our U.S. franchisees on average finished at $141,000 per store, leading to cash on cash returns that continue to not only outpace the industry, but signal the health of our system, the strength of our store level model and, of course, our potential for growth. At the enterprise level, our average U.S. franchisee generated nearly $1 million of EBITDA in 2018, a figure that has nearly tripled since we initially began our fortressing program back in 2012. We remain as committed as ever to the store level and enterprise profitability of our franchisees, both in the U.S. and across the globe. All in all, it was a good start to 2019. We remain focused as always to continue winning on value, winning on innovation, winning on service and winning with the best franchisees in QSR. That’s how we’ll dominate this category for the long haul as the number one pizza company in the world. And with that, we’re happy to take some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning. Jeff, you specifically mentioned that you thought aggressive promotional activity by third-party delivery weighed on the U.S. comp this quarter. You’ve already quantified the fortressing impact for us. So do you want to possibly take a stab at quantifying how you guys think about this third-party impact? And Rich, what strategically are you doing to fight through this?
Richard Allison: Hey, Brian. So I’ll take that one. We’re not going to take a stab at quantifying that impact. We’ve done that for you with our fortressing initiative. And frankly, that’s our own data that we can go in and give you a pretty tight estimate on. But most certainly in the short-term, what we saw from the aggregators was a big increase in advertising spend and push around free and discounted deliveries. And if you had the NCAA tournament on over the course of March, I’m sure you probably saw some of that as well. So we’re not surprised to see that it was driving some trial in some of the major urban and suburban markets, which I think led to slightly greater impact on our same-store sales growth than perhaps it did in previous years. As we think about our longer view and what we ultimately do about it, it’s really unchanged, frankly, if not reiterated. When we take a look across the restaurant industry, it isn’t growing any faster than it was before these aggregators entered. So at a macro level, we just don’t see a lot of incrementality. What we do see is share shifting across channels and players and frankly, a lot of profit being pulled out from some of the restaurant companies that are working with the aggregators. So it’s hard to imagine that the current approach is sustainable over the long-term, but we don’t know, we’ll have to see how that plays out. What’s clear for us is that our strategy has to remain the same, and that’s to continue to fortress the markets that we operate in. And what that helps us win on is service, helped us win with our drivers by getting them more runs per hour, and it helps us to continue to build that very important and profitable carryout business that we’ve been talking to you about for a long time.
Brian Bittner: Thank you, each.
Operator: Our next question is from the line of Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Matthew DiFrisco: Thank you. I just wondered I might have missed it. But did you guys say how much maybe of the domestic comp was did it benefit or not, or was there a lift from how you’re accounting for the points new program and the free pies? Is that included in the comp? Was that any sort of a benefit? And then I didn’t hear if you mentioned something about the go low. Is there a opportunity here internationally to lean into one of the major franchisees, maybe to bring out your digital system onboard than – rather than their internal systems they’ve been using?
Richard Allison: So, Matt, on the Points for Pies, certainly, the Points for Pies program helped us drive sales in the first quarter. But most importantly, it helped us to continue to reinforce and build membership in our loyalty program. As we spoke with you about back in January, we’ve got $20 million-plus active members in our loyalty program, our Piece of the Pie Rewards program, and we saw increases in the first quarter and app downloads and loyalty membership. And then also very importantly, as we see customers who become members for the first time and we start to see them order once and then again those are positive signs around the business.
Matthew DiFrisco: And then anything with respect to go low and potentially some of these larger international franchisees maybe adopting it?
Richard Allison: No new news to share with you there, Matt.
Matthew DiFrisco: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Gregory Francfort: Hey, guys. Maybe just on the international softness and can you parse out a little bit more what’s happening there, maybe any insights by market? And one of the things you’re pointing to is using customer insights and data better. What does that mean exactly? How do you do that? And sort of when does that start to impact the business? Is that a six-month, nine-month, 12-month, two years sort of an impact you can start to turn that back towards accelerating?
Richard Allison: So, Greg, I will comment on specific markets. I – what I will tell you though is that, softness has been more pronounced in a couple regions, including Europe and our Pacific region over the course of the first quarter. Overall, in our international business, we still grew retail sales 9.1% across the segment, so I’m still really happy with that. Now when we take a look at how we think about using data and insights, we’ve talked with you all about this for years now. It’s been a big driver of our success in the U.S. There are very few decisions that we make about product, about pricing, about marketing, about digital, about loyalty, very few decisions that don’t involve a deep reliance on consumer data and insights. We’ve established inside the business now with our new global operating structure center of excellence focused in this area, and we’ve got team members that are now positioned and accountable to work with our master franchise partners to help bring some of these same best practices and learnings to their business. And our belief is that, over the medium and the long-term, we’ll be able to help our master franchisee partners just simply make better decisions about their business, just as we’ve been able to do here over the last decade in the U.S.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris O’Cull with Stifel. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys, this is actually Alec on for Chris. In the past, the domestic system was able to drive restaurant profit with strong transaction growth and tolerate the margin decline. Now the transaction growth isn’t as strong. How are you helping franchisees stabilize the margin in this inflationary labor environment?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Hey, Alec, it’s Jeff, great question. When we look at our corporate stores as a pretty good proxy for what’s going on with the overall U.S. system, you’ll see that we did have again a quarter, where labor rates put some pressure on the percentage profit of our unit. And even though, we’re still driving very good dollar profit there, good ROI and that business has certainly been a headwind for us and our franchisees are feeling that as well. Getting back to Rich’s more important point though, continuing to go faster on the fortressing strategy, shrinking down these service areas, putting in more technological tools for our operators, both corporate and allowing our franchisees to use tools as well to manage their own independent businesses, I think, gives us a chance to continue to kind of fight through the labor rate challenges and to continue to drive good dollar profit. As Rich mentioned, we ended up at the high range – high-end of the range for unit profitability in dollars on average in the U.S. in 2018. And so you never like it when percentages are going in the wrong way, but really encouraged that we’re driving enough volume to make sure that the dollar profit continues to increase. And again, I don’t think it really changes any other strategies that we’ve communicated to you before.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. Your line is open.
David Tarantino: Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on that last question, Jeff. I guess, with the potentially lower comp rates than you had in past years and with some of these continued margin headwinds, do you think it’s reasonable to expect the profitability per unit for franchisees to be flat or maybe even perhaps that might decline this year? And then I guess, the second related question maybe more importantly is, how much margin for error do you think you have in that number before franchisees become concerned about the fortressing strategy and their willingness to do all of new units?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yes. So, again, I’d first point you to the fact that, we feel confident in our 3% to 6% comp guidance in the U.S. over the next three to five years and ultimately in that 8% to 12% of retail sales growth. We do think, it’ll be a mix of both comps and unit growth that gets us there. But while we don’t give specific unit economic guidance, what I can tell you is, we put franchise economics at the center plate of everything we do. We know that we are a football field ahead of both new and old competitors in our space. And that gives them the confidence, as you saw, again in Q1 for franchisees around the world opened up 200 net new stores. So we think franchisees are excited about the opportunity. They continue to put capital behind our brand in the U.S. and abroad. And I think you saw that with the New York transaction that we announced this morning. You have franchise there in a high labor rate market, wanting to put their capital behind the brand, wanting to grow in New York City. If we can do it there, we can do it anywhere.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Sara Senatore: Thanks. Actually, I have two follow-ups, so hopefully that counts as just one question. The first follow-up I had was on the aggregator comment, you said you didn’t think it was sustainable, but it was hard to know. And I guess, I was just wondering to the extent that you’ve seen this kind of aggressive activity in international markets, or maybe aggregators are further along? Have you seen sort of a diminution over time of the promotional intensity? And then just second, I had a clarification on the international comp. You said you thought value was part of the issue, but it was a ticket-driven comp. So is that something that your thinking should evolve some to less ticket more traffic as there’s an emphasis on value? Is that sort of the evolution we should expect to see?
Richard Allison: Hey, Sara, it’s Rich. On the aggregator question, what we’ve seen in the international markets, and your point is correct. We’ve seen penetration of aggregators in those markets that has come earlier than we’ve seen it here in the U.S. What we’ve found is that, in the markets where we are doing the things that we need to do to run our business, providing fast-delivery, great consistent service to our customers and exceptional value, we found that we’ve been able to succeed and grow faster than the market even when aggregators have a very intensive presence in a particular city or country. So I continue to believe that much more of our success is going to be driven by our own actions and our own performance than it will be by the spending or the discounting or whatever the aggregators may ultimately do. The second question around the international comp and the mix of traffic and ticket. Those do tend to fluctuate over time in 2018. All of the international comp was driven by traffic. This year, in the first quarter, it’s been a mix and a bit more ticket-driven. My philosophy and our philosophy of the brand is that, over time, the only healthy way to grow your business is to grow it through traffic. Ticket is a temporary way to grow your same-store sales and may look good on a quarterly report, but doesn’t help you to sustain and grow your business over the long-term. So we are always in dialogue with our international markets about making sure that we’ve got our value proposition dialed into the customers. So that when they make their choice about where they want to buy their food, they come to us more often.
Sara Senatore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. And as a reminder, we would like to reiterate that we ask to take one question at a time. Thank you.
Dennis Geiger: Good morning. Thanks, guys, for the question. Wondering if you could talk a bit more about the U.S. carryout business, given the increased focus you’ve had there in recent quarters. Maybe just ahead at a high level, if you could try and talk about the performance how it’s trended relative to delivery potentially, given some of your comments on the aggregators? And then just anything you can comment as it relates to the benefit from fortressing on that carryout business? Thanks.
Richard Allison: Yes, Dennis, carryout business continues to grow. And, in fact, both our delivery and our carryout businesses grew in the first quarter. We continue to remain focused on carryout as a key strategic pillar in our business and fortressing is really a – it is one of the most important things that we can do to build that business, because our research tells us that customers really are willing to drive or walk or ride their bicycles very far to pick up a pizza, the maximum extent and most cities is about a mile that a customer is willing to go. So when we open these new units, the vast majority of that carryout business that we get is incremental. And back to some of the conversation that we had earlier around how we think about fighting against these new emerging competitors, these aggregators, this is a piece of the business that we can really own and terrific profits in that business, you don’t have the same complexities and costs around managing the delivery side of the business. So very much remains that commitment for us to continue to develop and grow that segment of our business.
Dennis Geiger: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Your line is open.
Will Slabaugh: Yes. Question on the domestic business. You talked about the Points for Pies promotion being one way you’re building the loyalty program. And I was wondering if you could speak to where you think you stand today as it relates to monetizing that loyalty base through smarter and more personalized marketing, messaging and just generally what the opportunity looks like with regard to that, which is – what you’re able to do today?
Richard Allison: Sure, Will. The modernization of that loyalty base has really been happening for more than three years since we began, because we know that our loyalty customers order from us more frequently and significantly more frequently than the average customer. So, our team and once again driven by the data and analytical tools that we have, we’re constantly looking for ways to continue to be more relevant to those customers in our loyalty program such that we can increase the number of times that they do business with us over the course of the year. So I don’t have specific initiatives to speak with you about this morning. But I can tell you that we are constantly trying things, running AB tests, et cetera, to make sure that we’re maximizing the potential of that now 20 million-plus base of customers that have – that are active in our loyalty program.
Operator: Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John Ivankoe: Hi, yes. I think it’s one related question with two parts. Firstly, on the international side, oftentimes we see a slowdown in international development when comps slowing yet. The first quarter was obviously an extremely strong period in terms of net unit openings. Is there an outlook for – in 2019 and 2020? And I know you don’t generally like to talk specifically of how many net openings that we should expect from international given where current comps are and the issues that exist in a few markets?
Richard Allison: Hey, John, it’s Rich. The reason we’re getting strong growth in our international business from historic count standpoint is that, the unit economics are really strong. And so, when we take a look at what drives store growth over the long-term, it really is all about unit level economics. So even though you may – we were not at the comp level that we would like to see in Q1 at the 1.8%, we’ve still got very strong unit economics across the vast majority of our markets. So that’s where you really see the tie-in over the long-term.
John Ivankoe: Okay. And then secondly, obviously, you are selling the New York company stores – 59 company stores is important as it allows you to focus on fortressing other non-New York City markets. Is that going to happen with company store development? How significant could company store development be is part of the near-term algorithm?
Jeffrey Lawrence: So, John, when we take a look at our fortressing strategy, we’re taking a look across the opportunities around the U.S. And we’re constantly thinking about where can we grow and how do we want to grow. And a big part of that is figuring out who’s the best owner and developer of those markets. And in the case of this New York sale, we happen to have six terrific franchisees who are very eager to grow their businesses. And selling these corporate stores to them gave them an opportunity to do that, both through the acquisition, but also through their forward commitment to continue to build and fortress in the New York area. And then what that allows us to do is to take the capital and energy that we would have spent continuing to build a New York and we’ve built quite a few stores in New York over the last couple of years. We’ll take that capital and energy and we’ll direct that at our remaining corporate markets, so we can continue to grow and to build the brand.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Your line is open.
Peter Saleh: Great, thanks. It’s been about 10 years now with the same 599 platform. Just wondering if the traffic momentum in the U.S. today is enough to support that 599 price point or are the franchisees pushing back and asking you guys to raise the – that value price point higher?
Richard Allison: Hey, Peter, it’s Rich. We have been on that $5.99 platform for a long time. And from a consumer standpoint, it has been a huge driver of the growth in our business. Similarly, the $7.99 hero offer that we have around carryout has been consistent and been a big driver of our business. And one of the things that we see here in the U.S. and frankly, we also see it in our international markets around the world, consistency is really important in the minds of the consumer. They want to know on a Friday night when they want to feed their family, they want to know what it costs to buy a Domino’s Pizza. So it’s been a big driver. That’s why we start with it for so long. With all that said, we’re consistently looking at price points in our business. And if we were to find a price point that was better for our franchisees than $5.99, a price point that made more money for our franchisees than $5.99, then we would – we move to it. But it’s not a decision that we sit around and make. It’s a decision that our consumers make for us through the data and the research and the analytics that we apply against this just like we do every other decision we make in our business.
Peter Saleh: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
John Glass: Thanks very much. Rich, I believe in certain international markets, Domino’s franchisees do join aggregator networks just to source orders even if you provide the delivery. Has that been successful? And if it’s been successful for them, why wouldn’t you consider in the United States, or do you think there’s just a structurally different – difference in the market and that it’s not applicable here even if it does work in the international markets?
Richard Allison: Yes, John, you’re right. We do work with our master franchisees, do work with order aggregators in a dozen-and-a-half or so markets around the world. I will reiterate that we deliver our own food everywhere. There’s – it is absolutely critical in my mind that we control the quality and the safety around our product versus handing it to some random third-party and then having no visibility into what happens to that food before it gets to the customer. I will tell you that our success in using those order aggregators outside the U.S. has frankly been a mixed bag. We have some markets where I think they have done a very good job of working with some aggregators and doing that in a way that works alongside us and is consistent with their own strategies about how they grow their digital channels. But I’ll also tell you that we’ve got some international markets that frankly haven’t done a very good job of setting up the deals in the structure in terms of how they work with aggregators. And we’ve tried to – based on the learnings across all of these markets, help our franchisees make better decisions. When I take a look at our U.S. business, I don’t see any need for us to go on to these third-party platforms. We have an incredibly strong digital channel in our business. We’re far and away the digital leader in pizza. We’ve got a loyalty program with 20 million-plus active members. So it’s just not clear to me why I would want to give up our franchisees margin or give up the data in our business to some third-party, who will ultimately use it against us.
John Glass: It’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Rich, you mentioned in your earlier comments this is kind of around the U.S. a tough operating environment. Wondering maybe if you could contextualize and it seems like with your 4% comp seemingly quite pleased with that – within your long-term range. Kind of what characteristics are you specifically referring to and maybe whether those have changed over time? And did you – and just on that point, did you mention – I know you mentioned March Madness specifically in terms of, maybe aggregators doing outsized advertising. Do you tend to see the pressure on your business specifically during those times, or perhaps do you see it having more runway and maybe it’s more of a steady basis whether there had to be advertising or not? Thank you.
Jeffrey Lawrence: Sure, Jeff. So first, on the operating environment, it really does come down first and foremost to labor. It is, as all of you know, it is a really tight unemployment environment right now, and then we’ve all – which drives really – a really healthy wage growth across the country. And then we’ve also got the dynamic in a few states and in a few cities, in particular, where we’ve had some pretty significant increases in minimum wage. So when I talk about the tough operating environment, it really is around labor costs, but then also in terms of just the availability of labor. One of the things that I travel around and visit a lot of stores and one of the best ways to grow sales in our stores is just to put more drivers on the payroll quite frankly and serve the demand that we have. So that’s what I refer to when I talk about the operating environment. Commodities have been fairly benign. We haven’t seen as with a few exceptions, we haven’t seen a lot of significant cost pressure there. And then your second question around the March Madness. I don’t know that that’s a recurring pattern year-on-year. But really what we saw in the first quarter was very heavy spend on advertising and resulting share of voice on the part of either aggregators advertising directly to the consumer or with it being part of and coupled with another QSR brand, whether advertising delivery is a channel for that brand. And we know there’s a lot of activity in that space, as some of these players work hard to raise capital or potentially position themselves to go public. So that’s what we saw in the first quarter.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Alton Stump: Thank you. Actually, just a quick modeling question I suppose for Jeff. I didn’t hear you making a change to either G&A or CapEx guidance for the full-year. How should we think about, of course, the sale of the 59 stores, if there may be any change to either of those metrics for the year?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yes, Alton, it is Jeff. We have no change to the G&A guidance that we gave you in January, which is $390 million to $395 million and no change to the CapEx guidance $110 million to $120 million. What I can tell you is, when we report more fully on the New York sale in Q2 when we speak with you all in July, will have assessed all that and if there’s a need to change that guidance, we’ll give it to you at that point. On a completely unrelated note and you didn’t ask this question, earlier in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that interest expense decreased $4.8 million, actually I should have said increased due to the higher average debt balance from our 2018 recap. So even though you didn’t ask that one, I just wanted to clean up that little faux pas there.
Alton Stump: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Stephen Anderson with Maxim Group. Your line is open.
Stephen Anderson: Yes, good morning. I wanted to follow-up with your New York asset sale. Do you have any other markets where you have a concentration of company-owned stores, where you think you may be able to see any kind of similar transaction?
Richard Allison: Yes, Steve, it’s Rich. We don’t have any plans to do anything with our additional corporate store markets today. We remain committed to building stores in those markets and to fortressing them. We’ve got a history, if you look back over, gosh, the last couple of years or even the last decade, we’ve got a history of building corporate stores and opportunistically selling corporate stores over time. Just last year, we sold some stores down in the North Carolina market, you may recall. So back to one of the things I was saying earlier, we take a look at the portfolio across the U.S. and we assess who is the best owner and developer of those markets, as we work our way toward our 8,000 store goal by 2025. And so, we’re going to build stores, we’re going to sell stores over time. We’re going to work with our franchisees on development agreements to get to the ultimate goal.
Stephen Anderson: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Andrew Charles: Great. Thank you. Rich, it appears in this year’s FDD that the projected number of domestic franchise openings is likely to slow after you’ve experienced seven consecutive years of increases. And I’m just wondering just given the visibility you have into the pipeline, as well as the health of the franchisees you highlighted with the step up in store level EBITDA from 2017 to 2018 beyond what you originally anticipated at the Investor Day. What do you attribute the slowdown in projected openings to?
Richard Allison: Andrew, rather than trying to find some golden nugget in the FDD, I just encourage you to do the hard work to look at the unit economics in the business. That’s what drives the store growth over time. And as we mentioned on the caller earlier and as you’ll see in our reporting for this quarter, we’ve had a really nice increase in our global pace of store growth. And you’ve seen very strong store growth in the U.S. for the first quarter very consistent. That’s what’s going to drive it. We look forward and we still feel very confident in our 6% to 8% unit growth.
Operator: And our next question is from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jon Tower: Hey, thanks for taking the question. Rich, you spoke earlier about Domino’s not being interested in using third-party platforms in the U.S. for listing or delivery services. And at the same time a little bit later, you spoke about the high-cost operating environment, specifically around labor costs. A large franchisee for one of your competitors recently spoke about seeing a nice labor arbitrage by using third-party delivery in some of these higher-cost markets, specifically New York, without seeing any sort of service issues. So it’s – maybe your situation is unique, but if this is the case potentially for your company, why not let franchisees explore this avenue for delivery at some point down the line?
Richard Allison: Jon, I can’t comment on the cost structure of a competitor and what their trade-off might be. But I can tell you that every time we look at this, we are the lower-cost delivery channel versus using some other third-party aggregator in our business. And frankly, that – we’re probably advantaged in that relative to the other players simply by the fact that we’ve got significantly more scale. And what really drives that cost per delivery is the number of deliveries per hour that we can get per driver and the distance that we ask those drivers to take the food away from our restaurants. And it comes back to what we’re trying to do on our fortressing program of really shrinking down these delivery areas and making sure that we not only improve our service, but we continue to be the lowest-cost delivery provider. And then the other element of it, which I just can’t emphasize enough is that, we really, at our company, placed a high level of importance on the quality and the safety of the product that we bring out to our customers. And I have a tough time sleeping at night if I was handing our food to an untrained random third-party driver to then carry that over to our customer, because what happens when you have a service failure or you have a product quality problem in that situation? Who’s to blame? And I really like the closed system and the control that we have that our franchisees have around making sure that the great pizzas that they’re producing every day get to the customer hot and fresh and delivered by uniformed Domino’s Pizza driver.
Jon Tower: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And I’m not showing any further questions. I’ll now turn the call back over to Rich Allison for closing remarks.
Richard Allison: Well, thanks, everybody, and we look forward to discussing our second quarter 2019 results on Thursday, July 18.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-21 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Domino's Pizza Inc. Fourth Quarter Year End 2018 Earnings Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program Tim McIntyre, EVP, Communications IR & Legislative Affairs. Please go ahead, sir.
Timothy McIntyre: Thank you, Jonathan, and hello everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today's call will highlight the results of our fourth quarter and full year results for 2018. The call will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Rich Allison; and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence. This call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. A friendly reminder to our analysts, we have asked you to stick to one question on this call, because we want to give all 20 or so of you the chance to participate. We will provide each of you with the opportunity for more in-depth one-on-one calls later today. In the event that any forward-looking statements are made, I do refer you to the safe harbor statement you can find in this morning's release, the 8-K and the 10-K. In addition, please refer to the 8-K to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to CFO, Jeff Lawrence.
Jeff Lawrence: Thank you, Tim, and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018. During the quarter, we continued to build on the positive results we posted during the first three quarters of the year and we delivered strong results for our shareholders. We continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 31 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 100 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continue to increase our store count at a healthy pace as we opened 560 net new stores in Q4. Our diluted EPS was $2.62, which is an increase of 25.4% over the prior year quarter. This increase primarily resulted from strong operational results and a lower effective tax rate. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q4. Global retail sales grew 6.5% in the quarter pressured by a stronger dollar. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 9.5%. This global retail sales growth was driven by increases in same-store sales and the average number of stores opened during the quarter. Same-store sales for the U.S. grew 5.6% lapping a prior year increase of 4.2%. And same-store sales for our international division grew 2.4% rolling a prior year increase of 2.5%. Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 5.7% while our Company-owned stores were up 3.6%. Both increases were driven primarily by higher order counts in addition to some ticket growth as consumers continue to respond positively to our overall brand experience. Our Piece of the Pie loyalty program once again contributed meaningfully to our traffic gains. Our international comp for the quarter was driven entirely by order growth. During the quarter, all of our geographic regions were positive. Our comps were negatively impacted when compared to the prior year as our Q4 2018 did not include New Year's eve. We estimate that both our U.S. and international comps were negatively impacted by approximately 0.5 point by this calendar shift. We expect Q1 2019 to be positively impacted by the calendar shift. Separately and as discussed at our Investor Day, U.S. comp in 2018 were negatively impacted by a 1 point to 1.5 point, due to our store split fortressing strategy and investment we are willing to make toward our long-term growth. Our international comp was also negatively impacted by store split. On the unit count front, we are pleased to report that we opened 125 net U.S. stores in the fourth quarter, consisting of 127 store openings and two closures. For the full year, we opened 258 net U.S. stores, the most U.S. net store openings we have had since 1988. We are also very pleased to announce that our international division, added 435 net new stores during the quarter. The 435 net new stores were comprised of 472 store openings and 37 closures. For the full year, we opened 800 net new stores in our international division. On a total Company basis we opened 560 net new stores in the fourth quarter and 1,058 net new stores for the full year 2018, demonstrating the broad strength and attractive 4-wall economics, our brand and franchisees enjoy globally. Turning to revenues, total revenues for the fourth quarter were up $190 million or 21% from the prior year. As a reminder, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we are now required to report the franchise contributions to our not-for-profit advertising fund and the related expenses, gross on our P&L. Although this did not have an impact on our reported operating or net income in the fourth quarter, it did result in a $112 million increase in our consolidated revenue. It is important to note, although these amounts are included in our financial statements they are restricted funds that can only be used to support the Domino's brand and are not available to be used for general corporate purposes. The remaining $77.7 million increase in revenues resulted primarily from the following. First, higher food volumes, driven by strong US retail sales resulted in higher supply chain revenues; and second higher US retail sales, resulting from higher same-store sales and store count growth resulted in increased royalties and fees from our franchise stores as well as higher revenues at our Company-owned stores. International royalty revenues were down from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rate. FX negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $3.6 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies. For the full fiscal year, foreign currency negatively impacted royalty revenues by $1.1 million. Moving on to operating margin, as a percentage of revenues consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 38.2% from 31.5% in the prior year quarter. This increase resulted entirely from the recognition of US franchise advertising revenues on our P&L from the new accounting guidance I mentioned previously. Company-owned store margin was down year-over-year and was negatively impacted by both higher food and labor expenses as compared to the prior year quarter. Supply chain operating margin was up year-over-year and was positively impacted by procurement savings, but was negatively pressured by labor and delivery costs. G&A cost increased $15.8 million as compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by continued investments in technological initiatives as well as investments in our supply chain, our marketing and our international teams. We also had two items that largely offset for the quarter. A $4 million pretax gain on the sale of Company-owned stores to franchisees in Q4 2017, which reduced G&A in that period. And a $4.6 million reduction in G&A in Q4 2018 resulting from the adoption of the revenue recognition guidance primarily related to the reclassification of certain advertising expenses out of G&A into US franchise advertising costs. US franchise advertising costs were $112.9 million in the fourth quarter, as a reminder, beginning in fiscal 2018 we are showing US franchise advertising in our revenues with an equal and offsetting amount of expense in our operating costs. Interest expense increased $6.8 million in the fourth quarter, driven by increased net debt from our most recent recapitalizations and a slightly higher weighted average borrowing rate of 4.1%. Our reported effective tax rate was 17% for the quarter, down significantly from prior year. This was primarily due to the lower federal statutory rate of 21% and tax credits resulting from the federal tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017. The reported effective tax rate included 0.8 percentage points impact from tax benefit on equity based compensation. We expect that we will continue to see volatility in our effective tax rate related to equity-based compensation. When you add it all up, our fourth quarter net income was up $18.3 million or 19.6% over the prior year quarter. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $2.62 versus $2.09 in the prior year. Here is how that $0.53 increase break down. Our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.44, including a $0.57 positive impact from tax reform, and a $0.13 negative year-over-year impact related to lower tax benefit on equity-based compensation. Lower diluted share counts, primarily as a result of share repurchases benefited us by $0.12. Higher net interest expense resulting primarily from a higher net debt balance, negatively impacted us by $0.09. The gain on store sales recorded in Q4 2017, negatively impacted us by $0.06. Foreign currency negatively impacted royalty revenues by $0.05. And lastly, most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.17. Let's now turn to our use of cash. First and most importantly, we invested nearly $120 million in capital expenditures for the full year. We continue to invest in our supply chain to keep up with our rapid growth, including opening our New Jersey Center in Q4 and starting work on two additional supply chain centers, one in South Carolina and one in Texas. We also continue to invest in our technology capabilities. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 636,000 shares for approximately $162 million at an average purchase price of $255 a share. For the full year, we repurchased nearly 2.4 million shares for approximately $591 million at an average purchase price of $248 a share. During the fourth quarter, we also returned $45 million to our shareholders in the form of two quarterly dividend and made $9 million of required principal payments on our long-term debt. Subsequent to year-end on February 20th, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend approximately 18% to $0.65 per share. As always, we will continue to evaluate the most effective and efficient capital structure for our business, as well as the best way to deploy our excess cash for the benefit of our shareholders. We'd like to remind you of the 2019 annual outlook items that were shared at our Investor Day in January. We currently project that the stores food basket within the US system will be up 2% to 4% as compared to 2018 level. We estimate that foreign currency could have a $5 million to $10 million negative impact on royalty revenues in 2019 as compared to 2018. We expect our growth CapEx investments to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million, as we continue to improve and build supply chain capacity and capabilities and invest in technological innovation. We expect our G&A expense to be in the range of $390 million to $395 million for 2019, and do please keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down, as our performance versus our plan, as that affect variable performance-based compensation expense and other costs. Separately, and as a reminder, we will be adopting the new lease accounting standard in the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of this standard will result in a significant growth on our balance sheet, but it is not expected to have a material impact on our income statement. Overall, our solid consistent momentum continued and we are very pleased with our results this quarter and for the full year. We will remain focused on relentlessly driving the brand forward and providing great value to our customers, our franchisees and our shareholders. Thank you for joining the call today, and I'll turn it over to Rich.
Rich Allison: Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone, I'm pleased with what was a terrific fourth quarter, one that capped another outstanding year for Domino's. Our results continue to outpace the industry and our franchisees across the globe continue to make me extremely proud. I plan to keep my commentary rather brief today, mostly due to the fact that we recently held our Annual Investor Day, which was a great opportunity to communicate, detail around our strategy and my thoughts on my first six months, as CEO of this tremendous brand. We certainly hope you found it to be helpful, filled with substance and time well spent. The updates and concepts we discussed centered around one thing, what matters. Today and going forward, I'm going to frame up our quarterly performance around these elements. Areas in metrics that I am most focused on as we execute the long-term strategy designed to help us achieve our goal of becoming the pizza industry's dominant number one. So let's revisit what matters. Retail sales growth matters, and once again we delivered. Our global retail sales growth reflected a strong balance, across our US and international businesses. For both businesses in Q4, our growth reflected a healthy blend of unit growth and traffic driven same-store sales. Looking first at our US business, double-digit retail sales growth in Q4 was comprised of a very healthy and order count driven 5.6% comp and 125 net new units. The fourth quarter marked our 31st consecutive quarter of positive US same-store sales growth and capped very strong top line performance in 2018, above our three to five year outlook range. And continually driven by focus, fundamentals and execution. I'm so proud of our US franchisees and teams who continue to lead the Domino's system. Turning now to International, we delivered strong retail sales growth for the fourth quarter and a double-digit result for the whole year. Fourth quarter net unit openings were particularly strong and represented a significant acceleration over previous quarters. Same store sales performance can certainly improve versus what we have all come to expect, but I'm pleased to see all of our comp coming from order growth. During the quarter, we had two important milestones. First, we opened our 10,000 store outside of the United States, a testament to the unit growth engine, this segment has provided to the business over a lengthy period of time. In addition, the fourth quarter was officially our 100th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth. To think that we have grown sales in our international business for 25 straight years, and 100 straight quarters, still honestly blows my mind. And is a testament to us having the best international model in QSR. I credit our master franchisees and global operators for helping the brand achieve such an impressive milestone. Continuing our discussion of what matters, let's turn to value. Value matters and continues to be a significant part of our strategy. We remain the only player within our category to deliver value in a sustained meaningful and reliable fashion. As we have for nearly a decade, our 599 delivery and 799 carryout offers in the US continue to resonate with our customers. But beyond just the price point, we continually search for and deliver additional customer benefit to the overall value equation. Technology, leadership and our loyalty program matter. Although, this call is about the fourth quarter, I can't help but note something exciting we introduced earlier this month. We launched a technology and loyalty platform like no other of its kind. The points for Pie's program allows customers to send photos of any Pizza, using our AI interface we call the Pie identifier and earn points in our Piece of the Pie loyalty program. It is one more example of how we do things a bit differently, always trying to stay ahead on how we make news. Generate brand engagement and in this case grow awareness and participation in our loyalty program. As we updated you at Investor Day this platform with over 20 million active users has been a meaningful driver of sales performance and frequency over time, and I am very excited about the launch of this unique program. Franchisee profitability and unit economics matter. Franchisee profitability is at the center of everything we do at Domino's. We anticipate average US franchise store EBITDA to be in the range of $137,000 to $140,000 per store for 2018 with global cash-on-cash returns at better than a three-year payback. Very few in this industry and certainly our category will provide this figure. We will continue providing information on store level economics, because it is a top priority for us and certainly should be for you as shareholders of any restaurant brand. The health of our business and system is heavily reliant on our franchisees' success. And their enterprise growth and profitability will be a certain priority for me as CEO. Few metrics demonstrate the relationship between store level economics and growth potential better than unit openings and most notably closures. You have heard us discuss for several years now, how closures is a top indicator of the health of a franchise system and I'm thrilled to say that we closed only nine US stores in the full year 2018, nine when combined with international, our global closures number of 125, of a base of nearly 16,000 stores is a true testament to strong global unit economics. A component of the Domino's story that gives me a great deal of confidence and belief in our long-term potential. Our proven four-wall economics continue to pace the industry and it's just another reason why there has never been a better time to be a growth-minded franchisee at Domino's. In closing, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results. By focusing on the long-game and what matters, I am extremely confident that we are well positioned for success. 2019 is only the beginning of our pursuit to win and accomplish our long-term goal of dominant Number 1. And with that, we're happy to take some questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your question please.
Peter Saleh: Hey, guys. Great, thanks. I just wanted to ask about the international, real quick on, I think you said the comp growth has been driven primarily by order growth. What's the dynamic going on the check are you seeing your franchisees internationally discount to drive some of that traffic or just any commentary on the check would be helpful.
Rich Allison: Sure. Pete it's Rich. On the check what we are consistently trying to do as a brand across the globe is to stay focused on value. We talk about it a lot in the US with 599 and 799, but we're also focused on it in our international markets as well. And the approach that our growth minded master franchisees are taking is really around driving transactions, driving order count as opposed to taking price increases over time. So what you saw in 2018 was really that continued focus to make sure that we're driving growth, the right way.
Peter Saleh: Great. And then just domestically, the comp growth 1% was still a little bit below what we were anticipating. Did you see any deterioration in delivery times or any shift in the consumer behavior in the fourth quarter versus prior or was this pretty much in line with your expectations?
Rich Allison: We're really happy with the comp growth in the US in the fourth quarter. As stated earlier, it's a traffic driven comp which is exactly what we like to see with the business really healthy across all dimensions.
Timothy McIntyre: Hi everybody this is Tim. I'd like to reiterate, we really would like you to stick to just one question on this call, please.
Operator: Yes. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please limit yourself to one question, you may get back in the queue as time allows. Our next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.
Karen Holthouse: So, you previously talked about loyalty programs is something that come with sort of a natural pathway, is been one of the reasons, you expanded it outside of just digital transaction. Should we expanded points for Pie's promotion as an indication, that half-life was like starting to become more apparent in the existing program, and you needed a new jump start, can you just sort of put that in context of overall performance and confidence in the loyalty program.
Rich Allison: Sure. Karen, the loyalty program has continued to be a significant driver of comps for us, since its launched now, little over gosh, three years ago now. And as we mentioned at Investor Day in January, we passed the mark of 20 million active users. The points for Pie's program is a terrific enhancement to that program and our loyalty program does have a half-life, and our approach was not to wait until we hit hours, but to continue to bring more news and to bring more interesting ways for consumers to sign-on with our program and get actively involved in it. And I'll remind folks on the call that when we structured the loyalty program Our Piece of the Pie rewards back in 2015. It was done with the mind towards driving transactions, and everything about the program structure and the enhancements that we've made to it over time are all about making sure that we drive transactions and frequency with our customer base.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your question please.
Matthew DiFrisco: Thank you. With respect to the comp and sort of that comment, I think about the calendar shift that you made. Is there anything else we should consider given the Easter comes later, so Lent, the timing of Lent occurring a little later. Does that play into the quarterly comp at all or some things to factor in? And then also with the comp assumption pricing calendar shift in a lot of our wages went up in certain states. Is that another factor to think about in 1Q, just a higher pricing domestically?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yeah, Matt, it's Jeff. We'll primarily enter this for Q4 since we're in Q1 right now and we can't report on that. But what I can tell you is, it did hit us by about 0.5 point, the calendar shift. We'll get most of that back, obviously in Q1. As far as any kind of seasonality or quarter versus quarter start in 2019, not really that worried about it, that we're executing and putting up the numbers we want that'll be rounding here type of stuff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your question please.
David Tarantino: Hi, good morning. My question is on the domestic comp trends, and I know when you add back the calendar issue, the comp Q4 was pretty similar to what you had in Q3. But the comparison was quite a bit lower. So when you look at maybe at on a -- two-year stack basis, it does look like the business decelerated but I guess my question is that the way you look at it? Did the business decelerate and how does that change your thinking or does not change your thinking about your 3 to 6 comp target as you enter 2019?
Rich Allison: Hi David, it's Rich. The way I look at it is that the business did not decelerate from 2017 to 2018. We look at the full fiscal year 2017 versus 2018, looking at global retail sales, our US business, we were up 11.1% in fiscal 2017 and we were up 11.2% in fiscal 2018. If you took a look at the fourth quarter, we were up 7.6% in 2017, and we were up 10.2% in 2018. So we feel very good about our retail sales growth across the business, which is really the key metric that we take a look at. And we were very pleased with the comp in the fourth quarter for a couple of reasons. One, is that, it was driven by a very healthy dose of order count, growth -- transaction growth. And secondly, really, nicely within the range of our long-term expectations.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your question please.
Sara Senatore: Hi. Thanks. Just about the company-operated comps and that spread, I know it's a very small part of your system, company stores in the US, either bear greater sort of splits or/are more affected by aggregators. And then, can you say anything about that sort of what appears to be kind of on a one and two year basis of widening gap for the company stores and whether that has any kind of portend for the system overall?
Rich Allison: Yes, in the -- Sara, in the company-owned stores as you know, those are, those are concentrated in eight markets and you're primarily more urban type markets. So, certainly, you will see a little more impact from splits because all of the openings that we have in our corporate store business are going to be realignments of territories. And to the extent that there is an aggregator impact, certainly that's the areas where those folks are more focused. So we don't -- we don't see any concerns in the quarter from our corporate store growth. We feel very good about the growth and profitability in that business, but the characteristics are little more skewed toward the urban setting.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your question please.
John Glass: Hi, thanks, good morning. You've talked about the split impact in the -- anticipated split impact in the US. I know you report your international comps without the split impact. What would that be -- maybe in the fourth quarter and if you trend it that overtime or is the impact of splits increasing over time internationally? Decreasing or is it been stable as we look at that business over in the last couple of years?
Rich Allison: You know, John, we shared with you back at Investor Day, the point to point and a half on the US side of the business. We don't have a similar number to share with you on the international side, it's really going to, because it's really going to vary country by country, depending upon, what state of the growth curve that we happen to be in, in that particular country. And some of our markets where we are more penetrated today, you may see a little bit more of an impact there and other markets where we've got a lot of more -- a lot more white space left to fill, you're going to see less impact. But if we come back to our three to five year outlook for same-store sales growth of 3% to 6%, it takes into account, the fact that we will take some headwind on that due to the impact of in the splits. And as we talked about in our Investor Day, this is an investment that we're quite happy as a brand to make. And our franchisees have been quite happy to make, because it's necessary to drive the overall retail sales growth and overall profitability in the business, primarily at the franchisee level as well as a franchise.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question please.
Gregory Francfort: Hey, guys. So just, I wanted to ask about international and maybe one, could you just tell me how many conversions you had in the quarter? And then just on the comps, I thought they were little softer than I was expecting. And I'm, -- because I'm curious what that might have been attributed to, and if the count came in below your expectations and kind of, if there is any regionality there?
Jeff Lawrence: Hi, Greg. We're not going to report specifically on the number of converted units the -- the conversion that was primarily happening in the fourth quarter was the continued conversion of Hallo Pizza in Germany and we've been very pleased with the progress that DPE is making there, and you could probably refer to their release from about 36 hours ago and get more of the details around that. With respect to the international comp, there is certainly we would love to see that number a bit higher. It will just be fully transparent with you on that, because our trends over the longer-term has certainly been in a better place than where we were in the fourth quarter. That said, we are always going to have some ups and downs in the various markets around the world. In the fourth quarter we were softer in a few key markets in Europe and a few key markets in the Pacific region specifically. But when I take a look at the underlying health of those markets, we have strong market share positions, we have great unit economics and we've got strong management teams in place. And even with the little bit of weakness in the fourth quarter comp, when we step back and look at our retail sales growth, the product of that comp, and the unit growth that we're seeing -- I'm still quite pleased with the -- with the growth trajectory in the business.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens, Inc. Your question please.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey all, thanks for taking my questions. This is actually for [indiscernible] for Will this morning. I was just hoping you could out the comp a little bit more in 4Q. You said in your prepared remarks, the same-store sales growth included some ticket growth. I'm just curious if that check growth is a little bit more than we are accustomed to seeing and what was the driver of that? Thanks.
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, it's Jeff. Real good comp in the fourth quarter for the US business, in addition to the retail sales growth, did a five, six, the majority of that was traffic. We did get a decent amount of what I would call smart ticket. So, using that -- using the analytics capabilities we have working with our franchisees to really figure out where the places where we can kind of grow ticket, but what I'll tell you, it wasn't a really nearly raised prices across the board, our franchisees aren't doing that. They're doing it more precision based using the analytics, and it's a good balance is what I would tell you. But, again primarily it was traffic with a little bit of what I'd call smart ticket sprinkled in there.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your question please.
Chris O'Cull: Yeah, thanks. I had a follow-up regarding the corporate stores and I guess this applies to the franchise stores as well. But are there any opportunities to mitigate some of the cost pressures that you're seeing, especially around the labor to kind of slow the margin pressure we are seeing at stores?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, this is Jeff. Within the store environment in the US and in many countries around the world, it can be challenging on multiple line items, and labor is certainly one of them. When you look at the -- our corporate store margins for the year, they were pressured pretty significantly on labor rate, now the operator of that business, great teams and the market that we're in, did a really nice job of generating some efficiencies, but it wasn't enough to overcome the increase in labor rate and labor rates really two-forms. One is government-mandated labor rate increases, which of course we follow, but also just that the fact that the economy as you know, is white hot right now, in the US, everybody has got a job and sometimes the economics of the situation demand that labor rates go up. So really, really don't have an opinion or care as to why it goes up, but we need to do it, to continue to drive those efficiencies. And there are opportunities there, I think for us to continue to chase that, we're investing more in technology inside the store, we certainly done a great job with consumer facing, the point of sale, things like that. But we're really taking a fresh look at how we can use technology kind of behind the counter for labor scheduling for our corporate stores, sharing best practices to the extent that the franchisees who obviously make their own decisions in this regard, can learn from that. But yes, always opportunity in margin, labor, all of the big opportunity. And I think as we go forward, driving the volume, driving that traffic will give us a better chance, an increase in dollar profit there. But, it is difficult environment with labor, but we just got to continue to work our way out of that.
Rich Allison: Chris, just a couple of things to add to what Jeff was just describing in terms of some of our near-term effort. The real game changer over time, on labor, is going to have to come from our efforts to fortress our markets. The most expensive thing that we do is take a pizza from point A to point B. And as we look forward over time to reducing the radius of these delivery areas, in addition to driving incremental sales for household, which we've talked about in the past, we are also looking to reduce the cost per delivery and it just makes sense. Of course, the shorter the distance, the shorter the drive time, getting that driver out from the store to the customer and back to the store, the lower the labor costs for that specific delivery. And as we see wages rising in cities around the country, this is the key lever over the coming years in terms of reducing that delivery costs. To go alongside a lot of the things as Jeff described that we're trying to do around, being smarter about our scheduling and how we think about using technology to make the flow of product from the store out to the customer more efficient.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your question please.
John Ivankoe: Thank you very much. I know you guys have expressed your satisfaction with your fourth quarter comps in the US, but I'm wondering if you know think execution is optimal at the store level using in-store employees and optimal in terms of availability of delivery drivers. Obviously I have heard now and I've heard before the comments about reducing delivery stands, but are you currently staffed the way that you want that you want to be or their execution issues that are popping up in various markets, that might be constraining comps from what they otherwise would be?
Rich Allison: John, on execution we're never satisfied. We are as fast as we've ever been in getting out to the customer and we believe we're better than the competition, and competition, old and new, but we're never satisfied there. So the short answer is, yes, we need to get better, both in terms of the average time that it takes us to get pizza to our customers and also with the variability around those times. And that's something that we're working on each and every day. The driver labor market and availability of drivers certainly plays a part in that. And as Jeff said, it is a very tight labor market right now. So we've got to make sure and our franchisees have got to make sure that Domino's Pizza is the best place for those drivers to work when they have many more choices today, than they had five years ago. So what does that mean for us, well, the most important thing in terms of driver wages and satisfaction is how many deliveries per hour to these drivers get. That drives the compensation. And when we look at the places around the country where our franchisees have in, and built out their store networks to fortress where we cut those delivery zones, down from nine minutes down to six minutes or five minutes, we find that our drivers are making more money in turnover in those places is less. So it's not a short-term play, it's a long-term play, but we are very much focused on it, John, and we wanted to be a great place to work now, and also to create opportunities for our drivers of today to become the franchisees of tomorrow, 90% plus of our franchisees in the US started-off delivering pizzas or started-off answering the phones in our stores. And one of the really terrific things that is happening right now with the resurgence in store growth in the US, is that we are developing new franchisees at a faster pace than we have in many years. And so we're attracting drivers, not only for the near term wages, but also for those that have the vision around the longer-term opportunity to potentially be a franchise owner at Domino's Pizza. We think we've got a terrific value proposition for them.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Scott from Mizuho. Your question please.
Jeremy Scott: Thank you. Just wanted to ask about your international store growth. Did that, first did that come in about as expected. And then secondly, as we look forward into 2019 and beyond should we be thinking about a step up in that development of some of your newer markets start to ramp up. And then separately, you talked about the G&A investments in your international teams where exactly is that going? And as you start to become a bit more dispersed in your geographical mix, does that mean you have to broaden out your investment in G&A?
Rich Allison: So, Jeremy on the store growth we were very pleased with the fourth quarter, the international store growth. As we talked about on some of our calls earlier in the year, store growth got-off to a slower start than we wanted to see in the earlier part of the year. And our expectation at that time was that, it would pick up over the course of the year and we were pleasantly, very pleased to see that in fact happened. As we look out going forward, I remain very confident in our 6% to 8% outlook for store growth. And I'd say that because the fundamentals of our four-wall economics in the business are still very solid with a payback in the international business of around three years on average with a number of our markets, even much faster than that. One of the things that happened in 2018, it also gives us confidence, is that we really seeing an acceleration in the brick markets in particular. And Russia, China, India, all had terrific years in 2018 store growth. And we in Brazil we're very optimistic going forward. We got new ownership in the market, there building up the great foundation as the previous master franchisee put in place. So feel good about the three to five-year outlook and I feel very positive about our aspirational goal of 25,000 total stores globally by the end of 2025. Your second question, I think you snack a second one there was around G&A. And we're investing in our international business really to help our franchisees continue to grow. And one of the things that we've talked a little bit about over the last several quarters post the leadership change that we adhere here at Domino's is we've been building some centers of excellence in our business and that's something that, our Chief Operating Officer, Russell Weiner is working hard on every day and the thought behind that is to take some of the capabilities that have driven our US business and make them more available to our international markets. And one of the areas there is around our data analytics and our decision support capabilities. And so we're going to be looking over the years to come to take some of the analytics, some of the data driven, decision making that have helped us to be so successful in US and port that out to more of our international markets.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dennis Geiger from UBS, your question please.
Dennis Geiger: Thanks for the question. Wanted to ask about market share in the quarter and specifically wondering if you saw any shift in the areas where you took share specifically looking at the Independence relative to the larger brands, whether you're taking any incremental amount from the larger brands. And then just perhaps if on the carryout side you saw greater gains there given the increased focus over the last couple of quarters. Thanks.
Rich Allison: Sure. The short answer is, we continue to gain market share at a very healthy clip across the business and that is, -- that's both in our US business and in our international businesses, in both of those businesses we grew at a very healthy multiple of the overall market growth rate and one of the things that we shared back in January at our Investor Day if you look even back across the last four years, more than 100% of the transaction growth in the US pizza category is being driven by Domino's. You pull Domino's out of the, -- if you pull Domino's out of the overall market, you would see that their transaction declines when you add up all the rest of the players. Now that share shift comes from a number of different places and frankly, we're fairly agnostic about whether we take share from the larger players or from some of the smaller and medium-sized players over time. Across the different elements of our business, we continue to grow our share both in delivery and in the carryout -- in the carryout business. When we take a look at it, even as the number one player overall now, we still have significant market share growth potential, given the fragmented nature of the category.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your question please.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you. First, Rich, just want to compliment you on your television ads, it's nice to see you on a more regular basis.
Rich Allison: Thanks, Jeff.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Sure. Separately, just on the international front and I recognize that, it's tough to make broad brush comments, when you're talking about so many different countries. But, the fact that the comp did come in slightly below the long-term range, it seems like it's the lowest in many years. Does it make the 3% to 6% guidance for the next multiple years look a little aggressive, just wondering, especially when you commented that, you had a couple of weaker markets, but in reality, all markets are positive. So it doesn't seem like there is a big headwind that you're all of a sudden going to be able to correct, seems like it's more just a slow and steady across pretty much all of your markets. So I'm just wondering how you think about or why you're confident in such a re-acceleration or why not perhaps lower that long-term guidance, since we all know that I guess the total retail sales growth that you focus on?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, Jeff, you know, as I mentioned earlier on the call -- we weren’t altogether that thrilled with the fourth quarter comp in the international business, but it doesn't diminish our confidence in our ability and our master franchisees ability to continue to drive same-store sales growth across international, over the longer-range outlook in that 3% to 6% range. And the fourth quarter number, the 2.4% is really it's a blend. We had some markets, while all regions were positive, we certainly had some markets that were negative. And we had some markets that were wildly positive, then when we take a look at the potential, particularly as we break down the largest international markets, that really drive the business and drive the overall number. We and our master franchisees see opportunities to continue to perform better. In some cases, the short-term gets pressured by some macroeconomic factors. In some cases, our short-term is not where we want it to be, because, maybe we weren't executing at the level that we needed to. So we don't make any excuses for it, but we see, we're still quite confident in the opportunity going forward.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Tower from Wells Fargo. Your question please.
Jon Tower: Great. Thanks. Just real quick, following up on that franchise -- international franchise side, the absolute unit closures on the international side was the highest, I think that I have on record here. So, I was curious if there is anything going on perhaps, there is something related to conversions. And then, just secondly on the U.S., you had mentioned the loyalty program it's been in place for about three years. And you mentioned, it's been a significant driver of traffic. So can you perhaps, breakdown how that program is driving same-store sales meaning? Are you seeing it from new member acquisition or is it building frequency with existing active members as well as building check with those members? Thanks.
Jeff Lawrence: So you should [knock] into there also, get sneaky from time-to-time. So, on the international closures, there were some closures in there associated with conversions. Whenever you do a conversion, there is always some overlap. And so, you would find, you would find some closures in there. We also had a few of our smaller markets, where we had a few more closures than we might typically do. And in those cases, places where we've got some unprofitable units or maybe some units that were opened, maybe not in exactly the right place. And it's the right thing to do, to close a unit, we hate to do it. But if it's the right thing for the overall health of that market, consistent with the long-term growth goals, then that's something that we're willing to take in the short-term. To your second question around loyalty, and the answer there is kind of yes and yes. We're continuing to drive sales and engagement with existing loyalty members, while we continue to bring new members into our program. And the way we share the data with you when we talk about 20 million members, those are active members. So that is -- when we put somebody in that bucket, that is a customer that has ordered through our loyalty program within the last six months. And we continue to see terrific engagement from those that joined us three years ago, and those that have come on board in 2018.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Company. Your question please.
Andrew Charles: Thank you. When you look at the 500 basis points of deterioration in domestic to your trends from 3Q to 4Q, in both 2017 and 2018. Both of which include a 50 basis points headwind from the calendar shift. But do you think there is a new element of seasonality in the business that you believe is emerging? And if so, what you think is driving that?
Jeff Lawrence: Yeah, this is Jeff. The short answer is no, no more seasonality to the business than as ever been in there. Still a simple business, it's one where you just got to go out and execute every day. But now, no new seasonality or any impacts from that.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alton Stump from Longbow Research. Your question please.
Alton Stump: Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the 1% to 1.5% impact, you guys talked about in fortressing of 100 comp. I think by my count this was the seventh year in a row that you've seen your overall unit growth accelerate in the U.S. If that does continue to accelerate, is there any concern about in the kind of 1 to 1.5 debt becoming a bigger number? Going forward, or is it, am I not thinking about that correctly if we’re -- if we, to continue to see it was unit growth expand in coming years?
Rich Allison: Yes. So when we -- when we look at unit growth going forward and we engage in conversations with our franchisees about building new stores, we absolutely take into account what type of impact, we might have on the comps in the existing stores and then the way we look at new unit openings is we take a look at the expected cash-on-cash return in that new units, but we also take a look at the expected payback across the overall cluster. So as an example, if there is an opportunity to carve out some territory and open a new store. The cash-on-cash return on that store might be 2.5 years. The cash-on-cash return on the cluster that might be four years, 4.5 years. We look at this, and each individual circumstance. What I just share with you is, just an example. But we are working with the franchisee and making sure that the new store makes sense, but also the impact on the cluster makes sense because we, in the franchisees look at it as a near-term investment giving up a little bit of comp in those existing stores to drive the long-term growth of their business and their profitability and one of the things that, we are most excited about from 2018. 2018 is our franchisees' profitability and I'm going to talk about that in two dimensions. The things we thing, we talk about a lot you is the $137,000 to $140,000 per unit in franchisee profitability. But what's -- what we also think about a lot is the overall franchisee enterprise profitability. So our average franchisee today now has almost seven stores and what that means if you run your math. Is that an average franchisee is now generating over $900,000 in EBITDA and that has been growing rapidly over the last several years. So we're focused on unit level economics and we're very focused on franchisee economics.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Rich Allison for any further remarks.
Rich Allison: Well, thanks everyone. We appreciate your time today and we look forward to discussing our first quarter 2019 results on Wednesday, April 24.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants' lines have been placed on a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'll now turn the call over Tim McIntyre to begin. Please go ahead. 
Timothy McIntyre: Thanks Maria, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today's call will highlight the results of our third quarter and will feature commentary from Chief Executive Officer, Ritch Allison and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence. I just said Ritch Al, I should have said Ritch Allison, sorry. Oh, my goodness. CEO Ritch Allison and CFO, Jeff Lawrence. This call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. A friendly reminder to our analysts. We have asked you to stick one question on this call because we want to give all 19 of you the chance to participate. We will provide each of you the opportunity for in-depth one-on-one call later today and tomorrow. In the event that any forward-looking statements are made, I refer you to the safe harbor statement you can find in this morning's release and the 8-K. In addition, please refer to the 8-K to find disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that maybe used on today's call.  With that, I would like to the turn call over to Jeff Lawrence.
Jeff Lawrence: Thank you, Tim. And good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued as we once again delivered great results for our shareholders. We continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 30 consecutive quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales, and 99 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continue to increase our global store count at a healthy pace.  Our diluted EPS was a $1.95 which is an increase of 53.5% over the diluted EPS as adjusted in the prior year quarter, which excluded the impact of our recapitalization completed in 2017. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q3. Global retail sales grew 8.3% in the quarter. When excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 10.4%. This global retail sales growth was driven by increases in same store sales and the average number of stores open during the quarter. Same store sales for the U.S. grew 6.3% lapping a prior year increase of 8.4%. In same store sales for our international division grew 3.3% rolling a prior year increase of 5.1%. Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 6.4%, while our company owned stores were up 4.9%.  Both increases were driven primarily by higher order counts in addition to some ticket growth as consumers continue to respond positively to our overall brand experience. Our Piece of the Pie loyalty program once again contributed meaningfully to our traffic gains. Our international comp for the quarter was driven entirely by order count growth. During the quarter comps in our Asia-Pacific, Americas and Middle East regions were strong. And while still positive year-to-date, the comp in our European business was slightly negative for the quarter. Our teams on the ground are working hard with our European franchise partners to regain comp momentum. Our retail sales growth in Europe remains strong due to healthy store count growth, and we remain optimistic long term in the business there.  On the unit count front, we are pleased to report that we opened 59 net U.S. stores in the third quarter consisting of 61store openings and two closures. Our international division added 173 net new stores during Q3 comprised of 192 store openings and 19 closures. On a total company basis, we opened 232 net new stores in the third quarter and 920 net new stores over the last 12 months, demonstrating the broad strength and attractive 4-wall economics our brand enjoys globally. Turning to revenues. Total revenues were up $142.3 million, or 22% from the prior year quarter. As a reminder, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we are now required to report the franchise contributions to our not-for-profit advertising fund and the related expenses gross on our P&L. Although this did not have an impact on our reported operating or net income in the third quarter, it did result in an $82.5 million increase in our consolidated revenues. It is important to note although these amounts are included in our financial statements, they are restricted funds that can only be used to support the Domino's brand and are not available to be used for general corporate purposes. The remaining $59.8 million increase in revenues resulted primarily from the following. First, higher food volumes driven by strong U.S. retail sales resulted in higher supply chain revenues. Second, higher U.S. same store sales resulted in increased royalties and fees from our franchise stores, as well as higher revenues that are company-owned stores. Store count growth also contributed positively to these increases. And finally, higher international retail sales resulted in increased international royalty revenues, but were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. FX negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $1.9 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies. For the full fiscal year 2018, we now estimate that the impact of foreign currency on royalty revenues could come in near the low end of our prior 2018 guidance of flat to positive $4 million. As you know, there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rates, which make this a harder part of our business to predict. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 37.6% from 30.8% in the prior year quarter. This increase resulted entirely from the recognition of domestic franchise advertising revenues on our P&L from the new accounting guidance I mentioned previously. Supply chain operating margin was negatively pressured by delivery and labor costs. Procurement savings partially offset these margin pressures. Our supply chain center operations in both the US and in Canada continue to have opportunities for improvement. We continue to invest heavily in both capacity and driving efficiencies in all of supply chain. And we remain committed to our franchise partners in making tangible headway in both capacity and efficiency in the near term. Company owned store margin was negatively impacted by higher food, labor and insurance expenses as compared to the prior year quarter. G&A cost decreased $1 million as compared to the prior year quarter. This net decrease resulted primarily from a $5.9 million pre-tax gain on the sale of 12 company owned stores, and a $4 million impact from the adoption of the revenue recognition guidance primarily related to the reclassification of certain advertising expenses out of G&A into domestic franchised advertising costs. These decreases were partially offset by continued investments in our marketing, supply chain and corporate store teams, as well as our planned investments and technological initiatives including ecommerce and the teams that support them. Please note that the company receives technology fees from franchisees that are recorded separately as franchise revenues. We currently estimate that our G&A cost for the full year 2018 will come in near the low end of our previously communicated range of $370 million to $375 million. Keep in mind too that our G&A expense for the year can vary up or down based on among other things our performance versus plan which affects variable performance based compensation expense. Domestic franchise advertising costs were $82.5 million in the third quarter. As a reminder, we are now showing domestic franchise advertising in our revenues with an equal and offsetting amount of expense in our operating cost. Interest expense increased $800,000 in the third quarter, driven by increased net debt from our most recent recapitalization. This increase was largely offset by $5.8 million of incremental interest expense recorded in the prior year quarter related to our 2017 recapitalization. Our weighted average borrowing rate was flat as compared to the prior year quarter at 4.1%. Our reported effective tax rate was 15.3% for the quarter, down significantly from prior year. This was primarily due to the lower federal statutory rate of 21% resulting from the Federal Tax Reform legislation enacted at the end of the 2017. The impact of tax benefits on equity based compensation also resulted in a $7.4 million reduction in our third quarter provision for income taxes. This resulted in a 7.5 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate. We continue to expect that our ongoing tax rate excluding the impact of equity based compensation will be 22% to 24%. We also expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to equity based compensation. When you add it all up, our third quarter net income was up $27.7 million or 49% over the prior year quarter. Our third quarter diluted EPS was a $1.95 versus a $1.18 last year, which was a 65.3% increase. As compared to our prior year diluted EPS as adjusted of a $1.27, our third quarter diluted EPS increased 53.5%. Here is how that $0.68 increase in diluted EPS breaks down. Our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.41 including a $0.31 positive impact from tax reform and $0.10 positive year-over-year impact related to higher tax benefits on equity based compensation. Lower diluted share primarily as a result of share repurchases benefited us by $0.17. Higher net interest expense resulting primarily from a higher net debt balance negatively impacted us by $0.09. Foreign currency negatively impacted royalty revenues by $0.02 and importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.21 which includes $0.08 from the gain on the sale of company owned stores. Now turning to our use of cash. During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 397,000 thousand shares for a $109 million at an average purchase price of approximately $275 per share. Year-to-date, we repurchase and retired approximately 1.75 million shares for $429 million at an average purchase price of $245 per share. We also returned $23.2 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.55 per share quarterly dividend. All- in- all, our strong momentum continued and we are very pleased with our results of this quarter. And with that I'll turn it over to Ritch.
Ritch Allison: Thanks Jeff. And good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance, and I'm extremely proud of our great franchisees and operators around the world, particularly within our US business, who executed at high levels during the quarter. Our focus on global retail sales growth and franchisee economics continues to shape our steady, long- term strategy and approach. My first three months on the job have only reinforced my point of view about what it takes to succeed in this business. The brand with the best people, the strongest franchisee relations, a focus on forward-thinking innovation and most importantly, the courage to take smart risks and tackle the steep hills needed to create meaningful change and improvement will win. I am very proud to be leading an organization that continues to play the long game by taking this winning approach. Focusing first on US business, it was an outstanding quarter, with strong retail sales growth driven by a solid balance of same store sales and unit growth. The launch of Domino's Hotspots and the Paving for Pizza program both generated terrific attention and are two good examples of how we continue to make news for the brand in unique and different ways. We see these as more effective than the limited time offering product of the month approach, which differentiates us from others not only in pizza but across the QSR landscape. We continue to drive healthy traffic and order counts, and as always remain focused on our own strategy and execution rather than specific competitive or macro factors. For years now we've stressed the importance of franchisee profitability and cash on cash returns as important drivers of long-term growth for Domino's or any restaurant brand. Store openings are an obvious measure of the health of cash on cash returns, but it is also important to take a look at the rate of store closures. Closures are a key indicator of brand momentum and franchisee confidence. I'm pleased to note that year-to-date in 2018, we have only closed seven stores in the US.  I'm just going to repeat that. Year-to-date in 2018, we have closed just seven US stores, while opening 140. I credit the many efforts related to sales and efficiencies made by our team and our franchisee base toward industry-leading unit economics that are keeping stores open and profitable. On our last call, we spoke about the need to accelerate supply chain capacity to support our industry-leading retail sales growth. I am pleased to report that during the quarter, we opened our new state-of-the-art supply chain center in Edison, New Jersey. The first Domino's US supply chain center to open in more than a decade. I am very pleased to see us making progress on these efforts to expand capacity. And as Jeff mentioned earlier, continuing to address needed efficiency improvements as we invest toward upgrading capabilities within our centers, both old and new. I'd like to call out one more events during the quarter that makes a big statement about the strength of the Domino's brand. Stan Gage, a former member of the Domino's leadership team left Domino's and then became a 12 store franchisee in the Carolinas. Stan in a familiar Domino's story started as a driver more than 30 years ago and worked his way up through the company. Most recently, he ran our company own stores. I note this not only because it is one more outstanding talent to add to our nearly 800 franchisees in the US today, but also because it shows ultimate confidence in the brand. Stan, we wish you all the best as you build your Domino's business. Many of you have told us, we make this look easy at times, but the retail sales results, franchisee energy and momentum within our US system don't come easily. They take hard work each and every day. The US business results are driven by a system, culture and collection of franchisees and corporate team members that refuse to be complacent or to rest on past success. This collective energy and drive motivates me and my leadership team each and every day. Turning to the international business. We had a good quarter, generating strong retail sales growth and improving store growth trends across all regions. Three of our four regions delivered positive same store sales with our Europe region being the exception. While there is work to do in a few key markets, overall, I continue to be very pleased to see our International same store sales growth being driven by order growth. Across the international business, our master franchisees continue to perform at a very high level with excellent unit economics. We have the best master franchisee partners in the restaurant business, and we will continue to work closely with them in driving home elements from the proven playbook used in the US in many other markets, including customer insights, franchisee alignment, technology innovation and a clear focus on value and transaction growth as the main drivers of top-line results. We are a work in progress brand and we will never rest in our quest to achieve a dominant number one position in every market where we compete. On the technology front, our Hotspots program was featured front and center this past quarter. Beyond any sales expectations at this early stage, the thing I am most pleased with has been the incredible engagement from this program, with our customers, our franchisees and the media. Hotspots received much attention because it is a program that is completely unique within our industry. I couldn't be more proud of the store level execution of our franchisees and operators around the country as they deliver delicious Domino's Pizza to parks and beaches and more than 200,000 Hotspots across the US. Not all technology innovation is television commercial worthy. And some that happens behind the scenes is as valuable as anything else. We continue to consider tech when discussing operational efficiencies with our franchisees, seeking to innovate and support their needs wherever possible. From this, we have recently incorporated voice and mobile capabilities into some of our store level activities, including inventory management and other areas. While not a customer facing digital platform which I am still pleased to see us doing plenty of, these launches can also drive value. We are constantly striving to create a better experience in our stores, utilizing technology to benefit our franchisees, managers and store team members in ways that improve efficiencies and make their lives easier, is something we will continue to do wherever and whenever possible. In closing, I am pleased with our third quarter results. As I mentioned during my opening remarks, I am very proud to be part of a brand with such a winning attitude and mentality. A winning strategy and approach and a winning collection of people that are no doubt the best in the industry. This is what gives me the utmost confidence that we can maintain our energy, momentum and success. And now, operator, we will open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Co.
Brian Bittner: Thank you. Good morning, guys. First question is just when you look at the US business and you look at the fourth quarter last year, comps of 4% in 4Q last year was still obviously very solid, but it also was a very clear temporary slowdown that we saw in the business. Can you just remind us what drove that temporary slowdown last year so we can better understand the fourth quarter this year? Was it mostly driven by external issues or internal issues in the fourth quarter last year?
Ritch Allison: Brian, we were pleased with the fourth quarter last year the 4.2% was within our three to five-year outlook that we've been giving you guys for quite some time. And we don't see any material --didn't see any material challenges back then that gave us cause for concern. When we take a look at the momentum in the business this year and on a multi-year stack looking backwards, we're very pleased with the performance.
Brian Bittner: Okay. And just in the international business, I know your Australian franchisee is going to be doing a conversion. How do you expect that to impact the international openings over the next few quarters?
Ritch Allison: We are in the midst with our partner Domino's Pizza enterprises of a conversion of Hallo Pizza in Germany as we speak. So, Brian that is a work in progress and conversions are --has been happening for several months now, and will continue to go forward in the months to come. We won't comment on any specific unit count impact as it is --it's an ongoing process.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. 
Karen Holthouse: Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is the first quarter in awhile that we've seen really only a moderate increase in year-over-year supply chain cost. Is there anything specific you would point to that sort of helping the cost curve there those early benefits of the new facility that's been open in the US? Are you starting to see changes on the freight or shipping side -- and things really just any color there.
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, Karen, it's Jeff. In supply chain, we've really taken our role as the franchisor seriously. We're investing materially as you know both in capability building, as well as capacity building as Ritch mentioned in his prepared remarks, we were super excited to get our first supply chain center in more than a decade open and running. Our dough balls running down the line as we speak in Edison, New Jersey.  And that's something that we're going to continue to do. It's a great division. Guys are working really hard and our franchisees need that comfort that we're going to continue to get them high quality. Safe food supply so that they have the confidence to continue to grow. They have that confidence in our supply chain. We're going to continue to invest again in even more capacity and more capabilities over time. As I mentioned, I believe it was last quarter, we raised our guidance on CapEx for 2018 to reflect the fact and the optimism and where we're going in the US business to pull forward supply chain centers number two and three in the US. So a lot of opportunity for improvement there like we have in lots of parts of our businesses, but it's a great business, a good ROI and most importantly getting good food supply to our franchisees in the US and Canada.
Operator: Our next question comes from one of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America.
Gregory Francfort: Hey. I got two questions for Ritch. One is just a clarification. I think you said 3% to 5% long- term algorithm. I think you meant 3% to 6%, just maybe you clarify that. And then the other question I had was just on the European sales and what the reason for the pressure there is, and I guess what you're doing right now to address that market and maybe sort of bend the arc back?
Ritch Allison: Sure, thanks Greg. And yes, you are correct, 3% to 6% is our three to five-year outlook. So thank you for correcting me on that. First, around the business in Europe, our three other regions were very strong in Q3, but within the Europe region, we've got a couple of markets where we've got some improvements to address. And some of those are short-term, and some of those are going to take you a little bit of time. When I take a look at the business over there, the issues that we have are by and large in our master franchisees control. And we share a joint commitment. Take whatever steps we need to get the business back to the performance on comps that we're all used to. If you take a look at it holistically in Europe, I still feel very positive about our overall market position. We still have strong cash on cash returns across the region. And our retail sales growth performance has still been quite solid even in the face of a quarter where we didn't achieve the comp result that we'd like to see.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of David Tarantino of Baird.
David Tarantino: Hi, good morning. My question is on the domestic unit growth. I think this is maybe the seventh year in a row where the pace of growth has increased. And I think that's probably an outcome of your fortressing strategy, but just wondering if you would expect that pace to continue to move higher as we move forward? And is it possible in your view that we could see domestic growth in line with your long-run target for the global unit growth outlook?
Ritch Allison: Sure, David. We're very pleased with what has now been a multi-year acceleration of the pace of unit growth in the US. And certainly the strategy of fortressing and driving retail sales growth plays a big part of that. Also the fact that we have seen consistently improving over the last couple of years, store level profitability which as we've reported out to you has been in the mid - 130 on a store level basis. If that's driving a lot of confidence in the franchisee base in building new stores. You combine that with the fact that we've got a lot of stores out there in the US right now that are really busy. On Friday and Saturday nights, we've got some stores where we have a tough time putting in incremental pizza in the oven because they're so busy. Take all of that, you roll in a historically low rate of closures in the business, and it's driven a nice acceleration. And we're very optimistic about US store growth going forward. We've shared with you that we think the US within a 10-year horizon is an 8,000 store business. And so, we're optimistic about the forward growth also.
David Tarantino: And Ritch maybe a related follow-up. Are you seeing any signs of concern among the franchisees related to the overall labor environment? I know the cash flows are still quite good, but is there any sort of pause or concern you're seeing anywhere in the system in the US on development?
Ritch Allison: I think labor is tight in any business in the US today. And we were certainly no exception of that with unemployment now under 4% for a while, but our franchisees out there are making it happen. And they are hiring drivers; the fact that our drivers are so busy helps us. When we take a look at what a driver can make at a Domino's Pizza relative to delivering or driving for some other businesses, it's very, very attractive. But, yes, labor pressures are certainly on the minds of our franchisees. On the flip side of that, the one of the things that yes, or the thing that drives sales of pizza as much as anything is having people gainfully employed and earning good wages out in the marketplace. So as the number one player in the pizza business, we also get a nice top size benefit from a strong labor market.
Operator: Our next question comes Will Slabaugh of Stephens Inc.
Hugh Gooding: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And this is actually Hugh on for Will this morning. I think this is really the first full quarter with the Hotspots now in. And can you provide any learning from the program and maybe any color on the adoption or top-line contribution from this program?
Ritch Allison: Yes. Hotspots --it's been a really fun program for us. It's another one of our anywhere platforms with our goal of making Domino's Pizza accessible to our customers anytime and anywhere they want it. What I've been most pleased about on this is just the terrific brand engagement that we've seen on this platform. And it starts with our franchisees who've set up these 200,000 plus Hotspots around the country. Our customers who have been excited about the program and also this has got terrific amount of media attention as well, which is been quite a bit of fun. So, overall, we're quite pleased with the program.
Operator: Our next question comes from one of Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI.
Matthew McGinley: Good morning. Questions on the G&A. When you back out that $5.9 million gain you had in --the impact for ASC 606. Your G&A dollars were up about $10 million in the quarter. Is that just a normal G&A increase or is there some sort of lumpiness in the quarter that should go down? And just to confirm the full-year guide on G&A reflects that gain meaning you went a little bit higher given that that would have been an offset?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, Matt. It's Jeff. The $370 million to $375 million remains the guide and that is inclusive some of the noise that you see including the gain. So it's inclusive of that. We're guiding to the low end of that range or near the low end of that range in part because of that gain that you saw from the store sale. So it kind of --I think compensates for that a little bit. As far as the rate and pace, basically what we're probably going to continue to give you is just one year at a time is our best guess on what's going to go into G&A because we are in such a dynamic environment. We have been in periods where we've decided to accelerate some strategic investments if we see the opportunity in the marketplace. And so given one year at a time is what we feel responsible to do now. So in any one quarter you might always get some bounce around things like that, but $370 million to $375 million is what we'll invest this year. Again, possibly at the lower end of that range, but again if we outperform in Q4, that's going to go up, you have things like advertising that flows through and corporate stores and such. And if we underperform, we could be at even the lower end or below the range.  So I think the key point here is it continues --the increases continue to go in strategic areas. It's in marketing. It's an analytics. It's in technology. It's in the things that are driving the profitable retail sales for franchisees around the world. And that you're going to see more of not less up as we go forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from one of John Glass of Morgan Stanley.
John Glass: Thanks very much. Could you just talk a little bit about the US competitive environment? It's not lost on you or anyone the call that one of your key competitors ceded some share this quarter, but it's hard to see if you actually got a benefit or how much that benefit is? So and even what the store overlaps are? Can you talk about one the overall US competitive environment and changes but specifically to that comment on the competitor that's losing shared you pick it up or is it too hard to measure because from the outside in it's hard to see if you picked up share from that or not?
Ritch Allison: Yes. John, we're in --as you are aware we're in a very fragmented category. And if we have a competitor donating share it doesn't simply fall in our pocket. We've got to earn it. And sometimes share that's donated doesn't necessarily all fall into the pizza category as well. And that specific competitor has a relatively small share within the category. Yes, so the impact of this on the overall landscape isn't necessarily as heavy as some might assume.  When we take a look at the category overall, we're really more focused on our own competitive strategy than we are on kind of short-term ups and downs with any specific competitor. And we think if we can continue to stay focused on bringing value to our customers and also on delivering terrific unit level economics to our franchisees, we think we can continue to be successful and can continue to take share from competitors small and large in the pizza market.
Operator: Our next question comes from one Peter Saleh of BTIG.
Peter Saleh: Great, thanks. Yes, I want to circle back on the category as well. Can you guys talk a little bit about the growth of the pizza category? Have you seen that growth moderate or accelerate at all? And then also anything you can discuss on the closure rate of some of your competitors primarily the independent operators? Are you still seeing the closure rate accelerate and more closures in the system?
Ritch Allison: Peter, first of all, on the overall market, we aren't seeing any significant swings one way or another on the --on what is just a pretty steady, low single-digit growth of the category in the US. And then globally, the pizza category continuing to grow. We believe in that 3% to 5% range. So no significant changes that we've seen there. And with respect to closures, as I commented earlier, in our business the very strong unit level economics have led to our franchisees maintaining confidence in keeping their stores open. Seven closures across the entire US year-to-date.  As you look elsewhere broadly across the industry, I don't have any specific comments about closures at competitors small or large, but what I will say is that over time my experience has always taught me that it's going to follow unit level economics. And if we have players in the marketplace that are struggling to generate returns at the unit level then that's what's going to drive, that's what's going to drive either closures on the downside or openings on the upside going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.
Sara Senatore: Hi, thank you. Ritch you mentioned both value to customers and unit economic to franchisees, but I think sometimes in other systems we see those in conflict. And the system struggle to stay on message around value because a franchisee push back. So maybe could you just address how you're franchising about value and consistency in that $5.99 price point. Are there offsets that you're continually finding? Is it the mixed a sort of a fixed amount, just try and understand how you're able to be so consistent around value and others kind of float in and out?
Ritch Allison: Sure. Sara I think you used exactly the right word in your question which was the word consistent and that's really been the key within our system. So we've been on our $5.99 mix-and-match which is our hero offer in delivery. We have been on that for effectively about nine years now. And in our carry out business for multiple years now we've been consistently at our $7.99 offer there. And the key with value is consistency because it's really hard to offer those price points in the marketplace if you're not driving volume growth over time. And you can't just jump on value for a quarter or for one promotional window, and jump back out of it again. That is --that's just not a recipe to driving long- term transaction count gains in the business. And everything that we have experienced here at Domino's in the US and in our other large international markets is that it is that transaction count growth over time that correlates not only with sales growth, but with profit growth. And staying consistent and focused on that value has helped us to drive the kinds of unit level profitability numbers that you've seen --that you've seen from us over time. So consistency and alignment is the key. Franchisees also have at levers at their fingertips as well with local menu pricing with how they price their delivery charges et cetera that allow them outside of the national price point to manage pricing and some of the profit dynamics in their business at a local level as well. And we think that that mix of a strong consistent national price point with flexibility at the local franchisee level is the recipe for a profitable and growing business.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Chris O'Cull of Stifel.
Christopher O'Cull: Thanks. Ritch I had a follow up regarding labor. Several restaurant companies have stated they're having difficulty fully staffing the restaurants in the current market. And obviously this becomes a major concern if it hurt your customer service. So are you able to monitor whether franchisees are properly staffing restaurants? And can you tell us whether customer satisfaction or drive time performances changed much in recent quarters?
Ritch Allison: We don't monitor franchisee staffing at the local level. They're independent business owners. And that's their job to track and manage their staffing at a local level. Certainly, as we look broadly across the business service is --it's critically important to us. And it plays, Chris, into the fortressing strategy that we have been driving in the business getting our stores closer to the customer is going to help obviously with that service dimension, but also when we get our stores closer to the customer, our drivers can execute more runs per hour because the distances are shorter and more runs per hour means happier customers. And it also means more tips which helps us to attract and retain delivery drivers into our business over time.
Christopher O'Cull: Have you seen a decline in customer satisfaction or changes in it in recent quarters?
Ritch Allison: No. We haven't seen any decline in customer satisfaction.
Operator: Our next question comes from a line of Alton Stump of Longbow Research.
Alton Stump: Hi. Chris' second question, you just had a question I think about for third-party delivery providers, a, is that sort of have any kind of have bigger impact from what you can see under demand and then b, kind how do we model out of course the increased labor costs just from a driver standpoint that are most likely going to result for quick off of the growth in these third party providers?
Jeff Lawrence: Hey, Alton. It's Jeff. On aggregators, we don't have that much more to add than what we've already said, been saying over the last 18 months to two years. It's more about what we're doing. Our strategies are great execution in more than 90 markets around the world. And we are -- as you see again we're hitting more often than not in that 8% to 12% global retail sales growth with really good flow through to the bottom line. So I don't think we have anything really to add to the conversation around these aggregator phenomena other than to tell you that that we're going to grow regardless.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great, thank you very much. Question on the unit growth and it's hard to look at any system quarter- to- quarter, but best couple quarters we've been sitting in the 6% range which is the lower half I guess of your 6% to 8% annual guidance. And I recall last quarter there was talk about the International maybe coming in a little late of expectation. So I was wondering if you could talk about whether the third quarter results saw the uptick you were anticipating or whether there is any reason why we might see more modest growth there particular regions that might see more modest growth on the international front? Otherwise it does seem to imply a pretty big uptick as we think about fourth quarter growths and just wondering to get your thoughts there specific to the international.
Ritch Allison: Well, thanks, Jeff. First you keep in mind that 6% to 8% unit growth outlook is a three to five year range in terms of outlook specifically related to the third quarter. We were pleased to see the pickup in international growth 173 net units in the third quarter. We were pleased with what we saw there. And when we take a look forward at the medium and the long term, we've got solid unit economics across the international business. And that's across all of the regions that we operate in. And that is really the leading indicator of what is going to have --it gives us confidence in that 6% to 8% unit growth range that we give you on a global basis. And then as we've talked about previously on this call, the unit level economics in our business in the US also continue to be very, very strong at a level of returns that encourage our franchisees to invest their hard earned dollars into building Domino's Pizza stores.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Jeremy Scott of Mizuho.
Jeremy Scott: Hey, thank you, good morning. Just bigger picture on international for the next 2,000-3,000 stores versus the last 3,000 stores. Can you talk about the difference in contributions from your core market versus some of your younger markets that were launched in that 2013-2015to period when I believe Ritch you were leading the effort? I have your long-term store targets in front of me but just think about the momentum over the next two years which markets may surprise us and accelerate versus those that where the growth might level out? And then maybe just to follow up on the previous comment, you mentioned that you share a joint commitment to drive business in your international franchisees. Wondering if you can expand on that a little bit? Is there a threshold of underperformance in a major market that would induce you to step up with capital support or is there something else that you had in mind? Thanks.
Ritch Allison: Sure, well, Jeremy, start with your -- I'll start with your first question. When I think about the composition of store growth in international. The good news there is that it has been a pretty balanced portfolio of growth if you look over time. In that we continue to get strong store growth out of long established core markets and you've seen that the last couple years in places like the UK and Australia for example. While also driving a strong growth in some of the newer or more emerging markets that we've got around the world. And you've seen a lot of units over the last couples years come from places like India and Russia and Brazil and places that are relatively undeveloped for us. When I take a look forward, honestly, I don't see a lot of change in that dynamic. We still have very attractive unit level returns in our core markets, and also a good bit of white space for growth in those markets. If you take a look at the top 15 markets that we operate in by unit count, there are still another 4,000-5,000 units of opportunity available in those places. And then beyond that markets that wouldn't appear on that list like places like China and Russia. And places like that where we're optimistic about the forward growth in some of those emerging markets as well. And having this balanced portfolio really helps us over time because frankly not all markets are going to be performing it at any particular point in time. So you need that balanced portfolio to be able to consistently drive unit growth in that 6% to 8% range. I'll turn now to your second question. We have a really deep partnership with our master franchisees around the world. And I think that is one of the things that have allowed us to be successful over a sustained period of time. So our teams work side by side with our master franchisee teams to make sure that we're driving the business forward with our customers in those marketplaces, but also working hand in hand on the unit level economics in the business as well. So it's not so much stepping in with capital or other financial support as it is really making sure that we are taking the best of the learnings that we have whether that's from here in the US or from the more than 85 countries that we operate in, and making sure that we don't repeat some of the same mistakes and making sure that we take advantage of those things that work. So that's how we look at it is really a partnership that is driven by a shared set of expectations and a shared opportunity to create value for DPZ and for our master franchisees.
Operator: Our next question comes from one of John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. 
John Ivankoe: Hi, thank. Ritch you mentioned in your prepared remarks about your taking risk and climbing steep hills. And I did think that in of itself was an interesting quote. And then secondly, Jeff and I think it was you at perhaps an answer to a question that you talked about looking at G&A one year at a time which I understand, but also you mentioned accelerating strategic investments. So I guess maybe I'm trying to connect two things that aren't necessarily directly connected, but what does that mean in terms of your future spend in G&A? Obviously, this year $370 million to $375 million but going forward I mean it is -- are you the organization at this point that wants to spend more get more or are you beginning to think about potentially getting leverage out of the dollar spend that you've currently committed to?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. John, this is Jeff. The first thing I would tell you is the overarching way that we view the business is to be front footed and really try to invest to get the gains that we want. We're not going to take our foot off the gas pedal and just hope that things continue to get better, we can continue to perform in a high fashion. We really want to make sure that we're targeted with incremental investments in the areas that we think, we are again, drive the consumer experience, drive great franchise economics, all those things roll together, hopefully we can do double-digit retail sales growth out into the next three to five years. We are not a brand that is going to circle a number and say, G&A must be this percentage of revenues or this percentage of retail sales. We think that's limiting and we think that ultimately-- if we had that kind of mentality over the last 3, 5, 10 years, we would not be sitting in the competitive position that we are today. So we are going to continue to be front footed. We're going to continue to take smart risks to Ritch's prepared remarks. I've been at the brand now for almost 19 years. I think the courage that Patrick and now Ritch have shown, our franchisees have shown to take on the really difficult challenges of the quick-service restaurant industry and continue to fight through and win is really energizing not only for the folks here in this building, but more importantly the franchisees and team members and 90 markets around the world. So we're going to continue to be front footed. We're going to continue to try to make the right choices. We're not going to run out the clock John. We are going to --we are going to be aggressive and try to grow share.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Slagle of Jefferies.
Alex Slagle: Thanks, good morning. As you think about building traffic over the next couple years, how do you envision the balance between building frequency of existing guests where you've done a great job with loyalty and analytics or see opportunity to accelerate growth in new customer visits and perhaps thoughts on how you go about identifying those groups and reeling them into the Domino's loyalists?
Ritch Allison: Sure, well, the first and foremost the opportunity is there to continue to drive frequency among folks that buy from Domino's already. And when the loyalty program was first developed, our piece of the pie rewards program three years ago, the foundation of that program was built on driving frequency. That's why points are earned based on the number of purchases as opposed to the amount of dollars that are spent. So as we look across the landscape, we still see a significant amount of opportunity to get the customers who buy from us already to buy more. Also getting trial is important as well and reducing these kinds of veto votes that may keep folks away from Domino's is important. That's one of the reasons that you saw one of the few product introductions that we've done over the last couple of years was with salads. And that was a way to attract potentially some customers and some households into the brand that maybe otherwise weren't using us before, but I see --I still see lots of opportunity and driving frequency.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Jon Tower from Wells Fargo.
Jon Tower: Hey, thanks for taking the question. First a clarification. I believe last year at least according to my notes, there was roughly a 50 basis point headwind to U.S. same store sales from the Hurricanes. So first is that correct? Second is, was there one this year from Florence? And then the question is for Ritch. Is there any sort of level of U.S. market share that you feel like Domino's could get to or perhaps some other metrics that you're looking at where you'd consider monetizing the technology platform to other operators outside your franchise base?
Jeff Lawrence: Hey, Jon. This is Jeff. I'll take your comp/hurricane question then I'll take it over to Ritch for the second part of your question. The short answer is last year and in this year, we did not see a material either benefits or detriment to the U.S. comps because of weather including hurricanes or anything else. To the extent that we do see measurable stuff like that in the future we'll point it out, but it's --I know everybody in the industry like to talk about weather when things aren't as good, but for us it wasn't either last year or this year a material part of our comp performance.
Ritch Allison: And then Jon to the second part of your question on market share. One of the great things about this segment of the QSR industry is that we as the market leader is still only sell about one in six pizzas that are sold in the U.S., and only about one in fifteen that are sold outside the U.S. So I think there is significant headroom for market share growth. If you take a look at benchmarks across other segments of QSR, whether you're looking at burgers or coffee or chicken or other places, the market leader is typically going to have a 25% or higher share. And we see that in some of our own Domino's businesses around the world as well. So in my opinion lots of room to continue to grow, and that's really where we're focused, is on continuing to do what we do really well. I like the fact that we have more than 300,000 people around the world wearing the Domino's logo who wake up every day and think about selling more Domino's Pizza. And as long as we've got a lot of runway for growth, I want to remain focused and not distracted by trying to take some elements of our business across to other brands or other sectors of the restaurant industry.
Operator: Our final question comes from one of Stephen Anderson of Maxim Group.
Stephen Anderson: One comment I do want to make is on your commodity outlook. I just want to see if there has been any change to that. And if you're looking at any trends heading into 2019? 
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, Steven, this is Jeff. Our guidance for 2018, as you may recall is 2% to 4% up on the food basket that our U.S. franchisees are expecting. We're not updating that guidance at this point. Year-to-date we are in that kind of 3% to 4% range. So we're at the high end of that, but our franchisees have done a great job at executing at the local level driving volume and continuing to drive really good dollar profit in their operations. So no change to the food basket guidance in 2018. And as far as it relates to 2019, we're not giving any commentary or guidance on that today.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen that was our final question. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ritch Allison for any additional or closing remarks.
Ritch Allison: Well, thanks everybody. And we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on Thursday, January 17, following the ICR Conference. And we also look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results on Thursday, February 21st. 
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Emily, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter 2018 earnings call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over Tim McIntyre, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.
Timothy McIntyre: Thank you, Emily, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today about the results of our second quarter. Today's call will be the first one featuring Ritch Allison, who became CEO officially on July 1. Ritch will be joined, as usual, by Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence.  As you know, this call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. And in the unlikely event that any forward-looking statements are made, I refer you to the safe harbor statement you can find in this morning's release and the 8-K.  We will start with prepared statements from CEO -- or CFO, Jeff Lawrence, excuse me, and then from CEO, Ritch Allison followed by analysts questions.  With that, I will turn it over to CFO, Jeff Lawrence.
Jeffrey Lawrence: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued as we once again delivered great results for our shareholders. We continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 29 consecutive quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 98 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continue to increase our store count at a healthy pace. Our diluted EPS, as adjusted, which excludes the impact of our recapitalization completed during the quarter, was $1.84, which is an increase of 39% over the prior year quarter.  With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q2. Global retail sales grew 12.6% in the quarter. When excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 11%. This global retail sales growth was driven by an increase in same-store sales and the average number of stores opened during the quarter. Same-store sales for our domestic division grew 6.9%, lapping a prior year increase of 9.5%. Same-store sales for our international division grew 4%, rolling a prior year increase of 2.6%.  Breaking down the domestic comp, our U.S. franchise business was up 7% while our company-owned stores were up 5.1%. These comp increases were driven by higher order counts and also ticket growth, as consumers continue to respond positively to the overall brand experience we offer them. Our Piece of the Pie loyalty program also continues to contribute meaningfully to our comps.  On the international front, all 4 of our geographic regions were again positive in the quarter, with our Americas and Asia-Pacific region leading the way, and our same-store sales performance for the quarter was driven entirely by higher order counts.  On the unit count front, we are pleased to report that we opened 43 net domestic stores in the second quarter, consisting of 44 store openings and 1 closure. Our international division added 113 net new stores during Q2, comprised of 148 store openings and 35 closures. On a total company basis, we opened 156 net new stores in the second quarter and 905 net new stores over the last 12 months, clearly demonstrating the broad strength and outstanding four-wall economics our brand enjoys globally.  Although we are generally pleased with our continued store growth, we recognized that our store growth internationally is slower than we expected for the first half of this year. We do not believe there is any structural or material market-specific reason for the net store growth result in the first half of the year, and we reiterate our global net store count guidance of 6% to 8% annual growth over the next 3 to 5 years.  Turning to revenues. Total revenues were up $150.8 million or 24% from the prior year quarter. As a reminder, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we are now required to report the franchise contributions to our not-for-profit advertising fund and the related expenses gross on our P&L.  Although this did not have an impact on our reported operating or net income in the second quarter, it did result in an $80.9 million increase in our consolidated revenues. It is important to note, although these amounts are included in our financial statements, they are restricted funds that can only be used to support the Domino's brand and are not available to be used for general corporate purposes.  The remaining $69.9 million increase in revenues resulted primarily from the following. First, higher supply chain center food volumes driven by strong U.S. retail sales resulted in higher supply chain revenues. Second, higher domestic same-store sales resulted in increased revenues at our company-owned stores as well as increased royalties and fees from our franchise stores. Store count growth also contributed to the increase in royalties and fees from our domestic franchise stores. And finally, higher international royalty revenues from higher retail sales as well as the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  Currency exchange rates positively impacted international royalty revenues by $1.1 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar weakening against certain currencies. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate that the impact of foreign currency on royalty revenues could be flat to positive $4 million year-over-year. As you know, there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rate, which does make that a harder part of our business to predict.  Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 37.7% from 30.7% in the prior year quarter. This increase resulted entirely from the recognition of domestic franchise advertising revenues on our P&L from the new revenue recognition accounting guidance I mentioned previously.  Supply chain operating margin was negatively pressured by delivery and labor cost, while company-owned store margins was positively impacted by lower insurance expenses and sales-based transaction fees as compared to the prior year quarter and was partially offset by higher food and labor costs.  Let's now shift to G&A. G&A cost increased $6.5 million as compared to the prior year quarter, which is net of the expense reclassification for certain advertising costs we mentioned on the Q1 call. This net increase resulted primarily from our planned investments in technological initiatives, including e-commerce and the teams that support them. Please note that the company receives fees for technology from franchisees that are recorded separately as franchise revenues.  Moving down the income statement. Domestic franchise advertising costs were $80.9 million in the second quarter. As a reminder, we are now showing domestic franchise advertising in our revenues with an equal and offsetting amount of expense in our operating costs.  Interest expense increased $11.5 million in the second quarter, driven by increased net debt from our most recent recapitalizations. This increase in interest expense also includes $3.3 million related to our 2018 recapitalization, which has been adjusted out as an item affecting comparability for EPS purposes. Our weighted average borrowing rate in the second quarter decreased to 4%.  Our reported effective tax rate was 15.1% for the quarter. This was primarily due to the lower federal statutory rate of 21% resulting from federal tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017. The impact of tax benefits on equity-based compensation also resulted in a $6.9 million reduction in our second quarter provision for income taxes. This resulted in a 7.6 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate.  We continue to expect that our tax rate, excluding the impact of equity-based compensation, will be 22% to 24%. We also expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to equity-based compensation. When you add it all up, our second quarter net income was up $11.7 million or 18% over the prior year quarter.  Our second quarter diluted EPS, as reported, was $1.78 versus $1.32 last year, which was a 35% increase. Our second quarter diluted EPS as adjusted for the 2018 recapitalization transaction was $1.84 versus $1.32 last year, which was a 39% increase.  Here is how that increase in diluted EPS as adjusted breaks down. Our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.23, including a $0.28 positive impact from tax reform and a $0.05 negative year-over-year impact related to lower tax benefit on equity-based compensation. Lower diluted share counts, primarily as a result of share repurchases, benefited us by $0.21. Higher net interest expense resulting primarily from a higher net debt balance negatively impacted us by $0.09. And most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.17.  Now turning to our use of cash including the use of proceeds from our recapitalization transaction. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 906,000 shares for $219 million at an average purchase price of approximately $242 per share. Year-to-date, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.35 million shares for $320 million at an average purchase price of $236 per share. We also used cash to repay $490 million of our 2015 note in connection with our recapitalization and we returned $23.5 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.55 per share quarterly dividend.  We continue to invest heavily in technology and have also increased the level of investment for supply chain capacity, primarily for our new U.S. supply chain center scheduled to open later this year. Given our current outlook for the U.S. business, we are pulling forward additional supply chain capacity building investment into 2018. This includes work to begin building two additional U.S. supply chain centers, which we project will be completed over the next 18 to 24 months.  As a result of this acceleration, we now estimate our gross capital spending for the full year 2018 to be approximately $115 million to $120 million, up from our previously communicated $90 million to $100 million range. All in all, our strong momentum continued and we are very pleased with our results this quarter.  And with that, I will turn it over to Ritch.
Richard Allison: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'm excited to be with you all on my first earnings call as CEO and I am particularly pleased to be reporting a very good quarter as the momentum in our business continues to remain quite positive, thanks to our strong fundamentals and a steady, proven strategy.  Before digging into the specifics around the quarter, there are 2 things I'd like to acknowledge. First, I'd like to pay one more respectful farewell to my predecessor, Patrick Doyle. It's a little odd for all of us on quarterly earnings day to look around the room and not see Patrick, but his legacy and contribution toward this wonderful organization will not be soon forgotten.  For me personally, I am grateful for his influence and mentorship and my progression toward the honor of succeeding him. Thank you one more time, Patrick, for all you did to make this an outstanding business and a great place to work. We wish you well and we trust you are getting some well-deserved rest and relaxation, as we speak.  Secondly, I want to express my gratitude and excitement to continue working even closer with our incredible group of franchisees. During my transition I have heard from many of our international franchisees, with whom I have worked very closely over the last 7 years.  I have also really enjoyed getting to know many more of our U.S. franchisees. It is energizing to trade thoughts around how we can continue to maintain our incredibly strong alignment and our shared commitment to industry-leading store level economics and cash-on-cash returns.  During my seven years leading the international business, this was a top priority for me and it will continue to be so going forward as we lead this business into its next phase. We placed major emphasis on ensuring our franchisees' success, and we promise to continue to listen, to be collaborative and to remain as strong of a partner for you as any in the industry.  Strong alignment and performance is a great segue into our discussion of the second quarter, one that was very solid across all areas. During the quarter, we officially surpassed the milestone of 15,000 stores worldwide and retail sales growth continued its tremendous momentum.  I am particularly pleased with the performance of our U.S. business, led by outstanding same-store sales and yet another quarter of solid sustained momentum around unit growth. Industry-leading unit economics, a focused fortressing strategy and a committed franchisee base once again contributed toward our balanced formula for growth in the U.S.  The rapid growth of our U.S. business has driven record-level volumes in our supply chain centers. With volumes up more than 50% in just the last 5 years, it is time to accelerate our investments in supply chain capacity, both to serve current demand and to support our growth plans going forward.  We are on track to open a new supply chain center in Edison, New Jersey later this year. We will also accelerate work in the second half of the year on 2 additional supply chain centers. In addition to these 3 new center projects, we are increasing our investment to enhance capacity in several existing centers.  We will continue to invest in the growth of our business going forward and we'll provide specific CapEx guidance for 2019 in January. The international business had a good quarter with top line comp performance within our 3- to 5-year outlook and positive results from all 4 regions.  I continue to be pleased to see our same-store sales growth being driven solely by order growth. We have a collection of top-notch master franchisees who are continuing to learn from insights and global best practices, focusing on value and emphasizing the importance of growing transactions, prioritizing traffic over ticket and avoiding the price take trend that we see taking place throughout most of the industry.  As Jeff touched on, our international unit growth has admittedly been a bit slower than our historic norms during the front half of 2018, but I continue to stress my confidence and expectation that this will normalize on a full year basis.  Last month, we welcomed another new market into the Domino's family. Kosovo celebrated the grand opening of its first Domino's location in mid-June and set a new Domino's European record for opening week volume. We are excited to deliver hot, made-to-order pizzas helped by strong digital ordering capability to the people of Pristina.  Domino's is truly a global brand and this was on full display during our biannual worldwide rally event held in Las Vegas just 2 months ago. We hosted nearly 9,000 Domino's franchisees, general managers and team members from 6 continents and more than 70 countries.  The interaction I was fortunate enough to have with our many global operators was truly inspiring. Our attendees learned and grow through connecting, networking and best-practice sharing. Reminding us all that we are truly a global system with so much in common, most notably, our commitment to helping one another reach success.  It was another forward-thinking quarter on the technology front as our Domino's Hotspot's ordering platform got officially up and running. We are very pleased with the launch and customer reception and most importantly, the participation and execution of our U.S. franchisees, store team members and drivers in making this a successful start to a unique, collaborative and clever digital platform.  We now have over 200,000 Domino's HotSpots delivery locations available nationwide, and I hope customers will continue reaching out to suggest new potential locations and can do so by visiting dominos.com/suggestahotspot. We continue to demonstrate our ability to invest and innovate in a flexible manner to maintain our unquestioned digital leadership position within this category. Getting a lead is one thing, keeping it is another. And that demands an aggressive and nimble mindset around investments toward this area. Expect that to only continue going forward.  In closing, it was an excellent second quarter. There's a reason that, in addition to being quite humble, I come into the position with utmost confidence in the continued potential for this business. I inherit an outstanding leadership team and smart, dedicated, motivated corporate team members here in Ann Arbor and throughout the world.  The momentum around this brand and all that it has come to stand for has never been stronger in its nearly 60-year history, and I now have the opportunity to work even closer with the best group of franchisees in the restaurant business. We are incredibly committed to their success and we'll remain aligned, focused and marching in unison toward our shared goal of dominant #1.  Thanks again, and we will now open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner.
Brian Bittner: First question, just you mentioned the loyalty program continues to be one of the largest tailwinds to your domestic comp. This is a program you launched, I think, in September 2015, so can you just help us understand what about this program almost three years later is still contributing so much to your growth trend? And I have a follow-up.
Richard Allison: Yes. Brian, the program continues to gain active membership. We'll update you on those membership numbers again in January, as we did last January, but our program just continues to resonate with our customers and we continue to see nice, solid tailwind from it.
Brian Bittner: And just my follow-up, maybe for Jeff. The international business, after a stretch of very steady margins here, you did see a pretty big decline this quarter and it looked like it was mostly because of G&A which went up a lot. Can you just unpack the drivers of the international margin this quarter and help us understand maybe how these dynamics unfold from here?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yes. I mean, first thing is we had some FX settlements. Even though we were benefited on the top line during the quarter in royalty revenues from FX as it started to turn and people were paying their bills, that pressures us a bit on the G&A line for the international division. The other one, quite simply, is that we continue to invest in the capabilities of the team members that are in the field right now, partnering with our master franchisees to grow the brand. So again, other than that, you normally get some variability, a little higher, a little lower, but those are the 2 things that I'd point to for this quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse.
Karen Holthouse: A quick one, really, on store level margins. From disclosures in the Q, it looks like labor costs are actually leveraged in the quarter, which is certainly a divergence from trend. Is there anything you would call out that was sort of onetime in nature about that? And is that going to pick up the decrease in insurance costs year-over-year or is that separate?
Jeffrey Lawrence: And you're speaking of the corporate stores, Karen?
Karen Holthouse: Yes.
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yes. So corporate store labor for the quarter was actually up 0.5 point to 30% of sales, and primarily that's labor rates. Now partly a function of some minimum wage increases we've had in the business this year and partly because the economy is humming and some of our stores we're paying a little bit more to attract, retain great team members, we are doing a better job with efficiency with the labor hours that we have in the store and we're getting some leverage because ticket and sales continue to go up, but it was not enough to overcome the labor rate increase. And that's why you see that 50 basis point increase in corporate store labor this quarter over last year's quarter.
Karen Holthouse: And then one of the things that came up on the call last quarter was starting to test fully automated phone order taking. Maybe just give us an update on sort of how that test is going and do you have any initial thoughts on when sort of earliest time to market?
Richard Allison: Sure. Karen, we've got that automated phone ordering. We've done phone ordering in about 20 of our corporate stores that we're testing, and we are continuing to learn at a very rapid rate. I don't have any update for you right now on time line for a broader rollout, but the program is moving along at or better than our initial expectations.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley.
Matthew McGinley: First question is on the international unit growth. And I know you both expressed confidence that this would reaccelerate and I assume you have reasonably good visibility into that, but was there any one factor or region that would have driven that slowdown? I mean you're in 70 countries, so it's a little bit surprising that they would all slowdown at once.
Richard Allison: Yes. Matt, it's Ritch. Yes, it's interesting, no real single market or region driving the near-term slowdown. We have had, over the course of the last year, we've had some leadership changes in a number of markets. And frankly, some markets just absorbing what was a record amount of growth across 2016, 2017. I mean, if you think about it, we opened more than 1,900 net new international stores during that 2-year period. So sometimes, markets just need a little time to absorb the impact it did have on the people and their organization. But as we take a look forward, our confidence is really grounded in the fact that we still have very strong unit level economics across these markets, and that is ultimately what drives store growth over time. So we feel good about that and we also have some visibility into the store pipeline through signed leases and things like that. So when we take a look at it, still very confident in the 6% to 8% global net unit growth that we have put out there as our guidance for the 3- to 5-year horizon.
Matthew McGinley: Okay. And on the company-owned margin side, was the deleverage you experienced there on food -- related to actual food price inflation or was it more of the labor and the supply chain? And what was the overall commodity basket up?
Jeffrey Lawrence: So it was -- for corporate stores, it was up mostly because food -- it was up mostly because of the basket, so what the supply chain centers are charging the stores for that. And there's lots of puts and takes kind of cats and dogs with commodities up, down, sideways. But net, it was up and -- not a ton, but up a little bit with the basket being up in the 4% handle quarter-over-quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort.
Gregory Francfort: I have two questions. The first is that the story for Domino's in the pizza category over the past several years has been the big 3 or 4 taking share from everybody else. But recently, it seems like Domino's has taken share from the big 4 players. Does that increase the urgency to maybe pull forward or accelerate unit growth from here? And then my other question is just on CapEx. And I know you guys don't want to guide next year, but any early read just on if there's new material step up around supply chain investments or not. I'm sure you guys have a read into how much more you need to add to the supply chain next year and just directionally kind of where we should expect that number to go.
Richard Allison: Greg, first on share, we see an opportunity, as we've communicated in the U.S. business, we see an opportunity for an 8,000-store Domino's business potential within the next 10 years. We've had success gaining share. And while a lot of that share has come from the locals and the regionals, as we look forward, we see an opportunity to take share broadly across the industry and that confidence leads to our expectation that we've got strong unit growth potential in the market.
Jeffrey Lawrence: And then on the -- this is Jeff. On the CapEx question, again, we're going to update '19 in January. We're going to anchor to that. But what I can tell you is that the second and the third center that we're going to build after New Jersey, the first center cost will be materially less than the New Jersey build. And again, we'll give you specific numbers around that when we give you our '19 guidance. In '18 we're just getting them going, but we'll give you more details on that in January so you'll have good reason to show up at our Investor Day.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh.
William Slabaugh: Just a quick question on domestic comps. Last quarter you talked about the strength of delivery and that growth rate actually outpacing carryout. So I'm curious what those two growth rates may look like if you could speak directionally to that this quarter here in the U.S.
Richard Allison: Yes. We're not going to speak specifically to the composition of growth across delivery and carryout, but both were growing during the quarter. We emphasize delivery last quarter, just given the discussion that we had been having around aggregators. But don't expect going, forward, that we'll break that comp down across delivery and carryout.
William Slabaugh: Fair enough. And Ritch, just given you've been focus on the international business for a while now. And now thinking about things, obviously, much more broadly, is there anything in the U.S. that strikes you as either an opportunity or even where we might see you focus a little bit more intently than we've already seen in the past? And I don't know supply chain might be the answer or if there could be something else.
Richard Allison: Yes. A couple of things there. One is that the strategy that we are now pushing forward in the U.S. around fortressing is actually something that a number of our international markets had been doing for some time. So there was some learnings that came out of our ability to carve out territories from existing stores and drive overall retail sales growth in the U.S. market that respond out of the efforts of some of our high-performing international master franchisees. A second area, and it relates to some of the supply chain investments that we're talking about, it has been a number of years since we opened a new supply chain center in the U.S. And as we move forward in building out with that additional capacity, we're taking a lot of the learnings that we've gained over the last decade in the international business as we built dozens of supply chain centers, employing some more advanced production techniques and technology in those centers. So we'll continue to look for opportunities to transfer learnings and best practices back and forth between our U.S. and our international businesses.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass.
John Glass: First, just on the domestic business, on the HotSpots, maybe can you talk about how acceptance of that has been. Has there been an immediate uptake or is it sort of a novelty at first and people will kind of get used to it over time? And how do you ensure that it doesn't interfere with speed of service? You can imagine a scenario where drivers are looking for somebody and that just takes a little bit longer. Have you -- how do you work through that to make sure that doesn't occur?
Richard Allison: So first of all, we won't -- John, we can't comment, really, much on the uptake so far on HotSpots just given that it's basically a Q3 event. We've been rolling it out over the course of the last month. But in general, just to kind of give you a sense for how we think about it, when you think about HotSpots, we think about it similarly to how we think about many of our AnyWare platforms. It really is another way for our customers to be able to access us anytime, anywhere that they want to. To your question on speed of service, the HotSpots are contained inside of the delivery areas that our franchisees have already, and those HotSpots are defined by our franchisees. So customers request them, but franchisees select those areas that we can deliver to. And quite often, their landmarks, which are easier to find than someone's residential address, in many cases, it might be at a beach or at a baseball field or at a park, areas that are well-known within the community.
John Glass: Got it. That's helpful. And then just another on the domestic comps. So one is that the gap between domestic company-operated and franchise, again, continues to favor franchise the last couple of quarters may be the simplest comparisons, but is there any other element in there? And maybe in answering the question, has fortressing accelerated, for example, in company-operated markets prior or ahead of franchise markets? Or maybe you could just talk about where you are in fortressing markets generally in the U.S. right now.
Richard Allison: Yes. So John, it's a good question. And yes, when we look at our corporate store growth in the U.S., basically, all of the stores that we're opening in our corporate store business are splitting territories, so there is a bit more of downward pressure on the comp from those splits. But consistent with what we've been talking about, the strategy is really around growing retail sales within that footprint and expanding the sales for household in each of those territories. So when we take a look at those openings, we're not only looking at the sales and economics potential of the new store that we're opening, but also looking broadly across the market and trying to drive sales and profitability at that level.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino.
David Tarantino: A couple of questions. First, on the domestic business. If I look at the domestic franchise revenue growth, it was quite a bit below the system sales or retail sales growth this quarter. So I know you had an accounting change, maybe that was part of it, but can you talk about why the franchise revenues lag the retail sales growth this quarter?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yes. David, this is Jeff. I think it's a couple of things. The comp flow-through in the technology revenues that we get track the way we would normally expect it, but there were a couple of things that might be mucking up your model a little bit. One is a reclassification of some technology fees out of domestic into international. That might be doing it. And the other thing that we disclosed in the quarterly report we filed this morning is a reclassification out of franchise revenues into the advertising fund revenue line item. So those two things taken together, my guess is, will make up most of your difference there.
David Tarantino: And Jeff, is that -- was that reclassification a catch-up adjustment from prior quarters or was that all related to this quarter?
Jeffrey Lawrence: It was related to this quarter. But when you compare it to last year at this time, you'll get a little bit of wonkiness there.
David Tarantino: Okay. Great. And then on the international front, I was just hoping that you could give an update on your -- expansion of your proprietary e-commerce system and the adoption of that outside the U.S. I know it's been slower than inside the U.S., so can you maybe just talk about where you are on that? What some of the barriers are to get to 100% outside the U.S.?
Richard Allison: Sure. David, we continue to work with our international master franchisees to leverage our investment in global technology platforms, and that really is continuing on a couple of fronts. You've mentioned the e-commerce side, but really the first wave on that is really with our point-of-sale system, the PULSE system, which is now in more than 12,000 of our stores globally, and we have several additional international markets that are rolling that platform out this year because that really is the foundation upon which we layer the e-commerce platforms. And then with respect to those e-commerce platforms, we continue to roll that out into new markets and also continue to have conversations with additional master franchisees about how we can take some of those core building blocks within that e-commerce platform and help to leverage the scale and investment that we're putting in so no new markets to report specifically on that, but just know that the conversations are ongoing and we continue, over time, to bring more and more of the international markets into the fold.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh.
Peter Saleh: Just wanted to come back to the supply chain investment for a minute. Jeff, what's changed in your thinking on the supply chain that you're -- you guys are being more aggressive in pulling forward more the investment this year? What's changed since the Investor Day in January that makes you guys want to be a little bit more aggressive on the investment?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yes. I mean the first thing is our U.S. operators in the field and our marketing and technology teams just continue to put up amazing growth. And when we look at what capacity we need to keep up with that growth, but also to hopefully continue the acceleration and unit count growth in the U.S. business. These are centers we knew we were going to have to build, probably over time. But as we did almost 12% -- 11%, 12% retail sales growth again in the second quarter for the U.S. business and most of that again is volume and traffic-driven, it simply accelerates what we knew what we had to do already. Again, we're just going to get these things going. They have a long lead time, 18 to 24 months is what I said in the prepared remarks. But we view this as a front footed, a smart investment, kind of a good CapEx problem and we're going to get great, fresh, high-quality dough out to our stores that we have today, but also make sure we can get the capacity for the stores we're going to open up over the next 1 to 5 years. That's really important to us. We're excited to make these investments and more importantly, our franchisees are excited that we're making these investments.
Richard Allison: Peter, I'll give you just a little bit more color as well in addition to what Jeff just said. If you look back over the last 5 years, the volume that is running through our existing supply chain center network in the U.S. is up more than 50%. So the team there has done a great job of absorbing what is a phenomenal increase in demand within the existing footprint, but we are now at a point where you start to get inefficiencies and diseconomies of scale in some of these centers when you get capacity up past a certain point. So we're both trying to absorb some of the demand that we've already driven, create a little bit of model preparing ourselves, as Jeff said, for the future growth in our business going forward. It's also, at this point in time, with the after-tax return on our investments, it's better this year than it was last year, so it gives us another opportunity to continue to invest.
Peter Saleh: Great. And then just one more question for me, I know you guys have been focusing a lot more on the carryout business. Given that you've had a lot more creative and more focus on this in the front half of the year, what does the data tell you about the carryout business versus the delivery businesses? Is carryout still a very separate occasion than the delivery customers? Are you still seeing unique guests coming for carryout or is there any -- or are you seeing more crossover from the delivery customer into the carryout business?
Richard Allison: We're still seeing them as two different occasions with very literal overlap across, and that's why you've seen us consistently market to both of those occasions. So we will -- 52 weeks of the year, you see our ads running on TV and we are running certain messages that are targeted directly to the delivery segment and certain messages that are targeted directly to the carryout segment. And as we mentioned back in January, that key insight is one of the things that has given us the confidence around our fortressing strategy as the new stores that we open allow us to access a carryout customer that we weren't able to access before because a carryout customer will not drive as far to pick up a pizza as we will drive to deliver them one.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull.
Christopher O'Cull: I just had a couple of follow-ups. One was on the domestic fortressing strategy. Ritch, how many stores opening this year are part of that strategy and is there a geographic region of the country where the strategy is focused? It would seem like targeting markets where competitors were weaker would make sense.
Richard Allison: Yes. We continue to increase the number of those units that are opening. Our splits across the geographies in the U.S. side, Jeff, you may correct me here, but I believe on a trailing basis we were just shy of -- over the last 2 years, it was just shy of 300 of our units opened in the U.S. were split territories. So sometimes, that's taking one store's territory and carving it in half, and sometimes it's taking some territory from several stores to create a new trading area for a new store that's opening up. So we look at this on a market-by-market basis across the geographies and we run our models to understand what the incremental sales gain can be from that new store and what the impact on the existing stores will be.
Christopher O'Cull: Okay. And then, Jeff, to the reclassification that impacted the franchise revenue line, the domestic line, was that new this quarter or did that happen last quarter as well?
Jeffrey Lawrence: It was in Q3 last year, we did it. So now you're looking at a Q2 versus Q2 last year. So you're getting a little bit of that, again, kind of wonkiness there. So when we get into -- all the way to Q1 -- Q4 and Q1, they'll start to normalize a little bit. But until then, it will definitely mess with your percentages of retail sales there.
Christopher O'Cull: One thing I'm struggling with is, if you look at the first quarter, you had about 12% growth in the domestic franchise revenue year-over-year and you had a similar comp. And maybe a little lower comp this quarter, but similar unit growth rate. And then this year or this quarter, the second quarter, it grew by 6%. So can you help me understand what's the difference in the growth rate in that line item from the first quarter to the second quarter, what caused that?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yes. Again, I'm not sure, obviously, all the puts and takes in what you're modeling there. But the biggest thing I can tell you is the contractual royalty rate haven't change, the incentive programs has been pretty steady and the technology flow-through has also been what we would expect. So everything else is basically accounting and reclassifications as we think about it because, really, nothing else fundamentally is changing the economics of the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Two questions. First one, Ritch, when you're looking at the international business, this is where you're coming from, I mean you mentioned all 4 geographies, all positive, just looking back over the past few years and what obviously has been very strong comp growth. But the last 6 or 7 quarters, it looks like you've been within that long-term guidance range or maybe slightly below, whereas the prior 12 quarters where, clearly, every quarter consistently above the high end of your kind of 3% to 6% long-term guidance. I'm just wondering, are we in kind of a new steady state now where most of your key markets are more mature and the long-term guidance is more appropriate or are there certain structural things going that's changing it? Or -- I know you mentioned that there are no really any markets that are bearing meaningfully from a comp flow perspective, but just wondering your thoughts as we look forward whether the 3% to 6% is now likely to be sustained versus what had been consistent outsized growth.
Richard Allison: Yes. Jeff, as we look forward, that 3% to 6% range I think is the range that you should be thinking about. We've had a significant acceleration in the unit growth in that international business if you look back over the course of the last 7 years. And just as we spoke about in the U.S. business, many of those store openings that we've had, in particular in the mature market, have been stores that have been splits or carved outs from the existing store territories. That puts a little bit of downward pressure on the overall -- on the same-store sales comp, but again we do that because the objective is driving retail sales growth. And so when we take a look at retail sales growth, second quarter, we were still -- even excluding the impact of foreign currency, 10.6% retail sales growth in the international business, which is in the upper end of our long-term range. So I think that's how you should think about it. It is a mix of businesses out there, some wide open territory in some countries where we're still relatively underpenetrated, but then the balance of the growth coming from the more mature markets where more of the store openings will be carve outs.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And then my follow-up, also, just on the international front. I'm just wondering, in your new seat, whether there's anything you consider doing differently as you think about international. I know in the past it often came up a lot about the royalty rate and how to determine country by country. I'm just wondering, how often is that rate reviewed or is there options for negotiation? Obviously, the international franchisees are doing so well, or which ever considered taking an equity stake in any of these businesses, or should we just assume kind of steady as she goes?
Richard Allison: Yes. Jeff, we don't have any near-term plans to make change in strategy for that business. We feel good about the way it is structured today. The master franchise business model is a model that we still believe is the right way to grow the Domino's Pizza business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco.
Matthew DiFrisco: With a couple of follow-up questions. With the supply chain investments, I guess you answered that as far as -- I'm trying to understand on the margin front, are you saying that now that this will be a margin benefit as far as getting better capacity and more efficient plans right away? Or is there going to be a little bit of a time to ramp those up to get to better capacity utilization so then the supply chain margins, the improvement to come might be in the out years?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yes. Great question, Matt. We haven't and we're not, today, giving any guidance specifically around margins in any of the businesses including the supply chain. But what I can tell you is, as you can see with the New Jersey Center that we're opening, capacity and catching up on capacity, it cost a lot of money, right? And the second and third centers, although, they'll materially less than CapEx than the New Jersey Center, are also pretty big dollars. And what we're looking to do, without giving guidance on it, is just take advantage of these new centers, some of the new technologies, capture some of the transportation centers by being closer to the customers in these 2 or 3 new spots. And then, obviously, try to, the best we can, overcome the cost of actually building the center. So the thought I'd give you of the way I think about this long term is we're running at about an 11 percentage-or-so operating margin. I think it was 10.7% this particular quarter -- yes, 10.7% is particular quarter. I don't think it's going to 15%. I don't think it's going down to 7%. So I think it will generally be within some kind of a range that makes sense for the industry. And listen, at the end of the day, we don't have a choice. We got to build this capacity and get that fresh dough to support the stores we have and the ones we're going to grow in the future.
Matthew DiFrisco: That's a good problem to have, though. So I guess if you're looking at the franchise perspective, are their margins going to get better and potentially from some new capacity that you're bringing on or new abilities that your capabilities are doing at these facilities?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yes. I mean, listen, one of the nice things about the -- having great franchise relationships is we also have a structure where we share in all of the investment, in all the profitability of the supply chain centers in the U.S. and Canada. So it is a true partnership that we both benefit from greatly. When I think about franchisee profitability in the U.S., 2017 was an all-time high and it's at a level that's supporting the growth of these units. What I would tell you is, whether it's food, labor, insurance, rent, anything around this capacity, it really doesn't matter what it is, we need to grow our way out of any kind of potential P&L headwinds. We've been able to do it very successfully, obviously, for an extended period of time. And as Ritch mentioned in his opening remarks, we will not lose focus on making sure that our franchisees grow right along with us. It is the secret sauce of what we've been able to accomplish, and our franchisees know that. And we're going to grow together, so big opportunity for us. We're -- as we mentioned, we're a small number one player in the U.S. pizza industry, we've got a lot more opportunity out there and we're going to do that together with these guys.
Matthew DiFrisco: Okay. And then just a question with World Cup. How did that have, if it did, have an impact on the international side of the business as far as potentially same-store sales or development? How should we look at that as any sort of impact as it's -- it didn't happen last year, so?
Richard Allison: So World Cup, for us, was a Q3 event, so we won't comment any on sales impact from that on this call.
Matthew DiFrisco: Would it be correct to assume it's a positive, historically?
Richard Allison: We're not going to touch on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump.
Alton Stump: I think most of my questions have been asked. I just want to touch back on HotSpots. And you, of course, understanding that it's still very early, and I think as you mentioned, Ritch, is more of a 3Q platform. But kind of what have you seen, so far, from -- is there any kind of read on how much of those orders are cannibalizing versus incremental? Are they all incremental? Or just any kind of color, even though it is very early, that you can provide.
Richard Allison: Yes. Still too early, really, for any of those quantitative measures. And as we spoke about, it's predominantly a Q3 event. But having 200,000 of these set up already, I think speaks to the consumer interest that we've seen and also the fact that our franchisees have really embraced it. So we're excited about it as we think about it fitting into, as I mentioned earlier, these AnyWare platforms. And the overall message that we're really trying to bring forward is that we want to be -- for our customers, we want to be there pizza provider anytime, anywhere they want to access us.
Alton Stump: Makes sense. And then just one quick follow-up on HotSpots, I mean, is there an opportunity to expand the delivery territory? If a franchisee, obviously, can move out into a territory that isn't covered by another Domino's franchisee, is there the ability to do that set up HotSpots outside of their actual delivery area?
Richard Allison: We're really focused on these HotSpots inside the existing delivery areas, and I'll describe why. When you start to venture outside of the existing delivery area, it can sometimes sound enticing because it may -- you may think it's an incremental order, but the cost of getting that pizza further away from the store is a challenge. And in fact, we're moving actually in the opposite direction of tightening our delivery territories over time. And we talk about fortressing, it is about really shrinking those delivery areas so that we, a, access the carryout business in those new locations that we've talked about. But also by having those delivery areas tighter, it allows us to get food to customers more quickly which brings them back more often and it reduces the delivery cost associated with each of those orders, making those delivery orders more profitable.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe.
John Ivankoe: At this point, I think a couple short ones. Firstly, there was a slight uptick in international closures in the second quarter and I think there was in the first quarter as well. Is there anything you need to think about the rate of international closures? I mean is it just modernization of the system? You see better locations elsewhere like you saw in the U.S. a decade or 2 ago or is that happening in specific markets?
Richard Allison: Yes. There's not really anything structural, John, that we're concerned about when we -- while it upticked a bit from what we've seen historically in an individual quarter, when we take a look at on a trailing 12-month run rate or if we look at how we think about it going forward, we don't see any major structural issues. Over time, market close, close some locations, as trading areas change and open up elsewhere, but nothing unique to any specific market or any specific trend that I would highlight.
John Ivankoe: Okay. And then, secondly, you touched on market rates kind of driving up your own labor cost. But the question was around availability, specifically around delivery drivers. I mean, whether in the U.S. or a market like the U.K., are you seeing any acute pockets of demand for your drivers where you feel execution has been affected? In other words, do you think the current employment market may actually be constraining your ability to execute to some extent?
Richard Allison: John, we certainly have -- with the growth of our business, we've got open positions across the U.S. and in many markets around the world, but not at a level that has been constrained our growth or that has caused any major service deficiencies. The -- with unemployment at the level that it is in the U.S. and some of the international markets, it is a very competitive market for labor, just as it is a competitive market at the customer level as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Scott.
Jeremy Scott: Just on the theme of fortressing your markets. Can you talk a bit about the value proposition? It seemed that the context or the promotional levels that we're seeing from Domino's and your top branded competitor in contrast with the rising menu prices from independent pizza players. I asked this question in the context that the last 2 years we haven't really seen much consolidation of the market, at least on the delivery side. It seems like most of your market share has come from the other big 2. Are we seeing a change this year and are you seeing more value-driven or price-driven transactions?
Richard Allison: So we've stayed very consistently focused on value over time. I mean our -- we're now in our 9th year at $5.99. We've stayed on that. And I think in the minds of many customers, when they think about $5.99 that's associated directly with Domino's. So we're continuing to stay focused on that from -- on the delivery side of the business. And then we've also got a very competitive value offering out there on the carryout side as well, which has been consistently for a while now that's $7.99 large, 3 tops. So we're aggressively going after share in both of those businesses. And back to what we were talking about around fortressing, as we think about it, fortressing is really important for both of those. The carryout business is largely incremental when we opened these new stores. And in order to stay competitive at $5.99 on delivery over time, we've got to continue to be more and more efficient. And by fortressing and tightening down these delivery territories, it allows us to operate a very efficient and cost-effective business model, even while bringing great value to our customers.
Jeremy Scott: Got it. Just a quick follow-up. We've seen a bit of a drop-off here in your core commodity cost. Do you expect that to run into the spot chain restaurant margins or is that -- do you intend to reinvest?
Richard Allison: For the store level food basket, we were actually up in the quarter. For our franchise and our corporate-owned stores, food is down a little bit. And supply chain, as a result of procurement savings just benefiting from the scale that we have, certainly, as a #1 player, that's getting better, not worse. But we've given guidance this year of the 2% to the 4% for the basket going up and we're not changing that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore.
Sara Senatore: Two follow-ups, if I may. One, on -- just touch upon something you mentioned about value and being very competitive. One of the -- your major competitor seems to be really struggling now. So I actually thought you might see even a bit of an acceleration granted 7% comps is impressive, but I would have thought maybe there was a little bit more room to take share. So are other -- there are other players that are also pressing on value and on their advantage and maybe you're sort of splitting the traffic shift more evenly. So that was question one and then I have another follow-up on the supply chain.
Richard Allison: Sara, I won't comment on what other competitors are doing in the marketplace. Just simply, we're going to maintain our focus on value for our customers and on -- and our focus on making sure that we're delivering great unit level economics for our franchisees. And the share will fall where it falls over time. If we do a great job on those things that we can control, then I think we'll continue to be able to take share from across the industry.
Sara Senatore: Okay. And then just on the supply chain, I guess, philosophically, it seems like owning the supply chain is sort of sacrosanct. But not every franchise business owns their supply chain, in fact, it's more of the minority and it does have a dampening impact on operating margins and returns. So I guess I was wondering if there's an opportunity or if you have ever considered outsourcing it. Other big system seem to be able to control quality and consistency across the franchise base without necessarily owning it from the supply chain.
Richard Allison: Yes. Sara, when we think about it, really, the core of our product offering is that fresh dough that we produce ourselves with our proprietary formula and that we distribute out to our stores. And there are, certainly, capital implications to doing that. We are going to have to invest to continue to expand that network, but we feel so strongly about the quality of our product and in controlling the quality of that product that we're going to produce that dough ourselves. And I'll also tell you that I think one of the key elements of the value proposition to our franchisees is the very high level of service that they get from an integrated supply chain where we bring that fresh dough and the other products and materials that they need to their stores increasingly 3 times a week for most of them. So it's a great service for our franchisees in addition to being a key part of the customer value proposition. And then, of course, finally, the great thing about it is it does deliver a significant level of profitability to the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tower.
Jon Tower: Just first on international same-store sales. The number now trending more within your long-term guidance and I believe you said earlier it was driven by order growth. I'm just looking back, historically, you are outside of that 3% to 6% long-term range. I'm just curious to know what the composition of the comp growth has been, perhaps, now relative to the past. Meaning, order growth versus ticket growth and how that's evolved.
Richard Allison: John, it can ebb and flow some over time. In the first half of last year, it was more driven by ticket than it was orders. This year driven, we're very happy to say exclusively, by order count growth. Over time, what we look for in the business, and this is no different in our U.S. business, we look to drive the majority of our same-store sales gains over time through order count growth. That is the only sustained way to grow the business, over time, is through transaction growth. There are times when brands will grow their same-store sales through pricing increases and that can sometimes work in the short term, but rarely works over the long term in terms of being able to sustain the growth in the business. When you look back at 98 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales gains, we would not have been able to do that in the international business without driving significant order count or transaction growth over time.
Jon Tower: And I know you're pleased with store level returns in the international markets, but has that come under a bit of pressure with perhaps a shift in that comp growth more towards the traffic and away from the ticket?
Richard Allison: No. We still feel very good about where we are on cash-on-cash returns at the store level in our international markets. Again, things will ebb and flow over time in individual markets, but we've been pretty strong and steady there when you take a look at it across the board.
Jon Tower: Okay. And then last one just a modeling question. The interest expense for the year, is the expectation still the $145 million to $147 million I think you talked about last quarter?
Jeffrey Lawrence: Yes, it is. And that's the as reported number.
Operator: And the last question in queue today is from the line of Stephen Anderson.
Stephen Anderson: From Maxim Group. I don't want to beat the international piece of the business to death, but as I recall about 1 year ago, there were some concerns about the rise of third-party aggregators. There hasn't been as much talk about it now. But since we were lapping that, and maybe the lap hasn't been as much as had been suggested, can you tell me if there's been anything that you're seeing outside the U.S. that maybe there's a new competitor or maybe one of those competitors is gaining momentum in these markets. Can you flesh some insight into that?
Richard Allison: Steve, we don't really have anything to add there beyond what we've talked about in the past. We've got -- we haven't seen any significant new players come into that market. We haven't seen any significant new evidence that leads us to believe that the economics of that business have changed.
Operator: There are no further questions left in queue. I'd like to turn the call back to the presenters.
Richard Allison: Well, thanks, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2018 results with you on Tuesday, October 16.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Marcella and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Tim McIntyre, you may begin your conference.
Timothy P. McIntyre - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Marcella, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today about the results of our first quarter. Today's call will be the final one featuring CEO, Patrick Doyle. As you know, this call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others to be in a listen-only mode. In the unlikely event that any forward-looking statements are made, I refer you to the safe harbor statement you can find in this morning's release and the 8-K. As always, we will start with prepared comments from Domino's Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence, and from Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Doyle, followed by the analyst questions. With that, I'd like to turn it over to CFO, Jeffrey Lawrence.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued as we once again delivered great results for our shareholders. We continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 28 consecutive quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 97 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continued to increase our store count at a healthy pace. Our diluted earnings per share was $2 a share, which is an increase of 59% over the prior-year quarter. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q1. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 16.8% in the quarter. When excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 13.1%. This global retail sales growth was driven by an increase in same-store sales growth and the average number of stores opened during the quarter. Same-store sales for our domestic division grew 8.3%, lapping a prior-year increase of 10.2%. Same-store sales for our international division grew 5%, lapping a prior-year increase of 4.3%. Breaking down the domestic comp, our U.S. franchise business was up 8.4%, while our company-owned stores were up 6.4%. Both comp increases were driven primarily by order count or traffic growth as consumers continued to respond positively to the overall brand experience we offer them. Ticket also increased during the growth. On the international front, all four of our geographic regions were again positive in the quarter with our Americas and Asia-Pacific regions leading the way. As I mentioned on the Q4 2017 call, our comps that quarter were negatively impacted when compared to the prior year, as our fiscal calendar did not include New Year's Day. That shifted back favorably in Q1 as comps globally were positively impacted by approximately half a point this quarter. On the unit count front, we are pleased to report that we opened 31 net domestic stores in the first quarter, consisting of 35 store openings and 4 closures. Our international division added 79 net new stores during Q1, comprised of 104 store openings and 25 closures. On a total company basis, we opened 110 net new stores in the first quarter and 966 net new stores over the last 12 months, clearly demonstrating the broad strength and outstanding four-wall economics our brand and franchisees enjoy globally. Turning to revenues. Total revenues were up $161.2 million or 26% from the prior-year quarter. As a reminder, we adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, we are now required to report the franchise contributions to our not-for-profit advertising fund and the related expenses gross on our P&L. Although this had no impact on our reported operating or net income in the first quarter, it did result in an $82.2 million increase in our consolidated revenues. It is important to note although these amounts are now included in our P&L, they are restricted funds that can only be used to support the Domino's brand and are not available to be used for general corporate purposes. The remaining $78.9 million increase in revenues resulted primarily from the following. First, higher supply chains that are food volumes, driven by strong U.S. constant store growth, resulting in higher supply chain revenues. Second, higher domestic same-store sale and store count growth resulted in increased royalties and fees from our franchise stores, as well as higher revenues at our company owned stores. And finally, higher international royalty revenues from store count growth and increased same-store sales, as well as the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rates positively impacted international royalty revenues by $3.3 million versus the prior-year quarter due to the dollar weakening against certain currencies. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 38.2% from 31% in the prior-year quarter. This increase resulted entirely from the recognition of domestic franchise advertising revenues on our P&L from the new revenue recognition accounting guidance, I mentioned previously. Growth in our global franchise business benefited the overall company operating margin, while supply chain operating margin was negatively pressured by both labor and delivery costs. Company-owned store margins remained flat for the quarter. Let's now shift to G&A. G&A cost increased $6.4 million as compared to the prior-year quarter. This increase resulted primarily from our planned investments in technological initiatives, including e-commerce and the teams that support them. Please note that these investments are partially offset by fees that we receive from our franchisees, which are recorded as franchise revenues. Moving down to P&L, you will also note a new expense line item called domestic franchise advertising. Due to the new revenue recognition guidance, we are now showing domestic franchise advertising in our revenues with an equal and offsetting amount of expense in our operating costs. In the first quarter, we recorded $82.2 million in expenses related to this change. Related to these changes, certain advertising costs that were previously included in our G&A line item have been reclassified to the new domestic franchise advertising expense line item. As a result of this expense re-class and our outlook for the rest of the year, we now estimate that our G&A line item for full-year 2018 will be in the range of $370 million to $375 million. As a final note on these accounting changes, we will not be providing an outlook on domestic franchise advertising expense. Moving down the income statement. Net interest expense increased by $4.3 million in the first quarter, primarily as a result of increased net debt from our 2017 recapitalization. This was partially offset by a lower weighted average borrowing rate of 3.9% as compared to 4.6% in the prior-year quarter. Our reported effective tax rate was 14.3% for the quarter. This was primarily due to the lower federal statutory rate of 21%, resulting from the federal tax reform legislation enacted at the end of 2017. The impact of tax benefit on equity-based compensation also resulted in an $8.4 million reduction in our first quarter provision for income taxes. This resulted in an 8 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate. We continue to expect that our tax rate, excluding the impact of equity-based compensation, will be 22% to 24%. We also expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate, related to equity-based compensation. When you add it all up, our first quarter net income was up $26.4 million, or 42% over the prior-year quarter. Our first quarter diluted EPS was $2 a share versus $1.26 last year, which was a 59% increase. Here is how that $0.74 increase breaks down; our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.38, including a $0.32 positive impact from tax reform and a $0.06 positive impact related to tax benefit on equity-based compensation. Lower diluted share counts, primarily as a result of share repurchases, benefited us by $0.19. Higher net interest expense, resulting from a higher net debt balance, negatively impacted us by $0.05. And most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.22, including a $0.04 benefit from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate on royalty revenues. Now turning to the use of cash. During the first quarter we repurchased and retired approximately 448,000 shares for $101.1 million at an average purchase price of approximately $226 per share. Subsequent to the first quarter, we returned $23.5 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.55 per share quarterly dividend. We also repurchased and retired approximately 352,000 shares for $81.3 million, at an average purchase price of approximately $231 per share. All in all, our strong momentum continued and we are very pleased with our results this quarter. Before turning it over to Patrick, I would like to give an update on our recently completed recapitalization transaction. As previously announced, we have been in the process of recapitalizing our company, increasing our leverage to match our growing business, which has been a consistent pattern for many years. The recapitalization transaction closed on April 24 with the receipt of $825 million in gross proceeds. We are happy to report that the deal was very well received by the lending community. And the interest rate we'll be paying on this new debt are a good reflection of the investment community confidence in our business and our brand. Now on to some details about this deal, the transaction, which again has taken advantage of the whole business securitization structure, included issuing $825 million of new fixed rate notes, which was made up of the following tranches: a $425 million tranche at a 4.116% coupon rate, with an anticipated repayment date in October 2025; and a $400 million tranche at a 4.328% coupon rate, with an anticipated repayment date in July of 2027. On a blended rate basis, these 2018 notes carry a pre-tax interest rate of approximately 4.2%. We are very pleased to have locked in additional debt at low interest rates well into the future. Our debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio using Q1 trailing 12-month EBITDA is now approximately 5.8 times, up from approximately 5.2 times prior to the deal, and near the top end of our previously- stated 3 to 6 times range. The 2018 notes have scheduled principal payments of 1% of the principal each year, which equates to approximately $8.3 million per year. With these scheduled principal payments on our outstanding notes and our momentum in the business, we currently expect our leverage ratios to fall over the medium term, consistent with prior practice. Use of funds from this transaction include $490 million to prepay and retire the balance of our existing 2015 five-year fixed rate notes, which will take place tomorrow. We also paid fees and expenses related to the deal of approximately $9 million and pre-funded approximately $4.4 million for a portion of our principal interest on the 2018 notes. We expect to decide on the use of the remaining proceeds of approximately $322 million in the near term. One last note on the recapitalization, we currently estimate that for full-year 2018, as-reported interest expense is currently expected to be between $145 million and $147 million on a pre-tax basis. It is important to note that these current estimates of interest expense may change due to borrowings under our variable funding notes and changes in LIBOR that would affect our variable rate debt, among other factors. All in all, another very good refinancing transaction for the company. And with that, I will turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin today's call, my final as President and CEO of this amazing organization, with gratitude towards many. I want to thank the many investors who have believed in our long-term story over the years. It's been great to interact with you along the way. I've learned from being challenged by your questions and observations over time, and they've helped us shape how we approach the business and ultimately helped us generate industry-leading shareholder returns. I want to thank all of the sell-side analysts for the time spent in understanding Domino's long-term approach and for your belief in our strategy and fundamentals. It's been great to get to know all of you. And while I'm still on the job for a couple more months, I want to also take this public opportunity to thank the tremendous second-to-none collection of people that make up our leadership team, our corporate team members, our incredible group of global franchisees, and the team members in the stores who take great care of our customers. As I've touched on in the past few months when discussing our leadership transition, the major reason for deciding it's time for me to move on is our deep bench of leadership talent, and an incoming CEO who couldn't be more prepared and ready to move the brand and business forward. I'm excited for many of you to get to know Rich Allison better in the coming months. I have no doubt that he will do an outstanding job. And beyond his skills and smarts as a leader, he's a good friend, and a great person who will represent our culture perfectly. You will hear from Rich in a few moments, but first, I'm delighted to discuss with you our first quarter and outstanding start to 2018. To summarize the quarter, we delivered, and we delivered in every way. There was an intriguing element of our results that's worth noting, particularly in the face of many questions we've received of late regarding the current delivery landscape. We generated significant growth in delivery during the quarter. While both carryout and delivery have consistently grown, carryout has outpaced delivery growth most of the past several quarters. We remain absolutely committed to carryout as a prime incremental opportunity for our business, but I was pleased to see delivery grew faster than carryout in our first quarter. Part of the reason for this is our continued assessment of third-party aggregator delivery, which has generated significant discussion within our industry and the investor community over the past couple of years. Simply, as our results demonstrate, we have continued to see very little impact on our business from third-party delivery. And between our strong overall retail sales growth, as well as the particularly strong delivery growth in Q1, our viewpoint on this seemingly becomes more and more confirmed. Delivery aggregator economics remain challenging and unproven, and those making attempts to succeed in this space are likely realizing something we have known for almost six decades; delivery is hard. While we aren't always perfect, I'm confident in our ability to continue to fend off those who attempt to play in our space of expertise and by utilizing the competitive advantage of owning it ourselves remain committed to offering the best experience for our customers and most affordable platform for our franchisees. The other major takeaway from our first quarter and a definite highlight is the tremendous retail sales performance, particularly within the Domestic segment. Clearly, our same-store sales performance was strong, but as we have stated, the best way to view the business for the long term will continue to be through the blend of comps and unit growth. And I'm pleased to see such a strong result in that regard to kick off 2018. This growth is leading to many things; fortressing (18:46) markets to generate superior returns for our franchisees, promoting continued investments in areas such as supply chain and technology to keep up with the strong retail sales growth, and a franchisee focus on growing their businesses and seeing the long-term importance in maximizing their profit potential through both store growth and same-store sales growth. Before I get into further specifics on the quarter, I want to take a minute to turn the call over to the next CEO at Domino's, Rich Allison.
Richard E. Allison - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Patrick. I appreciate you allowing me a minute for some quick remarks on our call today. The main thing I want to do today is simply to say thank you on behalf of our entire leadership team. We are so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with you and to learn from you. Patrick Doyle is, without question or debate, the top CEO in the industry. And while Patrick leaves big shoes to fill, I am extremely excited to step into a role I feel incredibly prepared to take on, overseeing such a tremendous brand and such a talented collection of people. Patrick, thank you so much for your leadership and for our friendship over the past eight years. It is my personal goal, and that of our entire company, to carry forward the tremendous momentum around this business. To those on the call, I am also very excited about our start to 2018 and our first quarter performance. I look forward to the opportunity to lead this phenomenal brand into the future. In addition to my first earnings call this July, I look forward to meeting and getting to know many of you better throughout the back half of 2018 and beyond. So with that, and with great appreciation, I'll turn it back over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Rich, I really appreciate it. I am absolutely confident that we are going to continue to do even better things around here under your leadership. So continuing my first quarter comments, and on our domestic business specifically, I am very pleased with an outstanding start to 2018. One of the things that I will miss most and continue to truly give Domino's its winning edge, is the continued energy and commitment of our U.S. franchisees. This group just refuses to be complacent or rest on their past success. Their unrelenting commitment to success related to sales, service and smart growth is inspiring. A relationship with our franchisees is second to none. Rich inherits and helped build a group of people who strongly believe in what we are trying to accomplish as a brand and as a system. Our alignment with our franchisees and our constant focus on their profitability and success is the only way we can succeed as a company. This alignment allows us to move faster as a system to take advantage of new opportunities and make investments in areas that generate future competitive advantage. Speaking of advantages, a quick note on technology highlighted by yet another recently announced forward-thinking innovation that we believe could be a game changer within our space; announced just last week, our Hotspots program is something we think could redefine delivery convenience, and adds to the long list of category firsts for Domino's. This will allow customers to order Domino's from thousands, in fact now almost 200,000, of parks, beaches, sports fields, and other places, which will now serve as official delivery locations. The ability to now deliver to spots without a traditional address and other rather unexpected sites will not only continue to drive incremental orders in the near term, but it is yet another meaningful step on our mission of industry-leading convenience; and the ability to order from us anywhere, anytime. This is thanks to outstanding technology helped by continued aggressive investment, sound operations, which are vital to making the Hotspots process work and proper execution participation at the store level, a nod to our terrific franchisees, managers and drivers. We urge you to visit the Hotspots area of our website to learn more about this very exciting, innovative, and pioneering platform. On top of Hotspots, we've also just announced another exciting advance in our technology. Enabled by our investments in proprietary artificial intelligence, we are developing the ability to take all phone orders via DOM, our virtual assistant. Fundamentally, we are on a path to take all orders digitally. Doing so will mean not only a better customer experience, which should generate continued sales and store-level profit growth, it allows our store-level teams to focus all their efforts on making great pizzas and giving great service to our customers. I'm not big on hyperbole, but this could be a game changer for us and our customers. On the international front, the business continued to perform very well with quarterly count performance at the higher end of our stated range, to get the year off to a solid start. I was very pleased to see our same-store sales performance be driven completely by order growth with more and more markets adopting promotional strategies and initiatives designed to grow transactions. Within our international business, I'd like to highlight the recent top line performance of our India business. As you've recently heard from Jubilant FoodWorks, our master franchisee in India, the reaccelerating of sales in the market is leading them to also reaccelerate their commitment to store growth within India; this at the same time that one major competitor has left the market and another is struggling. Our unit openings in international were a bit slower than usual in Q1, but we remain confident in our long-term outlook of 6% to 8% net unit openings. In closing I'd like to reiterate my great appreciation for the opportunity to lead this organization as CEO for the past 8-plus years and for over two decades with this amazing brand. I am extremely proud of what we've been able to accomplish. And even as I pass the CEO role to Rich, I will be a Dominoid forever. When I took this job I set out to achieve three things. First, I wanted Domino's to provide the best return for our franchisees in the restaurant industry by creating the dramatically better experience for our customers. Second, I wanted to ensure succession strength and have a leadership team and CEO in place that would be ready to take the business forward. And lastly, to become the number one pizza company in the world by the end of the decade. When I set this last goal, it was clearly a stretch, but my confidence in our franchisees, our leadership and every single person who passionately works to make this brand just a little bit better each and every day, left me little doubt that we would get it done. But here is the beauty of this organization. No one will rest. Victory lasts and complacency just don't exist within this culture. As it became clear, we're going to become the category leader, the discussion immediately shifted to how we become dominant number one. With Rich, Russell, and the whole team more than ready to take on the strategy of how to get there, it was time for me to step aside. And while I will truly miss the daily interaction with our franchisees and the team, I can't wait to watch from the sidelines and share on this phenomenal team, phenomenal brand, and phenomenal culture as it gets there and there is no doubt in my mind that it will. Thank you all so very much and we will now open it up for questions for myself, Rich, or Jeff.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Good morning. And, Patrick, it's just been such a pleasure to get to know you over the years. It's just been one heck of a run you've had, so congratulations. It's only fitting that you go out with a bang here and we're certainly all going to miss you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Brian.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: A couple of questions. Just with the fourth quarter now further in the rear view, are you able to now look back and better diagnose what that slowdown was most attributable to and what do you think is the biggest driver of this reacceleration or this improved trend that you've seen in the first quarter?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. Brian, I mean, first of all, fourth quarter was pretty darn good. We were pretty happy with it, but clearly, first quarter even got a bit better. I guess what I would say is, first, remember that New Year's Day shift so that was kind of a half a point out of Q4 and a half a point into or even a bit more into Q1, and so there's kind of a point plus of swing in the quarters right there. But if you look at it overall, our stores are executing at a very high level. They continue to do better and better on that. Our loyalty program and earn anywhere is continuing to I think accelerate the growth in the loyalty program. I think our advertising has been particularly effective in the first quarter, and I would remind you that we were lapping an incredibly big number in the fourth quarter. And normally, at the time, we're not going to talk about laps, but it was a particularly big one. So I think those are really the things, and at the end of the day, our guidance is 3% to 6% on the comps. We were happy to come in obviously over the top of that in the first quarter, but that's where we think we're going to be more often than not.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And just my last question. As you think about the potential to take share from smaller players going forward over a longer term, what do you think is going to be the biggest headwind for them? Why are they going to continue to donate share? Is it just an inability to compete on price, tough time competing on digital? What's the share shift driver going to be moving forward?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: I think there are a number of things, but we think we've got our food right, our digital strength is clearly driving a lot of it, our discipline around pricing, and frankly our focus on the profitability of our stores is allowing our franchisees to be disciplined around price. The fact that we've been able to run a national price point for nine years now and continue to make improvements in our franchisees' store level profitability is a big part of that. And our understanding that at the end of the day if you're not bringing more customers into your stores day in and day out, it's not going to be a long-term recipe for success. So there're just a lot of things that have played into it, but our focus on the franchisees' store level profitability and putting tools in place and the digital things in place that are going to do that and, as I was just talking about DOM and how we can become a 100% digital business. Don't underestimate what a big deal that could be for store-level profitability and for customer convenience. Those are the sorts of things that are going to allow us to continue to take share.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. And Patrick, I'd like to add my congratulations and best wishes, too. We'll miss you here.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, John.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Can you – you did call out the international store growth moderating versus a year ago and versus prior periods. Can you just maybe amplify on your comments as to why you think that occurred, and what is it, specific market for example? And what gives you the confidence that it will end up being where it was at the end of last year or the similar growth?
Richard E. Allison - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: John, this is Rich. We were a little slower out of the gate than normal in Q1 on store openings, but across the globe in each of our regions, cash-on-cash returns at the store level remained very, very strong. So as we look forward, we're still quite confident in our 6% to 8% unit growth guidance. In a 12-week period you can get some ups and downs, but the long-term health of the business is very solid.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks for that. And then, Patrick, you indicated that this voice ordering is going to be a powerful tool. Can you maybe, one, if there's a way to sort of dimensionalize how much time, either hours or percentage of labors spent on the phone at a store, so what could be removed? And remind us also if you can or maybe directionally, there's got to be enough left in check, right? Or could there be enough left in check just as there's more consistent upselling, for example, in that process.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yes. So John, look, we are still developing this. And we announced it because I think, as of this morning, we're in about 20 stores and it gets better every day. It's the way that you iterate on this, but to accelerate the pace of improvement in this, we needed more and more data points. More and more experience, finding out more different ways that customers would order, and so it continues to get better. And so what I would say is, the biggest, most important thing is how it will help grow our top line. And it's the same as it is with all of our other digital efforts. So there is some labor savings. Although interestingly, I mean if you figure today we are north of 60% on our digital orders and about 10% of our orders are walk-in orders. So, people just walking into the store and somebody takes the order there, and those can be handled with kiosks, so that's how those are going to be digital. But you're looking at today 25% or maybe slightly more that are still old-fashioned phone orders. And think maybe three minutes average on the phone for somebody to take a phone order. But that's ultimately not the big thing. The big thing is all of the calls are getting answered. They're going to get answered in the same way. They will all be upsold, kind of to your point around ticket. But from a labor perspective, what we think is maybe most important is the fact that people are able to focus then in the stores, fundamentally, on two things; on making pizzas and on getting them out the door and taking care of customers who are coming into our stores. So it is ultimately about driving sales through better customer satisfaction. And if you're able to get an activity like taking orders entirely out of a store, it's kind of the second order effects of that, that are more important, I think, than the direct minutes saved in taking those orders.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. That's helpful. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your line is open.
Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning, guys. And, Patrick, let me add that it also has been a pleasure to follow Domino's success under your leadership. I wish you well.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Patrick, just to follow up on your comments about the digital phone orders, what are the challenges that still need to be overcome to have this rolled out system-wide? And then I have a follow-up.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Look, it's going to continue to get better. And we're continuing to iterate on it. We've been working on this for quite a while. But there is only so much progress you can make kind of in a lab setting inside the organization. We've had it in a couple of stores for a while now. But artificial intelligence allows you to learn faster and faster, the more iterations, the more reps you can get on it. And so we are very confident that this technology is going to get there. But moving it into more stores, and that number is going to continue to increase, is going to increase the pace of learning and the pace of improvement. What's interesting though, if you think about it, if you think about Siri or Amazon Alexa or any of the natural voice platforms out there, they are covering very, very broad activity. We're talking about taking a pizza order. And it's a pretty small area for them to deal with. So if you call one of these stores and you start talking about politics or something completely off, they're going to be very confused. But if you call in and all you're trying to do is place an order for two large pepperoni pizzas and a two-liter Diet Coke, it's going to be really good and really efficient at doing that. So that's step one is continuing the iterations, and we wouldn't be rolling it into more stores if it wasn't already pretty good. But it's going to get better and better. And then the last thing is we're going to need to have the right phone systems in the stores to manage all of that, but we're pretty confident that the ROI on this will be very, very good and that the expense of that would be well warranted.
Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, Jeff, several companies have been talking about freight cost inflation. What level of inflation is the supply chain experiencing now? And will the new commissary help mitigate higher delivery costs for it?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, Chris, so just on food basket inflation, we're still anchoring to the 2% to 4% for 2018, but what the stores in the U.S. will experience lines up pretty much with what we're seeing in the rest of the industry. Not really a surprise there, and one that, to the great credit of our franchisees and our corporate stores, they've been able to really get the sales to help leverage and offset that increase. As far as delivery cost of the supply chain system that we have, we were pressured in Q1 on some labor and delivery costs. And just to be clear, we've been clear on this, we have opportunities to get better in that part of the business. We're investing heavily in that area, but this is not just for capacity, but hopefully to get some additional efficiencies. And at the end of the day, that benefit all accrues to the franchise operators and their P&L. If you remember, we share half of our profits in the U.S. and Canada with our franchisees, and so we're all aligned behind that business. We're going to add the capacity, as we mentioned, with the northeast center coming online in the fall. And again, as I look at the margin forecast there, I've told you before. I don't expect any wide shifts up or down on a percentage basis once we bring the new capacity online.
Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens, Inc. Your line is open.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, guys. And I'll echo my congrats to Patrick as well. I had a question on carryout. So you guys have obviously been focusing on that, and it's been growing, as you mentioned, at a faster rate than delivery the past few quarters. And the percentage of carryout, though, still remains below peers. So I'm assuming that has something to do with the real estate, among others. So can you talk about the potential to continue improving real estate sites and maybe anything else that I'm forgetting about that may continue to be an opportunity in carryout looking forward now that the remodels have largely played out?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. So the best way to improve our real estate locations is to have more of them closer to our customers. And it's something we've talked about a bit before, which is customers are not willing to drive more than a half a mile or a mile to get their own pizza. They might be willing to let us deliver from further away. In fact, they are willing to let us deliver from further away. So, when we add these new stores, as we have been doing, while there is a little bit of cannibalization on our delivery business, each of these new stores is 100% incremental on our carryout business, which is, again, a reflection of what I was saying about how far are customers willing to go for carryout. So as we add stores, that's going to help. We've gone through a lot of the relocations of existing stores in the U.S. There's still some to go, but that's, frankly, going to be much less of an effect for our customers than just simply building more stores, getting them closer to our customers. And if you look at big carryout-focused chains within the restaurant industry, so you look at Starbucks or you look at McDonald's or some of these other players, you're going to see a much greater density of stores than we have today. And as we focus more on this, we're realizing that there was something to that, that they've understood that people are only willing to go so far to get a cup of coffee or a hamburger. And the same thing is true if they're going to get a pizza from Domino's.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Makes sense. And if I could kind of flip that question around a little bit, you mentioned delivery actually grew faster this quarter than carryout. Was there anything that you did in particular in this quarter to help drive that shift or do you view that more as organic?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: It is all about our execution on delivery. And we do that extraordinarily well. You will probably find research out there already about the customers' experience with the third-party aggregators. And we remain confident that we are better at delivery than anybody out there, that we are doing it for better value for our customers. It's a hotter pizza when it's getting to them. It is a superior experience. And so there's a lot of talk about delivery and that may be helping to grow our delivery business as people understand that the best place to get food delivered is from the original delivery aggregator, Domino's Pizza.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Really two for you, first, on the company side of things, unit growth in the first quarter was really stronger than we've seen in a long time. And sort of being careful to extrapolate 12 weeks, was there anything sort of special to this quarter with five unit openings or is that a fair pace to think about for the balance of the year? And then, going back to sort of delivery versus carryout, inclement weather has been a pretty broad topic of discussion through earnings thus far. Do you think that that might have helped drive growth on the delivery side of the business and/or any comment on just sort of weather as an overall contribution to the comp in the quarter?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Karen. So, first, you know us. We never use weather as an excuse or as a driver because it just doesn't play into our business that much, that it ever gets to the point of being material, so really nothing in that. That doesn't mean that there aren't nights or a couple of days when we get really busy in one region, but our analytics all tell us, over the course of a quarter, with all the different geographies, it just kind of averages out into a couple of tenths here or there, but it's just not a big material effect on our business. For our corporate stores, you are going to see us opening corporate stores, but what you will also see is us occasionally buying and selling some corporate stores as well. But we believe strongly in our unit economics. Our stores generate a strong return. And everything that I just said about the system in general is equally true on our corporate stores, which is we need more of them covering territories that we are already in. And I'll give you an example. We opened a couple of stores in New York City and Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens are a 100% corporately owned. And we added a couple more in there. We already cover all of the territory, and we know that we can cover it better by having more restaurants there. So part of the ongoing thing, you're not going to see us grow our corporate store counts materially, but we do see an opportunity to build some more in geographies that are already in, and some of that may be offset from time-to-time with some sales on geographies that may be a little further out.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump from Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. And of course I'll pass on my congrats to you as well as Patrick. It's been quite a run.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Alt.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I think most of my questions about the U.S. have been asked, and obviously it was a great quarter. Congrats on that. But just as I was looking internationally, it was also a strong quarter there. Been some choppiness obviously over the course of 2017. I was kind of look over the last few quarters here, I just kind of look ahead into the rest of 2018, is there any reason to believe it could be a more consistent performance from a same-store sales standpoint internationally than what we saw last year?
Richard E. Allison - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Hey, Alt. This is Rich. You know one of the things that we're seeing, which is very encouraging for us in the international business in Q1 is that all of the same-store sales growth was driven by order count or transaction growth. You may recall some of the choppiness we had back in 2017 we spoke about the fact that we were a little concerned that maybe we had gotten off on value in a few of our markets and had some issues with the growth coming more from ticket as opposed to transaction count. I'm really pleased to say that in the first quarter the growth was all driven by transaction count. So, that renewed focus back on value gives me optimism about our ability to continue to perform solidly in that 3% to 6% same-store sales growth range.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: That's helpful. Thank you, Rich. I think that's all I've got.
Operator: Your next question come from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. I thought the comments on the move to a potentially 100% digital business were very interesting and I was wondering if you could flush out a little more how you think that happens over time. And then sort of where the cost savings are? Is that just on order intake in labor? Is it that you can change sort of the investment cost in the box? And then just operationally how that could work? Is that kiosks that would replace sort of someone in the store taking the order? Just flushing our sort of your longer term thinking on that and then maybe the timing of when you think that happens, I'd be very interested in.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. Greg, what I'd say from a timing perspective, it's still going to take a little bit of time, but the team is working fast. We've got some pretty clear metrics that I'm not going to share right now, but pretty clear metrics on what success looks like, but certainly at the top of the list is the customer experience and customer satisfaction. But then the rollout on that is first going to happen only after we know that it is performing better than we can perform today with the existing systems that we have in place. And in terms of how it comes into the store, it looks like any other digital order coming into our store. So, the order just comes up on the make line screen automatically and they won't know whether or not that came from voice, or from a tweet, or a laptop, or an app, or anything else. It just drops straight into the store. And what I would add to that is that is one more reason why we are so confident about our business model and our integration of the ordering and the restaurants and the delivery system. There is no handoff that has to happen where mistakes can be made. It just drops straight into our one point of sale system. So all of these foundational things that we've been doing, having one point of sale system, one online ordering system that is able to funnel all of these things in, this funnels into that exactly the same way, so the order just drops on to the make line and the people making great pizzas get to work on fulfilling that order.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And maybe just one follow-up on the Hotspots. How do you expect stores or your franchisees to sort of tailor delivery fees to Hotspots? Is it possible for you to go no fee on those or what's the plan in terms of the delivery fees on those orders versus maybe traditional delivery orders?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. Well, first franchisees set their pricing. They control that. But I think the answer is you're going to see delivery fees there be identical to their regular delivery fees. That's what I would guess is going to happen, but obviously they control their delivery fee.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you for the thoughts.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Baird. Your line is open.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. And congratulations, Patrick. My question's on the unit growth in the U.S. It seems to be accelerating each quarter. And I just wanted to maybe ask about sort of overall appetite among the current franchise base to continue accelerating investment in new units. And just at a high level, do you think you can sustain this mid-single digits or move it even higher as you think about the next few years? Thanks.
Richard E. Allison - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Hi, David. This is Rich. The reason that we're seeing stronger unit growth in the U.S. really is driven by one fundamental thing. And that is strong cash-on-cash returns at the store level. And stores don't get built because of numbers that are in contracts or because we push franchisees to do it. They get built because the returns are there over time. And what we've seen as we have really focused on growing franchisee profitability over time is that the returns are very strong. You combine that with some incentives that we offer to the franchisees, and the result is you get a cash-on-cash return that is better than three years without an incentive and approaching two years with an incentive. And our franchisees have voted with their wallets and decided that that's a terrific investment for them to make.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And, Rich, have you seen a change in mentality on this since the tax reform bill was passed? Are franchisees now gearing up to do more investment based on that dynamic? Or is it just more based on sort of what's been the recipe all along, which is good cash flow at the unit level?
Richard E. Allison - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: So really, the primary reason, David, is that strong cash flow. Our franchisees averaged about $135,000, $136,000 in EBITDA at the store level in the U.S. last year. But over and above that, most certainly a lower tax rate, and therefore, better after-tax returns certainly helped on the margin, to put a little bit more incentive in there for the franchisees to grow.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thank you. And it's always a challenge for the operators there with my last name and the firm name. So, good job. A question here, a lot of detail about the digital, Patrick, that you are talking about getting to potentially 100%, it's been a while since you gave us an update. I think you crossed 60%, you've always said better than 60%. Can you give us an update on where you sit? Are we north of 75% now as far as digital?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No. Stick with north of 60%, but the key is, it's going to be 100%. And what we are doing with all of the data remains an incredibly important part of what we are doing to drive the business. But it continues to grow, but now we've figured out a way that we can get this to be in a fully digital business. And I can't give you a timeframe on when that's going to happen, but I can tell you it's going to happen.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Well, I guess with the delivery pickup and also with the step up in the delivery growth, is that correlated with the, maybe an acceleration in digital? I know you don't want to give us milestones or anything, but historically when you've expanded your digital you've also seen the check grow. You've had better personalization driving demand, so I wondered, is this correlated with it, and expansion or a reacceleration of digital winning more share of your sales and that's also driving delivery?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Well, what I would tell you is, number one, overall it just continues to move up as it always has. But the other thing is, more and more of our carryout business is digital now. And it used to be that there was a very big skew on digital to being about delivery. We've put emphasis on putting more and more of our carryout business that direction. Our loyalty program now being earned anywhere definitely plays into that. So overall it continues to grow and it's helping our business as it has helped it in the past.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Excellent. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Great. Thank you, and congrats, Patrick, on an outstanding career. I just wanted to ask about delivery versus carryout. I know you said that delivery grew faster this quarter than your carryout, despite the fact that your marketing creative was really focused on the carryout business. So, is there any sort of governor for the growth on the delivery side or are you finding enough drivers to continue this growth on the delivery side?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Our guidance is 3% to 6%. That is where we think we're going to be. But no, I mean, look, we continue to see a lot of opportunity if – we are proud that we are now the largest player in pizza. But tonight, five out of six pizzas sold in the U.S. are going to be from somebody other than Domino's. Globally, if you add in our international, 9 out of 10 are going to be sold by somebody other than Domino's. So, our share is so low today and you've got a category that is growing a little bit in the U.S. and a bit more than that outside of the U.S. There is clearly lots of room for growth ahead.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Great. And then I think in the past you guys had discussed carryout being a separate occasion. Now that you've had a little bit more data and more time to look at it, you still feel like it's a fairly separate occasion with about maybe a 15% overlap?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yes, that's about right.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeremy Scott from Mizuho. Your line is open.
Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Hi, thanks. Was hoping to talk a bit more about the Hotspots. It seems to be a very intriguing solution to address a bunch of different issues, even outside of the areas that you're initially targeting. So I had a multipart question. First, just wondering if you have an early idea of potential sales lift as you study this launch? I would imagine that we're talking about predominantly incremental customer transactions or interactions and assuming you're going to put some marketing dollars to work. Second, if this were to become a huge success and you innovate your way towards better targeting the customer on the street, would this change your world view on store density, carryout mix? And then third, in the context of your comments that delivery is complicated and hard, where do you really see this going? I understand targeting beaches and parks, but what about campuses and other locked down locations?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. So I'll take the last part of that first. Yes. On all locations. The big thing is we need to keep it safe for our drivers, which is why the stores actually set these up and can control the time so that they're not being sent to a hotspot in an alley at 3:00 a.m. We want to make sure that we're able to deliver safely and the most important delivery that our drivers make is them coming back safely at the end of the night. And so that's why we've got some control around or complete control around where these deliveries are going to be made. Yes, I think there's clearly going to be some incrementality to that as with most things that we're investing in. We're not given a projection as to exactly how much incremental we think we're going to get out of it, but we're excited about it. And in terms of how that plays into the overall, it does open up a lot of exciting things and the fact that we can target specific spots and lat-longs and make deliveries fundamentally anywhere plays into kind of providing ultimate convenience for our customers. So we've been talking about our Anywhere suite of ordering and the fact that you should be able to interact with any technology. We also think you should fundamentally be able to get a Domino's pizza delivered to any location where you're going to want it and that includes campuses and all the different things we've talked about.
Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Great. Thanks. And then just operationally, maybe talk about the differences you might see in hotspot deliveries. Would there be more order batching? And then how do you work it out between different franchisees that may be targeting the same, or different locations that may be targeting the same hotspot?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. So they have defined delivery areas as part of their contract. So each address is attributable to one store, and that remains the same. So if the hotspot that they have designated is in their territory, they're the one's who set it up, and it is theirs to service. And so that's not going to change.
Jeremy Scott - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Anderson from Maxim Group. Your line is open.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group LLC: Good morning, everyone. And, Pat, congratulations to you. To the point, I want to ask a question about the takeout guarantee that has launched very recently. I just wanted to see if it's something that's been tested and if you've seen in any test markets any incremental increase in the takeout orders after the guarantee.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Well, you've seen some things in international I think around takeout guarantees. But there are ways to put more certainty around timing for people so that they can make sure that the pizza they're going to get is coming straight out of the end of the oven. You've got the carryout insurance that we've been talking about in the U.S., which is, look, if something goes wrong with the delivery on the way home, we want you to be satisfied with your overall experience. But yeah, there are ways that we're looking at it, how can we make that carryout experience even better, even more predictable, and making sure that the customer is getting the hottest possible pizza right out of the end of the oven when they come in to get it, so more to come on all of that.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group LLC: Right. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Stephen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore. Your line is open.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you. On the company-owned stores, the dynamic for the past few years has been you have pretty strong comp, but the margins have declined on labor inflation and some other items, but this quarter you had a pretty strong comp and you had flat margins. So the question is where are you at with labor deployment? And is there something you're doing differently or that we should think about the future of that business where you have reasonably strong comp where we don't see that same sort of a margin decline?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Hey, Matt, it's Jeff. Yeah, you're exactly right. They were flat as a percentage, obviously, up in dollars, as they continue to grow that business. Really can't say enough about those almost 400 stores that we have in the corporate portfolio, what they were able to achieve in the first quarter. As you know, there are places that we're at that have some pretty significant minimum-wage pressures, other regulatory pressures, that are a real headwind for the business. And for those guys to kind of as a whole portfolio, corporate stores fought their way to an even percentage margin, was just a great result, and we were thrilled with that. You've also got other things bouncing around in there. Obviously, as well, beyond labor, they had to overcome a little bit of food, things like that. So, we look at that business, it's a high ROI business. Make no mistake, we still like being 97% franchise, but using those corporate stores to provide good return, develop leadership talent, test some things out for the betterment of the system, all great reasons to have those. And again, getting back to your question, the fact that they were able to sell and work their way out of some pretty significant headwinds, we believe is a big win for us in that business.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Got it. On the G&A guidance for the year, you had $380 million to $385 million previously and you dropped that to $370 million to $375 million, but in the Q the ASC 606 impact looked like it was about $4.5 million. And if I run rate that, it should be around $20 million for the year, but the guidance only dropped by $10 million. So was there something else in there that the core G&A ticked up a little bit and that is a net of the revenue recognition change? Or am I just thinking about that wrong in terms of a run rate?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No. You're all over it. And it was, first and foremost, about kind of the re-class there, but there were some things in the businesses we accelerate around all of the technological initiatives that we talked about as well as performance-based comp. Obviously, we got off to a pretty strong start. Little bit of an offset there, and so the $370 million to $375 million is the number that we would tell you right now we're comfortable with for that G&A line item what's locked in there. But no, there were a couple of puts and takes there, but the most important one was the re-class.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffery Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Patrick, hope our paths cross again, whether inside or outside the restaurant industry.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Jeff.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Life wouldn't be the same if we didn't talk a little bit about delivery from the aggregators. And obviously, you guys seem to be holding up extremely well on that front. So if it's really not having much of an impact on you, yet every other call we're on and independents are talking about it as well. They're claiming that they're seeing success from a sales perspective, even though they might be feeling it from a profit or cost perspective on the other end. But where do you think the share is coming from? I mean should we just assume that the category is seeing an uptick or are these other restaurants deceiving themselves because they're just losing in-store sales? And it just seems like everyone's after delivering and everyone's succeeding in it, but I don't see how that's possible.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Jeff, honestly, I think it's a bit of prisoner's dilemma. If you aren't doing it, you may lose some sales, but you are not seeing a restaurant category that is growing faster than it was prior to this. And if almost everybody is now doing it, and it is not accelerating the overall growth of the restaurant category, then I would argue it is not, in total, incremental. For an individual brand, if they don't do it and everybody else is doing it, then that may cost them a little bit. But the question is, what does it cost their margin to be adding that in if it is not adding to the overall growth of the restaurant category. And I think that's where we are.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Interesting. Thank you very much. Congrats again.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups on the U.S. business, if I may, at the top line. First, you said that advertising was particularly effective in 1Q. And I was just wondering if you could characterize it maybe it was more value driven, similar to what you said about international, just with the more traffic-weighted comp this quarter versus last quarter. I'm just trying to understand if it was a pivot in that direction, and, if so, what drove that? And then the second question I had is I know consolidation remains a big story. And you mentioned five out of six pizzas are sold by somebody who's not Domino's. But it just seems to me that you have a really good quarter, typically one or both of your big competitors is struggling. So, I mean, I guess what is the conviction that it isn't from the large competitors just because if I look at a sort of an average for the industry, the big three, if you will, it's been more consistent with sort of the mid-single-digit range that I might expect.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, so a couple of things. So first on the advertising, you know, we test everything and our analytics team is terrific. And we know exactly how the advertising affects our business. And we know that our advertising was a little bit more effective in Q1 than it was in Q4. The other thing that played into it, and to your point kind of about competitive activity and all of that, one of the things that probably helped us a bit in the first quarter is we have a lot of equity around two medium, two tops for $5.99. We have built that equity over nine years, and we kind of own that price point in the minds of our customers. And it is altogether possible that some of our competitors matching that price point helped our comp a bit in the first quarter. So I think that played in a little bit as well into the first quarter. Not in a big way, but I think at the margin, it was probably a bit helpful for us.
Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And my question was exactly on that point. When the competition was running two medium, two top for $5.99 during those television advertised weeks, not only did you not see a negative impact, you actually may have seen a positive one?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. All right. That's great. And I guess what is that, I mean, I don't want to say that that makes you over-confident, but is there anything that you think about that the competition can do to you that you can't not only completely sendoff but even benefit from? I mean, certainly some number of years ago when competitors used to copy each other's promotions, it actually used to have an impact. And now evidently they're actually benefiting you. So, I mean, what are I guess the competitive risks, if any, that you think about?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Look, we've got good, big competitors that have smart people working there, and I certainly can't predict the things that they're going to do that are going to be effective that are going to grow their business. The only thing I know is that we count on the fact that they're going to do it, and they're going to figure things out, and their businesses are going to grow and get better. And that's what causes us to wake up in the morning and feel a need to run even faster, because we are not going to underestimate their ability to do good things within their businesses. And I think you're seeing a lot of activity at our largest competitors right now, and we'll see kind of how that plays through. What I would tell you about the specifics of the two medium, two-tops for $5.99 and how that differs from the past, we've been running that for nine years. There is equity for Domino's in that offer. If people see that offer, the first thing that's going to happen is they're going to be thinking about us. And so it is a different circumstance than if everybody back in the old days, everybody was doing different offers and cycling in and out of it. It's different when you've built real equity in one specific offer.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then the final question on the balance sheet, obviously given your interest rates and I'm sure demand for your debt securities, you could have put even more debt on the balance sheet and done an even larger capital return in the future. So what was the decision that went into the recap that you did, considering that you presumably could have put on more at still attractive prices?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. John, it's Jeff. We went out, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and just got great reception again from the lending community for our credit and our story. All I would like to point out that we've been doing this now for a generation. We (76:03) higher leverage in the QSR industry, and no one's performed better over now a 20-year period. So I think that accrues benefit for us and our shareholders certainly. This particular opportunity, I didn't originally think we'd be back in the marketplace this soon, having done a deal just last summer, but we've got a really good problem, which is we continue to throw off just a bunch of organic cash flow and we know to optimize the capital structure here that requires additional, longer-term, fixed-rate debt. And so market was still very good. We got up to – if you use the Q4 trailing 12-month EBITDA, it got us closer to 6 turns. The problem was Q1 was a bunch better than Q1 last year, so that's why we're at 5.8 already. And so again, we're trying to get more regimented around this with smaller deal sizes a little bit more often. And so lengthening the weighted average life of our capital structure, adding more long-term fixed rate debt at the rates we see, all green lights, all will accrue value to the shareholders. And to the extent that we can continue to create really high-quality organic capital out into the future, I think you'll see us committed to staying properly leveraged and lower that weighted average cost to capital.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Brett Levy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Thank you. And Patrick, all the best.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Brett.
Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: If we could talk a little bit more about the penetration and the fortressing, just how we should be thinking about it not just from a timing or an impact, but also what kind of percentage of growth is a reasonable expectation? And how does the margin profile differ? And does it also allow you to possibly go in with smaller footprints in some of these more deeply penetrated markets? Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. So Brett, at our January meeting we talked about the fact that we think we've got 8,000 stores in the U.S. that we can get to over the course of the next decade or so. So that gives you a sense of how much we think we can do, but as you build more stores, you grow your carryout business, you also increase the efficiency of your delivery, so you're giving better, hotter pizzas to your customers. And so we think there's a real opportunity around that, and it's part of why we're doing it. But at the end of the day, the biggest, most important way to think about it is it has to be improving the economics for our franchisees overall. And the reason we're building more stores is because it makes sense for our franchisees to be doing that, and those economics are ultimately what's going to drive the long-term growth on the business.
Operator: There are no further questions. At this time, I turn the call back over to the presenters.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: All right. Thank you. And listen, thanks, everybody, and the team looks forward to discussing our second quarter 2018 results on Thursday, July 19.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Amy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Tim McIntyre, you may begin your conference.
Tim McIntyre: Thank you, Amy and hello everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today about the results of our fourth quarter and full year 2017. As you know, this call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others be in a listen-only mode. In the unlikely event that any forward-looking statements are made, I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement you can find in this morning’s release and the 10-K. As always, we will start with prepared comments from Domino’s Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence and from our Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Doyle, followed by your questions. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jeff Lawrence.
Jeff Lawrence: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We are thrilled to report our results for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2017. During the quarter, we continued to build on the positive results we posted during the first three quarters of the year and delivered strong results for our shareholders. We continue to lead the broader restaurant industry, with 27 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 96 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continued to increase our store count at a healthy pace as we opened more than 400 net new stores in the fourth quarter. Our diluted earnings per share was $2.09 which is an increase of more than 41% over the prior year quarter. This increase primarily resulted from strong operational results and a lower effective tax rate. With that, let’s take a closer look at the financial results for Q4. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 11.7% in the quarter. When excluding the impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 9.9%. This global retail sales growth was driven by an increase in the average number of stores opened during the quarter and same-store sales growth. Same-store sales for our domestic division grew 4.2% lapping a prior year increase of 12.2%. Same-store sales for our international division grew 2.5% lapping a prior year increase of 4.3%. Breaking down the domestic comp, our U.S. franchise business was up 4.2%, while our company-owned stores were up 3.8%. These comp increases were driven by ticket and to a lesser extent continued order count growth. The ticket growth in the quarter resulted primarily from a higher number of average items per order in Q4 as compared to the prior year. On the international front, all four of our geographic regions were again positive in the quarter with Europe and the Americas leading the way. Canada, Russia, Turkey and India were among the markets that performed particularly well during the quarter. Our Q4 2017 comps were negatively impacted when compared to the prior year as our Q4 2017 fiscal calendar did not include New Year’s Day. We estimate that both our domestic and international comps were negatively impacted by approximately 0.5 point by this calendar shift in Q4 2017. We expect Q1 2018 to be positively impacted by this calendar shift. On the unit count front, we are very pleased to report that we opened 96 net domestic stores in the fourth quarter consisting of 102 store openings and 6 closures. For the full year, we opened 216 net domestic stores. We are also very pleased to announce that our international division added 326 net new stores during Q4, which included the opening of our 9,000 store internationally. The 326 net new stores were comprised of 339 store openings and just 13 closures. For the full year, we opened 829 net new stores in international. As a reminder, we converted more than 250 stores in 2016, which significantly impacts the year-over-year comparison. Our international growth continued to be strong and diversified across market driven by outstanding unit level economics. When adding the domestic and international store growth together, we opened 1,045 net new stores globally in 2017 demonstrating the franchisees’ continued excitement and commitment to our global brand. Turning to revenues, total revenues for the fourth quarter were up $72.1 million or 8.8% from the prior year. This increase primarily resulted from three factors. First, higher supply chain center food volumes, driven by strong U.S. comps and store growth. Second, higher international royalties from store count growth and increased same-store sales as well as the positive impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. And finally, higher domestic same-store sales and store count growth resulted in increased royalties from our franchise stores and higher revenues in our company-owned stores. Currency exchange rate positively impacted international royalty revenues by $2.1 million in Q4 versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar weakening against certain currencies. For the full fiscal year foreign currency negatively impacted royalty revenues by less than $1 million. Now moving on to operating margin, as a percentage of revenues consolidated operating margins for the quarter increased to 31.5% from 31.1% in the prior year, driven primarily by our global franchise business. The operating margin in our company-owned stores decreased to 24.6% from 24.8%, driven primarily by higher labor wage rates and insurance expense. Lower occupancy costs and lower sales based transaction fees benefited the operating margin and partially offset these decreases. The supply chain operating margin decreased slightly to 11.1%. The primary drivers of this decrease were higher labor, delivery and insurance expenses as compared to the prior year quarter. Procurement savings benefited operating margins and partially offset these increases. Before we leave operating margins, I would also like to note that franchisees in both the U.S. and Canada continued to share in our success with record profit sharing checks that we have earned in partnership with us, with great execution and performance. As I have mentioned many times before we expect to make additional investments in supply chain in the near-term to medium-term to keep up with our rapid growth. Let’s now shift to G&A. G&A increased by $1.6 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by our planned investments in technological initiatives including investments in e-commerce, our point of sale system and the teams that support them. Please note that these investments are partially offset by fees recorded as revenues that we received for digital transactions from our franchisees. Continued investments in other strategic areas also contributed to the increase in G&A. Lower performance based compensation and a $4 million pretax gain on the sale of 17 company-owned stores to franchisees partially offset these increases. Moving down the income statement, net interest expense increased by $5.3 million in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of increased net debt from our 2017 recapitalization, this was partially offset by a lower weighted average borrowing rate of 3.8% as compared to 4.6% in the prior year quarter. Our reported effective tax rate was 31.7% for the quarter. There was a $6.8 million decrease in our fourth quarter 2017 provision for income taxes as a result of excess tax benefit on equity based compensation. This resulted in a 5 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate. We expect that we will continue to see volatility in our effective tax rate related to equity based compensation. As a result of the Federal tax reform that was enacted before year end, we revalued all of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the effect on a reported tax provision in Q4 was not material. When you add it all up, our fourth quarter net income was up $20.6 million or 28.3% over the prior year quarter. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $2.09 versus $1.48 in the prior year quarter. Here is how that $0.61 increase breaks down. Our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.19 including a 15% positive impact related to excess tax benefits on equity based compensation. Lower diluted share counts primarily as a result of share repurchases during the year benefited us by $0.18. Higher net interest expense resulting from a higher net debt balance during the period negatively impacted us by $0.07. And most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.31, including $0.05 from the gain on the sale of company-owned stores and a $0.03 benefit from the impact of foreign currency exchange rate on royalty revenues. Now, turning to our use of cash, first and most importantly, we invested more than $90 million in capital expenditures for the full year as we continue to aggressively grow our technology capabilities and invest in supply chain to keep up with our rapid growth. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 277,000 shares for $51.5 million at an average purchase price of approximately $186 per share. We also received and retired nearly 660,000 shares in connection with the final settlement of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program which we discussed on the Q3 call. For the full year, we repurchased 5.6 million shares for $1.06 billion at an average price of approximately $191 per share. During the fourth quarter, we also returned $39.7 million to our shareholders in the form of quarterly dividend and made $8 million of required principal payments on our long-term debt. Subsequent to year end on February 14, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend approximately 20% to $0.55 per share and authorized a new program to repurchase up to $750 million of our common stock, which does replace our previous program. As always, we will continue to evaluate the most effective and efficient capital structure for our business as well as the best ways to deploy our excess cash to the benefit of our shareholders. As we look forward to 2018, I would like to remind you of our 2018 outlook that we shared with you at our Investor Day in January. We currently project that the store food basket we used on our U.S. system will be up approximately 2% to 4% as compared to 2017 levels. We estimate that the year-over-year impact of foreign currency on royalty revenues in 2018 could be flat to positive $4 million. If foreign currency rates today held for the full year that impact would be more favorable. In 2018, we expect our gross capital spending to be approximately $90 million to $100 million as we will continue to capital into technology innovation, supply chain capacity and capabilities, including our new supply chain center expected to open later this year and to a lesser extent company-owned store openings. We expect our G&A to increase due to our investment in e-commerce and technological initiatives. We expect total G&A expense to be in the range of $380 million to $385 million for 2018. Keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down by among other things our performance versus our plan as that affects variable performance-based compensation expense and other costs. Separately, I would also like to remind you that we will be adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard in the first quarter of 2018. We will be required to report the franchise contributions to our not-for-profit advertising fund and the related disbursements growth on our P&L. We are currently assessing the proper classification of expenses on our P&L as a result of this change. We do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our reported operating or net income. However, this new guidance will result in us reporting significantly higher revenues and expense currently estimated to be well north of $300 million. Overall, our tremendous momentum continued and we are very pleased with our results this quarter and for the full year. We will remain focused on relentlessly driving the brand forward and providing great value to our consumers, our franchisees and our shareholders. Thanks for joining the call today and now I will turn it over to Pat.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. Many of you attended or listened to our Investor Day last month and while the focus was on the state of the business, our strategy and outlook going forward there was obviously some additional news that I addressed at the beginning of the events. While we have the opportunity today, I wanted to briefly reiterate one of the key accomplishments I noted in deciding to move on to the next chapter following my time at Domino’s succession and my emphasis on leaving the business in the hands of incredibly strong capable leadership. This was an extremely important element of the decision process for me and I look forward to more of you going to spend time with Rich and gaining understanding of his skills, attributes and strategic approach as the next leader of Domino’s. With our transition now underway, I want to officially welcome Rich for the table for his first earnings call, since the announcement and note my confidence in passing the leadership baton to him this July. I will provide further remarks on this during my final earnings call in April, so let’s get to what’s most important our outstanding 2017. Makes no mistake, I am very pleased with our quarter and the contribution to our overall 2017 performance, which continues to set the standard within our industry. We continue to set the bar high and deliver on bottom line earnings performance, which we did nicely yet again in the fourth quarter. International full year same-store sales were within our 3-year to 5-year guidance, while our full year domestic results continued to impress well ahead of the top end of our guidance range featuring a plus 30% comp on a 3-year basis. Unit growth continued to progress domestically and combined with the reliable engine of international store growth, we are delivering on the healthy blend of retail sales growth contribution we have discussed steadily throughout 2017. This is important, both our corporate performance and more importantly that of our franchisees is dependent on a mentality centered around long-term enterprise growth that doesn’t just come with either comps or units within a silo. It takes both truly build and fortress and I am very pleased that the way this balance continues to come into shape. I discussed at last year’s Investor Day, my thoughts on the importance of store closures and how it is often a key and underrated metric on measuring the stability and potential for any business. It’s been an issue for many within our category. With that our 13 domestic closings for the year, let me repeat that that one just one more time 13 domestic closings for the year combined with only 62 around the rest of the world for a total of 75 global closures in 2017, with the lowest amount of closures we have had in over two decades and one of the more favorable signs highlighting the continued momentum around our model, performance and unit economic strength within this business. Our U.S. results in the face of the most difficult fourth quarter lap in our recent history we are solid. In addition, to our 27th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth, I am extremely pleased with the net 216 domestic stores for the full year and the impact it had on our impressive retail sales growth, which cannot be understated. I am proud of the team and our U.S. franchisees who continued to show commitment to aggressive unit growth, which wasn’t necessarily the case a few years back. All while staying focused on investing in re-imaging. We are now substantially completed and excited for our customers particularly those helping grow our carryout presence to get used to having one of the freshest new images and store designs in QSR be truly market wide. I am also very pleased for the first time in over a decade to say that in 2017, the U.S. was our fastest growing global market in terms of store growth. Year end results always remind me to note the extraordinary performance and solid relationship and rapport [ph] we continued to demonstrate with our outstanding franchisees, a group that is absolutely second to none. We came into 2017 wanting to maintain this impressive alignment and I credit both our company and franchisee leadership for beginning 2018 in that exact same position of strength. While this cannot always be measured, the importance of this can in no way be underappreciated. To our franchisees who have impressed me with our continued refusal to be complacent, I thank you for continued passion for our customers and our brand. I look forward to winning together in 2018. Moving on to international, we have now reached 24 consecutive – 24 years of consecutive quarterly same-store sales growth. This unprecedented and rather unbelievable streak is a continued estimate to a team focused on retail sales growth with a focus on fortressing territories and building to keep a leg up on competition for the long-term. I am pleased our full year results within 3-year to 5-year outlook. And while our cost for the quarter was below our range that has showed a bit more volatility than usual of recent, I am confident the business will continue to deliver strong top line results and more importantly continue to deliver tremendous unit growth, 825 – 829 net new stores for 2017 to be exact. The long game strategy of fortressing against the competition is highly visible, most notably and recently in India with the departure of a competitor. We didn’t comp them out of the market, but instead relied on unit economics that encouraged rapid growth and continue making it extremely difficult for others to get their foot in the door. This approach which is being executed globally is perhaps one of the more exciting strategies around the future of our business. Needless to say it’s working. The dialogue with all markets continues particularly within an Asia-Pacific region that was fairly soft during the fourth quarter. Our master franchisee partners are assessing structural and leadership changes and we will address a situation that we see is fixable and correctable within the relevant markets. The reminder of our regions and territories performed quite nicely including our large public master franchisees notably the UK as well as India under its new leadership. All-in-all, while there are areas to collect and continue to improve, I am pleased with the results this extremely strong model continued to produce and exciting as ever about our future and continuing to aggressively grow and fortress in all markets and territories driven by our strong master franchisee base that continues to get it done. We continue to set the bar on the importance of investing and innovating within technology. 2017 featured many highlights including growth of our AnyWare suite of ordering platforms with another strong year for digital loyalty, the emergence of voice and Alexa as a glowingly popular ordering option and more recently our first meaningful test of self-driving vehicle delivery. As we discussed at our Investor Day last month, we are the technology disruptors and as it is shown by the technology fee increase, our franchisees committed to beginning this year pledge we will invest to stay ahead in 2018 and beyond, making every effort to keep the advantage we have worked so hard to build. In closing, I pleased with the fourth quarter and feel tremendous about the momentum of our brand and business coming off of an outstanding 2017. We continue to rely on a long-term strategy and approach and emphasis on customer insights over our own, a disregard for complacency and playing offense over defense in extending the competitive leads we have built, all on the path of reaching our goal of global dominant number one. Thanks. And we will now open it up for questions.
Operator: At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Peter, your line is open.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks. So I just wanted to ask about the U.S. comp I know that the magic number was a 4.2, there was 50 basis points impact from New Year’s day, but I think even if you include that there was a pretty sizable deceleration on a 2-year stock basis, anything else you guys can call out in the U.S. market that may be showed some softening this quarter?
Patrick Doyle: Now I mean, we really feel good about it. I mean if you kind of adjust out the New Year’s Day which will come back in the first quarter kind of the same half point, rolling over a 12.2 from the previous year with accelerating store growth through the end of the year we feel very good about it.
Peter Saleh: Okay. And then on the on the international business I think you said the Asia-Pacific region was a little bit softer, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what you are seeing there and what steps you think you will be taking to resolve this issue?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. So you probably saw that Domino’s Pizza enterprises out of Australia already released last week. There was some weakness in Japan in particular, but overall, we feel very good about the business. They have had a leadership change in Japan now. We are getting a little focused on value there. It’s been a great business. I think it’s going to continue to be a great business there. And you may have seen in their release, they already called out the first I think 5 or 6 weeks of results heading into the New Year and those were already doing better. So, I think we feel good about the business over the medium and long-term and again you already saw some reacceleration of that business early in 2018.
Peter Saleh: Great. And then just last question from me on the G&A side, your G&A was lot lighter than what we were anticipating, I know you called out the gain on the sale, on the lower stock-based comp, was there anything else in the G&A, did any of the projects get pushed into 2018 that were supposed to be in 2017 anything else or are those the two items in G&A that would explain the difference versus your guidance?
JeffLawrence: Yes, Pete, it’s Jeff. First thing I would tell you is we are full speed at all of the strategic investments. We are not going to slow down on that. You continue to hear us say that. So everything that we wanted to give, we did and that will continue into 2018. The little bit of walking is really the two items you mentioned, one was the gain on the store sales to franchisees about 17 stores in Q4 and the other one was we didn’t do as well versus our plan this Q4 compared to Q4 back in 2016. So, your year-over-year comparison there also led to lower overall expense, but most importantly, the strategic investments are on track and we continue to invest in those areas.
Peter Saleh: Alright. Thank you very much.
JeffLawrence: Thanks, Pete.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is open.
Karen Holthouse: Hi, this is – I think the first time we have heard you talk about some procurement savings on the supply chain side. So, do you give any sort of color around that magnitude and then sort of how to think about the cadence of that as we moved through next year?
JeffLawrence: Yes. I mean, really the procurement savings are really what you would come to expect from a brand that’s really scaling pretty rapidly and had a little bit more market power than it had even 2 or 3 years ago. So, our team in supply chain fantastic job up there of just continuing to source very high quality, safe food ingredients, but at a lower overall cost and of course that flows through to the benefit of supply chain margin, which franchisees share with us 50-50 there. So everybody wins in that, but the important thing is we are not going to degrade the product in that process, we are going to make sure that we continue to improve the ingredient quality and also drive down food cost at the same time.
Patrick Doyle: Yes. The only thing Karen, I would add to what Jeff just said is you did see confirmation from our competitor on their retail sales last year. We are now bigger than which we have called out at Investor Day, but I will tell you our terrific procurement team may have made sure that all of our supply partners are aware of the fact that we are the largest and expect to be treated that way and so scale matters and the fact that we are now the largest globally and in the U.S. in the pizza industry matters and clearly we are going to press that with our partners.
Karen Holthouse: And then also on the distribution margins, I think one of the reasons prior to the upside – so prior to the upside has been some pretty broad spread concerns about just freight costs in general, logistics costs that we have heard through this earnings season. And I think a big challenge has been managing through pretty large spikes on spot freight markets. Could you walk us through or give any sort of color on how much of your distribution are you relying on third-parties versus doing it completely – and currently where you might not be exposed to that?
JeffLawrence: Yes. So this will probably not come as a surprise given our point of view on other parts of our business, but we own delivery of the food to the store just like we own delivery of food to our consumers, our customers. And so we have a very large fleet of lease tractors and trailers that enabled those 2 to 3 deliveries a week to all of our stores in both the U.S. and Canada. We have not seen any material spike of cost in our business as a result of anything going on in the spot freight market. We are usually able to get out in front of that in a pretty good time and so we don’t expect any pressures there and certainly there was no disruption for us in Q4.
Karen Holthouse: Great, thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Will Slabaugh with Stephens Inc. Will, your line is open.
Will Slabaugh: Yes, thanks guys. I had a question on domestic comps and we have seen over the past year to 2 years, this comp is being heavily driven by transactions and it sounds now like that shifted a little bit in the quarter toward ticket playing a larger role. So, can you talk about what’s driving that ticket growth in the average items for order as you mentioned earlier and how comfortable you are with ticket growth rising over time?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, it’s Jeff. So, again we did a 4.2% in the quarter, roll on a 12%, little bit more tickets and orders, but both were healthy and both contributed to the overall comp. We did have that 0.5 point shift again on New Year’s Day, which muted it a little bit. But really there were couple of different things that contributed to a little bit more ticket in the quarter and the biggest one is the one I called out which we just sold a little bit more fruit per order, which is kind of the best way to get ticket. What it wasn’t about in Q4 was us getting undisciplined around pricing or our franchisees getting undisciplined around pricing. We remain in lockstep around delivering great value to our consumers, the $5.99 mix and match we were on TV a bunch with that in Q4, which is what you have come to expect. And so as we roll into 2018, the role is to do what we always do which is to grow orders and just be real thoughtful about ticket and the construct of tickets. So, we can’t comment on 2018, but there is no bad news for us in the fact that ticket was a little bit bigger in Q4.
Will Slabaugh: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Gregory, your line is open.
Gregory Francfort: Hey, guys. Just the first one on I think if as I look at your franchise revenue growth in the domestic side this quarter, it was up about 5% even though you had a 4% increase in units and a 4% comp, can you maybe explain what sort of dragged down that, because I know you took the fees up on your franchisees on the digital side versus last year. So, I am curious what the offset is? And then just a second question, Patrick, can you talk a little about, I know we saw your Australian partner comment on third-party aggregators in the release, and maybe update us on in terms of how you think about external parties from an aggregator perspective versus a delivery perspective and sort of where you are coming from with that?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, Greg, it’s Jeff. I will take the first one and then I will take third-party over to Patrick for the second one. On the royalty revenues, really not a lot change in there the contractual rates generally are still the contractual rates. You might see a little bit of bounce around. The one thing I would point out is as you know we do offer some incentives for new store growth in the last, which as they get going helps to defray some of the opening costs there that might take down the effective rate a little bit, but again that’s been pretty consistent there. You mentioned the technology fee, which for ‘17 was the same as it was in ‘16 so really nothing there other than the additional mix of obviously increasing digital generally other than that, nothing really that we see bouncing around in revenues.
Patrick Doyle: Yes. And Greg, on the aggregator, we really talked about this at length at Investor Day in January and first of all the comments that came out of Australia, they are testing using some of the ordering portals, but not delivery and they are going to continue to control the customer experience and we think that’s very important. A reminder nobody does more restaurant orders digitally than us and nobody does more delivery than Domino’s. We understand the economics of that, the customer behavior related to both the ordering and delivery process better than anybody. And we have built real competitive advantage over the years by doing it ourselves. So accessing orders and customer base is something that’s been tested many in places, but the delivery process and the efficiency of the delivery process is something that we know and understand very, very well. And that’s not something that you are ever going to see it’s outsourced, because we believe as we have said in January, the only way to build long-term competitive advantage is to do something yourself. So if you use of third-party, you are basically decide this is something where we are not going to build competitive advantage. And if you do it yourself, the only reason to do it yourself is because you think you can do it better than you could do by accessing third-parties.
Gregory Francfort: Thank you for perspective. I appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI. Matt, your line is open.
Matthew McGinley: Good morning. I have a question on the international revenue growth, it grew at around 26%, which is materially better than what would have been implied by the comp than the units in the FX, so the question is what drove that increase, was it something with conversions now paying royalties or tech fees or AUV differences and some like that?
JeffLawrence: Yes. Matt, it’ Jeff, it’s a little bit of all that stuff as the older conversions start to roll up, they will obviously start to pay a little bit more. We also have an acceleration in what Rich has talked about around the global online ordering platform and the deployment of PULSE more globally. Those are obviously bringing revenues into that line item as well. And so it’s a little bit of all of that stuff, which is I have seen the increase there, in addition obviously the store growth and the comps.
Matthew McGinley: Got it. And on the asset sales, was the rationale for selling those stores in the fourth quarter, it was only $4 million for I think 17 stores that I would likely imply lower than average profit, I am curious what the rationale was in this quarter and then did that have any impact on the company on margins in the fourth quarter?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I will answer fist and then kick it over to Jeff. First of all $4 million is just the game, that’s not the sale price. But what we have said in the past is we are always going to look at kind of our corporate stores and where they are. These stores that were sold were stores that were a little bit further out geographically from some of our others. We are also building stores, increasing density in some places, where we are already operating. So this is kind of within the range of if you will ongoing portfolio management of our corporate stores and the specifics and I will kick it over to Jeff.
JeffLawrence: Yes. The only thing I would add to what Patrick – you covered it pretty well is the sales actually took place a little later in the quarter. So you won’t be as big of an impact on any of on the team USA margins or the franchise revenues. You will really see that flowing through in Q1. And as far as geographical just happened to be a couple of stores that will run East Coast in the Virginia, Carolina area. But again that’s less important than Patrick’s point which is normal portfolio management.
Matthew McGinley: Okay, got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John, your line is open.
John Glass: Thanks and good morning. First, you highlighted the carryout opportunity at the recent Analyst Day, how did carryout relative to delivery performed this quarter?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. They both did great.
John Glass: Okay. And then Patrick, you would – you answered the last question – few questions ago about never wanted to outsource delivery, but you didn’t answer the question about whether the order aggregation to be something you would be willing to outsource, meaning is there an opportunity to expand the marketplace by using an aggregate resource or even if you deliver them understanding that the economics have to be compelling and is that a real opportunity in your mind in the U.S.?
Patrick Doyle: Well, it’s something that’s – that we have looked at. I guess what I would say is, first you are going to start to by saying okay, what is order aggregation. So I could argue today that Google is an order aggregator, right because there are lot of people who are looking for food go in and they start the process by Googling the restaurant they wants to go to. And we use that. We buy keywords like our competitors do and a pretty reasonable portion of our sales wind up going through portals like that. So as those portals evolve, how we use them and the return on investment for those, we are always going to look at that. But if you look at the largest order aggregator in the U.S. today they are charging 15% of ticket on average to restaurants that you are big, you are going to pay less than that and that’s without delivery, that’s something that for us is clearly not economic. Our franchisees are paying $0.25 which is a little bit over 1% and that’s why we have got our loyalty program we are generating the data. It just is it’s a terrific experience for the customer if they are going through us, it all ties into our point of sale system. So it’s easier and more efficient in the stores. So the answer is never say never because pricing may change dramatically and kind of how people operate as portals may change. So it’s certainly something we are looking at, but is that a big near-term opportunity moving outside of the places where we are sourcing today, I don’t think the economics support it, but those economics may well change over time.
John Glass: Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is open.
Jason West: Yes. Thanks. Can you guys hear me?
Patrick Doyle: Yes.
Jason West: Okay. Just one, I am going back to the sort of the aggregator question which I know this comes up every quarter, but if you can talk about the mix of kind of urban sales versus suburban if you are seeing any sort of divergence there that you may have a referenced in the past?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I mean really no different than what we said before, it certainly those aggregators today are stronger in urban areas. If you dig down into their economics, their economics deal – they still struggle with how to take care of the customer, the driver of the restaurant. There likely been more articles coming out around the struggles that restaurants are seeing and in generating incremental volume out of that. But in terms of how that’s shifting there really is not been a real change in that.
Jason West: Okay. And then the other question just going back to the food inflation outlook, did you guys see that sort of accelerating through 2017 and is that something that you think kind of is going to be higher as you move through the year or is there anything on the pacing of that would be helpful?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I mean again it wasn’t a bunch of commodity inflation or food basket inflations for us on the whole in 2017, up a couple of points which was – which is basically in the range that we told you we would be in, a little bit more in the back half than the front half of 2017. But again that’s kind of split here is a little bit – the point was it was pretty favorable for the restaurants and going into ‘18 again a 2% to 4% over a real good ‘17 year. We don’t think commodities are going to be something that has an impact – a big impact on our store economics.
Jason West: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open.
John Ivankoe: Hi. Thank you. Patrick, in your prepared remarks, you used the word fixable and correctable in relevant markets, I think referring to international I mean I thought those were interesting words and I think perhaps to be put in the context of these issues of being avoidable in the first place, I guess will you kind of comment on that whether you think your franchisees can be more proactive in terms of avoiding some of these things that need to be fixed and as we kind of think about the corporation over the next 3 years or 5 years if you want start getting more involved as a corporation in the affairs of the operations, right, you may be even a little bit more in the tactics of some of your larger international franchisees if comps aren’t you they used to be?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. John I think it’s interesting. If you look back over the course of 2017, we had a little bit of a slowdown early in the year with the UK. And the UK is very much back on track. India had a period of time where it slowed down and it is now doing very, very well again. I think it’s just a function of you are always going to do your best with the research that you have and make as logical decisions as you can, but every once in a while you just don’t get it right. And when you saw the release from DPE about Japan, they talked about a promotion during the Christmas holiday time period that hasn’t worked out well for them. And I have been look, it was just a misfire. And what I would point out is a reminder that – when they released their results, their first half results for them that was a half, but the problem that they were talking about was all within the fourth quarter as it was leading into the holiday. And you already then saw them talking about how they were doing at the beginning of 2018. So, part of the fixable comment was frankly, normally, I wouldn’t talk about something within the quarter, but they had already released those numbers as part of DPE and it was already doing better. So clearly, it was flexible. So, I think the overall answer John is we are always giving opinions as asked and we are talking to them about what we think the right approach is going to be, but ultimately that’s the decision of the master franchisee and we have got phenomenal master franchisees who understands their local markets and the dynamics there better than wherever going to and most of the time because of now multiple decades of positive quarterly performance, they do a pretty good job. Every once in a while they are going to miss. And in 2017, it seemed to kind of rotate around the world who have a little bit of a miss, but everybody is good at this and we are confident that they can get it back on track.
John Ivankoe: And do you think that the global shared services model or the global shared data model is fully optimized I mean I think there is always opportunity, but do you think there is any big opportunities to maybe apply some of the global learnings at Domino’s even more to local markets when they have the little issues that appear?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, I think there are, I mean and it is part of why if you look at our point-of-sale system that is now in the majority of our international stores that means we have got better access to data not only for us, but for them, because we are making sure that the data is being cleaned properly and that it’s going to help them make good decisions. And we still have a relatively small number of or small percentage of our stores on our online ordering platform outside of the U.S. It’s currently what 1,700 – 1,300 stores outside of U.S. on that platform. So that helps. So when we can do that, it gives us a little bit more visibility into it, I guess that kind of leads towards a bit more of your shared services comment, but it is why we think that’s important and why you continue to see more and more markets that are getting on to our platform.
John Ivankoe: Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thank, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Alton, your line is open.
Alton Stump: Thank you. Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Just a quick question, I think most of what has been asked already. But just from a competitive standpoint either in the fourth quarter or how we are seeing today in the first quarter, it was of course news out there as it appears to pizza of being more aggressive, maybe some smaller closures responding to that. Did you see any impact from them in the fourth quarter and/or in the first quarter?
Patrick Doyle: No, I mean their retail sales were negative in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and over the course of the year and ultimately from a competitive standpoint, it’s going to be all about retail sales. So, no, we really didn’t see any difference.
Alton Stump: Okay, thank you. And then one quick follow-up just on the commodity front being up 2% to 4% where cheese is at right now, I mean, is there any downside potential to that range as you kind of look out over the rest of the year, Jeff?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, it’s again 2% to 4% all-in is what we are currently estimating for what the stores will experience. We can over or under-perform that based on what happens in the marketplace for different food items up and down the list. We are able to enter at times into certain price agreements to lockup some of the volume at certain prices. We can’t tell you what we have and haven’t done for 2018, but listen, I don’t know where cheese is going, I don’t think anyone tells where cheese is going. I think the important part for us is we have shown a real good discipline with the U.S. franchisees around sticking on message and executing at a high level regardless of what happens with food cost, regardless of what happens with labor rates, they are just doggedly determined to continue to build share the hard way and so kind of regardless of where commodities may or may not know, I think our guys have the right attitude out in the field and that’s what matters the most.
Alton Stump: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank. Brett, your line is open.
Brett Levy: Thank you. Good morning. If you think about some of the things we have been hearing out in the marketplace from the international players on fortressing in the splits, there seemed to be some concerns about what it might mean and I know you are very focused on growing the global sales. So when do you think in the U.S. we can start to see more of a material impact on the retail sales growth and how should we be thinking about it in terms of returns at the existing units, what it means on these new units and really what kind of impact this fortressing could have in terms of a drag on comps, how should we be thinking about it really from a timing standpoint? Thanks.
Jeff Lawrence: Well, let’s say is the return on investment for franchisees is as good as it has ever been which is ultimately what’s generating the energy around store growth that we have seen. When we look at the guidance that we have given to the market of 8% to 12% on retail sales, we think the best way to do that is with a balance between comps and store growth. You have seen very good balance from international for a number of years. And I will tell you that if you expressed that there are concerns around that from international not coming from our master franchisees, there maybe people in the market who are talking about it, but the returns for the franchisees are very, very strong, which is why they are continuing to generate strong store growth. In terms of the effect on the business, we were over 200 net on growth for U.S. this year, which means you are looking at something now approaching 4% growth in the store count and so there already is some effect in there on our domestic comps, but all of that is already taking into consideration when we have reiterated our guidance of 3% to 6% comps for both domestic and the international at our Investor Day in January.
Brett Levy: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris O’Cull with Stifel. Chris your line is open.
Chris O’Cull: Thank you. Good morning guys. Patrick, you mentioned sales trends have been more volatile in the past few months and I apologize if I missed this, but did you see what you thought was causing the volatility?
Patrick Doyle: I was referencing international. And so international over the course of 2017 was a little more volatile than it depends and it was really from some specific markets.
Chris O’Cull: Okay, I apologize. I thought you mean domestic. And then Jeff, any color on what the company did differently in the quarter to increase the ticket?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. I mean, the primary one was we sold more food per order, a little of that was probably due or was due to the Bread Twists brand. We were on TV early in the quarter on that. There is always some coupon mix that goes on and in quarter four that happened to help us a little bit on ticket, but it’s mostly those two things.
Chris O’Cull: Okay. And then just lastly did the company pay annual cash bonuses at a target level or above in ‘17 or how do they compare year-over-year with ‘16?
Jeff Lawrence: So it was – it was above our 100% target level, but below the percentage that we earned in 2016.
Chris O’Cull: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Anderson with Maxim Group. Steven, your line is open.
Stephen Anderson: Quick question on our comps, so I just want to ask with regard to cannibalization, can you can quantify how much you might have seen an impact on both international and domestic comps, keeping in mind though that this part of your longer term strategy to build stores within existing markets? Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Stephen, great question, we are not going to disclose how much of the comp get eaten by splits. And again we would just point you to the 3 to 6 range for global comps and the 8 to 12 on retail sales. Is there an impact, yes there is, but again we think that really distracts from the more important question, which is how you would profitably grow retail sales in total. And obviously, again being led by international with and above range again when you strip out FX above that 12% range for that business, it’s more above the all in retail sales than it is about how much impact you split back here or there.
Stephen Anderson: Alright. Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: You’re welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions, one Patrick, I know just on the U.S. comp, it’s been discussed I know you said, you feel good about the trends and you are leading the industry, I know it was talked about that the comp trend did slow on a 1-year and 2-year basis, I am just is wondering, if you don’t think it’s anything perhaps internal and I think you mentioned carryout and delivery are both in great and digital since you are doing well, wondering if there is anything you are seeing in terms of what would attribute to that or perhaps maybe the industry slowdown a little bit I don’t know how with what regularity you get that industry data, but I know in the past you talked about the industry growing maybe 1% to 2%, maybe you are seeing some sort of a modest industry slowdown that would attribute to the more recent easing of the U.S. comp? And then I had one follow-up.
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Jeff, so first of all, I guess as we iterate, we are rolling over a 12.2 from the previous year. We had a half a point shift out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter of this year. We feel very, very good about the overall. And in terms of the industry we are not seeing anything that is showing really acceleration or deceleration materially over the ongoing trend.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it and Jeff can you just remind us, because you have revenue streams from the franchisees and the company and then the supply chain, an incremental point of comp on an annual basis ballpark what’s the annual EPS both for I guess U.S. and international or combined?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. We know that math. We don’t give that math out. But a point of comp particularly if it’s from orders is very good for us.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Good to know. And just lastly…
Jeff Lawrence: We can’t do all in work, Jeff.
Jeffrey Bernstein: No, but I will put that in our model. So it does…
Jeff Lawrence: We have the same reaction here.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Yes. And then just lastly, the cash return I mean, I know you talk about the balancing share repo and dividend and more recently it’s been more about the repo, the dividend right now, I know would be – the healthy increase you just made, it’s still roughly 1% yield, which is kind of the low end of peers, I am just wondering what would – why wouldn’t you maybe be more in line with peers in that 2% plus type range and obviously you have the strong free cash flow and still have the flexibility to kind of do as you will in terms of the repo, is there something that kind of keeps you more cautious in terms of upping the dividend even further?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. It’s Jeff, again. We returned $84 million to shareholders in the form of our ordinary dividend, Board just increased like 20%, which was on 20% plus, which was on 20% plus from the years before. And so while dividend yields is one metric, we obviously track and we care somewhat about we are also very interested in what the dividend payout ratio is and some other things. And what I would tell you is at the end of the day it is a healthy dividend. We don’t get to control the stock price directly, so still has the chance to bounce around, but $0.55 a quarter dividend in 2018, we believe is a healthy return to shareholders in that form.
Patrick Doyle: And one thing I would add is we have always talked about the fact that we are agnostic on how we use our cash, but if you look backward our return on investment for our shareholders on our decisions to buy shares have been extraordinarily strong. And so there is a balance in how we are approaching it. We are continuing to move the dividend up with the latest announced increase. But we have generated pretty darn good returns with the buybacks.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Absolutely. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara, your line is open.
Sara Senatore: Hi. Thank you. One question and then one follow-up on technology spend, in the past I know you said you are going to invest first the company and we will continue to see you invest and grow G&A, but I think sometimes we are seeing companies prioritizing that thing and then top line has sort of decelerated and they need to find ways to maybe balance that, so I guess to the extent that maybe your comps are to fall globally more in line with that 3% to 6% range rather than above is there any way for us to think about that investment side the growth OpEx if you will and how that might vary with top line? And then I guess that I do have a follow-up please.
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I will go back to repeating what we have said at Investor Day. And I think earlier today which is the investments that we are making both on the G&A front and capital investments are what is going to continue to drive our projection of 8% to 12% global retail sales growth. And we feel good about how we performed against that previously. And we are going to continue to invest do it. But we don’t start from a projection of sales and then work backwards to how much we can afford to spend. We look at the investment opportunities that are in front of them in front of us, what we think the odds are of those investments generated return for our shareholders and as long as that expected return is strong we are going to continue to invest.
Sara Senatore: Okay. Thank you. That makes sense. And then the follow-up is you talked about with respect to technology and delivery meaning to do it in-house if it’s going to be competitive advantage, one thing I was curious was, do you think is possible for a company to acquire kind of technology and delivery expertise sort of in one fell swoop or is that something that has to be grown organically in an organization over time, I guess is there any way to kind of leapfrog through a big acquisition of talent and technology?
Patrick Doyle: Look, broadly I mean people have acquired competitive advantage or build it themselves that’s always a choice you have. But I think ultimately if you are using a third-party that is available to anybody in the market by definition that’s the commodity, if anybody can access it. So could you see somebody acquire that and build competitive advantage through that acquisition, I suppose if they restricted everybody else’s access through that technology after they made that acquisition. But if it continues to be available to everybody then almost by definition it is a commodity and something available to everyone. So only if you acquired it and then got everybody else off of that technology would there be an opportunity to really start to turn that into competitive advantage.
Sara Senatore: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Matt, your line is open.
Matt DiFrisco: Thank you. Good morning and I appreciate the opportunity and it goes over an hour, so I will keep it pretty concise. A lot of questions about delivery and all the new entrants and third-party aggregators and everything, I am just curious behind of 3 to 6 domestic 3-year to 5-year of same-store sales guidance, what is embedded in there or what’s your outlook for the delivery growth category for overall food if you can just remind us? Thank you. And then I have a follow-up.
Patrick Doyle: I don’t know that we have got a specific assumption around how that’s going to grow. What you have seen so far is that people have talked about this being incremental to their business. There has been no incremental growth of the restaurant category. So I frankly would take issue with the idea that this is incremental within the overall industry. What I think you have seen is some people’s takeaway business or on-premise business to-date shifted to delivery. So as long as all that’s happening is it’s shifting from for one restaurant chain from a carry-out transaction to a delivery transaction for our purposes in projecting our business, I don’t know that it really makes any difference. Overall, I guess I would give the same answer you have heard from me many times, which is we just have not seen a really significant effect from this. And if we can identify it, it is still relatively small that it’s had an impact on our business.
Matt DiFrisco: Well, I guess what I am trying to get to is if the category is driving, if demand is increasing for delivery then should we see your traffic as well being seeing it go a little bit more positive, but it seems like it perhaps has been a little bit of a deceleration?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I – if you talk about demand growing for delivery what you have seen so far is more supply of delivery. So you have seen some restaurant chains that didn’t previously offer delivery, now offering it and it has shifted some relatively to-date, relatively small percentage of their customers from being a carry-out customer to being the delivery customer. But if that’s how their sourcing volume then it doesn’t really affect our business.
Matt DiFrisco: Okay. Thank you for that color. And then just a last question for keeping, you mentioned a little bit about the facility coming on domestically, is there any inefficiencies that we should see or sort of factor into our first half of ‘18 and the margin assumptions until that facility is fully efficient or is it going, is capacity going to be met pretty quickly and it will be up and running and not a drag on margins?
JeffLawrence: So we are not giving guidance specifically around supply chain margin short-term or long-term. But what I can tell you is when we open up the facilities outside of New York there will be a lot of costs, but also some transportation saving that we are able to capture there. On a net basis, over the medium-term, I don’t expect the supply chain margins dramatically be volatile whether it would be in Q4 or the first half of next year, but again we are not giving specific guidance around it, but again I think you it’s a big, big business, it’s a $2 billion revenue business, bringing on a very large center in the Northeast is a big deal, but it’s not something that I think is going to cause seismic shifts in margins.
Matt DiFrisco: What was the date for opening?
JeffLawrence: We are going to open it up in Q3 is the target.
Matt DiFrisco: Thank you.
Operator: And gentlemen, your final question comes from the line of Jon Tower with Wells Fargo. Jon, your line is open.
Jon Tower: Hi, good morning, just quick ones for me, first do you have some paper or notes that are callable in April, I think it’s 493 million kind of 3.48% rate, I am curious to know if you would go to market today how that rate would look, one. And then two, I know you don’t have a formal targeted leverage ratio, but given U.S. tax reform I would be curious to hear your thoughts on leverage ratios today versus what you are thinking about in the past?
JeffLawrence: Yes. I will take the last one first, which is tax reform, obviously we are a big winner on that and that helps us in everything. First and foremost, it just gives us that much more confidence to go faster on investing and all the things that are going to grow the retail sales. But it also is likely that some of that will fall up in the bottom and we will adjudicate that, as we do all free cash flow decisions whether it would being a buyback or a dividend etcetera. On the leverage itself, we have generally said 3 to 6 turns of EBITDA, the result of tax reform means that we can do a little bit more than that comfortably. Although at the same time, we are not ready to say that we are going to move the top range target up, because the cost of equity is the funny thing. Our shareholders need to be comfortable and we know it took us about a decade to train you all that 6 turns of leverage was good for our business model. And so we are not ready yet to say that we are going to go any higher than that. As far as specific piece of debt we have from the 2015 deal, which is part callable in a couple months, again nothing to announce on that, we are always looking at what the market is doing and what the rates are. We have seen a flattening as you know the yield curve for longer term stop looks a little bit more attractive than maybe the shorter term stop, but again that’s sounds around quite significantly and really nothing to announce on that.
Jon Tower: Great. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Patrick for closing remarks. ]
Patrick Doyle: Thank you, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call today. And we look forward to discussing first quarter 2018 results on Thursday, April 26.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Adam and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I’d like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Tim McIntyre, you may begin your conference.
Timothy McIntyre: Thank you, Adam. And hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today about our very busy third quarter 2017. As you know, this call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others be in a listen-only mode. In the unlikely event that any forward-looking statements are made, I refer you to the Safe Harbor statement you can find in this morning's release. As always, we will start with prepared comments from Domino's' Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence, and from Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Doyle, followed by analysts' questions. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jeff Lawrence.
Jeffrey Lawrence: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued, as we once again delivered solid results for our shareholders. We continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 26 consecutive quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 95 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continue to increase our store counts at a healthy pace, which we believe is more evidence that our brand is strong and growing. Our as-adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes the impact of our recapitalization completed during the quarter, was $1.27, which is an increase of 32.3% over the prior year quarter. This increase primarily resulted from strong operational results, as well as a lower effective tax rate. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q3. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 14.5% in the quarter. When excluding the impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 14.2%. The drivers of this retail sales growth included strong domestic same store sales, which grew by 8.4% in the quarter. Our U.S. franchise business and our company-owned stores were both up 8.4%. These comp increases were driven primarily by order count or traffic [growth] [ph], as consumers continue to respond positively to the overall brand experience we offer them. Our Piece of the Pie loyalty program continues to contribute significantly to our traffic gains. To a lesser extent, ticket also increased during the quarter. The hurricanes in Texas and Florida negatively impacted our Q3 company-owned store comp by approximately 1 percentage point, and negatively impacted our Q3 U.S. franchise comp by less than half a point. As a reminder, we operate company-owned stores in both the Houston and Miami markets. We also have franchise operations throughout the impacted areas. As of today, operations have resumed in significantly all of our stores, both corporate and franchise. More importantly, none of our team members or the team members of our independent franchisees were injured in the storms. On the unit count front, we are pleased to report that we opened 53 net domestic stores in the third quarter, consisting of 55 store openings and two closures. Our international division had a solid quarter as same-store sales grew 5.1%, lapping a prior year increase of 6.6%. Our international division also added 164 net new stores during Q3, comprised of 176 store openings and 12 closures. As a reminder, we converted approximately 100 stores in Q3 2016, which significantly impacts the year over year comparison. On a total company basis, we opened 217 net new stores in the third quarter and 1,182 net new stores over the trailing 12 months. By far, the best in the pizza category. Turning to revenues, total revenues were up 13.6% from the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily a result of increased global comps and store comp growth, which also drove higher supply chain volumes. Currency exchange rates did not materially impact international royalty revenues versus the prior year quarter. For the full fiscal year, we now estimate that the impact of foreign currency on royalty revenues could be flat to negative $3 million year over year versus our prior 2017 guidance of negative $8 million to negative $12 million. As you know, there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rates, which does make this a harder part of our business to predict. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 30.8% from 30.7% in the prior year quarter, driven by our global franchise business. The operating margin in our company-owned stores decreased to 23.1% from 23.5% driven primarily by increased labor rates. Lower transaction-related expenses as a percent of sales benefited the operating margin and partially offset this decrease, as did continued strong sales growth. Supply chain operating margin decreased to 10.9% from 11.1%, driven primarily by increased labor and delivery costs. Lower food costs as a percent of sales benefited the operating margin and partially offset this decrease. Market basket pricing to stores increased approximately 2% this quarter. We currently estimate that the domestic stores market basket cost will be up approximately 2% for the full year 2017 from 2016 levels. Before we leave operating margin, I’d also like to note that franchisees in the U.S. continue to share in our success with record profit sharing checks that they have earned alongside of us with great execution and performance. As I’ve mentioned before, we expect to make additional investments in supply chain in the near to medium term to keep up with our rapid growth. Let's now shift to G&A. General and administrative expense increased by $8.4 million in the third quarter versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by our planned investments in technological initiatives, including investments in e-commerce, our point of sale system and the teams that support them. Please note that these investments are partially offset by fees that we received from our franchisees, which are recorded as franchise revenues. Additionally, G&A increased due to higher advertising expenses at our company-owned stores, which increased as a result of our positive sales growth and continued investments in other strategic areas. These increases in G&A were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation. Based on our strong performance and outlook for the rest of the year, we now estimate that our G&A will be in the range of $350 million to $355 million for the full fiscal year 2017. Keep in mind, too, that our G&A expense for the year can vary up or down by, among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that affects variable performance-based compensation expense. As I just mentioned, we charge a transaction fee to stores to recoup a portion of our IT investments, which support our digital ordering platform and related innovation. This arrangement with our U.S. franchisees has been an important and meaningful one. Fundamentally, it has allowed us to create a best in class technology experience for our consumers and produce best in industry economics for our independent franchise businesses. Our franchisees understand and support us by continuing to partner with us in these investments, and the returns have been outstanding for all parties involved. Quite simply, we have built the best technological platforms in our industry together. With that in mind, we will be increasing this [pro] [ph] order technology fee from $0.21 to $0.25 effective on January 1, 2018. We will continue to invest aggressively in the technological arena and hope to deliver great consumer experiences, great franchise economics and strong returns for our shareholders. Moving down the income statement, interest expense increased $8 million in the third quarter, driven by $5.8 million related to our recapitalization, which has been adjusted out as an item affecting comparability. We also had a higher net debt balance during the period. Our weighted average borrowing rate in the third quarter decreased to 4.1%. Our reported effective tax rate was 33.3% for the quarter. There was a $3.5 million decrease in our third quarter 2017 provision for income taxes as a result of excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation. This resulted in a 4.2 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate. We expect that we will continue to see volatility in our effective tax rate. When you add it all up, our third quarter net income was up $9.1 million, or 19.3% over the prior year quarter. Our third quarter diluted EPS as reported was $1.18, versus $0.96 last year, which was a 22.9% increase. Our third quarter diluted EPS as adjusted for the 2017 recapitalization transaction was $1.27 versus $0.96 last year, which was a 32.3% increase. Here is how the increase in diluted EPS as adjusted breaks down. Our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.08, including a $0.07 positive impact related to excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation. Lower diluted share counts primarily as a result of share repurchases, benefited us by $0.04. Higher net interest expense resulting from a higher net debt balance during the period negatively impacted us by $0.02. And most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.21. Now, turning to our use of cash. During the third quarter, we received and retired approximately 4.6 million shares in connection with our previously announced $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program. The ASR program was completed yesterday and final settlement will be on Friday. That final settlement, we will receive and retire an additional 659,807 shares. In total, we will receive 5.2 million shares which will result in an average price paid of approximately $192 per share. We now have $250 million remaining on our $1.25 billion Board-authorized share repurchase program. We also used cash to repay $910 million of our 2012 notes in connection with our recapitalization, and we returned $22.4 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.46 per share quarterly dividend. All in all, our strong momentum continued and we are very pleased with our results this quarter. And with that, I will turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, everyone. While our fundamentals have taken over a decade to truly develop and solidify, our strategy and approach related to the business remains quite simple. And my third quarter commentary will follow suit. The quarter can be best described as us continuing to execute our established approach, and simply do what we do best, remaining steady in our long-term strategy and proven foundation, aligning with the domestic and international franchise base that continues to prove it is second to none, and refusing to compromise when investing in our innovative forward-thinking brand, which we believe has led to us selling more pizza in the U.S. and around the world during the third quarter than any other pizza brand. No catalyst or unique shift in approach is part of our continued strong global performance. Instead, we continue to heavily lean on the foundation built over time, fundamentals that our company and franchisee leadership have all come to fully trust. The ability to rely on this has certainly taken time. A great deal of homework goes into our occasionally difficult but always calculated decisions. But this long-term leg work and the many moves and risks that followed have positioned us for the fundamental strength that remains at the forefront of another outstanding quarter. Our strategy remains simple. Single-minded focus on continually improving every aspect of the experience for our customers and funding those investments by skipping the flavor of the month activity so common in our industry. Our U.S. results in the face of our second highest quarterly comp lap in the past seven years were tremendous. In addition to very strong sales, store growth continued to progress in the right direction as our focus on unit level economics and franchisee profitability continues to support this strong alignment and provide the key factor to maintain domestic store growth momentum. We were also excited to announce the expansion of our Piece of the Pie rewards program to customers who order through any method, now including phone and in-store in addition to digital. The loyalty program has continued to provide a meaningful impact on sales, and we will continue as with this most recent expansion to assess and evolve the program to keep it top of mind. To help this later in the quarter, we will launch a new national TV campaign around Piece of the Pie, as we continue to grow awareness around the simple and focused program. As we’ve noted, it continues to benefit topline business performance, and most importantly, our loyal and frequent customers. For all of these reasons, I'm particularly proud of our 26th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales, and the continued execution and energy of our domestic franchisees, managers, and operators. Their unwillingness to show complacency or rest on past success, motivates me and my leadership team each and every day. It is a unique and special collection of business owners that we are privileged to call teammates. There's no better example of this, than the response of many of our affected franchisees from the recent hurricanes and natural disasters. And I wanted to take a moment to say a big thank you to so many within our system for taking action and supporting your neighborhoods. Domino's continued its historical tradition of so often being the first to reopen to provide food and support for those who need it most, a practice we as a company and a collection of local entrepreneurs ingrained within their communities have taken much pride in for over half a century. In Texas, store general managers had to evacuate their own homes, yet still worked hard to make and donate pizzas for first responders, as soon as they could. Along with other stores throughout the South, our Texas locations also raised over $120,000 for the Salvation Army and Red Cross in a single day. Within our International group, I want to acknowledge franchisee John Caputo who managed to open his store in St. Maarten and feed people when literally no one else could. John bartered for generator fuel and salvaged food from the neighboring grocery store to cook and feed people who hadn’t had food or fresh water in days. I thank John, whom along with many others who made similar efforts, showed during an incredibly difficult time for his business and community what Domino's is all about during times of need. The unfortunate events have continued with the recent earthquakes in Mexico and the hurricane in Puerto Rico and the fires in California. We continue to hear the amazing tales of heroics and support involving people reaching out to one another in the neighborhoods we serve. Our master franchisee in Mexico, Alsea, activated a fundraising campaign to help those affected and committed to turning locations into collection centers, and going forward helped rebuild affected area as soon as they are able. And following the tragedy in Las Vegas last week, we fed first responders, local fire and police and those waiting in line to donate blood. Our operators don't do this for publicity or notoriety but because it's just what we do. I personally just want to thank so many in our system for everything you’ve done during these difficult times. It is truly inspiring to me and our entire team in Ann Arbor. To wrap up, there's really not much more I could say about our U.S. results other than I am extremely pleased and proud at the hustle and focus of so many that are making it all happen. Moving on to international, I would like for you to think about how old you were 95 quarters ago. Even though you are all very good at math, I’ll help you out a bit. It was nearly 24 years ago. That is now how long it's been since our last quarter of same-store sales that weren't positive, which is pretty amazing. Our third quarter results were back well within the long-term guidance we’ve provided, and certainly back in line with what we’ve all come to expect from this terrific model. Improved results in the U.K., terrific results in Canada, Turkey and the Netherlands are highlights and store growth continued to be very strong, keeping in mind the impact of last year's conversions that Jeff touched on. And some strategic calculated decisions related to store growth by our franchisee in India. The dialogue with all markets continues and my confidence in the best international model in QSR has only strengthened from this interaction. As this segment continues to perform at very high levels with the third quarter, no exception. And on that thought, it was another forward-thinking, innovative quarter on the global technology front. We now have over 70% of international stores on PULSE as our point of sales system continues to get closer to being a truly worldwide platform, which will benefit our entire global system greatly. We have surpassed 1,000 stores in our global online ordering program, and we continue to work with markets both big and small on the opportunities adopting our platform could present in the future. In the U.S., there were two major announcements. They’re very exciting. First, the ability on Amazon Alexa, which is becoming our most popular anywhere ordering platform, to now order from scratch without the need of a preset profile or saved easy order. This is a tremendous development, demonstrating next phase flexibility within these platforms, and giving customers more customization and choice during the ordering process on these pioneering, not to mention very cool, ordering platforms, all still unmatched within our category. And second, partnering with Ford on the first ever meaningful test of self-driving vehicle delivery. The attention and the interest from media, customers, industry experts and investors on this was tremendous. We’re very excited to be the first to explore, and likely first to report our findings as this very exciting partnership and very intriguing study takes shape in the near future. We will continue to invest to grow our digital lead. We are just as committed to keeping our lead as we were to achieving it, and this philosophy will very much continue to drive our approach to all things technology. In closing, I couldn't be more pleased with the third quarter. We continued to do what we do, and our performance was truly a result of staying committed to our sound strategy and relying on the best people in the industry to carry the business forward and help turn in yet another outstanding quarter of results across the board. Thanks, and we'll now open it up for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Gregory Francfort: I had two questions. The first one was just I think the last time you had a fee increase, you helped size up the magnitude of that impact. And I know that's on a gross basis and not net of the investments, but any help on sort of what the magnitude on that change, the $0.04 change is to your revenue?
Patrick Doyle: We’re not actually going to be giving guidance on the actual dollar amount, but you’ll start to see a flow through in the first quarter of 2018.
Gregory Francfort : And then maybe just on the franchise revenue over franchise sales, I think the domestic business basically had a slowdown in terms of that line, and I know there's some lumpiness, but the international business had a pick up. I mean, what drove the lumpiness? And I guess is some of it on the international side, just big franchisee sign-up on the PULSE business? Or is it maybe more of an ongoing step up?
Jeff Lawrence: I mean, the dynamics you have on the U.S. side for franchise kind of effective percentages are more around store opening incentives that we provide in certain circumstances. That sometimes can bring that down from the general 5.5% contractual rate that is paid. On the international side, you do have fees coming in on the technology, on our global platform which is in now more than 30 markets around the world. That can help it. The thing that kind of hurts that a little bit in the last year or so has been all the conversions that we’ve done. So a little bit of puts and takes there, but that’s going to bounce around a little bit as that map plays out.
Gregory Francfort : Is the conversion drag done? Are we done with that?
Jeff Lawrence: No, the conversion, incentives that we give so that they have the capital to reinvest in the brand and put up the leaseholds and the signs and such can generally last a couple years or so, and it starts to ramp back up to the normal rate. So that’ll have a little bit more time to get back to where we need it to be.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian, your line’s open.
Brian Bittner: Patrick, the strong same-store sales results obviously speak for themselves. But I just want to ask your perspective on the competitive front as you look forward. As you manage this business, what really has your attention the most? Is it people with -- the several players within the pizza space trying to improve on the leverage that they already have? Or is it the countless players outside the pizza space trying to get into delivery?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, Brian, the real answer is that we’re watching all of those things, and we’ll continue to watch all of those things. We don't generally react to them, and as you’ve heard me say in the past, kind of specific pricing initiatives or promotions from competition just don't have that much relative effect on our results. And a lot of that just has to do with the level of fragmentation in the pizza category which remains far more fragmented than other restaurant categories. And so a specific customer or somebody new coming in is going to have less effect just simply because there's still so much more share that can be taken. So we watch all of those things, but ultimately, the decisions on how we run our business are going to be made off of the data that we’re collecting on our own customers' research that we’re doing. And that's really going to drive our actions. We certainly are watching everything else as changes are made, but decisions are being made based on our own customers and what we think is going to give them a better experience.
Brian Bittner: And that just kind of segues into the next question where you talked about the same stores sales strength being mostly tied to the loyalty. And I'm just wondering how you understand that, how you know that. Does that mean that all the increased frequency is simply coming from loyalty customers? Is that kind of what you mean by that?
Patrick Doyle: No.
Brian Bittner: And what percent of your base is loyalty at this point?
Patrick Doyle: So first of all, we didn't say that most of it came from loyalty. We said that it was significant. And so I want to clarify that first. It certainly has been an important part of our results over the course of the last couple of years since we launched loyalty. Beyond that, we are not yet giving kind of specifics around our loyalty program metrics on the loyalty. But in terms of how do we know the effect that it's having, we have pretty extraordinary data based on our model and used that actively to kind of model out our business. And we understand pretty clearly what is driving our business and how each of the components of the things that we’re doing are kind of feeding into that. So we know pretty precisely what's driving our business. We are not going to share that because we don't want to help our competition make better decisions around their business, but clearly loyalty has been helping. It’s been significant, but I didn't say that it is most of what's been driving the results.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Peter, your line’s open.
Peter Saleh: I just wanted to ask about the G&A guidance. If I heard you right, I think it's going up about $5 million to $10 million for this year. Just wondering what’s changed versus earlier this year on your G&A? Is this a pull forward from next year or is this just straight up an increase for this year?
Jeff Lawrence: Peter, this is Jeff. It's really just the continuation of the investments that are planned plus the additional expense that you get when quite frankly you grow sales as fast as we do. We have things that are variable in G&A that correlate directly to sales growth. So as we continue quarter after quarter to put up the kind of results we’re seeing, at some point we’re compelled to kind of update that guidance. We believe the 350 to 355 number is the right number with kind of three months to go. And that's why we are raising it at this point.
Peter Saleh: And then just on the tech fee increase, the $0.04 increase, did the franchisees have to vote on this at all, or was there any pushback on this increase, or was there generally speaking a lot of buy-in on this increase?
Patrick Doyle: No, they don't have to vote on it, but, we are continuing to produce the results that we are because we’ve got great relationships with our franchisees and a lot of trust between us. And they are very excited about the investments that we’ve been making in technology and understand that if we’re going to continue to grow our lead, or at least maintain our lead in technology, we're going to need to continue to invest there. And so they’re very supportive of this increase. I think it's been about three years since we have changed the fee. We still are the best deal in the industry, and they recognize that as well. But we've got a great partnership with them, and so a specific vote wasn't required, but we're very cautious and we worry as much about their financial results and their ROI as we do about anything else. And so we recognize and are going to be very careful about how we take increases over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Will, your line’s open.
Will Slabaugh: And in the past, you’ve talked about growth rates in delivery versus carryout, and just given investments especially that you’re making now and have been making to your physical assets domestically. So I’m curious if you could just speak to kind of how those two businesses are doing. And then also, what that mid-term growth might look like internationally where it makes sense.
Patrick Doyle: Yes, it's continuing to grow nicely on both fronts in the domestic side. Over time, we've gotten a little more growth out of carryout than out of delivery, but we’re getting traction on both fronts domestically. And I think the same is really true overall in international, though that's going to vary a little bit market to market. But we're seeing strength on both.
Will Slabaugh: And one quick follow-up, if I could, on, Jeff, I believe a comment you made about lower performance based comp. I was just curious, with the results that you put up, why that may be the case.
Jeff Lawrence: Well, just we have pretty aggressive internal goals here. We don't -- we’re not resting on our past success, so when we get together with our board and they put our internal goals together, they’re pretty aggressive. And despite the fact that we had what we believe to be just a blowout great quarter, it was just a little bit lower than it was as far as outperformance versus the prior year, when you look at Q3 over Q3. And so when you add that up, it's a little bit less.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Sara, your line’s open.
Sara Senatore: I had a sort of a multipart question. The first one is just on your current advertising -- the blood, sweat and teardowns. I'm just trying to understand who that is talking to. Is it customers to talk about your assets, or are you speaking to franchisees who -- or potential franchisees? And I guess just generally what’s the message there? If it is for customers, is it about carryout? And then I do have a question about the competitive environment, please.
Patrick Doyle: Sara, yes, it is absolutely the customers, and it's about carryout. And the environment in our stores is better now. All the people in those ads are franchisees in our system. They’re all good friends. And they’re proud of their stores and the way they’ve rebuilt them, and they are excited to show them off to customers.
Sara Senatore: And the second question is just you mentioned that you don't react to competitor actions. But it looks like maybe there’s been some more price point competition about specific price points, like $7.99. So I guess I'm curious, are you seeing more price point competition? And even if you’re not, when you think about how your customers choose Domino's, obviously technology is a huge advantage, but 40% of your sales aren't digital. So maybe just talk a little bit about the factors that go into that, in light of what may be resurgent price competition.
Patrick Doyle: Well, consistency matters on pricing to our customers. And we’ve had basically the same national offer for seven, eight years, nine years now. And so people know the value that they’re going to be able to get from Domino's, and that has continued. And I guess what I would repeat is that short-term moves in pricing from competitors generally don't have that much effect because the category is so fragmented. And our largest competitor in the U.S. in total is all of the locals, and mom and pops, and regional chains. And so kind of their pricing in the aggregate doesn't move that much because it's a lot of individual decisions. So really, this goes back to what I said in my script about we don't kind of follow a flavor of the month. We don't use pricing and new products each month and all of those sorts of things to kind of attract attention. We use our resources to invest in what we think is going to generate a better experience for our customers today than it did a year ago. And so that's the answer, is we stay very focused on what we're doing and the consistency that people get from us -- is ultimately what drives the results.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line’s open.
Karen Holthouse: In commentary on the comp drivers, this is, I think, the first time in a while that you’ve mentioned ticket, versus really emphasizing traffic as the driver. And I’m just curious what’s driving that. Is that lapping maybe some of the headwind from loyalty? Are you doing better on suggestive selling on sort of digital orders? I know you’ve talked about rolling out some more customization and personalization there. Just any help you can offer.
Patrick Doyle: Yes, I mean, it still was overwhelmingly order count growth in the quarter. There was a little bit of ticket. Some of that, as I think we’ve talked about before, understanding ticket in our business is -- there are a lot of things that are going into the math equation. So it's the split between carryout and delivery. It's the split between digital and phone orders and walk-in orders. There are just a lot of different things that factor into that. One thing that probably did play into that a little bit is a year ago we started running -- or now a little over a year ago, we started running the full week carry out special. And so as we kind of start coming off of or start lapping that, the fact that that was a little bit more aggressive price point in that particular area a year ago -- and now because it's consistent, other things that may be playing into the ticket overall start having that effect. But there's nothing dramatic going on from a pricing standpoint. We’re very, very consistent as we’ve talked about it from pricing. It's really more just about kind of the component parts, what's growing a little bit more than other areas.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Jason, your line’s open.
Jason West: Just a couple questions. One, on the franchisee margins, obviously, it's been tough out there from a labor standpoint. We’ve got a bit higher fee now. Is there any sense of how long you can stay on this $5.99 value promotion? Or is there maybe some thought that you’d have to move off of that at some point?
Patrick Doyle: We’re not going to kind of give forward-looking guidance on pricing. We certainly aren't going to give our competition kind of a heads up on that. I guess I would just repeat that the consistency of what we do is pretty powerful. And you did say on the digital increase, we haven’t had a digital increase yet, and our digital orders are more profitable on average than our non-digital orders. And the $0.04 increase would have a nominal effect on that. They will still be more profitable for our franchisees than non-digital. So overall, we’re still pretty darn bullish on franchise profitability.
Jason West: And then on the international side. The unit openings there came in a little bit below. I think some estimates, and I know you guys don't guide quarterly, but you mentioned India making a strategic change perhaps. Can you talk a bit about going forward, is it getting a bit more difficult internationally to maintain such high levels of unit growth? Is there any sense that maybe things are flattening out at this sort of pace of unit growth? Or how we should be thinking about that or if there was a timing issue maybe in the quarter? Thanks.
Patrick Doyle: Now, also the timing issue in the quarter is simply some of the conversions that we’ve had out there. And there was a lot of growth coming out of the conversions. And we’ve kind of -- we’re kind of rolling off of that now. So those were going to be lumpy, and it's certainly not something that you can expect on a regular basis from us. The 6% to 8% guidance on net unit growth remains the same for us, and so that is ultimately where we think we are going to be most of the time. India is still growing store counts and the business in India is doing well. And you saw their latest results. They had a nice step up in their comps. We are really the dominant player in India. But what I would say is new CEO came in, and we agree with the decision that they took the foot off the gas just a little bit. With the demonetization from a year ago, and I guess we’re just coming up on a year now and then the imposition of the GST not long after that, his view and totally agree and that the owner's view was, “You know what? Let's slow down the pace of growth a little bit while we kind of adjust around the new realities of the marketplace.” But the business in India continues to do very, very well. We’re getting comp growth. We’re getting store growth. The store growth is just at a little bit more measured pace than it was in the past. And that's the real primary difference in kind of the organic growth. But all of which is within the context of continuing to believe that our long-term guidance around 6% to 8% is correct.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Matt, your line’s open.
Matthew McGinley: On the international comp., I know there’s a lot of markets that factor into that, so it might not be best to generalize the drivers, but last quarter you talked about improving value in some markets and also discussed store splitting as being a drag on the comp. How much of that sequential step up do you feel were improvements in those issues that you’d brought up with value and store splitting relative to one off impacts or headwinds, calendar shift technology issues and things like that in the quarter that may have depressed that International comp?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, so the - any effect from splits continues to be very, very consistent. And I think kind of the balance of growth, that 6% to 8% growth in net store units and how much of that is coming from splits versus green field, has stayed relatively constant. I think we got ourselves into better shape in the U.K. That was certainly a big focus last quarter from people, and my statement at the time was it's fixable, and it was fixable. And they had a very good quarter. They released a couple of days to go, and that renewed momentum in that business. And the U.K. is 20-ish% of our retail sales in our international business. So they matter a lot in our overall comp. And so the acceleration that they had in the third quarter certainly is a big part of the overall move in our third quarter.
Matthew McGinley: And then on the delivery versus carryout as it relates to the technology fee, how big is the differential in digital ordering between a carryout and a delivery customer? I was wondering that in terms of if the economics of the transaction are a little worse for you as a franchiser, if you don't get the technology fee, given that probably more of those carryout orders are done verbally rather than done digitally. So was that perhaps -- was the mix a driver of the decision to increase that technology fee, or do you feel that the features have just improved to the extent where you needed to charge more?
Patrick Doyle: No, actually no on both of those. We’re not charging more because the features have improved. We increased it because we want to invest in making it better going forward. And a higher percentage of our delivery orders are placed digitally than our carryout orders. But that's not really factoring into how we’re thinking about that fee.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump from Longbow Research. Alton, your line is open.
Alton Stump: A couple of quick questions. In the U.S. first off, of course you mentioned loyalty being a bigger driver this quarter. Could you talk about maybe some of the things you’re doing from an advertising or marketing standpoint to drive that higher impact from loyalty that you saw in 3Q?
Patrick Doyle: So, yes, we didn't say that it was bigger in the third quarter than in previous quarters. We just said that it continues to be a significant part of our comp growth. And what we did just say in my script is that we are going to be advertising it again this quarter. Otherwise, a lot of the support for it is coming from digital advertising and I'm not going to go into the specifics of how much of what we’re doing digitally is playing into it, but the biggest thing that we’ve done in terms of the loyalty program is change it so that you can earn anywhere. So that people can earn points if they’re ordering over the phone or if they’re ordering if they walk into the store. Though, that's relatively uncommon. They will still have to redeem digitally at the end of the process, but they’re going to be able to earn points by any order that take. So otherwise, I don't know that there's significant shift in how we’re promoting in the third quarter, but you are going to see it on television in the fourth quarter.
Alton Stump: And just a quick housekeeping item, as far as the hurricane impact, thanks for breaking out what that was in 3Q. Is there any impact from that that could plead into fourth quarter or is all that pretty much taken care of by the end of fiscal 3Q?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, Alton, this is Jeff. We expect it to be immaterial for Q4.
Alton Stump: And I wanted ask the last one just on the international side of things. Of course, quite a strong recovery sequentially into your SACs versus 2Q. Could you just maybe give some more color on, particularly U.K., sort of what drove that recovery versus 2Q?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, it really was more about getting the value equation right and it just had gotten a little bit out of line. It was very fixable and they fixed it. And we got some momentum again. And it's not deep discounting at all. But it was just getting that equation a little bit better as I think they had missed it a bit during the second quarter.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Jeffrey, your line’s open.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Two questions, just one following up on the discussion of delivery across the industry. I’m just wondering, as you examine your own results, do you see a range of comps across the U.S.? Is it a divergent range? I know last quarter you talked about you’re really just not seeing it with the 11 major metro markets or kind of small, suburban markets in terms of trying to get a read for whether delivery of competitors is having an impact on you, or maybe you have an international market or two where you think that they’re further along in terms of competitive delivery set that you use as a proxy. I’m just wondering if you have any read or believe that that’s going to have any traction, or whether you’re just not seeing it at all?
Patrick Doyle: So certainly If there's going to be an impact, it’s going to be in the major metro areas more than the smaller markets. And it’s going to be tough. As we understand the economics of some of these providers, their economics are certainly better in big cities than they are in smaller towns. So to the extent to which there's an effect, you’re certainly going to see it more in the major metros than somewhere else. We continue to track it very closely. If there is an effect from it, it's in the one point range. There's not certainly a big effect, but if there is, it is certainly going to be more in the major markets than in smaller markets. But it is still a limited effect.
Jeffrey Bernstein: And are there certain international markets that you talk to just for kind of intelligence, in terms of, we saw that a few years before you, and this is the progression of it, or is there really no specific market that you’d use as a proxy?
Patrick Doyle: The market where it is most developed is China, and we’re doing great in China. And there was certainly a lot of discussion after the second quarter as to whether or not this was really about aggregators in the U.K. And I think you saw that third quarter was pretty darn good in the U.K. So I guess what I would say is we continue to monitor it very closely. There is not a significant effect. If there is, as I said, it's pretty limited. And in terms of the markets where it's more developed, our results in China are strong and our results in the U.K. are strong.
Jeffrey Bernstein: And then just, Patrick, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned briefly just the self-driving cars and your early testing and whatnot, but if you were to use your crystal ball -- I mean, maybe just share any early learnings? Or how far off in the future are we talking? It would just seem like it would be a huge labor savings from a franchisee’s perspective. But I’m just wondering, maybe this piece of this we just don’t fully understand, but any early learnings or time frame when you think that might actually take place would be great.
Patrick Doyle: Well, the good news is that all we have to understand here at Domino's is how the customer is going to interact with that, and make sure that we are ready for it when it comes. The Ford and other people working on this -- and the government. As regulations develop, they’re going to be the ones who are going to be really determining when it rolls out at scale. Ford has talked about 2021 model year that they’re going to be delivering a significant number of these vehicles. I think you’re going to see adoption starting to really impact things somewhere between three years and ten years. And it's going to take time, and there are a lot of parties that are involved in that that are going to have a lot more control than this Ann Arbor-based pizza company. Our job is to make sure that we understand how we're going to be able to adapt it to the customer, and how it's going to play into our business, and how we can make sure that we’re going to be ahead of curve on this. And I guess the analogy I would make on this is voice. And when we rolled out voice on our app -- so natural voice ordering on our apps, now probably four years ago, something in that range, we talked about the fact that we thought this was important and that it was going to be an increasingly large part of our business going forward and how people were going to interact with technology. And we were out doing that ahead of everybody else and the first people taking commercial orders with natural voice. And you see now how that's played out. And our very developed abilities in that area have given us competitive advantage as natural voice is becoming more and more a part of how people interact with technology. So what I would say is three or four years ago as I was talking about natural voice, it was not clear exactly when that was going to start being widespread, but we were pretty confident that it would. We are equally confident that self-driving vehicles are going to have a material impact on transportation. And we've got to understand how we’re going to play in that space. And it's why we’re investing some resources against that and starting to understand how it’s going to affect our customers, how their behavior would need to change, et cetera. So the exact timing is going to be harder to predict and definitely not something that’s i-controlled or probably anything that any government agencies will be asking me about. But we are pretty confident it’s going to come and we've got to understand it and understand how we’re going to leverage it for competitive advantage when it does roll out.
Operator: And your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Ivankoe: Hopefully I'm not re-asking the same questions. I’ll try to ask it in a different way. The increase in the digital ordering fee from $0.17 to $0.21 to $0.25, are pretty small increases over a period of time. I mean, it's averaging just over $0.01 a year basically. So just put that into context as why the increase is so small? I guess in two different things. One, as you benchmark third party delivery orders or just third-party orders that are offered to competition, probably local competition, what is Domino's basically as a percentage of the average ticket relative to what your competitive peers are from what you can see in the independent markets? And then secondly, can you comment about your relatively small $0.04 increase about what we hear as one of your competitors that’s doubling the digital fee increase to its franchisees?
Patrick Doyle: So thanks, John, and the answer is as a percentage of our ticket, we’re kind of in the range of 1 point. And I guess a bit over a point at $0.25, but it is still in that range of 1%. If you look at Grubhub, which is today the largest kind of straight order aggregator in the U.S., I think they have said that their average is about 15% right now. And so our approach to this is if you give our franchisees a 14% cost advantage, we're going to win on value. And we want to give them the best deal. We want to have the best technology. Topline growth in our business is going to be the best way to generate value for our shareholders over time. And we are very aligned with our franchisees about the approach that we’re taking to the business and how we’re going to create value for them and for our shareholders. And so doing this with moderate incremental increases allows our franchisees to maintain a real value advantage over people who are paying dramatically more. And we think that's important. And our approach to this is, I think, borne out in far better growth than pretty much everybody, and so that's kind of thinking that's going into it. Sure, we can always take it up more and have a quick bump out of that, but that's not our goal with technology. This is something that we are doing with our franchisees to create competitive advantage in the marketplace. And they are sharing in the cost of developing that.
John Ivankoe: And I guess your perspective is as we think about longer term in the model, even in the next five years, is just to expect these levels of very moderate increases. And that’s no step functions up, but just the overall theme is maintaining low cost operator advantage and winning for the topline. Is that fair to characterize?
Patrick Doyle: I'm not going to get into projecting pricing going forward. But certainly we feel very good about our strategy and kind of how we’re approaching this. And this is an area where our scale allows us to spread our investments over a very big store base. It is an area where we can kind of leverage big investments that are being made centrally across a very large group of stores, domestically and around the world. And that's an advantage that we’re bringing to the marketplace for people who are part of the Domino's system. And so we feel really good about it.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
John Glass: Thanks very much. 95 quarters ago, I was 116 quarters old. So you can do that math.
Jeff Lawrence: We have a winner!
Patrick Doyle: Well played. Well played.
John Glass: There you go. Two questions. First question is just UberEATS and McDonald’s did actually run fairly significant promotion during the quarter. Did you feel that all? Was there any evidence that that impacted your business?
Patrick Doyle: I guess what I’d say, I’d repeat what I was before. If there is an effect and I’d say if there was an effect, you’re looking at it being relatively modest.
John Glass: That's helpful. And then just on this technology fee increase. Jeff, maybe you can size this for us just so we can get the right numbers in the increases that U.S. or there’s some international markets. And it sounds like you’re going to be spending against it incrementally. So is it a net wash when you look at your business from a P&L or are you just recapturing some costs that you had already accumulated over time?
Jeff Lawrence: So as far as your model, we’re not going to give the actual dollar amount. What I can tell you is it’ll be all the stores in the U.S. times their digital orders times $0.04 more for the year. So you can kind of coalesce around that and try to get to a dollar amount, but we’re not going to give guidance specifically around that. As far as the incremental -- and don't forget we endeavored to increase the digital mix as well over time, right? So it’s incremental there too. But again, as Patrick said, this is done -- we have our innovation technology plan. We have the teams in place to deliver that value. That's a barge moving down the river, over time, every couple two, three years at least in the past we’ve raised the fee, again, to try to keep it very competitive and the best value in the industry which we believe we have. And so they’re not directly tied to each other kind of lockstep. And I won't comment as to whether it's a net zero or not.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alex Slagle of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Alex Slagle: Could you talk about the domestic in-store execution and your satisfaction with your operator's ability to handle the big increase in volume going through your domestic stores? And it's been a number of years now of big growth. Have you come across any challenges keeping up with the production demands in terms of equipment, labor, and such?
Patrick Doyle: Overall, they’re doing a terrific job. And so today our service levels to our customers are better than they have ever been. I would also give a shout out to our supply chain folks who have also needed to keep up with the volume growth. And that's why we’ve talked about kind of increased investments coming there and are needed. But overall, our stores are doing a really nice job of not only keeping up with it, but continuing to improve, the service, and I would add, it is part of why you’re seeing more stores being built. That's the other way of increasing capacity. And what you’re seeing over time -- if you look back at our sales growth three or four years ago, it was fundamentally 100% same-store sales growth and effectively flat store counts. You’re now seeing far more balance in how we’re growing our business overall. So you’re seeing now on a trailing 12-month basis something in the range of 4% growth coming from store count growth. And so I think it's important, as you look at the business and kind of analyze how you’re doing, how we’re doing, that you’re looking at overall retail sales growth along with kind of the straight up same-store sales growth, because clearly, one of the ways that our franchisees are maintaining or even improving service levels to our customers is by building more stores to handle that volume. So overall, they’re doing a terrific job, and one of the net effects of that is kind of continued growth in stores in the U.S. and around the world.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Anderson with Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Stephen Anderson: Yes, good morning. And I wanted to ask about the increase guidance to the $350 million, $355 million range. Is that inclusive of any potential share compensation, share-based compensation, or is that on a separate line?
Jeff Lawrence: So, Steven, this is Jeff. The updated guidance on G&A we gave is the GAAP number, the gross general administrative expense number. We’re raising it $350 million to $355 million for the full fiscal year. I know we’ve got a couple of months, two, three months to go here. And that would include all of the gross G&A costs, including corporate store advertising, performance-based compensation -- it includes all of that, so -- and continued investments, obviously most importantly in technology and analytics, to really help drive the business. So it's an all-in number.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I now turn the call back over to the presenters.
Timothy McIntyre: Thank you, everyone. We look forward to seeing many of you at our 2018 Investor Day in early January, and discussing our fourth quarter and year-end 2017 results on Tuesday, February 20. Thank you all.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Tim McIntyre, Executive Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations, you may now begin your conference.
Timothy P. McIntyre - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Kelly, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2017 earnings call. As you know, this call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others be in a listen-only mode. I also refer you to our Safe Harbor statement that is both in this morning's 8-K release and in our press release in the event that any forward-looking statements are made. This morning we will start with prepared comments from our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence; and our Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Doyle, followed by your questions. With that, I'd like to introduce Jeff Lawrence.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued as we once again delivered solid results for our shareholders. We continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 25 consecutive quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 94 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continued to increase our store count at a healthy pace, which we believe is more evidence that our brand is strong and growing. Our diluted earnings per share was $1.32, which is an increase of 34.7% over the prior year quarter. This increase resulted from strong operational results as well as a lower effective tax rate. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q2. Global retail sales which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide grew 11.8% in the quarter. And excluding the impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 14.1%. The drivers of this retail sales growth included strong domestic same-store sales which grew by 9.5% in the quarter. Our U.S. franchise business was up 9.3%, while our company-owned stores were up 11.2%. Both of these comp increases were driven by order count or traffic growth as consumers continued to respond positively to the overall brand experience we offer them. Our Piece of the Pie loyalty program continues to contribute significantly to our traffic gains. Overall ticket increased slightly during the quarter. On the unit count front, we are pleased to report that we opened 39 net domestic stores in the second quarter consisting of 43 store openings and four closures. Same-store sales for our international division grew 2.6%, lapping a prior-year increase of 7.1%. All four of our geographic regions were positive in the quarter, with the Americas and Asia Pacific regions leading the way. We have had challenging performance in a handful of our 85 markets, and are working hard with the teams on the ground to improve those results. We continue to have strong confidence in our international business. The international division added 178 net new stores during Q2 comprised of 201 store openings and 23 closures. On a total company basis, we opened 217 net new stores in the second quarter and 1,281 stores over the last 12 months, clearly demonstrating the broad strength and outstanding four-wall economics our brand enjoys globally. Turning to revenues, total revenues were up 14.8% from the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily a result of increased global comps and store count growth, which also drove higher supply chain volumes. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $1.6 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies, primarily the British pound. As you know, there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rate, which does make this a harder part of our business to predict. Moving on to operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter decreased to 30.7% from 31.4% in the prior-year quarter. The operating margin in our company-owned stores decreased to 20.8% from 24.6%, driven primarily by higher insurance expense, as well as higher transaction-related expenses and increased labor costs. Lower occupancy expenses as a percent of sales benefited the operating margin and partially offset these decreases. Supply chain operating margin was flat at 11.1%. Although margins benefited from lower food cost and lower insurance costs, this increase in margin percentage was offset entirely by increased labor and delivery costs. There was very strong domestic volume growth this quarter and even stronger volume growth in Canada. Market basket pricing to stores increased slightly this quarter. We continue to estimate that the domestic stores' market basket costs will range from flat to up 2% in 2017 from 2016 levels. Before we leave operating margins, I'd also like to note that franchisees in the U.S. continue to share in our success with record profit sharing checks that they have earned alongside of us with great execution and performance. As I mentioned before, we also expect to make additional investments in supply chain in the near to medium term to keep up with our rapid growth. Let's now shift to G&A. G&A increased by $11.8 million in the second quarter versus the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by our planned investments in technological initiatives, including investments in e-commerce and our point-of-sale system and the teams that support them. Please note that these investments are partially offset by fees that we receive from our franchisees, which are recorded as franchise revenues. Additionally, G&A increased due to higher advertising expenses at our company-owned stores, which increased as a result of our positive sales growth and continued investments in other strategic areas. Moving down the income statement. Interest expense decreased slightly in the second quarter, and our weighted average borrowing rate remained at 4.6%. Our reported effective tax rate was 25.7% for the quarter. As previously communicated, we adopted the new accounting standard in the first quarter, which requires us to record the excess tax benefit on equity-based compensation as a reduction to our income tax provision on the profit and loss statement. As a result of this new standard, there is a $10.4 million decrease in our second quarter provision for income taxes which resulted in an 11.8 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate. Again, the economics have not changed, just the way we are required to present it. We expect that we will continue to see volatility in our reported effective tax rate. When you add it all up, our second quarter net income was up $16.5 million, or 33.5% over the prior-year quarter. Our second quarter diluted EPS was $1.32 versus $0.98 last year, which was a 34.7% increase. Here is how the $0.34 increase breaks down. Our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.20, including the $0.21 impact from the adoption of the new equity-based compensation accounting standard. Lower diluted share counts, primarily as a result of share repurchases, benefited us by $0.02. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted royalty revenues by $0.02. And most importantly our improved operating results benefited us by $0.14. Now turning to our use of cash. During the second quarter we returned $22 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.46 per share quarterly dividend. As we previously announced, we have been in the process of recapitalizing our company, increasing our leverage to match our growing business, which has been our consistent pattern for many years. The recapitalization transaction closed yesterday, July 24, with the receipt of $1.9 billion in gross proceeds. We're happy to report that the deal was very well-received by the lending community, and the interest rates we'll be paying on this new debt are a good reflection of the investment community's confidence in our business and our brand. Now on to some details about this deal. The transaction, which again has taken advantage of the whole business securitization structure, included issuing $1.6 billion of new fixed rate notes and $300 million of new floating rate notes, which was made up of the following tranches: a $1 billion fixed rate tranche at a 4.118% coupon rate with an anticipated repayment date of 10 years; a $600 million fixed rate tranche at a 3.082% coupon rate with an anticipated repayment date of five years; and finally, a $300 million floating rate tranche priced at three months LIBOR plus 1.25%, also with an anticipated repayment date of five years. On a blended rate basis, the new 2017 notes currently carry pre-tax interest rates of approximately 3.5%. When added together with the interest rates from the 2015 notes still outstanding, our weighted average borrowing rate has decreased from 4.6% pre-deal to 3.8% post-deal. We're extremely pleased to have driven down our cost of debt so substantially. Standard & Poors rated our debt BBB+, which is the top rating in the restaurant industry for whole business securitizations. We are proud of our long-term investment-grade credit profiles and our strong history of performance in this space. Our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio using Q2 trailing 12-month EBITDA is now approximately 5.9 times, up from approximately 4.1 times before this deal and near the top of our previously-stated 3 times to 6 times range. The 2017 notes have scheduled principal payments of 1% of the principal each year, which equates to approximately $19 million per year over the next five years. The outstanding 2015 notes will also begin re-amortizing in Q4 with scheduled principal payments of $3.3 million in 2017 and $13 million in 2018. Our 2015 and 2017 notes will cease principal amortization payments when our leverage ratio falls below five times. With these scheduled principal payments on both our 2015 and 2017 notes and our momentum in the business, we currently expect our leverage ratios to fall over the medium term, consistent with prior experience. We also entered into a new $175 million variable funding notes facility, essentially a revolving line of credit, at LIBOR plus 1.8%. This pricing is a significant improvement over our expiring $125 million facility. The new facility is currently undrawn. However, approximately $44 million of letters of credit have been issued in support of our insurance programs and certain leased properties consistent with our past practice. Use of funds from this recapitalization include $910 million to prepay and retire the remaining balance of our existing 2012 notes, which carried an interest rate of 5.2%. We feel great about swapping out this debt for lower cost new debt. We will also pay fees and expenses related to the deal of approximately $18 million and pre-fund approximately $5 million for a portion of the principal and interest on the 2017 notes. As with our previous recapitalizations, we plan to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include share repurchases and/or special dividend, subject to approval by our board of directors. We expect to announce plan for the remaining excess proceeds over the next couple of weeks. This recapitalization and these uses of cash will have a significant impact on our financial statement. And you can expect to see some changes and some noise in the back half of this year. We currently estimate that approximately $17 (13:40) million in debt issuance costs for the deal will be recorded on the balance sheet and amortized over the weighted average life of the new deal. When you add it all up, the new deferred financing cost amortization schedule, the expected principal payments, and the newer debt at lower rates; we expect as-reported Q3 interest expense to be approximately $33 million on a pre-tax basis. This includes approximately $6 million in deal-related charges and other interest charges, which will be adjusted out as items affecting comparability. For the full-year 2017, as reported interest expense is currently expected to be between $122 million and $123 million on a pre-tax basis, and again, approximately $6 million will be adjusted out as an item affecting comparability. It is important to note that these current estimates of interest expense may change due to borrowings under our VFN and changes in LIBOR that would affect our new variable rate, among other factors. Separately from a non-interest expense perspective, there will also be approximately $1 million of non-capitalized deal cost, which will be expensed in the third quarter and also adjusted out as an item affecting comparability. All-in-all, our strong momentum continued and we are very pleased with our results this quarter, including our recapitalization. And with that, I will turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. As I reflect on the second quarter, two main thoughts come to mind. First, how proud I am of our domestic franchisees and operators, as it was yet another phenomenal performance by our U.S. business. Brand momentum, execution and relentless focus on getting better each day continue to drive what we do. And I wake up each day proud to lead and be a part of a company and store-level culture that refuses to level off or become complacent. And second, while we continue to view ourselves as a brand in progress, while our international business continues to strive as a store growth engine, with most markets and master franchisee organizations executing at high levels within our over 85 markets worldwide, our sales performance is soft and below what we come to expect from the best international model in QSR. With this proven foundation, a diverse portfolio of geographies and issues easily categorized as correctable, I am confident we can get top line performance of this business to the levels we are used to. We've gone with football parallels in the past, so I'll stick with what works and share yet another one. I'm pleased we continue to execute the fundamentals without the need for trick plays. On offense, we continue to innovate, keeping our focus on long-term success and making investments that reflect that long-term focus. On defense, we continue to aggressively protect our growing share and competitive position in pursuit of being number one. And all-in-all, I'm pleased we continue to win. But with that said, we remain mindful of our need to always execute the basics better. And with plenty of game film to break down and learn from, that's exactly what we intend to do. Our U.S. results and ability to sustain and lap outstanding performance continues to amaze me. Our twenty-fifth consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth can be attributed to our franchisees and operators just plain getting it done. We have never been more aligned as a domestic system, and our sound simple strategy and sturdy fundamentals continue to position us for success. We opened 39 net new stores in the second quarter, as our domestic store growth continues to track in the right direction. Our internal team and franchisees are showing impressive alignment on the importance of smart strategic growth. And this area of our business, one that has certainly demonstrated opportunity in the past, is moving in a very strong direction. And I continue to be pleased with the progress. I'm also happy to announce plans to open our seventeenth domestic supply chain center in the Northeast sometime in mid-2018. This new center will strengthen our roster of dough manufacturing and food distribution centers in the U.S. and relieve some of the good problem to have, capacity issues, we have encountered due to the tremendously high volumes flowing through our supply chain operations. Lastly, while it won't impact results until the third quarter, we recently launched a new product we're very excited about. Our new bread twists are handmade, and make for a terrific side item with three flavors to choose from parmesan, garlic and cinnamon. This is not only a great addition to the $5.99 Mix and Match menu platform, but a great example of us constantly looking at how and where we can improve. Our talented chefs saw an opportunity to make our bread sides better, and like everything else we do, we test it. We made sure our customers agreed. We're pleased with the results so far, particularly for a product not yet on television and look forward to feedback from customers continuing to give them a try. Wrapping up, our domestic business is getting it done, to say the least. I couldn't be more pleased and proud of the many that are making it happen. I briefly touched on our international business earlier in my remarks, and reiterate that our 94th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales weren't exactly the type of results we've all come to expect within this high-performing business segment. The model is proven and we continue to see terrific performance from many markets, particularly within the Americas, highlighted by another great quarter in Canada. The slowdown in same-store sales this quarter was driven primarily by our Europe region where the issues in a few select markets are known and fixable. As an example, our dialogue with one of those markets, Domino's Pizza Group out of the UK which released its first half results this morning, is constant and productive. As we do in all of our international markets we're sharing best practices, key learnings and benchmarks around meaningful customer value and order count growth, and working together to improve top line results in the UK in addition to the other markets that were software during Q2. I'm highly confident we will do so and would add while same-store sales were not as strong, unit level return on investment remains extremely healthy, and we continue to drive significant store growth in the UK and across our entire international business in both developed and emerging markets at a tremendous pace. We opened a net 178 stores during the quarter, and in addition, continue to grow our technology position abroad surpassing 70% of international stores on Domino's PULSE during the quarter, and over 1,100 stores now on our global online ordering platform. And on that thought technology continued to be at the forefront during the second quarter for the business as a whole, as our Domino's Tracker campaign highlighted a core Domino's digital ordering fan favorite. With our strong unmatched lineup of anywhere ordering platforms, we now look to the future of digital with near endless opportunities in store and within the delivery experience itself to examine and consider, as well as applying data learnings to further enrich an online ordering experience that continually sets the pace for our competitors and peers. In closing, I am extremely pleased with yet another phenomenal quarter from our domestic business and congratulate our franchisees, operators and domestic leadership for refusing to rest on past success. Instead, they're pushing forward with more energy and vigor than ever. Our work in progress brand and team continue forward with the same approach that got us here, addressing areas that can get better, listening to the customer before listening to ourselves, and establishing global alignment that is stronger than any other within the industry. For three for three and our focus on those elements we'll continue to win. Thanks, and we'll now open it up for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Looking at the UK where you saw some weakness in the quarter, could you maybe help us understand, were there macro factors or competitive factors that were at play there, and when you think about the playbook to regain momentum in the business what are you most focused on and how quickly do you think some of those things could start to have an impact?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Karen. I think, if you look at the UK, I mean, clearly consumer confidence has been a little bit weaker, but at the end of the day we got to execute in any environment and the team over there is very, very focused on it. I think with consumers where they are, we've got to make sure that we're getting our value offer right, that we're getting our advertising right, and I think, there are – I know that there are things in the works to make sure that we're addressing those things in the UK, and that they're going to do it in the relatively near term. So there's a terrific team there. It's an overwhelmingly sub-franchised market and there are great sub- franchisees there. They know how to execute, we know how to execute there. And I'm confident that they're going to get this on track. But certainly there's been a little bit of a shift in the environment there and we've got to make sure that we're listening to the customers and getting it right.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And a quick housekeeping on the reporting of comps. I knew that Domino's Pizza UK makes a differentiation between reported comps excluding where they've split stores and then what that would look like without excluding that. Which convention do you follow when you're pulling their results up to yours?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: We do not exclude splits.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Maybe just one quick one. Can you talk about the – just the comp flow-through in the company margins, and particularly, insurance cost? How much of that is specific to the second quarter versus sort of an ongoing step-up in the insurance cost line?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Hey, Greg. It's Jeff. Yeah. In Q2 versus Q2 last year, we had a 1.8 percentage point headwind from insurance cost. That's primarily a year-over-year increase in the actuarial update for workers compensation and auto liability program that we run for our 400 corporate stores. It's an area where we continue to invest behind in safety teams and want to make sure we continue to get the culture right. Quite frankly, the results aren't what we want them to be. We're going to continue to focus on it very aggressively, and we hope that we can post better results on that line item in the future.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then maybe one more, just on the thoughts on the supply chain changes that are coming. Is that going to show up where you have one or two new centers you have to add to really fix the issues? Or is this going to be a real re-think of the – just the overall supply chain set-up and kind of re-thinking the entire plans as they stand today?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. We've got new leadership from just 18 months ago in our supply chain now, and Troy has built kind of a fairly new team at the top there, and they've done a full re-think of where we are. I think at the end of the day, the model is going to remain very much the same that we've executed in terms of our own centers and how we're doing it. But as we look at our footprints of centers, more centers that are delivering fewer miles, I think, is going to drive greater efficiency for us. So the team has gone through some terrific kind of analysis around how are we going to optimize costs, and those options could have included growing the size and capacity of the existing centers. I think while there will be some of that in a few centers, you are going to see us open some more centers over the next few years. You know, we talked about the first one in the Northeast that we've now got a lease signed and they've turned the building over to us and we're starting to swing hammers there, and that is basically a year process to get that opened. There will be others down the road. But what you're going to see is us kind of expanding the footprint in the number of centers, which ultimately drives transportation efficiencies in those centers.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That's really helpful. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is open.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Great. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to the domestic system-wide comp, and I think you guys said primarily driven by transactions and the loyalty program had a significant impact. Any more color you can provide on what's driving the comp in terms of the loyalty program?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, Peter. You know what? It's – it is honestly the same story we've been saying for a while. So our goal is to be nice and boring and consistent on this. The answer is it is a number of factors. So it is loyalty. It is almost all orders and only a little bit of ticket in the second quarter. You've got some from kind of just digital and what we're doing and getting more effective on digital media. Loyalty is clearly a big one. A little bit of a boost from television, both GRPs and, I think, the effectiveness of our advertising. And, you know, you've got a little bit of market growth out there as well. Not a lot, but the category is up I think a point or two points. And so add to that operational execution and our franchisees and our Team USA stores investing in giving customers better service in the face of some pressure on wage rates, which is ultimately giving our customers a better experience, we'll take that trade off. So, it's a combination of really a lot of things. Our model and analytics give us pretty good read on kind of exactly how that's contributing and honestly, it is a fairly long list of a number of things that are doing it.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Great. And then just on the international business, and I know there has been some softening and it seems like you're at least for the time being maybe below that long term guidance of 3% to 6% on comps. What is your confidence on getting back to that 3% to 6% longer term on comp?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, our confidence on our long term guidance remains high.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. If I could also go to international, you talked about a handful markets, citing the UK in particular. And you made it sound like there was some operational things that may have gone wrong, but how – maybe if that's the case, could you just elaborate on what it is? Is it delivery times or something else? And how confident are you it's not competitive pressure? In particular UK is a very advanced market from a food delivery and non-pizza food delivery market. Is that impacting the business in your view? Or any of the other markets as you look at, is there any commonalities from a competitive standpoint that make you think something is changing on that front?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, John, so first, I don't think it really is kind of operational execution issue. Those can always get better and there are always opportunities there. I think, it's more around making sure we're getting value right, that we're getting the offering right. I think that is more the issue and frankly those are the things that we can control. If you look in the UK at kind of the other delivery options, I think, our perception to date, and it's frankly the same in the U.S., you've got a growing number of players in that space. We simply are not seeing that affecting our business at this point. The one thing that I would say in the UK that's interesting, we don't know that it's had any material effect, but you do see increasing amounts of advertising from the Deliveroos and Just Eats and some of the other players in that market. So if you look at share of voice on a broad basis, and include kind of all of the delivery options, there are more advertising there. But to date, from a direct competitive pressure and are people choosing to swap out occasions with other food for pizza, we just aren't seeing that. And we clearly are not seeing that in the U.S. and I think the only thing that we're looking at that's just interesting is share of voice within food delivery more broadly in the UK.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you for that. And then just on the U.S. business there have been some talk, I'm not sure if comes from you or franchisees about raising your fee to the franchisees for the technology fee. Can you remind us where the technology fee or the transaction fee is right now, and if there are plans to look at that again given you've got some rising costs in that area, what you might think of raising it to?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. It's – so the fee is $0.21. We do have the ability to increase that fee, but what I would say is if that fee is increased, and we have increased it in the past, it was increased from $0.17 to $0.21 I think about three years ago. Is that correct?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Two or three years ago, yeah.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Two or three years ago.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: And that's to fund more investments into the technical – into technology. So from your perspective, if that fee changes, understand that, that is going to be coming with increased investments as well. So for the time being it is $0.21. But if there were an increase, it's going to be about making more investments into technology.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: But just from a financial standpoint, it is recorded in your comps or not?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: So, this is Jeff.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, it's not...
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Revenues, yes.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yes, not in the comps for the U.S. business, but it is in franchise revenues on the income statement.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Jake Fuller - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. This is Jake on for Matt. I was just wondering if you could provide any detail onto the digital sales growth, or what percent of total sales did digital make up in this last quarter?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. It's still in the same range we've been in. So kind of 60% plus. And I guess what I would say is our pattern has been very, very consistent on this. That in the fall into the winter is when we see that tend to ramp up seasonally, and then it tends to go flat in the spring through the summer. And that has been consistent for five years, six years, seven years, eight years now. So we're right in that 60% range as we have been. And ramps tend to happen a little bit later in the year and early into the following year.
Jake Fuller - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley of Evercore. Your line is open.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Hi. My first question is on the capital return. And I appreciate you're not – you probably can't comment about what the board will do in the next few weeks. But historically, mostly use repurchases to return capital. But there were two times in the past where you did do special dividends. I guess hindsight's 20/20, (36:48) it would probably have been a better idea to do share repurchases, looking at where the stock is at today, relative to a special dividend. But I guess historically like what led you to do the share repurchases – rather the dividends in the past? And does multiple over time factor in the decision to do buybacks?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Matt, the answer remains the same as it's always been, which is we go through the analysis at the time and look at what we think is going to help generate the best returns for our shareholders. We are completely agnostic as to what we're going to do. And as you mentioned, we've done pretty much everything since we've been a public company. We have paid special dividends. We commenced a regular dividend. We've done share buybacks. And there was even a point about a decade ago during the crisis that we were buying in debt when we could do it at $0.50, $0.60, $0.70 on the dollar. So we come to each of these decisions separately, look at the set of facts that we have in front of us, and make our decision based on that. And our board will be making that decision shortly, as Jeff said.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. On the CapEx as it relates to the supply chain, can you give us a sense of what these new DCs would cost in terms of the cash for CapEx? And you've been talking for a while about how to – you need to invest in the supply chain to expand capacity in existing DCs and then build new ones. Is this something that's like tens of millions of dollars, or could this be a significantly bigger number over time?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, Matt. It's Jeff. So when we think about building a new supply chain center, you can think about anywhere between order of magnitude $10 million and $20 million, depending on if we pick up the tenant improvements or the landlord does. And again, that's just an economic decision that we'll make on each of the centers separately based on those facts. But a big new building, think somewhere between 60,000 and 100,000 square feet, full capacity between $10 million and $20 million. We certainly believe that we have more than one of these to build, as Patrick has talked about over the medium term. So we got the first site identified. We got the lease. We're starting to swing hammers. We feel pretty confident that there will be another one to follow pretty quickly. And again, these are great capital problems to have. If we're needing to put money into the capacity of supply chain, that is the best capital dollars that I can spend. So, expect it to be material, expect it to be material over time, and again, as for the timing of each individual center, when we get closer, we'll announce that.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Just one following up on the delivery topic, I'm just wondering how you – how you would go about monitoring success of other restaurants that are launching or testing delivery in the U.S.? And then as you mentioned, there doesn't appear to be an impact to the comp, but would you see it in your delivery or labor costs or the cost of drivers? It just seems like kind of ties to comment in the UK about how you're seeing greater delivery advertising. I would think you're going to see that in the U.S. in coming quarters. I'm just wondering how you read your competitors' success thus far, and perhaps how you protect yourself in the U.S. with your learnings from the UK.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, I think the answer is because of our geographic coverage in the U.S., we know where delivery services are well-developed and where they're not, and so we can look at New York and Los Angeles and Chicago and big markets where those services – San Francisco, big markets where those services may be more penetrated, whereas you get into smaller markets and they're not available at all in smaller towns. And then can break those markets apart and see whether or not there is kind of differentiation in results, and we're just not seeing it. It just does not show – any way we cut the numbers, it does not show up in our results today as pressuring our comps. And you can argue that at some point, it actually will grow the delivery business in general. But what I would add to that, I've said before but would reiterate, a lot of these delivery services are finding out very quickly that delivery is a lot harder than they thought it was going to be. And some of them are already gone, and there are others who are still kind of understanding what the economics look like around this. And for it to work, it's got to work for the driver, it's got to work for the restaurant, it's got to work for the company providing that service, and it's got to work for the customer. There's got to be value creation for all four of those parties to have a successful delivery business. And I think that there's still a lot of learning going on in this space around how difficult it is to make all of that work. Fortunately, we have 57 years of learning around how to make delivery efficient on food, and our advantages there seem to be holding up very, very well.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just the other question was on G&A and I guess versus – you don't give quarterly guidance, but versus this quarter, it was higher than we had expected. I know your prior guidance I think was for 340 or 345 in terms of millions of dollars in investments in tech and supply chain marketing. But just wondering whether we should read into the spend this quarter, and maybe with the outside fundamental strength, it is compelling to increase your investments and therefore you'd be happy to go above that $340 million to $345 million or maybe what the greatest area of opportunity would be if you were to exceed that target?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, this is Jeff. First thing I'd tell you is that we're not updating our guidance right now on G&A as we sit here today. A long way to go for the rest of the year. Certainly, if we did outperform, particularly given our internal plan, we – you know, we have the opportunity to go higher on G&A, and we would announce – update the guidance for that particular time when we felt comfortable. As far as what we're going to invest in, and when we're going to invest in it and to what amount. I think, Patrick has said it very clearly before, when we see really good ideas, whether it's in technology, marketing, analytics, supply chain, we're going to put the money whether it gets classified as G&A or something else in the P&L, we're just going to chase those good ROI projects. And so, again, no update to guidance right now. But our mindset around what we invest in and when we invest in it has not changed.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes the line of Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is open.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, guys. I had a question on average ticket. I know you don't break this out specifically but I was wondering if you could speak to it more broadly on what you're seeing from either a check growth or contraction standpoint versus what you've seen in the past. And secondarily, if you're seeing any impact on Domino's from what seemed to be an increasingly price point oriented peer group within QSR and pizza in particular?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. So our growth in the second quarter was overwhelmingly orders. Ticket was up just a little bit and we don't see the competitive situation to be really any – materially any different than it has been in the past.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Got you. And a quick follow-up if I could on the cost of goods commentary. Jeff, you said that the insurance, you did view that as more one-time or that should just continue to get a little bit better in future quarters?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. So we really hesitate to call anything one-time because we have to get it right regardless of what the line item is. We view insurance cost both to our supply chain and our Team USA businesses as largely something that we can invest behind and hopefully have a positive impact on. We certainly did not see that in Q2 in the corporate store business as we updated our independent actuarial models. And as a result, we had to take that hit in Q2, but what I can tell you is, again, we think it's something that we are investing behind. We're not seeing the results that we want yet. Certainly the more you deliver, the more activity you have, the more opportunity you have for auto accidents or workers' compensation claims, things like that. But we just have to do better in this area. We're investing behind it and so we hope that over time, volume adjusted, we can – we'd hopefully outperform a little bit.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Understood. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.
Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thank you very much. Just a few follow-up questions on some of the topics that have already been touched on. One is if you go back to international markets, I think some of what we've actually seen there may be more intense competition from direct pizza competitors. So I wanted to see if you saw any risk of that in the U.S. for example as maybe some of your large competitors announce initiatives to improve their own businesses. And I guess, a related note, one of the sort of sustained competitive advantages I think you have is the technology in the U.S. Is that less of a case in international markets, where you have such a lead on things like digital ordering or loyalty? And then I have one more follow-up.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Okay. So there were a few in there. So first, international markets in general are actually less competitive in pizza than our domestic market on average. There are certainly exceptions to that, but the category is growing faster outside of the U.S. than inside the U.S. The competitive set is generally less restricted and 95% of the people in the world live outside of the U.S. and the pizza category is probably a little over double the size internationally what it is in the U.S. So clearly far less-developed, less competition, more opportunity to grow. What I would say though is are we looking at kind of competitive pressures domestically and is there any change there? Really the answer is no. There has been no material change on that front. The broad story remains the same that it has been domestically, which is larger players taking share from smaller players. And certainly we've been doing better than the rest of the large players over the course of last few years. But I still believe that the longer-term story is the competitive advantage that scale brings to the larger players versus the smaller players. In terms of technology, internationally and where we stand, our penetration of digital orders internationally is a little bit lower on average than it is domestically. I would say that the sophistication of our markets around how technology is getting used today ranges from markets doing a terrific job on this, to there are still markets that don't have digital ordering today, smaller ones. And we've now got our offering with our global online ordering and are bringing markets onto that. But I think that there remains still on average a little more opportunity in international to do some of the things we've been doing domestically. And so when you look at our international performance and areas where we think we can improve, one of them is in the digital space. And as part of what gives us confidence about longer-term growth in the international business is there are still things in the toolkit that have not been applied in all of our international markets that we know work, and it just takes some time to roll those all out.
Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. I thought the UK was somewhat ahead, but it sounds like there's maybe some opportunity there where we're seeing softness. But my follow-up was...
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: UK is very developed on digital, and as their digital penetration is very high in the UK. So they've done a good job there overall. There are always opportunities, and there are things that in our conversations with them that we share with them, but frankly they share with us too. And they rolled out digital ordering in the UK nationally before we did in the U.S. So learning can go in both directions.
Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just quickly on the U.S., just trying to understand how your customers think about making a delivery order to Domino's? And I know we've sort of belabored this point, but with some of the very large QSRs getting into delivery, it seems that maybe they could compete on convenience, speed of service, or price point, the things that you're so good at. Do you think your customers decide they want Domino's and then they figured out how to access your product? Or do they say I want delivery, and then they figure out what's available? I mean, do you have any sort of research that tells you how customers make that decision so we can think about what the competition looks like?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. So they actually decide they want delivered pizza, and then they decide the brand on average. And that's part of where we've been making gains is, we make it so easy for somebody who says they want to get pizzas delivered to make us the choice. So we've got everything set up in the Pizza Profile and make it possible for them to order from anywhere, with any technology they're interacting with. I mean that's part of what's been driving the growth that we've had. There are certainly a lot of people who are experimenting with delivery now. And with only a couple of exceptions, Panera has been starting to add their own drivers. Most of them are using third-party delivery services. And what I would reiterate is it's got to work for the driver, the restaurant, the customer, and the people providing that delivery service. And getting all of that right, getting that balanced is a challenge, and I think there are a lot of folks who are kind of understanding how much that's a challenge. But look, we are watching it very carefully. We understand this marketplace very well. We are looking at all of these different players and understanding where people may be doing things well, and where they're not doing it well, and we will take good ideas anywhere we can find them. But 57 years of doing delivery ourselves has given us an awful lot of knowhow, and remains a real competitive advantage. And I would reiterate, we have seen in the more developed markets from other options on delivery zero effect on our sales.
Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Very clear. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Tower from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jon Tower - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Just a quick question or a couple questions. One on the U.S. first. Just trying to dig a little bit more into the comp itself. And I'm curious to get your thoughts on whether or not you believe it requires more promotional activity, whether it'd be lowering the price of the product or more deals during the week or adding more loyalty points per transaction in order to drive these share gains that you're seeing in the market? And then kind of on that same thought, we're now in year two, I think, of seeing store-level margins, at least in the corporate side, contract, so I was curious to hear your thoughts on pricing potentially later this year?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Absolutely no change is the short answer. Our price point, two medium two tops for $5.99 has been the same for, what, eight, nine years now, and our loyalty program has been very consistent with how we launched it. We did one-week promotion around that earlier, but otherwise, everything has remained very, very consistent from a pricing standpoint, both in terms of what we're doing and in terms of kind of the competitive set. We're just not seeing a lot of change out there.
Jon Tower - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. And then just on the GOLO platform in the international markets, I think you had mentioned 1,100 stores earlier in the transcript, but I was curious to hear your thoughts on what the impediments to growth or getting faster adoption in these markets globally?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. It's part of the investments that we've been making and that you're seeing in G&A as we've been adding to the team who can support and onboard international markets. And one of the priorities to-date has been getting some of these smaller markets and medium-sized markets on our platform that weren't offering digital, and those are, frankly, less efficient. If you're onboarding an island in the Caribbean that has two stores but has a different tax structure, you still have to do some customization around that and we've been investing in our ability to roll out in more and more countries, adding stores and making sure that everybody around the world is able to access the brand digitally. And so that's part of what the ramp-up has been in terms of G&A investment, along with a lot of other things in technology, adding new capabilities and new platforms and all of that. But that's been part of the investment is adding to the team who's able to support it internationally.
Jon Tower - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump of Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Yes. Thank you, and good morning.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Good morning, Alton.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I guess, just two things. First off, I think I heard you mention, Jeff, earlier in the Q that in total insurance costs were 180 basis point headwind to margin. Is that right? Did I hear that right?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, you heard that right. The details are on page 15 of the 10-Q, if you want the specifics.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. And then just as far as margin question, obviously, as you mentioned, company-owned margins were down or store-level margins were down almost 400 basis points. How much of that, if you're able to splice it out, will continue or could continue in coming quarters, whether back half of the year and/or beyond? Or is there any other kind of, sort of onetime, short-term items that were in there here in 2Q?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, if you look at the year-over-year changes, the biggest thing we had Q2 versus Q2 is the insurance, which I've already talked about. We think that remains an opportunity area for us, not only for the financial ramifications but more importantly, we just owe it to our employees to continue this culture of safety that we have and get better results. On labor, we were up 70 basis points year-over-year. That really was all and more of labor rate at our stores that we run. Again, only 400 stores, but we're in pockets that include New York and Arizona, which both had minimum wage increases. And so as minimum wage rate increases that are on the books or new ones are enacted, it could be a percentage of labor headwinds for us. And then you go up and down. Food hasn't been that big of a deal for us this year. It's been pretty benign. I think when you add it all up and you move away from the percentages, I think it's important to note that despite all these headwinds we have made more money at the margin line in Team USA year-to-date than we did through six months last year. So driving those transaction counts, being consistent with pricing and promotion that Patrick spoke about, I think at least gives you a chance to be competitive when it comes to bottom line dollars here, and that has certainly been our focus as we try to balance some of these headwinds.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: And I'm going to add one thing on that which is I'll first clarify, so on labor rate. So our team actually leveraged labor hours. So the increase in labor is more than all-in wage rate versus hours, so they were still getting some efficiency in the hours used and it's not just minimum wage. There is pressure out there on wages in general as the labor market continues to strengthen and that's a really high-class problem. When strength in the labor market is putting pressure on rates that's the way you want to see it working and we are always going to be conservative about reacting to that with pricing to our customers. So it is far easier to make a short-term move on pricing and protect a little bit of margin. We don't think that's the right answer. We pay what we need to pay to keep our stores staffed and give our customers great service. When there is pressure on those wage rates, we're going to be cautious of passing that through because we want to make sure that we're getting that right. And so when you're seeing some of this movement, you may see a little bit of a lag in the short-term. It may have some effect on margins and then we kind of fine-tune pricing where we can but we want to be conservative around that. And I would add, our franchisees are prospering right now. They're doing very, very well, but I would applaud their discipline around this as well. They want to make sure that they're taking care of the customers. They're putting that first and then where we take some price, it's done conservatively and cautiously to make sure that we're not going to chase off customers.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Great. Understand. Thank you, Patrick and Jeff.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. The comments you made, Patrick, earlier of your share of voice, I guess, delivery competition broadly increasing in the UK, certainly we understand that from a customer perspective, but is that market seeing any particular demand of staffing around delivery drivers? Not just cost, which I think can be understood but the ability to execute the brand that you want during your peak hours and is that competition materially changing as delivery increases overall in the market?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. I think, look, DPG is a public company, so I think getting into the specifics, we will always let them kind of talk about the real specifics there. But I guess what I would say is we're confident in their ability to manage through that and in terms of the share of voice, the pizza category in 2016 had exactly half of the share of voice on delivered foods. So if you look at Domino's and Pizza Hut and Papa John's in the UK in 2016, collectively we spent exactly the same amount on advertising that Deliveroo did and Just Eat and some of the others and that's a change. So I'll let them kind of answer around the specifics on pressure on hiring drivers. There is certainly some, but I think it's very manageable. But the advertising one is interesting. We don't know that it's having an effect, but it's certainly something that we're watching.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you so much.
Operator: And this concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I now turn the call back over to the presenters for their closing remarks.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you all for your interest in getting on the call, and we look forward to discussing our third quarter results with you on October 12.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Michelle and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Tim McIntyre, you may begin your conference.
Timothy P. McIntyre - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Michelle, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings call. As you know, this call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others be in a listen-only mode. I also refer you to our Safe Harbor statement that is in this morning's 8-K release in the event that any forward-looking statements are made this morning. Today, we will start with prepared comments from our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence, and our Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Doyle, followed by your questions. And with that, I'd like to introduce Jeff Lawrence.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, our positive global brand momentum continued as we once again delivered strong results for our shareholders. We continue to lead the broader restaurant industry with 24 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 93 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continued to increase our store count at a healthy pace, which we believe is more evidenced that our brand is strong and growing. Our diluted earnings per share was $1.26, which is an increase of 41.6% over the prior year quarter. This increase resulted from outstanding operational results, as well as our adoption of a new accounting standard, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for quarter one. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 13.2% in the quarter. When excluding the impact of FX, global retail sales grew by 15.2%. The drivers of this retail sales growth included strong domestic same-store sales, which grew by 10.2% in the quarter. Our U.S. franchise business was up 9.8%, while our company-owned stores were up 14.1%. Both of these comp increases were driven by order count or traffic growth as consumers continue to respond very positively to the overall brand experience we offer them. Our Piece of the Pie loyalty program continues to contribute significantly to our traffic gains, while overall ticket decreased slightly during the quarter. On the unit comp front, we are pleased to report that we opened 28 net domestic stores in the first quarter, consisting of 29 store openings and 1 closure. Our international division had another solid quarter as same-store sales grew 4.3%, lapping a prior-year increase of 7.9%. Our international division also added 161 net new stores during Q1, comprised of 175 store openings and 14 closures. On a total company basis, we opened 189 net new stores in the first quarter. Turning to revenues. Total revenues were up 15.8% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of increased global comps and store count growth, which drove higher supply chain volumes. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $1.5 million versus the prior-year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies including the British pound. For the full fiscal year, we continue to estimate that foreign currency could have an $8 million to $12 million negative year-over-year impact on pre-tax earnings and as you know, there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rate which does make this a harder part of our business to predict. Moving on to operating margin, as a percentage of revenue, consolidated operating margin for the quarter was flat at 31.0%. The operating margin in our company-owned stores decreased to 23.2% from 24.6%, driven primarily by higher transaction-related expenses, higher food and labor and a slightly lower ticket. Lower occupancy expenses as a percent of sales benefited the operating margin and partially offset these decreases. Supply chain operating margin increased to 11.7% from 10.9%. The primary drivers of this increase, when compared to the prior year quarter, were lower food cost and to a lesser extent a leveraging impact of higher volumes, offset impart by increased labor and delivery costs. There was a very strong domestic volume growth this quarter and even stronger volume growth in Canada. Market basket commodity costs to stores increased slightly this quarter. We continue to estimate at the domestic stores commodity costs will range from flat to up 2% in 2017 from 2016 levels. Before we leave operating margin, I'd like to also note that franchisees in the U.S. continue to share in our success with record supply chain profit sharing checks that they have earned alongside of us with great execution and performance. As I've mentioned before, we expect to make additional investments in supply chain in the near-to-medium term to keep up with our rapid growth. Let's now shift to G&A. G&A increased by $9.3 million in the first quarter versus the prior quarter, driven primarily by three factors. First, our planned investment in technology, predominantly in e-commerce and other technological initiatives and the teams that support them. Please note that these investments are partially offset by fees that we received for digital transactions from our franchisees which I recorded as franchise revenues. Second, our strong performance like the higher performance-based compensation expense and third, higher advertising expenses at our company-owned stores which increased as a result of our positive sales growth. Moving down the income statement, interest expense decreased slightly in the first quarter and our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.6%. Our reported effective tax rate was 31% for the quarter. As previously communicated, we adapted a new accounting standard this quarter which requires us to record the excess tax benefit and equity-based compensation as a reduction to our income tax provision on the P&L. Previously, these tax benefits were recognized directly in the equity statement. As a result of this new standard, there was a $6.5 million decrease in our first quarter 2017 provision for income taxes which resulted in a 7.2 percentage point decrease in the first quarter 2017 effective tax rate. Again, the economics have not changed, just the way we are required to present it. The 2016 amount has not been reclassified to match this presentation. We expect that we will continue to see volatility in our effective tax rate because of this accounting standard change and, as such, we'll not be giving further guidance on our expected future effective tax rates. To give you a sense of the magnitude of the potential future tax benefit, I'll direct you to our equity incentive plan footnote in our 10-K. This will give you the intrinsic value of outstanding options at the year-end 2016 stock price. When multiplied by our tax rate, this gives a then current approximation of the excess tax benefit amount that could be recognized in future periods. I'll remind you that this number will change based on the stock price and option and share activity, but we do expect to see a continued future benefit from the adoption of this accounting standard. When you add it all up, our first quarter net income was up $17 million or 37.4%. Our first quarter diluted EPS was $1.26 versus $0.89 last year, which was a 41.6% increase. Here is how that $0.37 increase breaks down. Our lower effective tax rate positively impacted us by $0.12, including the $0.13 impact from the adoption of the new equity-based compensation accounting standard. Our lower interest expense positively impacted us by $0.01. Lower diluted share count, primarily as a result of share repurchases, benefited us by $0.04. Foreign currency exchange rate negatively impacted royalty revenues by $0.02, and most importantly our improved operating result benefited us by $0.22. Now, turning to our use of cash. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 80,000 shares for $12.7 million at an average purchase price of approximately $158 per share. During the first quarter, we also made $9.6 million of required principal payments on our long-term debt. Our quarterly dividend of $0.46 a share totaling $22.1 million was paid to our shareholders after the first quarter ended. As always, we will continue to evaluate the most effective and efficient capital structure for our business, as well as the best ways to deploy our excess cash to the benefit of our shareholders. All in all, our fantastic momentum continued, and we are very pleased with our results this quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I am very pleased at another outstanding quarter and a terrific start to 2017. Our franchisees and operators worldwide continued stepping up to the challenge of sustained success, and I wake up each day proud to be a part of a brand and culture that is truly inspiring, one that keeps us looking forward at how we can and must improve every day. We have an uncommon passion for what we do, and our performance during the first quarter certainly demonstrated that yet again. As we discussed at our Investor Day, our performance is the result of many years of reshaping our brands, improving our food, investing in our digital capabilities, reinvesting in our stores, and most importantly, building a team of the best people in the restaurant industry, both working for our company and throughout our global franchise system. Our story is one of a true long game approach, riddled with difficult decisions, reset priorities, and smart risks, which, while they took time to bear fruit, eventually reshaped our brand and system. I say all of this because we are often asked about which specific activities are driving our near-term success. And while our great analytics give us many of the answers, we know that the cumulative effect of a lot of long-term decisions over many years is what is ultimately driving our success. Our near-term success is the result of decisions and investments made three, five, or 10 years ago by our franchisees and by the company. It's that commitment to the long term, combined with great short-term execution for our customers, that makes me so proud of our team, our 800 outstanding franchisees in the U.S., and our master franchisees and team members around the world. And it's the investments we're all making in new stores, better food, better digital and stronger teams that will ensure our results continue to be strong in the coming years. Our performance in the U.S. just continues to impress me. Our 24th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth also marks another impressive figure. Eight of our last 10 quarters resulted in double-digit sales growth domestically. But, as I just said, what impresses me the most is not what we've done, but how we've done it: through consistent strategy, a research, disciplined approach and constant focus on long-term fundamentals rather than seeing things in a short-term, quarter-by-quarter way. I'm incredibly pleased our franchisees, corporate operators and team members have shown such phenomenal alignment. We opened 28 net new stores in the first quarter, a nice start as we continue to focus on this opportunity within our business. I continue to be pleased with our domestic store growth momentum and the commitment our franchisees and internal team has shown. They are more focused as a team on growing our system than I've seen in many years. One of the areas we focused on domestically during the first quarter was technology, as our digital leadership continues to strengthen. We are in the midst of a national ad campaign revisiting something in our back catalog of innovation that is no less to this day a fan-favorite, Domino's Tracker. This is very cool. It's one of our foundational innovations and was our breakthrough hit with customers. It helped demonstrate our forward-thinking approach early on as it was initially developed and launched back in early 2009. And for those of you who have seen the commercial and think I might now drop my favorite Ferris Bueller line on today's call, not going to happen. But with that, it's a great ad and nice to have some fun with our digital fans and customers while revisiting a pioneering piece of technology, first delivered by Domino's last decade. We also continue to raise awareness for our Piece of the Pie Rewards loyalty program and recently held our first Loyalty Member Appreciation Week, offering double points to our digital rewards program members for a weeklong time period earlier this month. The simplicity of this program continues to be very well-received by customers, and the focus on driving frequency continued to be a meaningful contributor to sales performance during the first quarter. And lastly on the technology front, we introduced the latest in a new wave of anywhere ordering platform innovation, the ability to start and complete a new order from scratch without the need for a profile or saved Easy Order. Customers can now order this way through Facebook Messenger and Google Home, with more to come. This is very exciting. It's the next major step in the evolution of our ever-growing suite of unique and forward-thinking ordering platforms, which continue to be unmatched within our competitive space. Our international performance in the first quarter was solid, facing a strong sales comparison from the year prior. The best international model in QSR continued to show its strength, with our diverse portfolio of over 85 markets and growth potential that continued into the first quarter with 161 net new store openings. We also had a very exciting event earlier this month, celebrating the opening of our 14,000th store worldwide in Cyberjaya, Malaysia which was only eight months after cutting the ribbon on our 13,000th location. This demonstrates our continued runway for growth within our international geographies, both new and existing, in developed and emerging markets. We have now reached 93 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales in our international business, a streak that continues to amaze me. Our store reimaging program, Domino's PULSE and global online ordering implementation, are all on track with where we expect. And the long-term opportunity for this rock solid business segment continues to be very strong. In closing, our momentum continued into the first quarter, and 2017 is off to a tremendous start. Our long-term approach continued to pay off and our reliable fundamentals continue to drive what we do and how we do it. I'm grateful to once again report positively on and represent a global franchisee base that is second to none and a system that has truly never been more aligned on our goal of sustaining success as 2017 continues. We know this is earned and are more motivated than ever to continue to achieve it. Thanks, and I'll now open it up for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Please ask your question, sir.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Just one quick question on the supply chain margins and not necessarily the margin percentage but the margin dollars, I think up 24% this quarter. I guess what's driving that, and I guess when is the investment coming? I guess, should we be thinking about that as a near-term headwind or maybe in the next year? Or I guess what's the timing on when you might reinvest there?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: You're going to see investment this year and as we expand the capacity. So, yeah, that's coming soon. The primary driver of growth in supply chain was volume growth. And remember, not only are we having terrific top growth domestically and in Canada, it was actually even stronger in Canada than in the U.S. It is all order growth. And on top of that, you've got store growth coming out. So if you look at total kind of pounds of foods sold through our supply chain, there are a lot of factors that are playing in there to pretty tremendous growth in food shipped out to the stores.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. But I guess my question is like it's – a 24% growth if the comps were 10% and the units were up low-to-mid single digits. I guess there must be – are you signing on more franchisees? I guess, what's the delta there?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No. I mean, that's – you're doing the math and add on some for Canada as well, and overall, it's about scale. And with that kind of volume going through, they're just efficiencies that are coming with it, and it was a very, very strong quarter.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Please ask your question, sir.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Great. Thank you. On your international franchise revenue, the way that we look at that is we do a revenue build and we look at the comp and the unit growth and then we adjust for the FX. And there's always a little bit of delta there that's usually changing royalty or new unit productivity. Delta was pretty big this quarter. Do you know what drove that in this quarter? Did you just open the stores up later in the quarter and that you didn't get the list from that or the revenues from that or did something else happen?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. When you kind of do – this is Jeff. When you kind of do that rough math, Matt, you've obviously got the royalty contractual rates which really haven't changed the bunch. I think the one thing you need to remember though is you have $250,000 or so conversions that we've got done in 2016 that are rolling through. And again, as we share in the investment upfront as those guys invest in the brand and change at all their leaseholds, we do typically provide some royalty relief there for the first year to two years depending on kind of their performance. And then, the other stuff we have rolling around in there in some of the global online ordering platform revenue. So as those two things kind of – both kind of ebb and flow quarter-over-quarter, you may see some movements in that rough math.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Got it. Thank you. On the store level margin, in the Q, you broke out the big buckets of what moved that margin around the quarter. And this quarter, the drag was from food and the transaction expense. We don't have every line item, but when I kind of bucket all the other stuff that's in there, it looked like it grew at around the rate of sales growth. So, the question is that, given most of the other things that you're having there, tend to be fixed like rent and zone and utilities, why didn't you get more leverage on that line item with the 14% comp? Was there something else in there that it increased at a faster pace?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think you mentioned transaction-related expenses, that's some of the charge-backs we talked about. Obviously, credit card usage continues to go up. You're going to get a little bit there. On the food side, specifically, we did have a little bit of a lower ticket as we've been running really effective marketing and advertising, both looking after our delivery business. But also ever increasingly, our fantastic carryout business which does have a little bit of a lower ticket, you're getting a little bit of a math problem there, playing with the percentages as well. What I would point though, too, is that's a really good thing to have because we're really growing carryout and delivery still at a very healthy pace. But because you have different amounts of food in those baskets, because you have different ticket, you can play around a little bit with the percentages but to us, as we look at that, it's good news. But what I can tell you is if the food is not going up as a percentage because of waste or ineffectiveness in the stores, it's really more of a math problem.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer. Please ask your question.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Back to the supply chain. Obviously, something happened there where it really flexed. It's mostly on the profits, more so than it has, I think, in recent high-volume growth quarters. So just trying to think about that going forward, you talked about the investments coming for that, that part of the business to keep up with the volume growth. Are you able at all to put some guardrails around what the expense magnitude may be as you kind of expand the capacity there? I mean, I know it's going to come with some CapEx. But as far as the fixed costs that come into that business, so we can kind of think about how to model that business going forward.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, Brian. It's Jeff. I mean, again, just to reiterate what Patrick said, I mean, first and foremost, this is about healthy volume growth in the U.S. business and Canada. Again, we do deliver food to all of our franchisees in Canada as well, and they actually grew, hard to believe, but actually grew faster than the U.S. business in Q1. On the CapEx side, the supply chain stuff is really baked into the $75 million estimate, I gave you all in January at Investor Day. And again, that can flex. Depending on how fast we grow our brand and the additional capacity we think we need to grow over time, we are going to make those investments, whether it's a little bit more or a little bit less than the current estimate. So there's still some to play out there, but our supply chain team is zeroed in on the investments that they need to make to continue with the impressive growth of the brand and again, it's about volume growth. And I did mention in my prepared remarks, we have a unique setup here at Domino's where we share 50% of our profits in our supply chain system. As our franchisees in the U.S. and Canada continue to execute at just a phenomenal rate and pace, they share $0.50 out of every dollar that we make through that system. So we really like that alignment, we love that they're winning with us, with profits here. And as I mentioned, their profit sharing checks are at an all-time record high right now. So it's on us to get these capacity investments made. We've zeroed in on them and we will be swinging hammers very shortly here.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah, the profit sharing agreement is working out well for them. And then I just had one more question, obviously, we're in the business of trying to project your business going forward and being on the outside looking in, I was wondering if you guys could shed light on how you think about the core trend internally. Do you guys kind of think about things on a three-year basis when you talk about the business going forward or is it some other way? And that's not me, that's not me trying to get the comp out of you. I'm just literally wondering because it's been such an incredible cycle here of same-store sales. I'm just wondering if there is a certain way you guys kind of look at that internally that cycle.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No. I think, Brian, that the real answer is kind of in the set up I was giving which is we made a decision a number of years back now that we were going to look at the long term on this business fundamentally, exclusively. And that is something that you can only do obviously if the near term is working. But our view is that if you keep your eyes up on the long term, if you're looking out three to five years on the business and you're making investments on that kind of a time horizon, a lot of the competition out there, frankly, doesn't look at things that way. And so, we do that and obviously at some point, if you're doing that right, the short-term gets better and gets easier, and kind of starts taking care of itself and that's what we've been seeing. What I would reiterate for you is that on both our domestic and international business, when we look out in kind of the medium term, we have guided you to 3% to 6% comps for both the domestic and international business. And so that's when we look out, that's where we think it's going to be, kind of over the medium term, we're right in the middle of that range with our international business and we're clearly still well above that range on the domestic business. But in terms of looking at the one year, two-year stacks, three-year stacks, sure, of course, we're looking at those. But at the end of the day, our focus is on how do we continue to make this a better experience for our customers next year than it was this year. And while we have done some new product launches, we always try to remind ourselves that the typical customer orders kind of their favorite pizza on an ongoing basis. And so, if somebody is a pepperoni pizza customer, how are we going to make that experience better for them next year than it is this year, that's what's ultimately going to drive growth in the business.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for that.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. One quick housekeeping question. In the international unit growth number this quarter, how many of those were conversions?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: A real small number. We didn't disclose it but it's not at the rate and pace that we saw in 2016 as we told you we expected.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. And remember, Karen, what we did talk about is the fact that that process is done in South Africa, it's done in Germany. So the only place where there was a little bit of activity was in France. We have disclosed that there is a smaller chain in Norway may get converted, but that activity is basically in the rear-view mirror as of the end of 2016. There will be a little bit but in 2017, that's going to be a relatively immaterial part of the overall growth.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then on the store margin side of things, the increase in transaction fees – which we really started to see that sort of spike last year. Is there any piece of that that's tied to regulations around the world of chip and PIN technology, where that growth rate might sort of moderate a little bit once we start lapping that?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, Karen, it's Jeff. We have the EMV readers in our 400 corporate stores in the U.S. With that obviously and, being such a digital presence to the extent that there is any transactional-related expenses on chargebacks, you can see that exacerbate a little bit, particularly in some of the urban markets that we are in. We are seeing that. It is a challenge for us. But we've got resources dedicated against it to try to manage it the best we can. The other thing buried in transaction-related expense increase is the fact that more and more customers are choosing to use credit cards with us over time, as you would expect with most QSR folks that have a digital presence. So a little bit of both of those things. On the credit card side, we're happy to take those as payment from our customers if that's what convenient for them. I would expect that trend to kind of continue most likely. On the chargeback side, it's an area of opportunity for us.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: And, Karen, the only thing I would add is, and you've been reading probably the same things we've been reading on, it is the consensus seems to be that as EMV readers rolled out in the U.S., they saw the same thing happen in the U.S. as happened in Europe, which was fraud levels did not change. They just shifted from retail to online. And our experience is that that assessment looks correct.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, and then if you look at just given that – your digital presence and the amount of orders that go through the website and increasingly through the rewards program, looking at other restaurants that have pretty dominating digital presences, are there opportunities to work around partnerships or create an incentive for stored value that could mitigate just sort of that overall transaction cost over time, either because shifting people to bigger transactions or actually working with a partner that's actually a less expensive processor?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, I guess what I'd tell you, Karen, is that right now, we are primarily focused on how do we drive the fraud out of the transactions on kind of a direct basis. And so all of the other things that you kind of discussed there, but we look at those frankly separately. We're not going to do those things simply because of how they might affect fraud. There would have to be a really good customer reason for – you talked about stored value or some of the other things – for doing that. And yeah, we certainly review partners and looked at the outside kind of fraud prevention groups and are doing some things internally. And I think the answer is, like fraud at retail, it is an ongoing battle and something that we are certainly very much on top of and engaged in and putting resources on, but not something that is likely to go away. It's really going to be something that you just manage on an ongoing basis, and we look forward to the credit card companies looking at technologies that might effectively combat that online.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh of BTIG. Please ask your question.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Great. Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask about the gap in same-store sales between the company and the franchise. It looks like it was about 430 basis points this quarter. Probably one of the widest gaps we've seen since maybe 2008. So can you just talk a little bit about what's going on there and what are the reasons behind that, such a wide gap versus previously?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, Pete. It's Jeff. One thing I think, and again – not that we're proposing you use a two-year stack or a three-year stack any better than any other stack. But if you look at a two-year stack, the gap between franchise and our 400 corporate stores isn't as wide. The other thing, I think, though that's probably driving some of that is, our team USA corporate store footprint skews a little bit more urban on average than all of our other franchise stores in the U.S. and as a result of the fact that our company-owned stores were really adopters of digital and online a little bit quicker than our franchise stores, years and years ago. You're seeing a little bit more digital mix in our corporate stores, which means that the impact of loyalty and the tailwind we're getting from that is a little bit more as well. So I think it's all those of things kind of put together. But listen, geographically, regionally, our franchisees are doing well, our corporate stores are doing well, and that's not a gap that we're concerned about.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Great. And then just want to ask about the advertising spend. I think Patrick mentioned eight of the last 10 quarters you had double-digit comps. We assume the ad budget's growing pretty significantly. So where are the incremental dollars on the advertising side being spent?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. Really the answer is across the board. We continue to get a great return on television, and our television spend is up but we're also finding great places to spend it on digital and that continues to grow as well. So it really has been across the board.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Please ask your questions.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. Just first just a follow-up, you mentioned check was lower in the corporate stores and transactions were higher and you cited take-out mix for example. Is that true system-wide too that transactions would have exceeded the 10% comp?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. So both the corporate stores and the franchise business driven by traffic ticket in both, just slightly down.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then there was just some chatter this quarter about progression of sales in the industry being softer in some months versus others. Did you see that variation or were the sales pretty stable across the quarter?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. We're not going to get into the mix within the quarter. I think as you're used to it, that's kind of our standard approach.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then my follow-up question is the day when GrubHub reports a very strong user, up significantly – this conversation about how people trade different kind of delivery services now. If you're looking for evidence that Domino's wasn't really vulnerable to that, could you play to those company store comps you said they were in urban markets and I don't know which urban markets they are. But that's typically where these delivery services are strongest. I mean, is that a good piece of evidence in your mind that other delivery isn't really impacting your business or how do you measure that if it's not?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. John, I think at some level that's true. And I mean, effectively, all of our corporate stores are within areas that would have those services now. There might be a couple that are outside of that. And I guess what I would say is that our answer on this remains the same as it has been before which is to date, we have certainly not seen any evidence that the growth of both aggregators on the digital side or increase in delivery activity has had any effect on our business.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Jeff, just one – I'm sorry, just one more accounting question. Did the change in the tax rate, did that impact the share kind of the way you calculated share count at all? Is that purely just a tax rate change?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: It primarily runs through the provision line item. There is a small impact that runs through the denominator of the share, but it's very small. And just as a reminder, that $6.5 million running through the provision is real cash. That's the real break that we will get on our taxes when we file them.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Please ask your question.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Just on the delivery side of things, maybe following up to that last question, is there any – I think you've talked about this in the past, but is there any way for you to monetize or take advantage of the ramp-up in delivery that the – or online ordering, perhaps? And you obviously have the expertise from a technology standpoint in online ordering and delivery. Peers would love to get some of that help, whether inside or I'm guessing more like the outside of the restaurant industry. I'm not sure whether that's ever an option or something that you'd ever consider to outsource some of your skill sets to those that could use it if it wasn't a competitive intrusion to you?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. You are right in all of your assumptions, and there are those in the industry who have thought that we might be a great partner on those. And our answer has continued to be and remain that the competitive advantage that we've created in digital and in delivery is something that we're going to use to grow the Domino's brand. And I guess, the only thing I would say on that is that if our share of the business were double or triple what it is today, I suppose you might think about that a little differently. But when you're sitting, selling one in six pizzas or one in seven pizzas in the U.S., there's an awful lot of growth for us in sticking to our knitting, and I think our results are kind of evidence that the potential distraction of doing it for others is not a risk really worth taking.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. I figured – I'm sure these discussions have been had before. And then just a follow on to that earlier question regarding these third-party services. I mean, despite the outsized U.S. company you're putting up, it doesn't seem to be having a negative impact on you, are there any signs of the small- and mid-sized players are starting to capitalize on the third-party online and delivery options, maybe just growing their own share and just demonstrated that the overall pizza category is even growing faster than it has been before? Again, seeing that it's not necessarily having an impact on you, but how do you gauge these small- and mid-sized players maybe starting to capitalize on that even if it's not as profitable for their bottom line?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. I think what I would say is you're seeing a lot of people experimenting with it right now and learning about it and trying some of the different services, both on the aggregator side and on the delivery side. But I don't know that I have seen evidence that it's changing the trajectory of anybody's business at this point.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And just lastly, just to clarify the tax discussions and I know you say you're not going to give guidance going forward for an effective tax rate. But is there any reason that it wouldn't be a benefit through all four quarters of 2017? Obviously, it could be two different magnitudes but just trying to figure out whether we should be stripping something like that out or whether there's some reason why next quarter to be totally different and therefore, we should look at each quarter kind of independently?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: So Jeff, the answer is these effects are going to happen based on when people exercise stock options. And so it is only predictable if you can predict when people are going to choose to exercise their options. The only thing that I would say that will maybe help on that is when you look at our K, it does give you a sense of under the equity incentive plans, it gives you a sense of kind of the average life left on those options. And so you're going to have some sense but people can leave the organization, people can decide they're going to exercise early or later, that's why it's going to fluctuate. I mean our tax rate is clearly going to move around. But short-term predictability on that is not going to be easy.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump of Longbow Research. And please be reminded to limit your questions to give way to other participants. Please ask your question, sir.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Good morning.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Good morning, Alton.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I just had actually two quick questions. First off, on unit growth here domestically, up, about 3.5% versus last year. I think that's quite a biggest number I've seen in over 10 years anyway. In the past, you've talked about the opportunity to add 1,000 stores in the U.S., but you've added now almost 200 over just the last five quarters. So is that 1,000 store number still valid even with all stores you have added and just kind of adds up beyond that, or could there be further upside to that down the road?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No. There could be further upside. I mean, we've always said there is at least another thousand. And I think as I've said before, we've been saying there is at least another thousand for a while even as the store count has grown. So we are continuing to see more opportunity for kind of full buildout in the U.S. than we did in the past. And I think there are two things that really play into that. First, as our comps have gone up, as our same-store sales have gone up, it has made more and more stores viable than may have been viable in the past. So as we're able to pull more sales per household out, which has been kind of the primary driver of our comp growth over the course of the last five, seven years, that means necessarily that areas that you may have looked at before and said I'm not sure if the stores are going to work there, now you get more optimistic about that. The other thing I would say is population continues to grow in the U.S., little bit under 1% a year. And so the way I look at it is on our store base, if we're not growing 50 or 60 stores a year, we're not even keeping up with population growth in the U.S. So, yes, we continue to believe that there are at least a thousand more. That number has gone up in terms of what we think the potential is versus the past, and it's something that we're continuing to assess. But in any sort of near- to medium-term basis, we're not seeing real constraints on our ability to continue to grow stores.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Very helpful. Thank you. And then just one quick housekeeping follow-up. A, was there any benefit from the Easter shift in the first quarter, and could that be a headwind for 2Q? And then – and also secondly, if I recall, I think weekday was not included or was not a benefit in first quarter 2016, is that accurate or not?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. I think what I'd say is kind of what we've always consistently said, which is most of those shifts and weather and all of that short-term stuff is just not big enough that it makes that material difference. And so, honestly, we try to not spend a lot of time worrying about that. There will be an individual day where we'll wake up in the morning and our sales will be dramatically up or dramatically down, and our adrenaline has to go down after 30 seconds when we realize, oh, wait, it was Easter a year ago or New Year's Eve or whatever. But overall, particularly if the kind of comps that we're putting up, it just doesn't have a material effect on that growth rate.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. Thanks so much. New Year's Eve. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull of KeyBanc. Please ask your question.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Patrick, would you talk a little about how the system is planning to adjust to menu labeling laws?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. We're going to be compliant next Friday. And our website, all of our digital ordering already is. When you get to the checkout page, the calories are there and listed. And so, we will comply with whatever law is in place next Friday, and currently, it will be in place next Friday.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Is there a significant expense burden associated with doing this for franchisees?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, there is. I mean, for the system and for the franchisees, I mean, you're looking at a few thousand dollars per store that they have to invest in store. And so, our point of view has been and remains that we've been disclosing calories for, I think 12, 13, 14 years now. There is a really good way to do it where our customers are making decisions. 60% of our business is digital now, and that's the best, most efficient place to do it. And if you're calling on the phone, then you're not going to have it there, and the best way to access it if you're calling on the phone, is also going to be online. And so, we think that's the right way to do it. It's the efficient way to do it. And we've had a pretty strong point of view around that, but we will certainly comply with whatever laws are there. And frankly, the cost is really about putting things up in the stores, and we don't think that's going to have any effect. In fact we know, based on having rolled it out a number of years ago in New York, that it doesn't have any effect on customer behavior, because in the store is not where people are ordering, and the range of calories that are posted are frankly not helpful for the customer in making a decision, even if they do line up in the store to place an order.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Matthew DiFrisco of Guggenheim Securities. Please ask your question.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Thank you. I have a two-part same-store sales question. With respect to the comp, I mean, you've had now four years of greater than 5% same-store sales. I wonder, as we might be getting into a period where maybe in the second half, if you were to drop below that sort of level of 5% or so, how do you think the franchisees might respond to that, or is there some change to promotional scheduling or advertising that you might come out? Or is it not that big of a difference to them optically to start to experience that? And then the other thing, I guess, just with respect to same-store sales, you've done a phenomenal job, and a lot of us have asked a lot about what you've seen intra-quarter and versus your peers and everything and versus the new delivery entrants. Is it safe to say that we're still – what's your opinion on how early are we in this trend with delivery? And is this something – maybe in aggregate, it's not bad. There is a reason why people are getting into delivery more because it's trending well. So are we seeing an acceleration? What are you seeing out there as far as the demand for food delivered to homes? Thanks.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Our delivery is up materially. But as Jeff was saying before, our carryout was actually even up a little bit more in the first quarter. So both parts of our business are growing very, very strongly. And I guess what I'd say is this new trend towards food delivery is something that we started three years before I was born, in 1960. And our founder in 1960 was pretty convinced it was a good idea, and he's a smart man and he was correct. Bringing people their food is a really good idea. It is really difficult, and I think people continue to underestimate how difficult it is to do efficiently and give consistent service to your customers. And so stay tuned as people talk about executional issues and margin effect and all the rest of it. Delivery is not easy, and we will see how all this plays out, but we're growing our delivery and our carryout business. And as it relates to the first part, we have determined that our franchisees are happier the faster sales are growing. But we've been producing record profit year over year for a number of years now at the store level. That remains what we believe is one of the most critical metrics for the financial success of a mostly franchise business, and we remain committed to focusing on that hard. And our long-term guidance is 3% to 6%, but certainly we like it even better when we're above that.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC: Excellent. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Please ask your question.
Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. One question and then a follow up on something earlier. I guess, I'll start with the – maybe I'll start with the follow-up, and this is on the idea of sort of value competition, because I know that – it looks like other national players seem to be ceding a lot of ground now. Your long-term view is that it's more consolidating the market and smaller players. But I guess, could you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment? Are you seeing a step up in promotional intensity, or rather is it something that if it happens, you can match that? In the sense that do you think your system is better positioned to offer really good value? Because again, that seems to be a place that you're really winning right now, so competitive intensity and your advantage there? And then I'll have a quick follow-up on the loyalty program, please.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, so I don't see any difference in competitive intensity versus what we've had in the past. We believe that our efficiencies in our system do give us real competitive advantage. And while food costs are pretty benign, you are seeing,- certainly in some markets, some pretty good inflation rate in wages, and a lot of it is healthier, a lot of it is coming in places simply because that's what you've got to pay to staff your stores. So we all have to deal with that. And I think the efficiency that we have and our scale gives us some advantages, and that's been certainly part of the story around why we've been consolidating share.
Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. And then just on the Piece of the Pie, I mean, you mentioned that that's been a big driver and very effective. As you think about lapping that this year, do you envision any changes to it? In particular, it can be very effective at driving ticket if you're still inclined but typically, to do that, you need to reward spend. So, anything as you think about this year or coming years, an evolution of that program that we might see?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Well, certainly nothing that we're going to talk about going forward. What I would say is that we think the simplicity of our program is a real strength in the program and we are always looking at things and testing things, and trying things, and that's part of our process around here. But certainly, nothing that we're going to talk about today or prior to launching it but I would say that we think that simplicity of the program, the ease for customers to understand what they're going to get from us is one of the strengths.
Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Will Slabaugh, Stephens. Please ask your question.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Wanted to dig a little bit more on carryout. I know that's been a focus for you and it sounds like it's driving some pretty strong comps in the current quarters. I was curious with your view on how that's been going versus internal expectations. And in particular, as I think about the sustainability of that business, if you're willing to talk about what percentage of those sales were on deal versus where you thought, and if you feel like you're keeping that carryout customer coming in even when the deal is in front and center?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. We are. I would say that we've been running two messages, we've been running very consistently a carryout message which is not something we have done over a long-term in the past. And so I think the consistency of value that we're giving in carryout has certainly been helping the growth. More stores helps, because people are not willing to go as far as they're willing to let our drivers go to bring them food. And so as we've grown stores, I think that helps our carryout business and the mix of the carryout. And certainly, the reimaging program that we've gone through is going to more directly affect carryout customer than a delivery customer. And so I think there are a number of things that are playing into it.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Will.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe of JPMorgan. Please ask your question.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. The question is really competition for store employees and delivery drivers, in particular. If, even on a very, very local basis, and maybe that's in urban areas, maybe it's not in urban areas where the employment market is getting increasingly tight and a lot of people are just searching for that last-mile driver that maybe has some customer service goals and a well-operated vehicle. So are you guys hearing anything in the system at all in terms of competition for these drivers is getting tougher, whether just availability of drivers or cost of drivers, or quality of drivers relative to maybe what it's been over the past couple of years?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. I think there certainly is, although I would say that I think it is more a result of kind of overall employment levels maybe then that's been really kind of competition for those drivers, at least so far. But for those drivers who are listening to this call, my pitch is you're going to be more consistently busy and receiving tips at Domino's than working somewhere else, and that is ultimately what keeps drivers happy is that they're busy. And the more orders they're getting in an hour, the more tips they're getting in an hour and that's ultimately what's going to make it a good earning proposition for them and they do really well with us. And so that's ultimately how we're able to compete.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And certainly, I understand the tip component. But has there been any change in the relationship at all between the stores and the drivers in terms of a per order fee or maybe what their minimum wage is, what have you, or is the (01:01:27) economic unchanged?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Well, I mean, in a material basis, no. I mean, has there been a sea change in kind of how we approach it? No. But you certainly have seen some wage inflation as I was saying before. Some of it is a result of minimum wage, but some of it is simply because there are areas in the country where employment levels are strong enough that you're going to have to compete not just with other delivery concepts, but with other employment opportunities for those people. And so there certainly has been some wage inflation on average.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And then the final question on delivery, could you update us where you are in terms of GPS tracking with drivers? I think that's in four markets, something that's been you've really successful implemented and this actually reduced delivery times getting to the consumer. But where are we in the U.S. with that?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yes. We have been actively testing that.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. If you're not giving more color, that's fine. All right. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: You bet. That's it for now.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks, guys.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, John.
Operator: There are no further question at this time. Please continue.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: All right. So thanks, everyone. And we look forward to discussing our second quarter results on Thursday, July 20.

Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Jacqueline and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Domino's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2016 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be question-and-answer session. Thank you. Tim McIntyre, you may begin your conference.
Timothy P. McIntyre - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Jacqueline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. Before we begin, all of us at Domino's Pizza want to join the rest of the investor community in acknowledging the loss of Joe Buckley from Bank of America late last year. Joe was a gentleman and a friend to many of us and we will miss him. As you know, this call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others be in a listen-only mode. I also refer you to our Safe Harbor statement that is in both this morning's 8-K release and our 10-K, in the event that any forward-looking statements are made. We'd also like to take a moment to acknowledge and welcome Domino's new General Counsel, Kevin S. Morris, who joined the company on January 2. He's here with us this morning. Our plan today includes prepared comments from our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence; and Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Doyle, followed by your questions. One minor note, our presenters are normally in the same room when we conduct these calls, but they are in different locations this morning, so it might help if you have a question specifically for Jeff or Patrick, to let us know that. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff Lawrence.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We are thrilled to report our results for the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2016. During the quarter, we continued to build on the positive results we posted during the first three quarters of the year, and delivered fantastic results for our shareholders. We continue to lead the broader restaurant industry, with 23 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 92 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continued to increase our store count at a record pace, as we opened nearly 1,300 net new stores in 2016. These factors all contributed to our EPS growing 28.7% over the prior-year quarter adjusted EPS. Before we review more of the numbers, I would like to remind everyone that our fourth quarter result in 2015 included an extra week and the impact of our 2015 recapitalization. Typically, our year consists of three 12 week quarters and a 16 week fourth quarter. But the fourth quarter in 2015 consisted of 17 weeks. These items affected the comparability between our 2016 and 2015 financial results, and is outlined in more detail in our earnings release filed this morning. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for the fourth quarter. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 7% in the quarter. When excluding the impact of foreign currency and the extra week in 2015, global retail sales grew by 18.1%. The drivers of this retail sales growth included strong domestic same-store sales, which grew by 12.2% in the quarter. Broken down, our U.S. franchise business was up 12.1%, while our company-owned stores were up 13.7%. Both of these comp increases were driven by order count or traffic growth, as consumers continue to respond very positively to the overall brand experience we offer them. Our Piece of the Pie loyalty program continues to contribute significantly to our traffic gains, while overall ticket decreased slightly during the quarter. It was the third year in a row that our fourth quarter domestic comp increased double digits. Moving to the unit count front, we are very pleased to report that we opened 98 net domestic stores in the fourth quarter, consisting of 104 store openings and 6 closures. For the full year, we opened 171 net domestic stores. Our International division had another solid quarter, as same-store sales grew 4.3%, lapping a prior year increase of 8.6% and, like the U.S. business, driven mostly by traffic. Our International division also added 461 net new stores during Q4, comprised of 487 store openings and 26 closures. For the full year 2016, we had record international growth of 1,110 net new stores, which did include 254 store conversions. Our international growth continues to be strong and diversified across markets, driven by outstanding unit level economics. When adding domestic and international store growth together, we opened an all-time brand record 1,281 net new stores globally, demonstrating the franchisees' excitement and commitment to our global brand. Turning to revenues, total revenues for the fourth quarter were up $78.3 million or 10.6% from the prior year. When excluding the extra week in 2015, revenues were up 18.5%. This increase was primarily a result of three factors: first, higher supply chain center food volumes, driven by strong U.S. comps and (5:58) store growth; second, higher domestic same-store sales and store count growth resulted in increased royalties from our franchise stores and higher revenues at our company-owned stores; and finally, higher international royalties, again, from increasing store sales and store count growth, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted international royalty revenues by $2.7 million versus the prior year quarter, due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies, primarily the British pound. For the full fiscal year 2016, foreign currency negatively impacted royalty revenues by $8.9 million. Now, moving on to operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter was relatively flat at 31.1%. The operating margin in our corporate stores decreased to 24.8% from 26.5%, driven primarily by higher food cost, higher transaction-related expenses, and increased depreciation expense from our Pizza Theater reimaging program. Lower insurance expenses benefited the operating margin and partially offset these decreases. The supply chain operating margin increased to 11.2% from 10.8%. The primary driver of this increase was also lower insurance expenses versus the prior-year quarter. Commodity cost decreased slightly this quarter and did not have a material impact on the operating margin. Let's now shift to general and administrative expense. G&A increased by $11 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior-year quarter. Excluding the estimated $4.7 million impact of the extra week in 2015, G&A rose by $15.7 million, due primarily to several factors: first, our planned investments in technology, primarily in e-commerce and other technological initiatives and the teams that support them. Please note that these investments are partially offset by fees recorded as revenues that we receive for digital transactions from our franchisees. Second, our strong performance led to higher performance-based compensation expense. And third, higher advertising expenses at are company-owned stores, which increased as a result of our positive sales growth. Moving down the income statement, interest expense decreased by $6.9 million in the fourth quarter, as the prior-year quarter included $7.3 million of charges related to our 2015 recapitalization that did not recur in 2016, as well as an extra week of interest. Our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.6% during the quarter, while our effective reported tax rate was 38% for the quarter. When you add it all up, our fourth quarter net income was up $10 million, or 15.9% as reported. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS as reported was $1.48 versus as reported EPS of $1.18 the prior year, which is a 25.4% increase. When comparing fourth quarter as reported EPS to the prior year as adjusted EPS amount of $1.15 a share, it was an increase of 28.7%. The fourth quarter of 2015 EPS was adjusted for items effecting comparability, which again is detailed in our earnings release. Here is how that $0.33 increase breaks down. Lower diluted share counts, primarily as a result of share repurchases during the year, benefited us by $0.12. Our higher interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.03. Our higher effective tax rate negatively impacted us by $0.04 and FX negatively impacted royalty revenues by $0.03. Most importantly, our improved operating results benefited up by $0.31, which does include $0.02 of a positive impact from the New Year's calendar shift. Now, turning to our use of cash, first and most importantly, we invested nearly $60 million in capital expenditures for the full year, as we continue to aggressively grow our technology capabilities. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased and retired 102,000 shares for $16.4 million, at an average purchase price of approximately $160 per share. During the fourth quarter, we also returned $18.2 million to our shareholders in the form of our quarterly dividend and made $9.6 million of required principal payments on our long-term debt. Over the trailing-12 months, we have returned nearly $375 million to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As always, we will continue to evaluate the most effective and efficient capital structure for our business, as well as the best ways to deploy our excess cash to the benefit of our shareholders. As we look forward to 2017, I'd like to remind you of some information we shared at our Investor Day just in January. We currently project that commodities we use in our U.S. system will be flat to up 2% as compared to 2016 levels. We estimate that foreign currency could have an $8 million to $12 million negative year-over-year impact on royalty revenues in 2017. For general and administrative expense, we expect to increase our investment in e-commerce and technological initiatives, which, please remember, are partially offset by transaction fees we receive. We expect total G&A expense in the range of $340 million to $345 million for 2017. Please do keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down by, among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that affects variable performance-based compensation expense and other costs. In 2017, we expect our gross capital spending to be approximately $75 million, as we will continue to invest capital into our technology and our supply chain capabilities. Overall, our tremendous momentum continued, and we are thrilled with our results this quarter and for the full year. We will remain focused on relentlessly driving the brand forward and providing great value to our shareholders. Thanks again for joining the call today. And with that, I will turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. What a year it was. While our results and performance certainly speak for themselves, when I think about 2016, two things absolutely stand out: first, the global alignment around our steady approach, based on continued fundamental strength and our long-term mentality; and second, the relentless energy and passion demonstrated by our franchisees, team members, and leadership in once again facing the challenge of sustained success head on. I am frankly not completely surprised by this, when keeping in mind who and what we are: true pizza people with an uncommon passion for what we do. Over 90% of our domestic franchisees started as drivers, pizza-makers, and hourly workers in our stores. And this home-grown culture shapes so much of what we do and how we do it. I'm constantly reminded and always proud to see that complacency just isn't a part of our global culture. Instead, we remain mindful that we are a work-in-progress brand. And our constant focus on permanent improvements in the customer experience reminds us to never stop working to be better than we were the day before. Those who joined us for our Investor Day last month heard me talk about how true sustainable competitive advantage takes time. 2016 was an outstanding year, but this is about much more than just a quarter or a single year timeframe. It goes back over a decade, a time period defined by smart disciplined risk, difficult decisions, investing and innovating to win, and always keeping the long-term in mind with every move we've made. It was critical that we think differently about how to have the best food and approach our menu, operations, and new product strategy in new and different ways. It was critical we position ourselves for future technology innovation, which today stands unmatched by anyone in our category. It was critical we take a hard look at our store image, and put a defined plan in place to get it right. And it was critical that we establish the strongest, most mutually-productive and profitable relationship with our franchisees of anyone in the industry. While much of this won't show up in headlines or on a press release, these elements have created the foundation and fundamental strength that continues to drive our success. Our domestic franchisee base has never been stronger. And we certainly had a strong finish to 2016, with phenomenal sales results during the fourth quarter and full year. Our international business completed its 23rd consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth and, in what is becoming a familiar story, another year of amazing store growth. And around the world, on average, we opened a new Domino's store every seven hours in 2016, which is an amazing thing to consider. The business model continued to show its strength, with impressive flow-through to the fourth quarter and full year bottom line. This, coupled with our second consecutive year of double-digit same-store sales in the U.S. and another rock-solid year across the rest of the globe, shows that our global alignment and brand momentum have never been stronger. I used the word phenomenal when describing our domestic business last quarter, and I'm starting to run out of adjectives. So let's go with this. Our fourth quarter was remarkable. It marked our 23rd consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales, and a rather astounding 34% on a three-year annual basis. This truly demonstrates our commitment to sustaining success and is a testament to our long-term steady strategy at work. I couldn't be more proud of our U.S. franchisees and corporate team members for a job incredibly well done in 2016. And on that note, I'm very pleased that our franchisees are reaping the rewards of their hard work. 2016 marked a new record high in our eighth consecutive year of increasing domestic franchisee profitability, with an average of close to $135,000 per store. Store level EBITDA is a figure we care very much about, and is one valuable way to measure health of the business against competitors and the industry, which is why we provide it to you in such a straightforward, transparent manner. Our goal of being number one for customers is matched only by our goal of being number one for franchisees. Healthy unit economics are a key way to ensure this. And it's fair to say this was very much the case again in 2016. Domestic store growth continues to show impressive momentum. We opened 98 net domestic stores during the quarter and 171 net domestic stores for the year, the best in over 15 years. We are nearing completion of our Pizza Theater reimage program and we'll be substantially done by the end of 2017. I remain encouraged by our team's efforts and our domestic franchisee's focus on continuing to invest to grow and win. U.S. store growth is certainly in area of the business with work still to be done, but very much continued in the right direction in 2016. In addition, I'm also very pleased to report that we set another record, one that's very special to me and everyone in our entire system. Domino's participation in the Thanks and Giving campaign raised a record $7.3 million for the kids of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. It was our fifth consecutive record-setting campaign and brought the total money raised since partnering with St. Jude 13 years ago to over $38 million. I sincerely thank our customers and franchisees for their support of this very proud partnership. To wrap up our domestic business, I am confident our people remain focused on the future rather than on the past. But with that said, I offer very deserved congratulations to our U.S. franchisees and corporate team members for a truly outstanding 2016. The accolades certainly don't stop in the U.S., as our international business wrapped up an excellent 2016 with strong sales and outstanding store growth. Our net store growth of 1,110 is the highest in our history and included successful completed conversions in South Africa and Germany. We opened our 8,000th international store, as well as a new market, Sweden, during the fourth quarter. Our recent highlights include both China and Indonesia reaching the 100th store milestone and both Germany and The Netherlands hitting the 200 store mark. In their most recent earnings release, three of our four public master franchisee partners announced double-digit same-store sales growth. Standout markets included Australia, Canada, Brazil and Russia. In the face of some challenging market economics and the highest year-end sales comparisons in our recent history, the best international model in QSR came through once again with a tremendous year. Our master franchisees worldwide are simply getting it done, growing at a rapid pace, executing at high levels and extending the Domino's experience to new neighborhoods and customers throughout the world, each and every day. It is impossible to focus on our results and the importance of innovation, without a few digital highlights. 2016 was another big year, as our digital lead remains unquestioned and our innovative ordering platforms remain unmatched. I am very pleased at the true global expansion of our technologies, platforms and processes. We now have 25 markets using our global online ordering, a program with terrific potential that I continue to be very excited about. And our international markets are at nearly 50% of total sales coming from digital. More than 11,100 total stores are using Domino's PULSE, our proprietary point-of-sale system. And in today's digital landscape, common POS has become a major differentiator. We will continue to take this competitive advantage we have created in the U.S. and grow and implement it across the globe. In the U.S., we reached 60% of sales via digital channels at the end of 2016. And while this is a nice threshold on paper, I continue to reiterate that touting percentages is not what truly tells our digital leadership story. Instead, I urge you to focus on our unyielding commitment to offering the best digital experience possible: direct partnerships with global technology leaders, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook, just to name a few; more ways to order and access the brand than any within our competitive space; and a simple focused digital loyalty program that customers can easily join and even more easily understand. We remain very committed to investing to win and in maintaining this important lead. There's not much else to be said about what was an extraordinary year for Domino's. In closing, I reiterate three things. Our strategy remains consistent. We didn't accomplish success in 2016 by changing course, and we certainly don't plan to now. Fundamentals will lead the way. We will continue to play to win. This means disciplined investments, relentless innovation and continuing to take smart risks. And lastly, we genuinely remain a work in progress brand, always seeking to improve and progress. As much as we are proud of our success, we wake up every morning motivated to improve what we continue to see as a customer experience that can get much better, and we remain as committed to this as ever heading into 2017. Thanks. And I will now open it up for questions.
Operator: Your first question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Congratulations on a wonderful 2016, guys. The question is now that you have a year of hindsight, when you look back at first quarter of 2016 and what happened from there, you accelerated from there and you never looked back. I understand that there are many factors that are contributing to your strong sales results, but you did mention and pointed out the rewards program as a big contributor to more recent success. Do you have any way of fully understanding the magnitude of this impact and anything you can share with us on what that may be?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah Brian. I guess, we're going to repeat what we've said before, which is, it was a significant contributor to our comps in 2016. We do know pretty exactly how much of our comp came from the loyalty program. But we're not going to disclose that for competitive reasons. But what I would reiterate was, it was a significant part of the progress for 2016, but along with a lot of other factors that were going right. But clearly, it worked for us and we continue to be very positive about it.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then, just last question on the carryout business, are you seeing growth, same-store sales growth, in line with the delivery business or faster or slower than the delivery business?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No, it's been pretty consistent across carryout and delivery. And it has grown as a percentage of our business over the last 10 or 15 years. So carryout has, in general, grown a little bit faster than delivery, but when I joined Domino's almost 20 years ago, we were 85% or 90% delivery. It's now more kind of two-thirds, one-third. So over time, our carryout business has grown faster, but more recently, I think they've been growing pretty much at kind of the same pace.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris O'Cull from KeyBanc. Your line is open.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congratulations on a great year. Patrick, we've heard a few of the larger players in the category talk about how sales stepped down in December and have continued to be pretty weak in the first quarter. Is there any evidence that you see that suggests the category has started the year off strong or weaker in sales?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not going to get into this quarter's results, but if you look at a lot of the comments that have been coming out, they were as much about the fourth quarter as they were about kind of what they're seeing early in this year. And not to state the obvious, but with our comps for the fourth quarter, we clearly weren't feeling that. And so we continue to feel pretty good about the category overall through the end of fourth quarter, and I am not going to get into kind of talking about the first quarter, as you're used to us not doing.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: No, that's fair. And then, Patrick, are you seeing anything different among regional players in terms of their ability to compete?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No. No, I think while we clearly grew share overall in the fourth quarter and we may have seen a little bit more of that coming from some of the national players than maybe in the past, we continue to believe that the big story over the medium to long term is, it is very tough to see how a regional player is going to compete against kind of the national players and the strength that we have with our digital platforms. So I think that the overall thesis of kind of the big national players taking share from the regional players continues to be in place. And as I've said before, the great small local player who knows half of their customers and they do a great job, they've got an ability to compete. But if they're not executing well or if it's a regional player trying to figure out how to compete with digital, I think it's very difficult for them.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks, guys.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the – I think Patrick said there is still work left to be done on the domestic unit growth front. And I know that continues to step up. And how are you approaching growing demand from the franchisees to open new stores? Is there a pace of unit growth you're looking to get to or a pace of unit growth that would be too high, I guess, just trying to get a sense for how you're thinking about that stepping up going forward?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. What you've seen, Greg, really is a very consistent upward trend in kind of our net unit growth. And that's certainly something that we hope is going to continue. We continue to see a big opportunity for unit growth in the U.S. As our same-store sales have increased, that only creates more opportunities for more stores to open up over time. So we continue to feel very good about the momentum you're seeing from our domestic store growth. We think there is still a very good runway for growth there. And the one thing that I would highlight, and we talked about this at the Investor Day, is look at the net store growth, but also look at it in kind of its component pieces. And what you'll see is we had a remarkably low number of closures in 2016, which is a reflection of the overall strength of our system right now. So not only are a lot of our franchisees optimistic and they're building more stores and we're seeing an increase in the gross number of openings, you're also seeing an extremely low number of closures. And I think it's important to kind of pull those apart both for us and kind of as you look at the category overall, to kind of understand the relative strength of our system right now.
Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Your line is open
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI: Thank you. You consistently give this industry size data in your 10-K. And this year, it showed the pizza category having the best growth that it's had in about a decade, with carryout taking a lot of share. And I was a little bit surprised to see dining in was up quite a bit. So my question is, is that consistent with what you're seeing from competition in the category with dining in? And do you think that pizza as a category, which had been losing share for a long period of time, is having a renaissance where, as a category, it'll take share back from other formats?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, Matt, this is Jeff. When we think about the industry in the United States, you know, between $35 billion and $40 billion kind of growing low single digits over time, it's still a healthy industry, I think, overall. And when you look at the sub-segments of carryout and delivery versus dine in, we certainly believe that we are in the right two sub-segments of the pizza industry, both carryout and delivery, both different occasions, both different need states, both very profitable places to be in. You know, if we were to start a company today, we would start a company in carryout and delivery, and not in pizza dine in. And so, industry data is industry data. It's the best that we can get, but to me, the health of the overall category is there. Certainly carryout and delivery strength is there, particularly for us as we strive to out-compete the other folks in the industry. And, you know, we're glad we're not in the dine in business.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI: Got it. And my second question is on the international royalty rate. I know that can vary considerably based on the market that you're in, but that slipped a little bit in 2016. Is that a function of the markets that you're growing in today, and does that continue to slip, or should this be roughly at 3% on a go-forward basis?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. So overall, it's going to stay right in that kind of 3% number. It may inflect a little bit based on the mix of the market. Some folks pay a little higher than that. A couple pay a little bit lower, but 3%-ish is the number that you're largely going to see there. The one thing that I would tell you is, as we continue to push the point-of-sale system out globally, and, as Patrick mentioned, we now have 25 markets around the world not named the United States, that we deliver. We will deliver, in the next 24 hours, e-com capabilities to 25 countries around the world. Those digital fee revenues will go into international revenues as well. And so that may have a little bit of a play as you look to calculate kind of a rough royalty rate, but as you think about the contractual rate straight-up for royalties, the answer is, it should stay right around that place. The other thing you have, of course, is the conversion. You had 254 conversions in 2016. Out of the gate, we will generally, on a market-by-market basis, give them a little bit of royalty relief, as they've really put that money into changing the signs and the leaseholds and such. So, it works out for everybody. You're certainly seeing a really high number of those conversions in 2016, and so that also plays into it a little bit as well.
Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore ISI: Okay, great. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens. Your line is open.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, guys. Just considering the industry backdrop, the commodity outlook you gave earlier, and then the fact that it looks like you're continuing to take actually more share from peers, given what we've seen so far, how are you thinking about your aggressiveness around price points, as we look to your messaging for 2017? And do you feel like we're in an environment where you need to actually become more aggressive with the price points to continue to get these types of traffic gains, or do you feel like we've hit at least somewhat of a bottom in the near-term, in terms of where competitors are willing to go?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No, Will, we've been incredibly consistent on our pricing for a number of years now. I mean, you go back four, five, six years, and we've been very, very consistent. So, overall, from a pricing standpoint, I really don't see it any more or less competitive right now within the pizza category than we've seen in the past. And I think you're seeing a very consistent approach to value from us as well. So I think it's a pretty steady-as-it-goes sort of environment from a pricing standpoint.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you. And a quick follow-up, if I could, on menu innovation, and then also kind of the customer and franchisee feedback as it relates to that. You've been very active here in the past few years, and very successfully, so I'm curious sort of what your customer is telling you in terms of, we're wanting more items, and also what the franchisee is saying in terms of, either we have the capacity to do that, or maybe we're sort of hitting a capacity issue at this point?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No. I think what you've seen, Will, is our customers, obviously, just from how they are behaving, which is ultimately more important than even what they're saying, they're saying they're happy with our approach. And you know, what you've seen from us is maybe one new launch a year. They have tended to be permanent additions to our menu, which we think is important. We don't like spending time and energy and training and advertising on things that are going go away shortly after we launch them. And so I think you're going to continue to see that. And our franchisees, based on sales growth, on profit growth, they're clearly very happy with the approach that we're taking as well. And you've even heard that from some of our competitors. I mean, when you roll out new products, it requires focus and effort and training. And so our view is to do that only for things that we think are going to have a material impact on our business. And clearly, it's worked pretty well.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Unknown Speaker: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Greg Holm on (37:52) for Karen today. I was just wondering if you could provide us with a reminder of any calendar shifts to consider for the first quarter, specifically maybe around Easter, whether we should expect any material impact from that?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, the shorter answer is no. There shouldn't be anything material for the Q1 calendar in 2017. It'll be more about how well we execute around the world.
Unknown Speaker: Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Two questions; maybe first, just on the competition from the online aggregators, I know you talked about it at your Investor Day, whether it's – I know you book it as order or delivery aggregators. I'm sure you're closely watching that trend, especially as they go after what seems to be your delivery dominance. I'm just wondering what you look at to assess maybe the success of these third-parties and how you go about protecting your moat, if you do anything different, as you see them start to have some success or whether there's just, at this point, no near-term concern from that perspective. And then I have one follow up.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah Jeff, we continue to watch it very, very carefully. And as we've said at our Investor Day, it frankly has done maybe a bigger sort of an impact outside of the U.S. than inside the U.S. And I would particularly call out China, where the aggregators are very developed, but in the U.S., our share of total digital food orders has been flat to even up. So I'm not talking about the share of our orders that are digital. I am talking about the share of total digital food orders that are going through Domino's. We're continuing to be very, very strong overall. And so near-term, we still have not seen any real impacts. We think the economics of our model and the fact that, frankly, for our franchisees, we are, by far, the best deal in town, we think is part of why we're able to be successful continuing to drive growth with our digital orders and our overall business. So certainly something we're going to continue to watch very carefully, but not something we have seen significantly impact our business yet, particularly in the U.S.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just on the international comp, clearly, it's hard to argue with 92 consecutive quarters of positive comps. And I think, Patrick, you mentioned that three of your four international franchisees noted double-digit comp. I wasn't sure if I heard that right. But we're hearing about others talk about increasing volatility and pressure on the international, whether it's attributed to the macro or, more recently, maybe some political debate or political pushback. And I'm just wondering. Do you hear anything from your franchisees that have you watching the trend more closely or are there any markets where you're seeing a change in trajectory? Just trying to assess the international landscape and I figured you'd have a pretty good look from your view.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. No, I think overall, it's absolutely fine. The comp in the fourth quarter was right in the middle of our long-term guidance that we give and we were rolling over, I think, an 8.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015. So, no, overall I think we're still feeling very good about our international business and really not seeing any particular dislocation outside of the U.S.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great to hear. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from Alton Stump from Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Yeah. Thank you and congrats, once again, a great quarter, guys.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Alton.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I have two questions. First off, on the store growth front, I think you've more interested in the U.S., of course, pick up you're seeing as far as net unit builds was an international jump, that (41:56-42:07) actually I think now for the last six years in a row, has seen the actual pace of growth pick up and a pretty sizeable jump, particularly here in 2016 versus what you guys had seen the last couple of years. Is there any reason to believe that that might slow down at all? Was there anything sort of special, whether it be conversions, et cetera, in 2016 that will not repeat itself in the current year?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. The conversions is the big one. And as we said, there were 254 conversions last year. And that conversion process is done in Germany. It's done in South Africa. There are some left in the conversion that we were doing in France, but still a relatively low number there. And so, mostly those conversions are now in the rearview mirror. So that is a little bit more on kind of the one-time side. And what I would say, though, overall, if you remember from our Investor Day, is we raised our unit guidance globally to 6% to 8%, and that's on a higher base. So overall, we're feeling good about it, but those conversions are going to be more of a one-time event.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Okay, thanks. And then, just quickly on the U.S., I think most of my questions have been answered, but just wanted to ask about the salad launch. You're now a couple quarters into that launch, or a quarter and a half anyway. Just curious sort of what your learnings have been so far, if there may be an opportunity to expand beyond three varieties that you have nationwide currently for the pre-packaged salads.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, so I'm not going to talk about anything we're maybe going to do in the future. But clearly, very happy with the salad launch and the customer reaction, as you could tell from the sales growth was very good.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you, Alton.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. In thinking about the U.S. business, it strikes me that your advertising budget grows ratably with your same-store sales, and that's growing much faster than the industry. So can you give a relative sense of how big your advertising budget domestically is versus peers? And are you still at the point where an incremental dollar spent on advertising is worth it or do you think about other ways to direct that money or salting it away for another period in time, if you don't think it's the case now?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No we're still finding that the return on investment on incremental advertising is very good. Remember that when you look at television, you've seen pretty consistently 5%, 6%, 7% sort of inflation in rates on GRPs and so some of the growth is just being absorbed with kind of the inflation in media overall. We have continued to spend more on digital and get a very good return there as well. So overall, you're absolutely right. I mean, our advertising dollars have continued to grow as our system sales have grown in the U.S., but that's part of what keeps the momentum building on the business. And part of what's contributing to the overall comp is our share of voice continues to increase in the pizza category in the U.S. And you asked kind of where we stand versus others. I think overall right now, we're basically in the same range as Pizza Hut. We are certainly much bigger than anyone else. Measurements on that are not perfect, because as you get down into digital and local advertising spends, you don't know always have kind of perfect visibility on that. But we're basically in the same range as Hut and the two of us are bigger than other folks.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. And then, just the topic of tax refunds has come up many times in the course of retail (46:36) earnings over the last several weeks. And there's been a delay this year, which seems to be catching up. Historically, has the timing of tax refunds impacted your business at all?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: I will be honest. Until I saw people starting to write about it over the course of the last two weeks, I had never even thought about the timing of tax returns. I don't know, Jeff, if you've got anything to add to that.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, in our business, you're more worried about people getting their paycheck every two weeks than you are about a tax refund that happens once a year. So, again, our franchisees are operating at a high level. That's way more important than any of the external stuff.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Alexander Russell Slagle - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Patrick, question with the PULSE POS now in 25 international markets and majority of the international stores, but the percentage of stores on GOLO remaining modest to some of the bigger franchisees that already have their own systems, I mean, what's it's going to take to see a meaningful ramp in the portion of international stores on your global online ordering platform, where you can then get the transaction fee and further fuel the investment?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, so, the first thing, I just want to correct something. You said that PULSE is in 25 markets. PULSE is in the majority of our markets at this point. And so that's the POS system, GOLO, Global Online Ordering, is the digital ordering platform and that's the one that's in 25 markets. We're continuing to add markets. Part of the ramp that you have seen on expenditures on digital ordering in our platforms has been building the team to on-board markets in international. So you're going to continue to see that grow this year and going forward. We think it's a real competitive advantage for those markets, because for the same reason that I say it is difficult for a regional competitor in the U.S. to have their own digital platform. So if you've got 100 or 200 stores, it is very difficult to kind of build your own platform. It is every bit as true for our master franchisees outside of the U.S., so unless they've got real scale. And so look at our big four public master franchisees, who have an awful lot of stores and critical mass, it's debatable whether or not it is wise for them to do it themselves, probably more efficient for us to do it for them. But they certainly have the scale that they can do it well. But for the smaller players, I think you're going to continue to see them come onto our platform.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: The one thing I would add to that is, as Patrick said, we're now at about 80% of our global store base on one point-of-sale system. That is a huge competitive advantage as you think about scaling that technological investment over now what is just a huge, huge number. And that allows you to do the e-com stuff kind of once you get the people on the point-of-sale system. So, not to be understated is a strategy that we pursued coming up on two decades ago, which was to take the long and the hard road on the proprietary point-of-sale system. And so we're very bullish about what that could mean for us going forward for our brand.
Alexander Russell Slagle - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thanks. That's helpful.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you so much. Firstly, just in terms of the technology, the ordering fee, that you charge the U.S. franchisees. I think it's currently $0.21. Obviously, the franchisees get a lot of value for that $0.21. So just kind of want to get your thoughts in terms of potential pricing and how your franchisees would feel about you taking that pricing? So that's the first point. And then secondly, you've guided to G&A 2017 of $340 million to $350 million. A lot of that is going to be technology-oriented. What do you expect to accomplish with that money? Is it just around big data, understanding the customer. Is it going to be customer facing? Does it make store-level operations easier? If you feel okay doing it, talk about what kind of specific tangible return you expect to get from current tech spend, if possible?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. So, John, on the first part of the question around pricing, we are at $0.21 to our franchisees. And our goal is to give the best digital experience to our customers and to our franchisees, and so to have the best digital platform in the restaurant industry, and we want to do it for the best value. So is there an ability, as we make investments, to move pricing? Yes, there is. But what we want to do is create more value for our franchisees than anyone else in the restaurant industry, and to do it for the best possible value.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah. And kind of on your second question, this is Jeff, G&A, we've guided 2017. We only do it a year out, because we're in a dynamic environment, where we want to put investment to work in the places where we think there will be an ROI. Technology could not be more of a focus for us there. That's the big part of why we continue to see that going up. What does it get you? It gets you a little bit of everything. I mean, it gets you a fantastic point-of-sale system; again, now in 80% of our stores worldwide. It allows you to continue to keep up on the consumer-facing, and really to stay ahead and get ahead of the competitors on all the consumer-facing things, our AnyWare platform. We were able, in 2016, to launch things like Facebook Messenger with bot technology. We're really excited about that launch in particular, but that's just one of 16 or 17 ways you can access the brand. And it's also about in-store stuff. So it's about store operations and efficiency. And so technology is permeating our brand, no matter how you look at it. And so we want to continue to invest. The bad news about technology is that it's expensive, but the good news is, it's really expensive. The other guys, a lot of the other guys, just can't compete. And I will go back to the point I made earlier, which is, when you do it with one point-of-sale system, as opposed to three or five or 10, which some other brands run, I cannot tell you how important of an advantage that is. And so, it's really, again, permeating all through the brand. It's consumer-facing. It's in the store, and it's also the analytics. The reason why you see the commercials you see, the reason why you see the promotions you see from us, is because we spend a lot of time rolling through that data. And it's not the TV commercial because Patrick likes it or I like it, it's the one that tested the best. So, it's all areas. We're going to continue to pour gas on it. And we're pretty excited about the possibilities.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Smith from Feltl and Company. Your line is open.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc.: Hi, guys. Just curious in international, I know that you're getting to the end of the conversions. Are there more opportunities internationally, or potentially domestically ,for more conversions?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Yeah, there probably are not any on the domestic side, at least not any of any real scale. I mean, it's always possible we find a little five store group or something somewhere, but that hasn't happened in my memory even, in Domino's. On the international side, there are a few, but it's pretty limited at this point. I mean really, the big constraining factor on conversions is what our footprint looks like, where that potential conversion might be. And as we get bigger and have a stronger footprint in a lot of markets around the world, the opportunity to do that gets smaller and smaller. So, I mean, we had a couple dozen stores, I think maybe 18 stores in Germany before we started the conversion there; obviously, a very, very big market. We had no presence in South Africa. And we had very limited presence in kind of Normandy and Brittany, which is where the French conversion is that we've been doing. So, it really comes down to presence. And, because you've got a delivery area and you've kind of locked down where a store is going to be able to deliver to, if you've got a lot of overlap between your footprint and a potential conversion's footprint, the economics just don't work for doing the conversion. So, there are still a few out there, but certainly what you saw last year, I think, is going to be unusual.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc.: Okay. And then, one quick follow-up; everybody in the industry is certainly focused on labor cost. Can you just give us an update on where you guys are in kind of initiatives to improve labor efficiencies?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Well, that's something that we're constantly working on, as we look at some of the investments that we're making in technology and analytics. And a lot of those things are about efficiency in our stores, finding opportunities for efficiency. But at the end of the day, one of the best ways to deal with any pressure on labor costs is grow your sales. And we've been doing that and there is a lot of efficiency that comes from just simply putting more volume through your stores. And that has a kind of a positive ongoing virtuous circle of effect on the business, which is it allows you to continue to be consistent around the value that you are producing for your customers. It allows you to be able to pay your team members well, so your stores are staffed, so you can give good service, which is going to grow your sales. I mean, it's just the momentum in the business simply gives you a much more flexibility in how you approach and it has clearly been part of the positive effect, is just sales growth themselves allow you to do things to continue to get that sales growth and manage that labor line.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your final question today is from Steve Anderson from Maxim Group. Your line is open.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group LLC: Yes. Thank you. And most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one follow-up question. A few of your peers in the industry have talked about the NFL season having affected sales, not just in pizza but also outside pizza. Have you been able to take a look at some of your weekday or weekend data and see if you've seen any changes in the rate of increase on, say, NFL game days versus the rest of the week?
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: No, no, I mean, the NFL continues to be a great property. We advertise on the NFL. Somehow, that wound up getting an awful lot of press in the fall about ratings, but what I'd tell you is that ratings overall across primetime have continued to be down a little bit. Our Sundays continued to be strong as a category. And we had a great comp in the fourth quarter. So we continue to be very happy with the NFL, how it affects our business. And there was no difference for us in the fourth quarter of last year than we have seen previously.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group LLC: All right. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Okay. Well, if that's the last of the questions, I want to thank everyone for getting on the call today, and we look forward to discussing our first quarter results with you on April 27.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Call. [Operator Instructions]  It is now my pleasure to hand our program over to you, Tim McIntyre, Executive Vice President of Communication, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tim McIntyre: Thank you, Christine, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our third quarter 2016 earnings call. I have enjoyed the opportunity to meet some of you in the past few months. And I am looking forward to seeing many of you at our Annual Investor Day in January. As you know, this call is primarily for our investor audience, so I kindly ask that all members of the media and others be in listen-only mode. I also refer you to our Safe Harbor Statement, that’s in both this morning's press release and the 10-K in the event that any forward-looking statements are made today. Our plan for this morning includes prepared comments from our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence; and Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Doyle, followed by your questions. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Jeff.
Jeff Lawrence: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continue to deliver tremendous same store sales in both our domestic and international businesses, as well as strong bottom line results. U.S. comps grew by 13% and international comps grew by 6.67%. We're thrilled with these results, particularly when you consider that Q3 same-store sales a year-ago in our domestic and international businesses were up 10.5% and 7.7% respectively. We have now had 22 straight quarters of positive U.S. comps and 91 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continue to increase our store count in an impressive rate and have now opened more than 1,100 net new stores over the trailing 12 months. These factors all contributed to our diluted EPS growing 43% over the prior year quarter. With that, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q3. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 14.9% in the quarter. When we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 17.2%. The drivers of this retail sales growth included strong domestic same-store sales, which has I just mentioned grew by 13% in the quarter. Broken down, our U.S franchise business was up 12.9%, while our company-owned stores were up 13.8%. Both of these comp increases were driven by order count or traffic growth as consumers continue to respond positively to the overall brand experience we offer them. Our piece of the pie loyalty program continuous to contribute significantly to our traffic gains while overall ticket was relatively flat during the quarter. Moving to the unit count front, we are very pleased to report that we opened 28 net domestic stores in the third quarter consisting of 36 store openings and 8 closures. Our international division had another great quarter as same-store sales grew by 6.6% and also added 288 net new stores during Q3, comprised of 300 store openings and 12 closures. Our international growth continues to be strong and diversified across markets and we continue to benefit from an increased number of store conversions in select international markets.  Turning to revenues, total revenues for the third quarter were up $82 million or 16.9% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of three factors. First, higher supply chain center food volumes driven by strong U.S comp and store growth. Second, higher domestic same-store sales and store count growth resulted in increased royalties from our franchise stores and higher revenues at our company-owned stores. And finally, higher international royalties again from increased same-store sales and store count growth, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted international royalty revenues this quarter by $1.5 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against certain currencies primarily the British Pound. For the full fiscal year, we now estimate that foreign currency could have a $7 million to $9 million negative year-over-year impact on royalty revenues. As you know, there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rates, which make this a harder part of our business to predict. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 30.7% from 29.3% in the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by positive same store sales, higher supply chain volume and lower insurance expenses. As a reminder, we re recorded a large insurance charge in Q3, 2015 which hurt operating margin last year. The operating margin in our corporate stores increased to 23.5% from 19% driven primarily by lower insurance expenses as I just mentioned. To a lesser extent, increased sales and lower occupancy cost benefited the company owned stores operating margin, while higher transactional related expenses and food cost partially offset these increases.  The supply chain operating margin increased to 11.1% from 10.2%. The primary driver of this increase was also lower insurance expenses. Aside from insurance, higher volumes benefited the supply chain operating margin. Commodity costs were relatively flat this quarter and did not have a material impact on the operating margin. We previously estimated that the commodities we use domestically will be flat up 2% in 2016 from 2015 levels. And now we expect commodities to be relatively flat for the full year 2016.  Let's now shift to G&A. G&A increased by $11.6 million in the third quarter versus the prior year quarter due primarily to three factors. First, our planned investments in technology, primarily in e-commerce and other technological initiatives and the teams that supports them. Please note that these investments are partially offset by fees recorded as revenue that we received for digital transactions from our domestic franchisees and international franchisees. Second, our strong performance led to higher performance based compensation expense. And third, our continued planned investment to support the strong growth of our international business.  Based on our positive performance and our outlook for the rest of the year, we continue estimate that our G&A will be in the range of $305 million to $310 million for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind too, that our G&A expense for the year can vary up or down by among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that affects variable performance based compensation expense. Moving down the income statement, interest expense increased by $5.2 million in the third quarter, primarily as a result of increased net debt from our 2015 recapitalization. Our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.6% during the quarter, down 70 basis points from the prior year quarter.  Our reported effective tax rate was 37.7% for the quarter. We expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the full year. When you add it all up, our third quarter net income was up $9.4 million or nearly 25%. Our third quarter diluted EPS was $0.96 versus $0.67 last year, which was a 43% increase. Here is how that $0.29 increase breaks down. Lower diluted share counts primarily as a result of the accelerated share repurchase program completed in Q1, and our additional share repurchases in the second and third quarters benefited us by $0.12. Our higher interest expense, primarily as a result of our higher debt balance negatively impacted us by $0.06. Foreign currency exchange rate negatively impacted us by $0.02. And most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.25 which does include a $0.06 year-over-year benefit from the Q3, 2015 casualty insurance charge.  Now turning to our use of cash. During the third quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 412,000 shares for $59.7 million, or an average purchase price of approximately $145 per share. During the third quarter, we also returned $18.4 million to our shareholders in the form of our quarterly dividend and made $9.6 million of required principal payments on our long-term debt. Over the trailing 12 months, we have returned more than $950 million to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As always, we will continue to evaluate the most effective and efficient capital structure for our business as well as the best ways to deploy our excess cash to the benefit of our shareholders. Overall, our tremendous momentum continued and we're thrilled with the results this quarter. We will remain laser focused on driving the brand forward and providing great value to our shareholders. Thank you for joining the call today. And now I'll turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Those who joined us for our Investor Day last January heard me talk about our fundamentals, our steady strategy and momentum within the metaphor of 36 blasts, a basic off-tackle football play. The point was a simple one, it is not a flashy play but when executed properly with players fully aware of their roles and responsibilities, it becomes nearly impossible to stop. Instead of short term benefit or trick plays, we went to work years ago to make sure we establish our identity, strengthened our foundation and perfected our fundamentals. If the third quarter is any indication, running this play is continuing to work very well and most importantly greatly benefit our customers.  As I think about the quarter, I continued to be proud of our approach to building success. It would have been easy to shift or over think our strategy and perhaps question our faithful emphasis on long-term fundamentals. By pivoting to a short-term mentality never crossed our mind. Reason being, I have never felt stronger about the momentum of our brand and business. The performance of our outstanding group of franchisees across the globe, our unmatched, relentless meaningful innovation and a team that is never been more energized and aligned.  Our domestic business driven by our US franchisees and corporate store operators continues to reach new heights with outstanding sales results. Our international business did what it does best. By putting another highly impressive quarter of store grown on the scoreboard while matching its 91st consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth. And to add another milestone to the quarter we surpassed the 13,000 store milestone and held the celebration at the Seattle based location in early August.  The business model continued to demonstrate tremendous strength, delivering once again with solid flow through our bottom line. A big part of this is continued, meaningful, responsible investment in the business. And when coupled with an innovative customer experience, terrific food and consistent, reliable value, we are left with the foundation of fundamentals that are dependable as ever across the globe each and everyday.  Our domestic performance was phenomenal in the third quarter. Frankly, I am not quite sure how else to put it. A 22nd consecutive quarter of positive same store sales also marked plus 31% on a three year basis. A figure that demonstrates our commitment to facing the challenge of sustaining success head on. Few have done this better than our US franchisees and corporate team members. And I am very proud of the work they have done to continue to put their customers first. We opened 28 net domestic stores during the quarter and with the tailwinds of record setting unit economics in 2016, excitement around our Pizza Theater reimage and unparallel brand momentum, I am very pleased to see this continuing to track in the right direction.  We added brand new product line with the menu introduced in our new salads with a full national watch campaign which began in mid August. I actually think the current campaign puts it best; this is something that may help the veto vote and offer additional choice on pizza night. Also, it is a terrific addition to the $5.99 mix-and-match menu offer in three choices, classic garden, chicken Caesar chicken apple pecan and remaining consisted with our approach to value.  The digital royalty program continued to perform very well. It is proven to be a strong case study demonstrating the importance of consumer insights, simplicity and implementing the program that through its focus on order counts is consistent with our overall strategy. It is fair to say we are very pleased with where the program stands after a full year in existence. Providing yet another great boost to the momentum created by our domestic leadership, corporate teams and operators and of course an efficient, determined US franchisee based that is second to none.  Stayed on the topic of digital, we launched yet another ordering platform to the expanding AnyWare suite. With ordering via Facebook Messenger available beginning last month. Much the same is our partnerships with Apple and Amazon to name a couple; we seek the partner with leaders within their space. And Facebook clearly remains the largest social network in the US. Between that and an easy order platform that is simple to execute, featuring a box that is actually quite fun, we are very excited to be the first pizza company to deliver this technology to our digital customers and fans.  Our worldwide digital participation keeps ramping up. We continue to increase participation in our global online ordering platform and now have nearly 70% of stores outside the US using Domino's PULSE, a proprietary point of sale system. We continue to take advantage of the master franchisee model by sharing digital best practices and remain committed to technology growth as a true worldwide initiative for the business. I continued to be extremely encouraged by our relentless approach to innovation and our unquestioned lead within a competitive technology space.  And speaking of competitive spaces, our international business once again came through with tremendous store growth during the quarter with 288 net openings, topped off with very solid sales performance. Two of our four public master franchisees are now double digit same store sales increases in their most recent quarters. And we hit a few store milestones including the opening of our 2000th store in Europe with the celebration in Homburg, Germany last month. We also reached 600 stores in Australia, 100 stores in New Zealand and 200 stores in Saudi Arabia during the quarter. Our current conversions are on track in South Africa, France and particularly Germany which is ahead of schedule. As we've noted, it will take some time to see direct revenue impact from these markets. But we have green lights related to the progress, timeline and potential of each market to sooner than later find itself in a strong position to compete.  We come to expect this type of performance from the best international modeling QSR and commend our master franchisees worldwide for once again getting it done.  In summary, the energy and alignment of our entire system continues to amazing. Results are fantastic but beyond that I continue to be most encouraged by the passion and vigor of our franchisees, operators and team members. Getting a lead is one thing, maintaining it is another. And not always an easy task. We remain as determined as ever to build upon our success.  Thanks and we'll now open it up for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America.
Gregory Francfort: Hey guys, congratulations on a good quarter. I just had a couple of questions. One on the food cost line, and I know you guys mentioned in the Q some promotional activities that drove that higher, are those ongoing promotions or is that something specific to the third quarter as we look out?
Jeff Lawrence: So, yes, great question. This is Jeff. In the food line item for corporate stores specifically there definitely have been and will continue to be probably some mix and promotional activity that run through there that may cause us about around a little bit. I think the bigger picture point though is that commodities continue to be fantastic in 2016. And as we trying to look out a little bit certainly at the end of this year we can continue to expect doing pretty flat. But other than that nothing really pushing that market around. 
Gregory Francfort: Got it. Thanks. And then just as I think about domestic store growth, how much of it is being driven by new franchisees versus existing franchisees? And when you look across the market, can you comment on what you think cash-on-cash returns are for some of the independent and small chains? I know you guys have been taking share from them, and I'm just wondering what sort of -- like, you guys are getting low 40% cash-on-cash return and maybe what the average is in the marketplace?
Jeff Lawrence : Sure. Greg, in terms of who is building the stores, it is mostly existing franchisees. In fact, it is really all existing franchisees. We have typically 20 to 25 new franchisees every year but those are people who come up through our system, they are manager before and then typically their first store they wind up buying as opposed to building their first store. So essentially all of the openings are coming from our existing franchisees. In terms of cash on cash returns for others in the category, clearly I don't know in terms of the overall. I guess what I would say is we've been seeing net closures amongst the moms-and-pops for a number of years now, nearly going back to the downturn and that has continued as the category has been consolidating. So my assumption of their closing is those are stores that don't have great cash on cash return. But in terms of the overall averages, honestly I don't know. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co.
Brian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning guys. If you could let analysts become franchisees that would be great too based on these numbers. The numbers are amazing. I'm just trying to better understand the acceleration that you've seen the last few quarters in the US business. As you look at kind of the drivers of your performance internally, how important has the benefits of the loyalty program played in the improving results and just the traction you are getting from that? 
Patrick Doyle : Yes. It is certainly very important and we are not going to break apart the specific component as you would guess for competitive reasons but the quarter was about order count as has been the consistent pattern, we are clearly taking share within the category. But as I said in the comments and as you heard us say it before, this is about getting the fundamentals right. This is about the power of momentum that is causing franchisees to build more stores, increasing the amount of advertising that we are able to do. We continue to with growing scale be able to, with our supply chain folks do a better and better job of buying commodities based on higher volume. So there is just an awful lot of things that are go and right that driving the momentum but most importantly I mean when you put up a 13, I will tell you that you don't go into the year planning a 13 and what I am most proud of within our system is that our franchisees and our store managers handling that kind of volume growth. And doing it well and giving great service to our customers because it isn't easy. And they have done a terrific job of trying to keep up with the volume and only with that kind of execution do you continue the momentum. So hats off to our whole system. 
Brian Bittner: Indeed. Patrick, historically I think you've kind of talked about another 1,000 stores being able to be built in the US. Is that still how you think about the domestic store growth opportunity or has that changed?
Patrick Doyle: You know what I have always said is that I think that there are at least 1,000 more and I continue to believe that's the case. And you are certainly seeing that playing out. And all I would add to that is that as volumes go up and as our shares goes up that only create the opportunity to build even more stores. Because places that might not have been viable become viable as your overall volumes and market share go up. So, yes, we continue to believe that there are 1,000 plus more out there that can be built. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.
Karen Holthouse: Thanks for taking the question. So you had another quarter of accelerating store growth if you look at the overall system. And I guess how should we think about that relative to any visibility you have in the pipeline? Are there timing things that are affecting that? Is you have meaningful ramp-up in the conversion rate/ or is that something that we could think of as manageable or continuable for the foreseeable future? 
Patrick Doyle: Yes. It is a good question. So our long-term guidance has been 5% to 7% and that is still the best number. We certainly feel very good about the growing momentum but one of the important things to keep in mind is we have about 100 conversions in Europe in the third quarter. And so that not something that continues long term. And so there is a little bit of one time in that number on the international side. There are still more to be converted but we are going to see the bulk of that done by the end of this year. And the third quarter was the largest quarter of those conversions. But apart from that you are seeing the base continue to grow as we open the 13,000 in the quarter and so that 5% to 7% range continues to get bigger on absolute store count basis. But so we clearly we feel very, very good about the momentum around store growth. We are particularly excited to see the domestic store growth moving because as we talked about before there were -- they are fundamentally four ways you can grow the business right. Same store sales, domestically and internationally and store growth domestically and internationally. And we have three of those four for quite some time. We now have the fourth part which is nice growth on the domestic side as well. So the momentum there is terrific but there was a little bit of kind of short-term boost from the conversions in the third quarter. 
Karen Holthouse: And then one other question which I will apologize in advance for something that's a little bit more short term in nature, but there's been both in the third quarter and then into the fourth quarter a couple of events between the Olympics, debates that I think folks have been pretty focused on as potentially nights that benefit the pizza players. So just anything you are willing to share on sort of is that something that you think can flow through into additional demand?
Patrick Doyle: I really don't think so. We've looked at that theory hard this year and in the past and events like that as the margin could have an effect but in terms of any real material effect you really -- in our business you really don't have to think about those. They just -- they don't drive enough in any given quarter to really register. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. 
John Glass: Patrick, in the past I remember you saying that there was some seasonality in the business in terms of new users using the brand for the first time in the third quarter in back-to-school, back-to-college. Was that dynamic still in place this quarter? Was it exaggerated this quarter? In other words, are you finding you are getting incrementally even more users than you've ever had before this quarter? Any color around the seasonality particularly this quarter would be helpful.
Patrick Doyle: Yes. So the seasonality is really more into the fourth quarter typically in terms of growth on digital order. So it kind of starts in the fall but most of that just based on when the quarter ends is really hitting in the fourth quarter. So that's a sort of thing that we've very consistently seeing now for five, six, seven years that the ramp up is kind of September to call it January something like that. And then it tends to flatten out as a percentage of sales may even see a slight tick down in the summer. And then you get the ramp up again through the fall. So the real answer is that pattern we wouldn't have seen much of through the third quarter. But we continue to be very happy with the overall growth on the digital side. 
John Glass: Thank you. And then just on the category itself right, most of your gains have come from share gains as you've talked about over time, but how has the category performed? Has it been a tailwind for you now? Maybe ex-Domino's is the category a little better or conversely as we've seen in a lot of restaurants has the category actually decelerated so these gains are even more profound in that context?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I mean I think the category is the pizza category is continuing to be up in the kind of 1% or 2% range something like that. I don't know that we've seen a material change in the overall momentum. But clearly this kind of growth has been far more about share gains than about anything going on in the category. So I think very modest growth in the category though I remind you when you look at overall growth in the category, you are typically going to be looking at maybe 2% ticket growth so modest category growth means fundamentally flat orders with a little bit of ticket. And I think that's what we've kind of continue to see in the category and thankfully we've been able to outperform the category. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton Stump: Good morning and once again great job on the quarter. Just two quick questions. I guess first off on the salad launch, obviously it's very new here, so probably don't have a whole lot of data back on it yet. But just is there any color that you can give us as far as how much of that is coming from ticket as an add-on purchase versus, of course, veto votes being less standard? Anymore color that you could give us on how salads are faring so far.
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Salads are performing very nicely very much in line with what we had projected. It all fits into our $5.99 mix-and-match and as you have seen with the advertising when we launched salads, it was as much about pizza as it was about salads. Salads were -- they only launched in mid August so you are looking at basically one out of three periods for us that has the salads in them. But we are very happy with how they are performing. I think very, very much in line with kind of what we had expected there. 
Alton Stump: Got it. Well, I've had the salads myself and they are shockingly good. So great job.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you. [Multiple Speakers]
Alton Stump: And the one other question real quickly, just as far as US unit count growth was up just over 3% year over year here in third quarter which is a great number. Obviously, you have already got almost 5,200 stores. Is there any reason to think that you guys couldn't hold that kind of 3-ish type of growth number into the foreseeable future in the US?
Patrick Doyle: Well, I guess what it says am I going back to the overall guidance of 5% to 7%. Globally, we certainly like the momentum that we built in the domestic business. I am not going to start kind of pulling together specific projections on international versus domestic but we are very pleased to be getting a nice contribution from the domestic business and with more stores to be built as I was just discussing. There is certainly room for momentum to continue. But we are not kind of giving a specific projection around domestic versus international. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI.
Matt McGinley: Good morning. I have a follow-up on that unit growth comment you made on the US stores. So my question is what is the limiting factor on US store growth among franchisees? I mean these guys have done exceptionally well over the past years with large increases in the NAV and the profit per store has been I think just about a double and yet your growth is around 2% or 3%. You did a little bit better this quarter, but why hasn't that growth rate even accelerated more given the unit economics are looking so much better than they did even five years ago? 
Patrick Doyle: You are tough to satisfy, Matt. 
Matt McGinley: We have to be tough whenever your comp 13 and ticket any minimal those in NAV [Multiple Speakers]
Patrick Doyle: Honestly it is -- I mean clearly the capital is there, the will of our franchisees is there to do it. They are busy right now. And I'll go back to the comment that I made about execution. You do a plus 13 and you are very, very busy just keeping your store staffed and managing your existing stores well. I'll tell you actually remember questions a few years ago when we announced our reimaging program which we are still on track to substantially complete by the end of 2017. But our franchisees are busy running the stores they already have. They have been busy doing reimages on store, the capital is not that constrained at all. But they've also been busy swinging hammers building new stores. And so you got to find real estate, you got to improve through the construction process. So it is not constrained by capital. It is not constrained by return on investment. At some point it becomes constrained by just how many available opportunities there are but that's well off over the horizon for us. And we like the fact that it's been just kind of continually progressing the last few years. The new stores are opening very well. Our franchisees who have been opening on average are very happy with their decision to do that. So I think it is -- the constraining factor is really just the ability to find new the sites and work through the progress. 
Matt McGinley: Got it. Thanks for that. And I had a quick follow up one for Jeff probably on the company-owned transaction-related expense. In the Q you called out about 140 basis point increase to 3% of sales for this transaction-related expense. My first question is what's actually in that 3%? Because if it's just interchange that seems to be a pretty big number as a percentage of sales. And then given that tender is such a small percentage of sales, it's hard to imagine you would've had a mix shift in tender that would have driven that up so much. So I guess what is that and what actually drove that number up so much on the company-owned side?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. Transaction related expenses as we pointed out mostly credit card related. Over time our credit card mix of our sales particularly when you think about the success of our online presence with the profile ability to have a card securely stored continue to push up the credit card mix of our business. Credit card companies don't give us a break the more we actually send their way so that actually is going to increase. And the other thing we are seeing a little bit there are just some charge backs. You get certain locale that have customer base is that basically charged back to the store saying that they didn't get the pizza or things like that. Again certain locations have done a little bit more of thorn in the side than others but it is really a bunch of thing that kind of adds up to move that. At the end of the day, it is couple of points of margin there. But it is up in there, we are focused on particularly around the charge back to make sure we limit those in the stores. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris O'Cull with KeyBanc.
Chris O'Cull: I wanted to follow-up on the increased promotional spend. Jeff, is the increase in promotional spend related primarily to the loyalty program?
Jeff Lawrence: Promotional spend, I think the original question was what impact this promotional activity have on food, and I think with the original question I think we get the call off with. As far as advertising specifically as you can imagine when you do a 13 and our stores contribute about 6% of their sale in the US into the advertising fund, we are not short of cash to chase really good ROI projects right now when it comes to building the brand for marketing promotional activities et cetera so very healthy on the cash flow coming in, the ROIs of where these guys are spending the money. This is the first time in my 20 plus year career in QSR where the marketing guys think like finance guys. And if they don't find the great ROI they won't spend it. But good news for us is they are finding great ROI with the dollars that are in the advertising fund. And again we take that very seriously. Those are 95% plus franchisee money. We need to put those to work in a good way. Not just to build sales, typical profitable sales. So we feel great about the money coming in. We feel great about how we are spending it. And you can't get 13 without getting that part of the business right. 
Chris O'Cull: Should we expect the cost of sales to continue to be impacted by promotional spend as long as commodity prices are down? Or if commodity prices start to inflate do you expect that you will pull back on some of those discounts?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. I think the biggest thing when you think about food as a percentage of sales in corporate store are that commodity has move significantly. You are going to see that move around, right. If the cost of cheese and meat and flour start to go way up, you are going to see that percentage suffer. If it goes the other way, you are going to see a benefit. As far as promotional mix, not is big of an impact possibly. It is really going to be way the commodity is move. And again as we look at commodity 2016 been a really good year for us. We expected to finish out that way. And early looking into 2017, at least based on the independent consensus that we get from economist, at least at this point not appearing to be significant in 2017 either, either way so again it is more about driving the sales. We are less concerned about the percentage, more concerned that corporate stores are making more money than they've ever made even with those little bit of margin bouncing around a little bit. 
Chris O'Cull: But the commodity prices deflated this quarter and your cost of sales went up year-over-year. If commodities start to go up or let's say the cheese prices start to go up for some reason, should we expect the rate of growth in your cost of sales to increase even further?
Jeff Lawrence: No, not significantly. 
Patrick Doyle: And the one thing I'd say is as you know we are one of I think only two largely franchised restaurant companies that talk about our franchisees profitability. They had a terrific year last year and they are going to have a better year this year on overall EBITDA. And we feel very good about how that's trending. So, look, you manage all of it. At the end of the day, you've got to have a compelling offer for your customers and you got to generate a great return for your franchisees on the investments in the stores as long as we are crossing both of those hurdles then we are feeling very pretty good about where we are and we are certainly continuing to see that. So you may see some movement in the components of that, food, labor all the rest of it but our job is to continue to generate strong return on investment for our franchisees. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Slagle with Jefferies.
Alex Slagle: Thanks. I'd like to get some perspective on your carryout business and how your success with the fast-growing digital ordering platform and the rollout of the loyalty program and reimages is driving your carryout business relative to delivery?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. So carryout is continue to do well both are growing. And I think the one thing that we continue to see is the majority of our stores are now reimaged. It is a better experience for our customers than it was in the past. There have been questions in the past about kind of specific return on investment from reimaging store and we've always talked about the fact that any individual store simply reimaging where they are is a 1% or 2% less but their expectation has always been that you are going to see kind of catalytic events as the majority or all of the stores are reimaged. I think we are seeing that. I think part of what's driving our comps right now is that the stores look better as the better environment for carryout customers to walk-into. And that's an important part of our business. We are getting growth on both sides. Delivery is growing, carryout is growing but I think the reimaging is certainly going to have at least a near term more positive impact on the carryout business than it does on the delivery business. 
Alex Slagle: Okay. And then one question on the domestic supply chains. Given the significant volume growth in the last few years, do you see a need to meaningfully expand supply chain capacity and if so when should we see that and to what magnitude?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. We absolutely are going to have to increase capacity in our supply chain. The team, Troy and the team has done a great job kind of keeping up with the volume that has been coming through. But we've talked about this before. There are certainly in the next few years are going to be some increased investments into the supply chain. Volumes are up very dramatically if you go back six, seven years now. And we've been kind of in an ongoing repair and maintenance mode as opposed to a significant capacity increase. We had excess capacity but we are certainly using that up and we think that there is an opportunity to build more capacity which frankly will help efficiency because they are getting busy enough and at some point you are going to be as smooth with operating those supply chain centers as you would have been otherwise. It is a very high class problem. I love trying to figure out how to deal with higher volumes going through our system. But it is up to that we are definitely going to be addressing. 
Operator: Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: Thank you. It's been a little while since we've talked about the digital ordering fees that you charge the franchisees. So I hope you could shed some light on that both in the US and international. I think it was a couple of years ago you took up the fee from $0.17 to $0.21. So I just wanted to see how much flexibility that you had in terms of taking that fee up more and what the franchisees would think about that? And if we could talk about what percentage of the international stores are currently paying the fee and if that is a long-term opportunity? 
Patrick Doyle: Right. So we are still at $0.21 domestically. It's a little bit higher outside of the US just because there are some cost of getting smaller markets up and running on the platform. Today, we have a reasonable number of international markets that are operating I think it's kind of 20 plus countries that are operating on the global online ordering system. Many of those are smaller so it is still a relatively low percentage of the system. The biggest market that on our platform today is Canada. But we've got a lot of markets in the Caribbean, few in the Middle East, South Africa. Some of our newer markets that have been opening. Certainly as that expands more around the world than it has been growing, we have been adding countries to that. It is an opportunity. It is global enable so we've got a system that will operate in multiple markets. So there is an opportunity there that those digital fees will grow just as the number of stores around the world is added to the platform. And in terms of that charge, right now it is at $0.21. Clearly investments that we've been making have been working. As we talked about often, the return on investment on our digital platform has been terrific. You've seen that playing out in our comp growth. We are committed that we are going to generate a good ROI off of that and what good means for the future we will work through but right now we are still at that $0.21 that you call it domestically. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great, thank you very much. Two things. One, Patrick, just you mention in the sustained success and how you don't necessarily plan on a 13% comp when you go into any quarter or year. But maybe on that, are there any hidden challenges that maybe we don't appreciate whether it's capacity in store? I think you touched upon the supply chain or from a labor or guest satisfaction perspective, are there any areas that you get caught off guard when you have this type of volume growth that you are then forced to play defense on?
Patrick Doyle: Not really other than we've already talked about in terms of just the sheer volume. I mean you heard me say before in terms of what I worry about. I wake up everyday and I worry about cyber security and I worry about food safety. Those always have to be top of mind and you are never going to be in a position where you can relax on those things. But in terms of the volume growth and what worries me there, stores that have been doing a terrific job of handling it, we are building more stores which will help any capacity constraint there, the supply chain, we've said we are going to need to invest in but the team has done a great job of kind of keeping up. Our technology folks have to make sure that we got enough capacity and that the pipes are big enough to handle all the volumes that are going through but in general we feel we've been in awfully good shape on those fronts. So we know where those constraints could be and actively have been managing that. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. Then Jeff, just on the return of cash I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks the Board looks at the return pretty regularly in terms of presumably I guess right now the balancing of a dividend and share purchase. But with the stock price appreciation, now the dividend is a modest, right now I guess it's a sub-1% yield. So just wondering is there a target level or what goes on in the boardroom discussions and is it just preferred flexibility of share repurchase over dividend or could in any one year those flip? Or just wondering what the thought process is behind the choices there.
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. I can't tell you everything that goes on in our boardroom, but what I can tell you that we have a very astute board who has been around the long time with us who understand that we are serious about optimizing our capital structure. We will continue to be serious about optimizing our capital structure. And if that provides us with an opportunity to have some excess cash, we trying to roll through with them the different menu options that we have. As you know, we've have a history of really kind of being flexible depending on what's going in the market place both with capital structure choices as well as use of cash choices. We feel good about the choices we've made in the past. Going forward, we are fully flexible; we do have about $925 million of debt which is due in January of 2019 which is par callable without a penalty in July of 2017 next summer. And so again doesn't mean that we are going to hit it. At that point in time we could go early or later but back to use of cash, our board has liked the fact that we've done an ordinary dividend in the past. I can't control the yield obviously; you know the investors control the yield. And so but now listen we are comfortable with the way we spend our cash here and it is going to continue to be a challenge, hopefully going forward if our operators continue to perform the way they have. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.
Peter Saleh: Great, thank you. I just wanted to come back to your philosophy on menu pricing. I think every quarter we are hearing traffic is up pretty dramatically but the check is flat. So are you taking any price and we are seeing maybe mix kind of declining or what's your philosophy and how should we be thinking about pricing going forward? 
Patrick Doyle : Well, ultimately pricing is getting set by our customers. And customers continue to be a little bit cautious as they have been since the recovery. And we've been finding ways that we can create great value for them and continue to accelerate the profitability of our stores. So feel good about kind of the balanced approach that we've taken there. There are certainly over the course of the last few years on average we've seen a little bit of ticket growth. But the majority of our growth has been through orders. We think that's a healthier way to do it. Ultimately the health of the business is going to be driven by order counts and how many people are choosing to do business with you each day. But we've cautiously found ways to get ticket. Remember, ticket is a function both of price but also how much in that basket. And so when you see us launching salads or we launched the marble cookie brownie last year, those sorts of things are allow us to have smart up sales. There can be a way of growing ticket without necessarily taking price. 
Peter Saleh: Got it. And then can I ask on the salads, are the salads, are the gross margin on the salads, are they higher or lower than the overall pizza menu?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Not going to get into the specific on that but we feel very good about where they are and how they are performing. They fit nicely into our $5.99 mix-and-match.
Peter Saleh: And then, lastly, given the store performance, the comps and the EBITDA improvement that are likely coming for this year, are we going to see more of the DXPs or are the franchisees asking to get more of the DXPs in the market?
Patrick Doyle: They are. And kind of our initial run is done. And but there is some demand for more out there. There was a model change and the model that we put it on. So if we are going to do more we actually have to produce new tooling and so I am not sure that we wind up doing that unless there was a lot of demand for more there. We certainly could have our franchisees buy more if they are available today but something we will look at. But I will tell you is customers' love it. I mean for the relatively few number that is out there, the visibility of those cars is terrific and we get an awful lot of comments about them. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Anderson with Maxim Group.
Stephen Anderson: Since has been answered but I do want to ask a broader question about the pizza industry. And you mentioned about the 1% to 2% growth in the broader industry. Do you include fast casual pizza players within that 1% to 2%, and do you see any sign of a potential shakeout in that segment and do you see any lift-off from that?
Patrick Doyle: We do include them in the overall category and the overall category growth US continue to see stores getting built. I don't know that I would call it a shakeout but I am relatively confident that at some point you will see consolidation. There is awful lot of players that decided that it was a good new -- a good idea at roughly the same time. And enough similarity and approach that I wouldn't be surprised that you saw some consolidation at some point. In terms of shakeout, I don't know, I mean that implies closures but I guess what I'd say when you heard me say before which is fast casual pizza to me is really about the idea of a better environment, great food still needs to be fast value, still needs to be there and we are working hard at all of those consumer benefit. And that's why we think we are growing so strongly. So they are out there, they are growing. I just don't view it as a new category. I view it as new competitors who frankly have been taking share from moms-and -pops and regional chain that's simply ever been performing as well. So the overall thesis on the category I think remains the same which is there is limited growth in the category. You are seeing big players take share from smaller players on average. We have thankfully been getting more than our fair share though. We had always like even more than that. In the fast casual players as they referred to, I just think they are people who are doing a nice job with their pizza restaurant and they are taking share from existing players. 
Operator: Our final question comes from Mark Smith with Feltl and Company.
Mark Smith: First, can you just talk about your ability to compete with grocery stores versus maybe the rest of the restaurant industry? And secondly if you can talk about any competition that you see coming from gas stations as we look at Casey's or grocery stores within the pizza category?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Look at the end of the day I suppose anybody who is feeding anybody in the US is competition. As it relates to pizza and frozen pizza or take-and-bake, there is some interplay between our category and those categories but not much. I mean during the time when you saw a lot of growth in frozen, we just couldn't see that it was directly affecting us much if at all. And so the same is true of gas stations, any take-and-bake, it is out there but I am just not so sure that there is that much interplay there. And my view on frozen pizza in particular has always been that I think frozen pizza despite how they try to position themselves, tends to just cannibalize other frozen food as opposed to cannibalizing the fresh pizza category. And so I think despite how they try to position themselves, one more sale of frozen pizza is one less sale of frozen lasagna. And I think that's why you haven't seen the overall frozen category grow much in grocery over the last few years. There was some time when they were adding doors of frozen pizza and that was growing the frozen pizza category. But I don't think you saw a lot of net growth in frozen prepared food overall. So I think that is more a competitive issue within grocery and within the frozen aisles than it is necessarily to the pizza category. 
Operator: Now that concludes our questions for today's call. I'll now turn the program back over for any closing remarks. 
Patrick Doyle: All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day in January. And following that we will be discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results with you on Tuesday, February 28. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining the third quarter 2016 earning conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful afternoon.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim McIntyre. Sir, you may begin.
Tim McIntyre: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our second quarter 2016 earnings call. My first official one. This call is primarily for the investor audience, so we ask that all members of the media and others be in listen-only mode throughout the call. I also refer you to our Safe Harbor Statement, that’s in the press release and the 10-K in the event that any forward-looking statements are made this morning. We will follow the usual procedure of prepared comments from our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence; and CEO, Patrick Doyle. And then we will open it up to your questions. With that, I’d like to kick off the call by introducing our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Lawrence.
Jeff Lawrence: Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, our brand continue to deliver positive results, as we posted strong same-store sales in both our domestic and international businesses. U.S. comps grew by nearly 10% and international comps grew by more than 7%. We're thrilled with these results, particularly when you consider that same-store sales a year-ago were a robust 12.8% and 6.7%, respectively. We have now had 21 straight quarters of positive U.S. comps and 90 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. We also continue to increase our store count at a healthy pace and have now opened more than 1,000 net new stores over the trailing 12 months. All of this outstanding brand momentum helped us grow diluted EPS by 21% over the prior year quarter. With that broad overview, let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q2. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 11.7% in the quarter. When we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 14.3%. The drivers of this retail sales growth include strong domestic same-store sales, which grew by 9.7% in the quarter. Broken down, our U.S franchise business was up 9.8%, while our company-owned stores in the U.S were up 9.1%. Both of these comp increases were driven by traffic or order count growth as consumers continue to respond positively to the overall brand experience we offer them. Our recently launched loyalty program contributed significantly to our traffic gains. Ticket was relatively flat during the quarter. On the unit count front, we are very pleased to report that we opened 29 net domestic stores in the second quarter consisting of 36 store openings and 7 closures. Moving to the international division, they had another very strong quarter as same-store sales grew 7.1% and also added 215 net stores during Q2, comprised of 228 store openings and 13 closures. Our growth continues to be strong and diversified across our international markets. Moving to revenues, total revenues for the second quarter were up $58.7 million or 12% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of three factors. First, higher supply chain center food volumes driven by strong U.S comp and store growth. Second, higher domestic same-store sales and store count growth resulted in increased royalties from our franchise stores and higher revenues at our U.S company-owned stores. And finally, higher international royalties again from increased same-store sales and store count growth, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted international royalty revenues this quarter by $1.8 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against most of our foreign currencies. For the full fiscal year, we continued to estimate that foreign currency could have an $8 million to $12 million negative year-over-year impact on pre-tax earnings, and yet this does include a more recent estimate for the British pound post Brexit vote. As you know, there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rates, which does make this a harder part of our business to predict. Now moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 31.4% from 31.2% in the prior year quarter. Our franchise businesses positively impacted our margin as a greater percentage of our revenues this quarter came from both international and domestic royalties. As a reminder, our royalty income stream have no associated cost of sales. The supply chain operating margin increased to 11.1% for the quarter as higher volumes and lower fuel costs were partially offset by higher labor and insurance expenses. Commodity costs were relatively flat during the quarter, and food cost as a percentage of supply chain revenues decreased in the quarter. We still expect that commodities we use domestically will be largely consistent with our previous estimate of flat to up 2% in 2016 from 2015 levels. Company-owned store operating margin decreased to 24.6% from 25.6%, driven primarily by higher food and insurance expenses, as well as higher transaction related costs. These margin pressures were partially offset by the leveraging of certain expenses from increased sales and lower delivery costs during the quarter. Let's now shift to G&A. G&A increased by $7.7 million in the second quarter versus the prior year quarter due primarily to three factors. First, our planned investments in technology, primarily in e-commerce and other technological initiatives and the teams that support them. Please note that these investments are partially offset by fees that we received for digital and credit card transactions from our franchisees that are not included in this G&A number. Second, we continue to make planned investments to support the very strong growth of our international business. And third, our strong results led to higher performance based compensation expense. Based on our continued positive performance and our outlook for the rest of the year, we now expect that our G&A could be in the range of $305 million to $310 million for the full fiscal year, driven primarily by performance-based expenses and continued strategic investments. Keep in mind too, that our G&A expense for the year can and does vary up or down by among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that affect variable performance based compensation expense. Moving down the income statement, interest expense increased by $6.2 million in the second quarter, primarily as a result of increased net debt from our 2015 recapitalization. Our weighted average borrowing rate was 4.6% during the quarter, which is 70 basis points better than a year-ago. Our reported effective tax rate was 37.4% for the quarter. We expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2016. When you add it all up, our second quarter net income was up $3.4 million or 7.3%. Our second quarter diluted EPS was $0.98 versus $0.81 a year-ago, which was a 21% increase. Here is how that $0.17 increase breaks down. Lower diluted share counts primarily as a result of the accelerated share repurchase program completed in Q1, and our additional share repurchases in Q2 benefited us by $0.11. Higher interest expense, primarily as a result of our higher debt balance negatively impacted us by $0.07. FX negatively impacted us by $0.02. And most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.15. Now turning to the balance sheet, during the second quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.8 million shares for $224 million, or an average purchase price of approximately $121 per share. Subsequent to quarter end, we repurchased an additional 85,000 shares for $11 million, or an average purchase price of approximately $126 per share. As previously disclosed, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company's share repurchase program. As of July 14, we had $214.5 million available under that most recent authorization for future share repurchases. During the quarter, we also returned nearly $19 million to our shareholders in the form of our quarterly dividend, and made $12.4 million of required principal payments on our long-term debt. As always, we will continue to evaluate the most effective means for deploying our excess cash to the benefit of our shareholders. Overall, our positive momentum continued and we're very pleased with our results this quarter. We do not take these results for granted and we're committed to driving the brand forward and providing value to our shareholders. Thanks for your time today. And now I will turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. There's really no shortage of adjectives. Adjectives I could use to describe our second quarter, but I will sum it up as best I can. Our top line performance and proven model once again drove remarkable results. I mentioned last quarter that the culture of our system is one that faces the challenge of sustained success head on and with passion and great energy. I’m very proud of the way our second quarter performance clearly put this on display. It was a tremendous quarter for our domestic business. And our international segment continues to do what it does best. Perform and grow at a high-level as the best international model in QSR. We have now reached 90 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth, a streak that continues to amaze me. And for the first time on a trailing 12 month store growth basis, we surpassed 1,000 net global stores. This milestone took the efforts of both the international growth machine and our resurgent domestic growth to accomplish. I want to give a sincere thanks to our franchisees who just keep getting it done each and every day in the pursuit of from New York to New Delhi, and Istanbul to Brisbane, being number one in their neighborhoods. At our recent worldwide rally events, in Las Vegas, we brought together all time record attendance of over 8,000 franchisees, managers, and team members from across the globe, and their energy was a reminder that the excitement and morale within our system has never been higher. The strength of the Domino's business is evidence and I couldn't be more pleased with the top and bottom line results during the quarter. Our fundamentals and investments in the business have produced a continued sound steady strategy that puts us in an ideal position to execute, and deliver a high quality reliable and innovative experience to our customers worldwide, all at a very reasonable price. Nothing demonstrated this idea of sustaining success better than our domestic business. I am especially proud of this. Our 21st consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales and the efforts of our U.S franchisees and corporate team members including these phenomenal results on the board. Domestic store growth continues to progress in the right direction. Our 29 net domestic store openings was evidence of our solid efforts and is the strongest second quarter we've had in the past decade. Our franchise base has never been more efficient, more profitable, and has never felt stronger that the time to grow within Domino's is now. With record-setting store level EBITDA and unprecedented brand momentum, we clearly share this belief and I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make. Our store reimage initiative is coming along nicely with nearly 60% of total U.S stores now in the pizza theater image. Our stores are looking better, our food and pizza making is on full display, and our people are now at the forefront of the experience. The digital loyalty program had a meaningful positive impact in the second quarter. Our early objectives around simplicity and frequency are being met and while we may be keeping many program metrics close to the best, due to heavy competition within the space, I can say with certainty that the program is meeting the high expectations we had upon its launch. Continuing with digital, we announced something during Q2 that, frankly, I didn't even think was possible, Zero-click Ordering, I admittedly thought five clicks or less was pretty impressive as it was, but our forward thinking digital team as it does so well to things a step further. After linking the Zero-click to your pizza profile, simply open the app and as long as there is no change of heart during the 10 seconds -- before the 10 second timer ends, your easy order is placed without a single tap, swipe, or click. It is yet another creative and inventive ordering platform and an example of the unmatched innovation that continues to shape our branch. Our worldwide digital participation continues to ramp up with 22 international markets now utilizing our global online ordering platform and just over 60% of stores outside of the U.S using Domino's Pulse, our proprietary point-of-sale system. We continue to share best practices with our master franchisees worldwide and remain committed to technology growth as a true worldwide initiative, developing and maintaining digital leadership globally. And on the note of maintaining a global lead, our international business once again performed at a very high-level. It was yet another impressive quarter of same-store sales and we turned in our best ever Q2 to date for international store growth with 215 net store openings. We're making great headway on the conversions in South Africa, France, and Germany, and while it will take some time to see direct revenue impact from these markets, the progress in getting them opened and in a strong position to operate successfully is on track. Our public master franchisees continue to get it done. Alsea and Domino's Pizza group both recently reported double-digit same-store sales increases. Jubilant FoodWorks recently surpassed 1,000 Domino's stores and DPG isn't too far behind in the U.K. We expect the best international model in QSR coupled with the high-level of talent within our master franchise base to continue to be a winning combination. I’m very pleased that once again it produced outstanding results. To summarize, I'm extremely pleased with our second quarter. While our results speak for themselves, I am most proud of the passion and energy demonstrated by our entire system. We continue to deliver results not with the help of catalysts or short-term burst concepts, but truly relying on a model that is proven. Fundamentals that have never been stronger and a team that is never been more aligned. Thanks. And with that, I will open it up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.
Karen Holthouse: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Given the positive metrics around loyalty in the U.S., and you’ve a great track record of sort of exporting digital initiatives from the U.S-international, is there interest from international franchisees to adapt to that program or just copy it for their markets? Are there reasons, either technologically, or socially, that that wouldn't work, as well just thinking about the transferability of that platform?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, Karen, its good question. The answer is absolutely there is interest. The market conditions differ around the world, and so the design of a program might be different in other places around the world based on relative market share and what you're trying to accomplish is as we talked about before, we designed our program to be about frequency to drive order counts and clearly we're feeling very good about that. But one of the things we’ve talked about before and I think are particularly proud of and believe has been a big part of our success is that we do a lot of things in a lot of different parts of the world. We have big master franchisees who are all working on the same issues that we are in the U.S., and so when somebody figure something out somewhere there is very quick best practice sharing around the world. And clearly we're happy with loyalty, clearly we're sharing results, and then markets will make decisions on whether they’re going to launch it. And if they do, when they’re going to launch it, based on kind of the priorities and the list of new initiatives that they want to take in their market and kind of how they're going to prioritize those. But absolutely the success that we're having has been well noted within our system, and it's certainly something that international markets are going to look at.
Karen Holthouse: Great. Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Karen.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.
Brian Bittner: Thanks. Good morning, Patrick and Jeff. I just want to better understand what changed within your domestic business in 2Q versus 1Q because obviously the two-year trend actually accelerated at a time when the industry did the opposite. So, as you see it internally, was loyalty really at the end of the day the primary difference maker here? And if there is anything else you can add outside of loyalty, what you’re seeing impact the business, I appreciate it.
Patrick Doyle: Yes, Brian. I think, first, we’re not going to kind of breakout the components of growth specifically. I mean you know we don't do that. What I would say, has changed on loyalty in the second quarter versus the first quarter is simply the amount of time that we've been able to watch the results, analyze the data coming in. We already talked about in the first quarter that we were seeing good results from loyalty and we're ready to say that, yes, it’s a success. A quarter later, we're just that much more confident that it is absolutely doing what we expected that it was going to do. So, I wouldn't necessarily say that it was a driver of the difference in results between second quarter and first quarter. And I guess the other thing I would say is we were pretty happy with first quarter results also, and we obviously like our second quarter very, very well. But we just feel like the overall momentum in the business is very strong. Lots of good things happen when you got this much momentum, and so we're seeing franchisees getting more and more excited about what's happening here, you're seeing that play through into increasing store growth. It seems as we grow that we've got more advertising dollars to spend as a brand overall. I mean just -- the momentum feeds upon itself. And I think that's really the broadest explanation for the second quarter and kind of the overall results we've had is that it just continues to build the energy in the system, continues to be terrific. I mean, we 8,000 people get in a room in Las Vegas last month from all over the world, virtually every market represented which was by far the largest turnout that we've ever had, and that energy and momentum is contagious.
Brian Bittner: It makes sense. I guess we're six years into that momentum and it's still going.
Patrick Doyle: Yes, exactly.
Brian Bittner: The second and last question, just Jeff, on the G&A, it's about $15 million higher than the last guidance you gave I think. How much of this is just simply additional performance driven incentives and how much of it is incremental actual investments versus the last time you talked to us?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. So, yes great question. I think the most important thing is that we also incorporated into this new guidance of 305 to 310 not only our performance, but also our outlook for the rest of the year. So it does express some confidence in the momentum we have. So we think some of that’s baked in. It’s more performance-based than it is strategic investments, but it's really both, Brian. As Patrick has talked about, we’re investing to win. If we see good ideas in IT or digital, if our international team has some investment they want to make to continue that train going down the tracks, we're saying yes to really good investments that have a good ROI. And it's not really a short-term focus for us on what the G&A number is if we believe it's going to create long-term value. So G&A as a percentage of revenues versus last year this quarter about the same and yes it’s a bigger number. But specifically to your original question, more performance-based than it is strategic investments, but it’s a little bit of both.
Brian Bittner: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
John Glass: Thanks very much. Patrick, if I look at the unit growth internationally over the last six months, first half this year versus first half last year, then I look at it versus the back half of last year versus the prior year, in other words kind of comparing the two six-month periods, there seems to be a pretty significant step up in unit growth, like the pace has almost doubled. And that’s maybe there is some timing, but where is that coming from I guess? Maybe some more detail about where you think that’s coming from. You are over 8% unit growth now, is that -- are we on a path now to 10% for example. Is there an upper boundary to what’s reasonable or is this -- some of that’s just maybe timing in the quarters?
Patrick Doyle: No, I mean, we got off a lot of momentum in store growth. We do have the conversions that are happening in the three countries, in Germany, France, and South Africa. That's not a really big part of it yet, but that’s certainly is contributing. And that's something that is a little bit unusual. I wouldn't expect that. There just simply isn't the opportunity frankly for that many other conversions out there. But the vast majority is coming from just faster organic growth in a lot of countries around the world, and our unit economics are very strong when you get 90 straight quarters of positive same-store sales growth in your international business and with the pace of that same-store sales growth unit economics on the whole continue to get stronger and stronger. And so confidence in reinvesting into the brands and growing stores and believing that they’re going to generate a terrific return for the master franchisees continues to go up and that's really what is going on out there. And so feeling very good about it, feeling very good again about kind of the momentum in that area. There is a little bit of boost from the conversions, but it is mostly about unit economics driving a belief in the strength of investing into our brands and I would add, I remember there were some questions a couple of years ago about reimaging and relocating stores and whether or not that was going to have any effect on unit growth. And I think I expressed some confidence that it wouldn't and I think we're seeing that play out. I mean, there are seeing nice returns, we’re seeing momentum in the brand based on those reimages. And so despite the fact that there's pretty -- been pretty heavy investment into those reimages, which is now about 60% done, they’re also accelerating investment into new stores.
John Glass: That’s great. That’s helpful. And then, Jeff, just a quick question. The buyback was relatively larger, I guess, versus our expectations, maybe took advantage of the decline in the share price in the first quarter. How do you think about that going forward? Your cash balance at least unrestricted is low and I don’t think you’ve got a lot left on the revolver. Is that just a function of maybe upping that or is this -- are you thinking of this more in the context of an earlier recapitalization of the Company so you don’t mind running those things down right now?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, you know as far a future recapitalization, we’re not going to tip our hand on that obviously. You do know that our 2012 notes are callable at par about a year from now. As far as buyback, we’ve about $215 million left under the most recent authorization. With the last recap, obviously principal and interest is a little more than it used to be. We obviously have a pretty robust dividend, ongoing dividend program going on. So we viewed it as just a really good use of the last $200 million we had left over from the recap plus some organic cash that was sitting around. We're happy with the buybacks and going forward to the extent that we think that’s the best return of value to shareholders. We will continue to do that. We have the Board support, we’ve the Board authorization. If the opportunity is there, we will consider it and act accordingly.
John Glass: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton Stump: Good morning. Great job once again on the quarter guys.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Alton.
Alton Stump: It is pretty impressive. Quarter-to-quarter, you guys continue to beat on the comp front in particular. I guess, just looking at the U.S comps and sort of the environment, I’ve heard from some others that we're starting to see competitive pressure ease a little bit in the QSR pizza category in 2Q versus the first quarter, in particular. Have you seen any of that on your end?
Patrick Doyle: Honestly we haven't seen a big difference in the competitive activity overall. And as you've heard me say before, just given that the fairly fragmented market shares within pizza, the individual actions of really any player including us in the category just don’t have that much effect in the near-term on the other players. And so I think what I would say is that the overall trends have kind of continue to be the same, which is you continue to see the large players taking share from the independence and happily we’ve taken more than our fair share of that. But overall, it still continues to be really about the national players taking share from the smaller players and some growth in the category, but certainly not robust.
Alton Stump: That’s helpful. Thanks Patrick. And then, one quick follow-up just on the cheese costs front. Cheese costs obviously, on spot market anyway have come back up recently. Is there any chance you think as you kind of crystal ball the back half of the year that we'll see some smaller mom-and-pops which are probably buying predominantly, if not entirely, on spot, get a bit more rational because of cheese moving up higher?
Patrick Doyle: I think you're right. It certainly put some pressure on them, but we're looking at cheese that in today's trading in kind of the normal range of cheese. I guess, maybe the only thing I would say is extending that forward a little bit in markets where there is more wage pressure, they may have seen that offset a bit by lower cheese costs, with cheese costs moving back into kind of the more normalized range they may feel that a bit more. Clearly for us, we made more money in the second quarter in our corporate stores and we did a year-ago, so we're feeling good about our performance. But you I think they certainly will feel the pressure a little bit more. We obviously do some more forward buying than they’re able to do, which takes a little bit of the volatility out of it for us.
Alton Stump: Great. Thanks again.
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with BTIG.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to ask about, I know first quarter there were some issues on the labor side. Did you guys do anything different in terms of labor scheduling in 2Q versus 1Q or anything you guys can comment on the labor front that may have changed in the second quarter?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, I think we got a little bit more efficient. You saw some of that in supply chain and some in our corporate stores as well. And honestly it's -- we have the high quality problem of keeping up with volume. And as strength continued in the second quarter, I think the teams did a nice job of doing a little bit more efficiently than we did in the first quarter, and I think that's really it.
Peter Saleh: And then, I know you guys don’t want to give too much detail on the loyalty program, but how significant or how important were -- is the pizza profiles in terms of getting your sign-ups for this loyalty program?
Patrick Doyle: Very important. You know the pizza profile has been fundamental for us on a lot of things. It has allowed a lot of the extensions that we've done on digital ordering, because we already have all of the information there. And for people to join our loyalty program, all they got to do is click a box. And so, the ease with which people can sign up for our loyalty program is clearly been part of the strength and our ability to drive penetration in that program has been part of the strength of the results. It's very much within the range of what our team predicted it to be and that number was predicted to be pretty high based on what we thought was a very attractive program, but then also, importantly, the fact that it is very easy for them to join the program. So, I think your question is dead on and it certainly has played into it.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffery Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. A Couple of questions. One, just on the delivery side, maybe just bigger picture on delivery, I’m just wondering how you think about a couple of things. One, whether there is any potential for you to maybe provide some of your delivery service for others within retail or whatnot. And two the potential on the flipside that maybe you could see some pressure as third -- all these third-party services deliver more, whether they’re delivering for traditional QSR or casual dinners, whether that could work against you. Just wondering how you think about those two things?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, we are the most efficient delivery system out there for food. We’ve got scale. We’ve been approached by virtually every one of the players at some point, and we like our competitive position. And so, I would not expect that you will see us doing that. We are very, very good at this. We’ve got critical math of volume in our delivery business. We’ve been perfecting efficiencies around it for 56 years, and that is certainly not something that we are going to lend to other parties. And overall I think what you’re seeing is, a lot of people who are trying different things within this space taking different approaches, some around food, some around packages, obviously people moving people around, and they are still getting I think their arms around the variable economics of doing that for kind of each of those three categories, moving people, moving food and moving items. And some of my learning that it is far more about people and logistics and managing a very large distributed group of people making those deliveries that it is about kind of the technology behind it. And so, we love our position in delivery. We do it awfully well, and we’re going to continue to do it ourselves.
Jeffery Bernstein: Go it. And then just one other thing on the outlook as we look to the back half. I’m wondering if you’ve looked over time in terms of election years and Olympics and whatnot. I’m just wondering whether you’ve seen any correlation in terms of benefit to sales if consumers are glued to the television or maybe on the flipside whether your advertising spend spikes because spot prices are elevated. Just wondering how either of those events could impact you both on sales and the cost of advertising?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, so there are really two questions in there. One is, within the overall of a quarter, it won't make that much difference and really never has. There will be some days or some nights that might be particularly busy, but within the overall context of quarter I wouldn’t be looking at, at a material move one way or the other. We’re a national advertiser. That actually, your second part of the question that has been an issue in the past. In election years they’re doing local buys and that when we were buying locally it used to be a real issue in Election Years. Because cost do go up, availability gets pretty constraint, and we used to have to spend a fair amount of time working around Election Years as a local buyer. While the answer is, we’re almost entirely a national ad buyer now and as the advertising buys for campaigns are not national typically that vast, vast majority of spend goes into swing states, and so for us it won't be an effect. For those who are buying locally they’re probably spending time trying to figure out how to work around the political buys.
Jeffery Bernstein: Understood. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Matt McGinley with Evercore ISI.
Matt McGinley: Good morning. I guess I have a quick follow up on the advertising as well, and primarily relates to the advertising fund asset you have on the balance sheet, that’s up quite a bit year-over-year and its up relative to revenue, it's up relative to stores. Can you give me some context to why that would be so high? Did the sales surge later in the quarter or it’s just the function that you have a bigger plan queued up for the back half?
Patrick Doyle: The short answer is high sales. And remember a decent amount of that is actually against advertising that has already been spent, and the bills haven’t come through yet. So there is a little bit of an asset that gets carried there. But it is higher than average right now. We make our commitments for the majority of our spent in the upfront and that is generally the most efficient place to be buying advertising. So when sales and store growth are particularly strong, you may see that number build. And then we’ll make higher commitments in upfront based on both that asset kind of building up and then kind of expectations of sales going forward. So that's really primarily why that has built up at this point.
Matt McGinley: Got it. And a quick one on insurance, your casual insurance rates have been pretty lumpy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and I guess that's more of a common to what happened last year in the third quarter. But for the past two quarters it's been higher relative to the trend. Should we assume that the insurance line item on that company owned store is just kind of structurally higher on a go forward basis?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, Matt, it's Jeff. Good question. As we talked about last year third quarter when we kind of had the unexpected actuary of -- unexpectedly large actuarially adjustment, we committed to start doing it twice a year which is what you’re seeing in this quarter. A little bit higher in team USA, a little bit higher in supply chain, probably within a reasonable band, plus or minus, what you can expect when you have a $43 million liability sitting on the balance sheet and certainly materially less than what we did in Q3 last year. So, very Q2 and Q4 you’re going to see that adjustment being flowed through whether it's good, bad or sideways. I think the important thing -- so to answer your question, it could be a little lumpy in those quarters good or bad. I think the important thing for us is, safety teams are in place working hard every day making sure our team members are safer. And yes, I think that will help drive the number and hopefully manage the number better over time, but feel good about where the safety teams are. As you know actuarial studies are -- have a tail off. They have a long memory, then you have to prove to them you are materially better before they give you credit for it. That's what we’re working on right now. And we think long term it won't be as big of an issue certainly as it was in Q3 last year.
Matt McGinley: Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Matt.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris O'Cull with KeyBanc.
Chris O'Cull: Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on a great quarter.
Jeff Lawrence: Thanks, Chris.
Chris O'Cull: I had a follow-up on the global unit development. I think Jeff, you mentioned or Patrick you mentioned that the conversions did not have a meaningful impact on unit openings in the second quarter. But when do you think they will have a more meaningful impact on the rate of growth? And do you think you could a point or two to the 8% to 9% rate you just showed this quarter?
Jeff Lawrence: Well, the number on the conversions in total is, you’re looking at about 200 stores in Germany. You’re kind of in the 75’ish range in France, and kind of a similar number in South Africa. Most of the stores are already converted in South Africa and that's been happening over the last year or 18 months and it's still relatively early, it's still quite early in Germany and we’re kind of mid way through or so in France. So, and that's -- so in terms of it adding a point over time, I mean the answer is it's going to add a total of kind of call it 300 stores over the starting 18 months ago until kind of a year or two from now. And then those are done and then we’ve got a base to grow off of in those markets. We were already in France and big in France. But this is really more an entry strategy in South Africa, it was -- our first store there was a conversion of actually the first one was a new build that they’re basically better conversion of those stores there. In Germany we had a very small presence and this conversion of Joey’s is really what’s getting us scale. So, that's kind of more in the onetime events, sort of a category I guess on doing those conversions. So over the long-term as we give long-term guidance on store growth, it won't have any real effect over a three, five, ten year basis. It's going to be a nice onetime bump-up, but it necessarily accelerate on kind of a percentage basis, the store growth level over a long-term.
Chris O'Cull: That's helpful. And just as a follow-up to that, the -- what’s the unit potential in Germany and South Africa compared to where you are today?
Jeff Lawrence: Well certainly the potential in Germany is very big, and then you’re looking at a market of what 80, 85 million people. And by the time this conversion is done we’ll be the leader in the market. And so you’re looking at a market that's kind of the same size and scale of call it the UK, maybe even a bit bigger. And so, certainly the potential there is very, very large. We’ve got to get our arms around this conversion and make it work and we’ve got a lot of learning to do there. The team who built Joey’s that we’re converting is still the team running this business. I spent some time with them together within the last month and will be over there I am sure within the next year or so and then our team is over there on the ground, and we feel very good about it. But it's going to take some time to kind of get it where we want to be. Early signs are all positive. France little different, because they’ve already got a scale business there and this is really an acceleration of our path towards kind of full potential. But Germany absolutely could be a big market. It has typically been a tougher market. It's taken us some time to make progress there, and we love the team that's there now. We love DPE and DPG having joint ownership. DPE has brought a team in to work with them. So over time I think it's going to be terrific, but it's certainly going to take some time.
Chris O'Cull: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: Two I think pretty short questions if I may? First on the pizza theatre in the United States, I think you mentioned 60% were on the new format, obviously 40% to go. How much has the experience shown to lift sales in the units that have been converted maybe on a one and two year basis? And is that a potential substantial driver for your comps as well?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, John, I think it's really been more. It's really more driver of the comps you’re seeing and that gives us some confidence going forward. The numbers have continued to stay in the range we talked about before which is an initial conversion or an initial reimage the store gets you a fairly minimal bump in the short-term, call it a point or two maybe three, but really more in the point or two range. But what we see is kind of the catalytic effect. Which is as more and more stores are reimaged for a brand that has aspirations to do everything well and a growing carryout business, we’ve got to have a great experience for people in stores we didn’t before. And what we always talked about is that we think that this conversion is not going to be really compelling on a short-term basis store-by-store, but that it's going to be part of what builds the momentum around the brand overall, and for once I think we got it right. So I think that's exactly what we’re seeing play-out which is, the overall momentum playing into the brand as it was an area of weakness. Our stores just didn’t look great. It wasn’t a great experience when people came in for a carryout pizza, and with this it is a terrific experience.
John Ivankoe: Agreed. Thank you. And then secondly, you’ve mentioned in a couple of different conversations cost of labor. I wanted to talk about availability of labor and not just your labor going at other types of third-party delivery but other careers that they may have what have you. So, are there any kind of issues as you’ve been through a few different economic cycles in your career. Are there any markets that are kind of bubbling up where you say, it's not that the stores can’t handle the capacity, just you’re having a hard time finding the quality people that you need to execute your brand?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, so I’ve been at Domino’s now 19 years and when I talk to the system, we are always talking fundamentally about one of two things. It is either top-line sales or it's staffing. And clearly top-line sales are terrific. So we’re all spending a lot of time talking about staffing in our stores. And it is the better of the two things to be talking about. So our franchisees are doing what they do best, which is adapting to their individual market conditions. There are certainly markets where labor is tighter than others, but in general you are clearly seeing a healthy demand for labor out there, for people in the stores. Our growth gives us ability to -- and profitability in our stores gives us an ability to compete effectively for those people. And -- so yes, the unemployment rate in the USA is down to 4.7%. It has gotten tougher to hire people into the stores. Our reimaging program frankly pays -- plays too bad of the fact that it's a better environment for people to work in, makes it easier for us to hire great people into those stores. When the stores were frankly uglier, it was harder to hire them into those stores. So a great bright fun winning environment makes it easier for us to hire people and the right people and keep the stores staffed and give great service to our customers. But the reimage program absolutely plays into that as well.
John Ivankoe: Thanks, Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Thank you, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from Stephen Anderson with Maxim Group.
Stephen Anderson: You had answered most of my -- just about all my questions I had on the call, but thank you.
Jeff Lawrence: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley with Bank of America.
Gregory Francfort: Hi, guys. This is Greg. Just two questions. First is on average ticket. I know you talked about it being relatively flat year-over-year during the quarter. How does the average ticket today stack-up to where it was five years ago? It doesn’t seem to me like you’ve taken a lot of pricing on your base pizza, and there might be an opportunity to raise prices going forward that you may have gotten into a better value position. Can you just address, that is my first question and then I have one other.
Patrick Doyle: Yes, I mean, I’m not going to get into the specifics on tickets, but ticket is higher clearly than it was five years ago not a lot higher but it is certainly higher. The interesting thing is there are kind of four things I guess, that broadly that play into the ticket. One is, digital ordering, and ticket is higher on digital orders than phone orders, a little bit. I mean it depends on kind of the service method but it is a little bit higher, and so that plays into it. Ticket is higher on delivery than it is on carryout by quite a bit. And carry out has become a bigger and bigger part of our business over the course of the last decade. So you almost need to pull it apart and look at when we’re looking at it, we’re looking at what are the tickets doing in carryout versus what is tickets doing in delivery. And the fact that carryout has been growing a little faster over the past decade and so that is overall percentage of sales it means our overall ticket growth winds up looking a little bit more muted. Then there is ticket based on how much you are selling. So how much food people are taking in the basket and that, some of that plays back to digital ordering because people have the full menu in front of them. They’re going to wind up buying some things that they might not have bought if they were just doing it over the phone. And then really the fourth part is pricing, and what’s happening within specific pricing and pricing moves, and all four of those things kind of factor into that overall ticket number. And then there has been a reasonable amount of move in all of those, so that often I think price kind of gets translated directly as what’s happening with ticket. And there are some other big components that kind of play into what’s happening within ticket other than simply the price part of it. So the answer overall is ticket movement has been there. It's been relatively modest, but there’s an off a lot of different things that kind of play into it.
Gregory Francfort: Got it. That's really helpful. Maybe just to the follow-up, do you think the pizza industry or category has underpriced maybe other segments in QSR?
Patrick Doyle: I think the pizza category gives great value based on kind of a per-eater basis versus other parts of the category. I think there was a time 10 years ago when frankly the pizza category had gotten too aggressive on price and it was hurting order count in the industry. I think we’ve done a much better job overall of giving great value to consumers and that's clearly part of why the pizza category has probably been a little bit better on overall growth versus the overall QSR category. So I think it's a question of discipline around pricing and making sure that we’re doing right by the consumer and then you watch what’s happening with our overall level with store profitability, we’re making that work in a way that's also very compelling for our franchisees.
Gregory Francfort: That's really helpful perspective. And just my second question, on G&A and not looking for necessarily a next year target. But as we look at how you think about the variability to the sales, is this a -- been a line that you can leverage or maybe how much leverage can you get on there as sales increase over the next few years?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, it's Jeff. As you look at G&A gross versus revenues, you kind of get a bellwether as to how that bounces around, call it 12%, 13% over time. But even that metric is a little goofy, because our revenue is based on FX and supply chain pricing can sway that, it really doesn’t give you a true sense of how it's benchmarking. I think the more important thing is a couple of things. The G&A that we show you is stuff and the increase -- there is stuff that's really driving the business, and it's an inseparable part of these kind of comps, these kind of retail sales growth and these kind of economics for our franchisees. And the other thing is, we don’t show a net G&A, the regulators don’t let us show you that. But there is a non-immaterial amount of franchise contribution sharing the critical investments with us particularly around digital, they’ve always done them on advertising of course, but it's a new world, so they’re contributing on digital as well. We’re not able to really net those two together to show you kind of a true economic picture of how the investments net roll through our P&L, but they’re all in there when you look at EPS and it's just one of the things that gets us comfortable with the investments we’re making, it's in digital, it's in technology, it's in international. And we’re going to continue to make the investments. So I can tell you it's not back office stuff, its stuff that's really driving the results just you’re seeing, and we’re not going to shy away from being aggressive on these investments.
Gregory Francfort: Thank you very much.
Patrick Doyle: Go ahead.
Gregory Francfort: Sorry. No, I cut you off.
Patrick Doyle: No, I was just going to say, the other things that mean just kind of thinking about some of the dynamics within G&A and as you think about it and kind of the performance of the business, advertising for our corporate stores is in G&A. When sales go up a lot because they are contributing to our national ad funds, G&A goes up because sales have gone up. So, strong performance top line and in total our corporate stores are kind of with -- a little bit of store growth plus comp. Second quarter you’re kind of looking at 10% overall growth in sales. On a $400 million business, at a 6% ad spend it's actually a pretty significant increase in G&A year-over-year. So if there are a lot of different things that are in there, some of which actually get tied directly to volume.
Gregory Francfort: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Smith with Feltl and Company.
Mark Smith: Hi, guys. Real quick, can you just talk about the profitability of carryout order versus a delivery order? And if this is -- it's been a contributor to the higher margins that you’ve seen as you talked, Patrick, over this grow in the last decade?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. So, lower ticket but also lower cost, because you’re not performing the delivery for them. And so overall well I am not going to give the specifics. In terms of dollar profitability, I wouldn’t think about them as being dramatically different. The components of it will look at little different. Food cost will be a little bit higher, labor cost will be lower, ticket will be lower. But at the end of the day what we worry about at the dollars that you take to the bank, and all of that nets out reasonably at the end of the day.
Mark Smith: Thank you.
Operator: And we have no other questions in queue at this time. And I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters.
Patrick Doyle: All right. Well listen, thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to discussing our third quarter earnings with you on October 18. Thanks everyone.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today’s conference call, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: My name is Dennis and I will be your conference operator today. At this I would like to welcome everyone to the Domino's Pizza First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Lynn Liddle. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Lynn Liddle: Thanks, Dennis and good morning, everybody, and welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. I've got the privilege today of doing this opening for the very last time, so I'm excited to tell you that we're going to follow our usual pattern of pointing towards our Safe Harbor Statement, make sure that you have all seen that, and I will ask also the media as per usual to be in listen-only mode. We're going to spend the next little while with prepared comments from both our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer and then we will open it up for questions for all of you. So let's kick it off this morning with Jeff Lawrence, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jeff Lawrence: Thank you, Lynn. And good morning, everyone. In the first quarter our positive brand momentum continued as we once again posted strong same-store stores in both our domestic and international businesses. UF -- by 4% and international comps grew by 7.9%. A fantastic outcome when considering the great results that we were rolling over from Q1 a year ago. We have now had 20 straight quarters of positive U.S. comps, and more than 22 consecutive years of positive international comps. We also continue to increase our store count at a healthy pace, which we believe is more evidence that our brand is strong and growing. Our diluted EPS grew 9.9% over the prior year quarter. With that let's take a closer look at the financial results for Q1. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company owned stores worldwide, grew 7.3% in the quarter. When we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 11.7%. The drivers of this retail sales growth included strong domestic same-store sales, which as I mentioned grew by 6.4% in the quarter, broken down are U.S. franchise business was up 6.6%, while our corporate stores were up 4%. Both of these comp increases were driven primarily by traffic or order count growth as consumers continue to respond positively to the overall brand experience that we offer them to a lesser extent, we also saw some ticket growth during the quarter. On the unit count front, we were also very pleased to report that we opened 16 net domestic stores in the first quarter, consisting of 18 store openings and two closures. Our international division had another strong quarter as same-store sales grew 7.9%, lapping a prior year quarter increase of 7.8%. Our international division added 146 stores during Q1, comprised of 163 story openings and 17 closures. We continue to have broad, diversified strength across our international markets, which is driving these results. Turning to revenues, total revenues were up 7.4% from the prior year.  This increase was primarily a result of increased global comp and store count growth which also drove higher supply chain volumes. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted international revenues this quarter by $3 million versus the prior year quarter. Due to the dollar strengthening against most of our currencies. For the full fiscal year we continued to estimate that foreign currency could have an 8 to $12 million negative year-over-year impact on pretax earnings. As you know, there are many uncontrollable factors that drive the underlying exchange rates, which make this a harder part of our business to predict. Our revenues were also negatively impacted by a calendar shift as the New Year's Eve and New Year's day positive impact of our franchise businesses. The operating margin in our company-owned stores decreased to 24.6% from 26.2%, driven primarily by higher labor rates, transaction-related expenses, and increased depreciation from our pizza theater reimaging program. These margin pressures were partially offset by increased sales and lower food and delivery costs during the quarter. The supply chain operating margin decreased to 10.9% from 11.2%. While supply chain dollar profits were up based on higher volumes, rising labor costs led to the decline in the operating margin as a percentage of revenues, with lower commodity costs partially offsetting that decline. We are actively focused on labor costs and supply chain as this is an opportunity area for us. As we discussed in January at our Investor Day, we expect a to increase investments over time in this important area of our business as we continue to grow and as we continue to provide a quality product to all of our stores in the U.S. and Canada. As a reminder, commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar markup to our franchise he's. Therefore, lower commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit, they do, however, positively impact our supply chain margin as a percent of revenues. The average cheese block price in the first quarter was 1.47 per pound versus 1.54 in the same period last year. This helped drive down our overall market basket in the U.S. by approximately 1.5% as compared to the prior year quarter. We still expect that commodities we use -- will be largely consistent with our previous estimate of flat to up 2% in '16 from 2015 levels. Let's now shift to [indiscernible] G&A increased by $5.7 million in the first quarter versus the prior year quarter, due primarily to two factors. First our planned investments in technology, primarily in eCommerce and other technological initiatives, and the teams that support those initiatives. Please note that these investments are partially offset by transaction fees that we receive for digital transactions from our franchisees that are not included in G&A. Second, we also continue to make planned investments to support the strong growth of our international business. We continue to project that our G&A will be in the range of 290 to $295 million for the full fiscal year. Keep in mind as well that our G&A expense for the year can vary up or down by, among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that affects variable performance based compensation expense. Moving down the income statement, net interest expense increased by $5.8 million in the first quarter, primarily as a result of increased net debt from our 2015 recapitalization. Our reported effective tax rate was 37.6% for the quarter. We expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our first quarter net income was down 1.8%. This decrease was primarily driven by the aforementioned increase in interest expense. Higher domestic and international comps, global store growth, and strong supply chain volumes, all helped to increase net income. This was offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Our first quarter diluted EPS was $0.89, versus $0.81 last year, which was a 9.9% increase -- 8% increase breaks down. Lower diluted share counts, primarily pass a result of the accelerated share repurchase program benefited us by $0.09. Our higher interest expense, primarily as a result of our hire debt balance, negatively impacted us by $0.07. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.03. And most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.09. This is net of an approximate $0.02 negative impact from the New Year's calendar shift. Now, turning to the balance sheet, during the first quarter, we received and retired approximately 457,000 shares in connection with the final settlement of our previously-announced $600 million accelerated share repurchase program, bringing the shares we received and retired in total for the program to 5.3 million shares. The average purchase price for these shares was $112.87. After the accelerated share repurchase program was completed and as of the end of the first quarter 2016 we had $200 million of capacity under our Board authorized open market share repurchase program. In the fourth quarter we also made $27.4 million of required principal payments on our long term debt. As always we will continue to evaluate the most effective means for deploying our cash to the benefit of our shareholders. Overall our positive momentum continued in the first quarter and we’re pleased with our results. Thank you for your time today and now I will now it over to Patrick Doyle.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. As I look back on our first quarter results, I feel good about our continued momentum and the overall strength of our business model. Our strategy is steady. We're emphasizing continuous improvement and resisting the complacency that can come with success. And we're executing on big, bold, innovative ideas at an extraordinary pace. I'm very pleased with our solid sales performance domestically and yet another tremendous quarter for our international business, whose positive same-store sales streak continues to be unmatched at 89 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth. Our franchisees just keep getting it done. The recent advertising highlighted our DXP pizza delivery vehicle, which we debuted for you at our Investor Day. As Russell told you then, the commercial scored very highly in tests as it reinforced with customers that Domino's is an innovative brand. It's consistent with our strategy of big bold ideas and contributed to that brand momentum we keep talking about. Our new loyalty pa program is getting a strong site. Sign-ups are healthy and we're getting more frequency from our regular customers, proving that loyalty drives loyalty. We expect this to be a contributor to sales comps going forward based on the early positive signs we're experiencing. On the technology front, the quarter was highlighted in the U.S. by two new exciting ordering platforms, Apple Watch and Amazon Echo. Partnering with two of the premiere technology companies in the world is more proof of the tremendous work being done by our digital team. Our investments in technology have helped build a truly unmatched in-house team, and I am proud of the contributions that the great technology talent we've assembled here in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is making toward our current performance. We told you last quarter about the progress of our global online ordering platform, which we called GOLO, as well as the deployment of the pulse point of sales system across the globe. We now have 20 markets using GOLO and60% of our stores outside of the U.S. utilizing Domino's Pulse. Both increases since our last update following Q4. As it did in the U.S., a widely used point of sale system worldwide helps our double digits fall potential and ability to share best practices in digital experience with franchisees worldwide. You may have also noticed some media attention around the test of an autonomous delivery vehicle, Drew, which stands for Domino's robotic unit by our Australian franchisee, Domino's Pizza expect enterprises. We don't expect Drew to be making the majority of our deliveries in the near term, it is certainly another bold forward thinking idea and it is very much in line with our commitment to continually experiment and find new ways to improve our business model. And speaking of great things happening across the globe, the pace of success for the best international model in QSR continued on. We had yet another strong sales performance. Sounds boring but certainly isn't to us. And we turned in our best first quarter ever for international store growth, with 146 net store openings. We're making good progress on the conversion in France of pizza Sprint stores to Domino's stores, and Domino's Pizza, Inc. has officially completed the access of Joey is in Germany which will begin converting to Domino's in the second quarter. Standout markets, so chalk up yet another terrific quarter for our international business, our master franchisees are once again performing at the highest of levels. In summary, it was a very positive start to 2016. Our sales momentum continued, innovation persisted, and our team and franchisees across the globe showed that they're facing the challenge of sustaining success with passion and energy. Thanks. And I will now open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Brian Bittner: I just have two questions for you, both on the U.S. business. I think that you said -- in the first quarter versus the fourth Street. Can you just talk about what the driver of that is. And then on the company -- margin, it was down a little bit year-over-year. Can you rehash exactly what drove that in the quarter?
Jeff Lawrence: First, on the U.S. comps, you know, significantly driven by traffic orders with just a small amount of ticket increase. So not a big amount of ticket increase. And as you know, we are really focused around getting comps, you know, more through orders and traffic than we are tickets so that's right in line with kind of what we planned for and expect. As far as the company-owned store margin, if I heard you right, really, the biggest thing going against us there is more labor rate than anything else. Food, not a big movement Q1 over Q1 last year. And you've got some other things moving around that you can see in our 10-Q. But more than anything, it's higher labor rates, and, again, as you guys know, our team USA footprint is a little bit more urban on balance than our franchisees footprint so a little bit more susceptible to rate changes, but, again, as we've said before, we view it as a short to medium term kind of challenge that we need to deal with, but we are focused on growing our way out of that over time, and that's what we will focus on doing, as well as our franchisees, who are also impacted with higher rates.
Brian Bittner: Okay. Is there any way you can tell us what the check growth was in the fourth quarter versus first quarter so we can get a better idea of what's going on with the check?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, you know, the short answer is we don't give those exact things but I can tell you it was not a significant or material part of the 6.4 that you see.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Karen Holthouse: One quick housekeeping question. The new year shift that you mentioned, is that something that shows up in the same stores sales number or just in revenues?
Jeff Lawrence: So, Karen, it does not impact the comp number or the same-store sales number. It does actually flow through a little bit on the revenues. And again we've estimated that it's a $0.02 negative in Q1. When you look at the Q4 results that we had, you know, we identified and backed out the 53rd week, which was approximately $0.12, so the benefit of those really busy profitable days, New Year's Eve and New Year's day, was in that $0.12.
Karen Holthouse: And then was there any sort of shift in weather this year versus last year, given sort of the amount of severe weather we had last year that wasn't really repeated this year?
Patrick Doyle: Not material. I mean, you know, at the margin, maybe a little bit, but that's not a -- that's not a material driver.
Karen Holthouse: All right. And then one actual question. With rewards in the wild now for four or five months, what are you seeing in terms of the redemption cycle at one point talked about it's really going to take a year to get real data on it, it seems like that timeline has been pulled forward. Have you all been sort of quickly --
Patrick Doyle: We're feeling good about the loyalty program, and you say it's still only, I guess, seven or eight months in, but it clearly was a -- was a positive contributor to comps in the first quarter, and we're seeing enough on it that we're feeling good about how it's going to affect the growth on the business going forward.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
John Glass: Jeff, just looking at the earnings and the earnings growth this quarter versus prior quarters, I guess I appreciate your calling out the calendar shift, maybe some of us didn't have that, but when you exclude that, even then your earnings growth was low double digits, low teen and it has been high teens or better in the prior, you know, many quarters. What do you think the key differences are here? Are there cost items, for example, in the first quarter that will continue, like labor, or are there some one time issues? Can you talk a little bit about what -- is this the right kind of thinking about earnings going forward and is this just maybe the reality of mid-single-digit comps versus double digits which we've enjoyed over the last several questions?
Jeff Lawrence: The first thing I would say is when you roll over a 14.5% come him and the throughput that that gets you a year ago, you know, putting up a 6-4 which we are very proud of and excited about, on balance wouldn't have got the you the flow through as if we had thrown up another double-digit. But when you look at the two-year camp, north of 20%, we feel great about the underlying momentum and the fundamental strength. When you look at 9.9% year-over-year, that's the biggest thing, but as I mentioned just a moment ago, also opportunities for us in some margin areas.  Again, corporate stores being pinched a little bit by labor rates. Supply chain busier than they've ever been, doing a fantastic job of keeping up with the U.S. business. But they're being stretched a little bit. You know, we kind of mentioned that at the Investor Day in January. It's an area of our business that we are going to invest behind to continue to evolve and make sure we can keep up with the growth that we're seeing. But, you know, again -- and, again, you also have FX again this quarter, you know, another $3 million negative for Q1 versus last year. So you know what? When you add it all up, it does get you kind of in that 10% range, but, again, as you know, things can be, you know, a little bumpy along the way. What we're focused on is continuing to build the brand the right way with top line sales growth driven by traffic, driven by best in class digital and you know what, earnings will fall where they May but we feel good about the long-term opportunity of our financial engine.
Patrick Doyle: The only thing I would add to what Jeff said is, you know, we've got two quarters in a row now where the two-year come is north of 20%. I don't believe we have ever done that. So the domestic momentum is as good as it has ever been. So we feel good about where we are.
John Glass: And for sure the question wasn't about the comp momentum which even a two or three-year stack is unbelievable. It just had to do with what [indiscernible] growth expectations have been. Can you just -- one follow-up, Pizza Hut for the first time in a long time is comping positively felt historically you said it doesn't really seem to matter that there's a big unconsolidated -- is that still the case when you look down into your data, that when one major competitor starts to move materially higher than that they've been, there's still no real impact on your business? I know it doesn't seem like it from the outside but is the inside view the same?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, I think it is. And, you know -- and I guess I'd go back to, you know, what I was just saying. I mean, you know, we saw, you know, very strong comps, you know, each of the last two quarters, particularly given what we were rolling over. And I guess I would repeat what, you know, I think you've heard me say many times around the category, which is, you know, the big story remains, the big players taking share from the smaller players, and so the fact that, you know, the Pizza Hut had a -- you know, had a better comp rolling over I think what was a small negative from the previous year, is -- is still a reflection of kind of that share moving from the smaller players to the bigger players. So, you know, I don't think we did feel it, really in our comp at all as they were up a bit in the first quarter.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton Stump: I just have two questions. And if I heard this wrong, please correct me, but as you think back to the New Year's, New Year's Eve timing shift, how much of that impact did that have on your comps, ballpark, do you think, in the first quarter?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, it's less about kind of the comp increase than it is just about the profits falling to the bottom line, both across the international domestic franchise as well as the stores and supply chain. So we estimated that it had a $0.02 kind of headwind for us in Q1 of '16. You know, if it hurt us in Q1, it means it helped us in Q4. So, again, that identified 53rd week item affecting profitability -- $0.12 in Q4 included kind of that positive effect. But, you know, you -- when you don't have New Year's Eve and New Year's day in your if I can, it's going to hurt you a little bit, and with the brand as strong as it is and with the volumes as strong as they are, it's going to hurt you little bit more than it has maybe in the past.
Alton Stump: And then just secondly, you know, I was -- I was surprised at your currency update is unchanged given the fact, you know -- some major currency -- versus U.S. dollar. Any color on sort of what you're factoring in into your current or, you know, into your unchanged FX guidance for the year?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, so, you know, as I said a moment ago, you know, FX is largely unpredictable, and if it were more predictable, we'd all be doing something else. A year ago we said that we thought 2015 was going to be $8 million to $12 million going into that year and we ended up at a negative 20. This year we kind of -- we looked at independent consensus estimates from economists, and when you add it up, it looks again like it's going to be at eight to $12 million headwind in 2016. In the last two or three weeks there's a little bit of softening in the U.S. dollar, but nothing that would cause us to think that that's going to be a permanent, you know, a permanent state for the FX. $3 million hit to earnings pretax for Q1, you know, kind of in line with that eight to 12 if you play that out, but, again, can it move around, either -- either better or worse than the eight to 12 that we've shown as an outlook for '16? The answer to that is yes, and sometimes materially. So we're going to let that play out a little bit more. We will continue to update all of the shareholders along the way with the impact that has and our outlook on it as the year progresses, and we will see where we land.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Peter Saleh: I just wanted to ask, you know, two consecutive quarters where your two-year stacks is north of 20%, and now you've got the loyalty program that should be kicking in. Is there any reason that you guys can think of why, you know, that momentum should slow going forward?
Patrick Doyle: I'm not going to get into the kind of forecasting the specifics going forward, you know that’s not our practice, but what I would say is we obviously feel very good about the momentum of the business both domestically and internationally. And the news on the loyalty front is we have now seen enough from the results on that to have sense that is helping our comp and clearly that gives us some confidence but in terms of projections on near term we don’t get into, we just stick with our long term guidance.
Peter Saleh: And then just, you know, the GAAP between the company owned units and the franchise units looks like it was a little bit wider than it has been, you know, historically. Any call-outs there in terms of why the domestic -- the franchise units outperformed you guys by such a wide margin?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, if you look at the two-year comp, they're actually identical, and I guess what I'd say, though, is, you are always going to see some noise one way or another, you know, between those because, you know, we are essentially in eight markets with -- with the corporate stores, and so, you know, it's always going to be a little bit more reliant on some specific local market conditions, but the two-year comp is fundamentally identical for corporate stores and franchise stores.
Peter Saleh: And then just my last question, you know, and when you guys have tested the loyalty and your initial results, are you seeing that the loyalty customers tend to spend more? I mean, I know your comp has been predominantly driven by traffic and I know the loyalty program is designed to drive traffic, but should we expect that the average check should start to increase as more and more of your customers sign up for the loyalty.
Patrick Doyle: No, I mean, our loyalty program is -- and I think we even talked about this a bit at our Investor Day, you know, you've got a choice to make when you design these. We are -- we designed ours so that it is about odds, you know. And so you get 10 points for every order that is over $10. So it is rewarding frequency as opposed to rewarding spends. And it is playing out that way.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
John Ivankoe: The question is on the supply chain, which has been more volatile in operating income as of late. You know, there were some comments about, you know, perhaps optimizing some labor while continuing to invest in what is obviously a very important strategic part of your business. So, you know, what type of, you know, operating income, you know -- or operating income gains should we expect out of that division over '16 and '17, obviously understanding there's going to be not only volatility around the dough balls, you know, but also perhaps some volatility, which is difficult for us to see in terms of the pizza theater upgrades.
Patrick Doyle: Yes, so, John, you know, I think the answer is ultimately you're going to see it grow kind of like you have in the past. I mean, if you look at kind of its profits and dollar profit growth as opposed to margin shifts, it has fundamentally kind of grown in line with the pace of our business growth overall. And, you know, what we saw in the first quarter was, you know, our team is very focused on -- on supporting the stores, the most important thing they do is -- is to be effective and make sure that we're getting the service levels to the stores that we need. In the first quarter that means we may have been a little bit less efficient. And that meant a little bit of overtime. But you're not looking at an order of magnitude on that that is -- that is that big. What I would say in terms of the investments is, while there may be some investments in people, when we have talked about those, wear talking more about capital expenditures going forward because we're going to need to increase some of the capacity in our system. So that's really more what we've been talking about as we think about investments going forward. And, you know, I guess what I'd say is, when you look at kind of the profitability of the supply chain business, I would always say, focus more on the dollar profits than on the percentage margins because the percentage margins, as -- you know, as you know, are going to move with commodities, whereas kind of the dollar profits are going to tend to be more consistent.
John Ivankoe: And then secondly, you know, you've run much lower cash balances, you know, completely unrestricted cash balances than you currently have, so what do you think the right minimum cash balance is for Domino's as we kind of thing quarter to quarter, and secondly, could you take advantage of any early refinancing opportunities for your 2017 through securities?
Patrick Doyle: That's a good question, John. I'll do your second one first is, you know, as you know, our 2012 debt that's outstanding expires in January of 2019. It has a par call -- or basically take it out without penalty next summer in the middle of '17. You know, we're never going to tip our hand as to what we're going to do but it's always a possibility that we could go any time between now and January of '19 into that -- that has served us so well. So we will keep our options open and we'll continue to consult with the management team and with our Kochville board and do what we think is right for the shareholders. As far as cash balances, we did roll into the end of Q1 with a higher unrestricted catch balance than we normally do. That was expected. Again, we knew as part of our recapitalization we were going to have around $700 million of excess proceeds. Basically the maximum amount that we could have flown through our accelerated share repurchase and make it efficient was $600 million, and during the accelerated share repurchase, you're really kind of not prohibited but it's hard to actually compete with your own ASR in the open market at the same time, so we knew we were going to run with kind of a temporarily high cash balance. And then again, as I said in the prepared remarks, we are very proud of our history of deploying cash in an efficient way to our shareholders and, again, I won't tip our hand as to how exactly or when we'll actually do that but that will remain our focus going forward and I think longer term, without giving you an exact number as to the dollars that we want to see in cash, it's lower than you see at the end of Q1.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Joseph Buckley: Can I and you to elaborate on little bit on the wage rate inflation you're seeing in the company stores? And I know you mentioned labor was a supply chain but I wasn't sure if that was the overtime issue or how important that labor component is in the supply distribution business as well.
Jeff Lawrence: It was really, I think, kind of two different things in our corporate stores and in supply chain. Supply chain, honestly, was about keeping up with the business, and, you know, while they were very effective at doing that, you know, there were some opportunities on efficiency. But these were not big dollars in the grant scheme of things. From the perspective of team USA, we own all of the stores in the Bronx, Brooklyn and queens, and minimum wage, as you know, has gone up in New York, and so that's really the wage rate pressure that we're talking about. That's really primarily about New York. That's kind of a short-term thing, as, you know, our view on that has always been that, as wage rates move, you may see a little bit of dislocation in the near term on that over kind of the medium term and longer term. You see that both show up in better efficiency, because, frankly, as the wage rate goes up, stores tend to get better and more efficient about managing labor hours.  And you also see, you know, over time kind of price settling in as well a little bit. And so, you know, we kind of absorb that a bit in the first quarter. And, you know, you may see that again as wage rates are going to continue to move in New York at the beginning of each year, but you adjust around that and I think over time you're going to see that kind of come back out again. That's at least the goal.
Joseph Buckley: And Patrick, could I ask a big picture question on delivery? We're hearing more and more brands in various sectors of the industry exploring it, talking about it. How do you think about that market and you obviously, you know, kind of the -- position that each category has more importantly that Domino's has?
Joseph Buckley: I mean, we absolutely watch everything that's going on out there. There are a lot of different people, often third parties that are trying to get into the kind of package or food delivery business. My understanding today is that some of the larger players are making pretty good money moving people around, but that from a variable profit standpoint, you are not seeing a lot of profit for them moving things around. And we'll watch as that develops. We clearly believe we are the most efficient around at delivering food. It's something that we've been perfecting over 55 years. It certainly is something that has given us, and we believe will continue to give us, real competitive advantage. We do it very efficiently. But it is certainly something that we're watching and keeping our eye on. There is demand for the convenience that we provide to people of delivering food to them. And so I think it's -- it's to be expected that others are going to look at that. I don't think yet today, within the restaurant industry, you're seeing any of them doing very significant scale of delivery through the third parties, and I think you've still got pressure within those third parties on -- on whether or not they're able to make money doing that. So it's going to be interesting. We're certainly watching it closely. But you know, as of this time, still remain pretty confident that we uniquely do this in an efficient way and at a scale that allows us to be efficient.
Operator: Your next question is from the life of Steve Anderson with Maxim Group. Please go ahead.
Steve Anderson: This is a follow-up to Joe's question just now. As you notice, some of the higher wages you're seeing in some of the urban stores, particularly New York and California. Has this influenced any of your decisions with regard to your company store opening schedule?
Patrick Doyle: It has not. It has not. And just for point of clarification, we don't have any corporate stores in California. So this is really more about New York. But it is not. A and if you look at the overall profitability --
Steve Anderson: In what sort of states are you seeing the most wage pressures where your company-owned stores would see an impact?
Patrick Doyle: New York is really the biggest of those. We too far corporate stores in California. We do not have corporate stores in Washington state .. and those three states are probably the ones that have put kind of the biggest increases on the board for wage rates.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Two questions, just one on promotions. I know Patrick in recent years it's been all about methods of ordering with technology, front and center, and I think you said there were two new platforms in the first quarter which seems to imply and I think you mentioned you have a huge backlog of presumably great products to launch whenever you feel they're quote/unquote needed. So I guess where do we stand in terms of your outlook for the rest of next year. Do you consider or are you contemplating new pizza menu product items, you know, in order to perhaps drive some new news or are you still happy in coming quarters really focusing more on just the ordering platforms?
Patrick Doyle: Not going to get into any forward-looking go thoughts on that. What I will tell you is we do have lots of things in the pipeline, both from food and technology, and you know we feel quite good about where we are on that front.
Jeffrey Bernstein: And then just as the labor discussions continue to heat up across the industry, and obviously it's not much of a company-operated income just based on your franchise mix but it is evident in those company stores, but I'm just wondering what you hear from franchisees in terms of their response. Needless to say that record high profits. So there's somewhat some insulation for them. But whether they contemplate more menu pricing or if there's ever any internal definition about the 5.99 value promotion maybe needs to be tweaked or whether that's viewed as a pillar of the -- are addressing these cost pressures.
Patrick Doyle: First you answered your own question. You know, we made over $125,000 of store at the franchise level last year, record level of profitability for our franchisees. You're seeing accelerating store growth. So, you know, overall they feel very good about where we are and the outlook for the business. Do we have discussions about all of the things that you just listed? Absolutely. And I guess what I would say is, we operate in -- in over 80 countries around the world. We operate in -- in labor markets that vary dramatically. There are places we're operating today where wage rates are over $20 an hour and markets where wage rates are significantly lower than they are in the U.S. And we’re pretty darn good at it, we’re efficiency, the efficiency of our model has been strength for a long time. The relatively limited menu makes us more efficient, the scale that we have around delivery makes us more efficient on that side and we have a technology platform that is also driven efficiencies and we think gives us opportunities to drive more efficiencies going forward. So certainly we have lots of conversations about how to address these things. The great news is our competition has to deal with all the same things and at the end of the day. The competitive landscape is one of who figures things out better, who is more efficient, who figures out how to balance driving value for -- for the customer effectively, who has the best people in the industry, and, you know, we feel good about where we are.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Question on the U.S. business. I know you mentioned that Domino's is very insulated from competitive sort of pressures, maybe even from direct competitors, but certainly in the first quarter we heard a lot about market share shifting between segments, mainly the QSR taking share from casual dining. So I guess my question is, you know, are you seeing the overall pizza category, do you track that, is there some movement there and the momentum in general, and even if not, maybe just comment on general competitive pressures, maybe how you respond to them locally or geographically? I know this is I think some of the shifting was during lunch and maybe just comment on sort of how you respond to, you know, changing competitive landscape -- outside the category.
Patrick Doyle: Sure. The pizza category is going a about it, you know, it's still not robust growth, but there were a number of years there where the pizza category really didn't grow. We're now seeing, you know, more in the range of low single-digit growth in the pizza category, so that's a little bit better. And, you know, I think from an overall restaurant industry perspective, you know, at the end of the day, it really comes down to, are you giving the great value to your customer, are you giving them a level of product quality and service, and, you know, the image of your stores that's -- you know, that's creating demand at the price point that you're offering. And I know that's kind of an obvious statement and an obvious equation, but it is something that we spend a lot of time looking at, at, you know, how can you say MERS are feeling about the quality of our food and, you know, the service that we're providing and are we doing that all at a value that's working for them. And, you know -- and I think if you look broadly at -- at the adoption of technology, you know, we're proud to be in the category that has probably done the best job with technology, and I think that's giving some advantage to the pizza category overall and not just Domino's. And so that may be helping at the margin as well.
Unidentified Analyst: Maybe just a follow-up. Did you see any change in the comp trajectory between daytime deliveries and evening?
Patrick Doyle: Not materially, no.
Operator: And your final question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with KeyBank. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: I just have a couple follow-ups on the wage inflation commentary. Did you say what level of inflation franchisees are seeing right now?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, I mean, it really depends on the market. I mean, on average, they're going to be seeing a little bit less than we do, just because of kind of the balance of where the stores are and how affected they're going to be. So, on average, affecting them less but, you know, averages are -- are dangerous, and I will tell you one of the interesting things that I think everyone in the restaurant industry is looking at right now, is, while we operate in lots of markets in the world that have very different wage rates, both higher and lower than the U.S., I can't think of any markets where you have wage rates that may vary dramatically within the market. And we are heading that direction in the U.S. And it's an interesting challenge for the business. It's something that I think every restaurant company is going to be thinking about. And, you know, certainly something that we're spending time on and we're bringing kind of our analytical prowess to kind of understand how we operate in an environment where, you know, you're a national brand, but you have cost structures that may vary fairly dramatically from state to state. So, you know, short answer is, on average, our corporate stores will have a little bit more wage pressure than our franchisees, but the interesting challenge is, as we move forward, is going to be an operating environment where those numbers may be pretty different.
Unidentified Analyst: Just explore that a little more. Is your technology capabilities give you an advantage in terms of being a national brand but able to establish trade area level pricing? Does that give you an advantage in terms of communicating promotions, I guess?
Patrick Doyle: Well, you know, first, most pricing is set locally, so while we have a national promotion that our franchisees and our corporate stores are honoring, most of the rest of their pricing and their coupons are set locally by market so there are ways to adjust, and I guess in terms of technology, what I would say is, it gives us lots of advantages, and there may be ways in which it allows us to address this a little bit more effectively as well.
Unidentified Analyst: And I wasn't thinking of a trade area being a market, but a store level trade area. Do you find that you see that as well?
Patrick Doyle: You know, individual franchisees within a market may vary their pricing, you know, so you might see different pricing between different stores within a market, but, on average, pricing within a market tends to be far more the same than you're going to see variability.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. And then how has the change in the overtime rule affect a typical pizza operator?
Patrick Doyle: We’re going to see how that kind of all shakes out here. I mean there is a lot going around that right now, certainly it could wind up impacting and that’s primarily what it's going to do is it's going to be far more efficient about not having overtime in your stores.
Unidentified Analyst: Well Will there be -- so if you had managers below that 50,000 threshold, would they be -- how would you think about that? Are they -- I mean, would a lot of people switch over to hourly employees?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, I'm not going to get into all the -- all the details on that, but you know it certainly gives you a little bit -- it's something else to look at and figure out how you're going to do it most efficiently, but also put yourself in a position where you're going to be able to attract the best people in the industry.
Unidentified Analyst: And one last question. Jeff, it seems like the category discounted more in the quarter so I'm surprised with the ticket increase. Did you guys increase your discounting in your quarter and was able to drive your check through other means or--
Jeff Lawrence: Didn't materially change our pricing in the quarter.
Operator: And at this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.
Patrick Doyle: Terrific. Well, listen, before we officially close, I'd like to acknowledge some recent news that many of you are aware of, which actually takes effect this coming Monday, May 2nd, which is the retirement of Lynn Liddle who is sitting across from me for her final earnings call at Domino's this morning, and the appointment of Tim McIntyre, whose sitting across from me for his first as the new Executive Vice President of Communications, Investor Relations, and Legislative Affairs. Tim is a 31-year veteran of Domino's Communications, and I look forward to many of you getting to meet and work closely with him along the way. Lynn, I join the investment community in saying we're going to miss you, very much and thank you for all you've done to move the Domino's business forward over the past 14 years.  Domino's would not be what it is today without your leadership. With that, I thank everyone for joining today and look forward to discussing our second quarter earnings with you on July 21st.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Domino's Pizza, Inc. first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Dennis. And I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Domino's Pizza Q4 and Year End 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Lynn Liddle. Please go ahead.
Lynn M. Liddle - Executive Vice President-Communications, Legislative Affairs & Investor Relations: Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. We're coming to you from beautiful, snowy Ann Arbor, Michigan. We made it through a snowstorm to be here with you today to announce our year end 2015 results. And we're very happy to be here. I'll remind investors or all of the folks on the call that this is for investors primarily. So I'll kindly ask the members of the press to be in a listen-only mode. And also turn your attention to our Safe Harbor statement that is in the press release and the 10-K. In the event we say something that we shouldn't say that's forward-looking. We're going to follow our usual procedure of prepared comments from our CFO and CEO. And then we'll open it up for your questions. So as we begin, I would like to introduce Jeff Lawrence, our Chief Financial Officer.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. We are thrilled to report our results this morning for the fourth quarter and full year 2015. During the quarter, we continued to build on the positive results we posted during the first three quarters of the year. And we delivered fantastic results for our shareholders. Our international and domestic divisions posted strong same-store sales growth. We opened a significant number of new stores, both domestically and internationally. And adjusted EPS grew 26.4% over the prior year quarter. Before we jump into the numbers, I would like to first remind everyone once again that our fourth quarter included an extra week this year. Typically our year consists of three 12-week quarters and a 16-week fourth quarter. But in 2015 our fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks. Additionally, we also completed our recapitalization during the fourth quarter, which also impacted our as reported amounts. In the earnings release we filed this morning, the impact of both of these items has been adjusted out of our 2015 results, as items affecting comparability. With that in mind, let's jump into results. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 17.6% in the quarter. Again, these numbers were benefited by the extra week. When we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, which was a headwind for us all year, global retail sales grew by 25.2%. The drivers of this retail sales growth included strong domestic same-store sales, which rose by 10.7% in the quarter. Broken down, our U.S. franchise business was up 10.7%, while our corporate stores were up 10%. Both of these comp increases, which are not affected by the extra week, were driven primarily by traffic or order count growth. We also saw some ticket growth during the quarter. What's even more impressive is that this 10.7% increase was lapping an 11.1% increase in the prior year quarter, a double-digit on a double-digit. We're also very pleased to report that we opened 88 net domestic stores in the fourth quarter, consisting of 92 store openings and four closures. For the full year, we opened 133 net domestic stores. This net domestic store growth is the highest number of openings we've had in 15 years. Our international division had another strong quarter, as same-store sales there grew 8.6%, lapping a prior year quarter increase of 6.1%. This marked the 88th consecutive quarter, or 22nd year of positive same-store sales growth for our international business. Our international division added 323 stores during Q4, comprised of 348 store openings and 25 closures. For the full year 2015, we had record international growth of 768 net new stores. When adding in the domestic store growth, we opened 901 net new stores globally, which is the most store growth we've had since the brand was rapidly expanding back in the 1980s. Turning to revenues, total revenues were up $98.2 million, or 15.3% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of four factors. First, the extra week increased revenues by an estimated $49.7 million. Second, higher supply chain center revenues, which were driven by higher food volumes related to strong U.S. comps, as well as increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our global store re-imaging program. These supply chain increases were partially offset by lower commodity prices. Third, higher domestic same-store sales and store count growth resulted in increased royalties from our franchise stores and higher revenues at our company-owned stores. And last but not least, higher international royalties, again from increased same-store sales and store count growth, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted us this quarter by $6.4 million versus the prior year quarter, due to the dollar strengthening against most of our currencies. For the full fiscal year of 2015, foreign currency negatively impacted revenues by $19.9 million. Now moving onto operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 31.2% from 29.5% in the prior year quarter. Operating margins benefited overall from lower commodity costs in the quarter and higher sales in all of our business segments. Looking specifically at company-owned stores, operating margin there increased to 26.5% from 23.2%, driven primarily by lower food costs and to a lesser extent, the leveraging impact gained from higher store sales. The supply chain operating margin also increased, this time to 10.8% from 10.1%, due primarily to lower commodity costs, offset in part by higher labor costs. As a reminder, commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar markup to our franchisees. Therefore, lower commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, positively impact our supply chain margin as a percent of revenues. The average cheese block price in the fourth quarter was $1.63 per pound versus $2.11 in the same period last year. This helped drive down our overall market basket by 7.1% as compared to the prior year quarter. Let's now shift to general and administrative expense. G&A increased by $6.3 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year quarter due to several factors. First, we estimate that $4.7 million of these G&A expenses were incurred as a result of the extra week in the quarter. Next, our planned investments in our team, primarily in e-commerce, international and technology, also contributed to this increase. Third, our robust sales and earnings led to increases in volume-driven expenses such as variable performance based compensation and franchisee incentives. And finally, these increases were offset in part by the non-recurrence of a $5.8 million asset impairment charge we took back in 2014. Moving down the income statement, net interest expense increased by $13.6 million in the fourth quarter, and by $12.5 million for the full year, primarily as a result of increased net debt from our 2015 recapitalization. Switching to income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 36% for the quarter and 37% for the full year. We expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our fourth quarter net income was up $14.7 million, or 30.7%. When you exclude the estimated impact of the extra week, the 2015 recapitalization expenses, and the 2014 asset impairment charges, all of which are identified as items affecting comparability in our earnings release, the net increase in net income was primarily driven by higher domestic and international comps, global store growth and strong supply chain volumes. Our improved operating results were partially offset by the FX headwinds I mentioned just a moment ago. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS as reported was $1.18 versus $0.85 last year, which was a 39% increase. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS as adjusted for the items affecting comparability that I just mentioned was $1.15 versus $0.91 in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was a 26.4% increase. Here is how that increase in diluted EPS, as adjusted, breaks down. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.045. Our higher interest expense, primarily as a result of our higher debt balance, negatively impacted us by $0.05. Our lower effective tax rate benefited us by $0.015 and lower diluted share counts benefited us by $0.07. But most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.25. For those of you looking for a 17-week EPS number without the recapitalization, you would take our as adjusted diluted EPS amount of $1.15 for the quarter and add back an estimated $0.12 for the impact of the extra week. Now turning to our use of cash, over the course of the year we had total share repurchases of $738.6 million. Of this amount we repurchased and retired approximately 1.3 million shares for $138.6 million, or an average price of $107.08 per share through our open market share repurchase program in the first three quarters of the year. Separately, in the fourth quarter we received and retired approximately 4.9 million shares in connection with our previously announced $600 million accelerated share repurchase program. At final settlement of the ASR program, which will be completed and recorded by the end of the first quarter of 2016, the company will likely receive and retire additional shares. We also used cash to repay $564 million of our debt during the year, primarily related to the $551 million partial repayment of our 2012 notes in connection with our recapitalization. Separately, we returned over $80 million to our shareholders in quarterly dividends. When you add the share repurchases and the quarterly dividends together, the end result is that we returned more than $800 million to shareholders during 2015. Moving to capital expenditures, we invested approximately $63 million in CapEx in 2015, primarily in our stores, our supply chain centers and our most important technology initiatives. As we look forward to 2016, I'd like to remind you of some information we shared at our Investor Day in January. We currently project that commodities we use in our U.S. system will be flat to up 2% as compared to 2015 levels. We estimate that foreign currency could have an $8 million to $12 million negative year-over-year impact on pre-tax earnings in 2016. For G&A we expect to have increases for e-commerce and technological initiatives, which remember are partially offset by transaction fees we receive. We also plan to have increases for other strategic initiatives. We expect total G&A expense to be in the range of $290 million to $295 million for full year 2016. Keep in mind too that G&A expense can vary up or down by, among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that affects variable performance based compensation expense and other costs. In 2016 we expect gross capital spending to be approximately $60 million, as we will continue to invest in improving our image, our technology and our supply chain capabilities. Overall, we are pleased with the results we achieved in 2015 and remain very excited about our continued growth prospects. We do not take these results for granted, and are committed to continuing to drive the brand forward with a focus on relentlessly increasing sales and unit economics for our franchisees, and driving continued growth and shareholder value. Thank you for your time today, and with that, I'd like to turn it back over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jeff. So that was an outstanding year. If there is one question I continue to get from the many who have become interested in us in recent years, it's about the cause of our success and what catalyst or event we can point to, to explain it. We welcome the question because, truthfully, it allows us the opportunity to take people through this multi-layered story. Our success didn't happen overnight and was certainly not due to the push of one button or the pursuit of a single element. It's been the result of a steady build over time and we're extremely pleased with the results those efforts are producing. From our landmark U.S. pizza turnaround six years ago, to our accountable, honest and transparent marketing and communication with consumers, to our unmatched innovation as a clear technology leader, and more recently the overhaul and redesign of our store image worldwide, we've truly taken a brand that once stood for delivery convenience, and frankly little else, to one that now stands for so much more. There are two critical elements to our steady strategy: continuous focus on improvements and big, bold ideas. In any competitive landscape, the team with momentum and operational excellence can be very difficult to stop. And as we sit today, it's nearly impossible to argue against Domino's proven strength in both of these areas. This approach helped produce an incredible 2015. And beyond just numbers and results, I'm encouraged by the winning attitude and culture throughout our team and franchisee base globally, along with our relentless focus on avoiding complacency. You won't find us spending any time marveling at our past success. Instead we look ahead and focus on whatever it takes to always get better. Nothing has brought this idea to life quite like our domestic business, where our performance in 2015 was just tremendous. From an execution and energy standpoint, our U.S. franchisees had what I would consider their best year in our company's 55-year history. We delivered 12% same-store sales growth domestically for the year and have now racked up seven straight years of positive sales growth in the U.S. We achieved another record year of franchise profitability at an average of more than $120,000 per store. This level of health in our franchisees' unit economics is very much a result of their hard work, passion and energy. Our domestic franchisees are making more money than at any time in our history, and that is helping to open even more stores. It's a positive cycle, and the momentum certainly continued in 2015. We're also proud of our accomplishment at re-imaging half of our U.S. stores by the end of 2015. Store re-image is all about providing a welcoming atmosphere and customer experience upgrade. And I am very pleased with the dedication, focus and progress our franchisees have demonstrated towards this goal, while continuing to execute at extremely high levels and not lose focus on the business at hand. Our loyalty program, which was launched during the fourth quarter, has produced encouraging early results, feedback and engagement from our digital customers. This introduction had a positive impact on the fourth quarter, and we look forward to continuing to introduce it to our growing digital audience and learning more along the way. It was a great year on the supply chain side as our team did a great job of reacting to the significant volume growth in 2015. As we look forward the next few years, it's clear we will need to invest to expand our supply chain capacity to continue to support growth throughout our system. I also want to note that because of the generosity of our customers, as well as hard work from dedicated franchisees and store members, we were able to set yet another record in raising $5.4 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. One of my favorite moments of 2015 was having the privilege of cutting the ribbon on the Domino's Event Center, a beautiful addition to the St. Jude campus in Memphis. We continue to be extremely proud of this partnership and the over $30 million we have helped raise since the partnership began in 2004. It's impossible to highlight our thriving business without discussing technology. We ended 2015 with over 50% digital sales in the U.S. And for the first time in our history more than half of our national television campaign topics were directly related to digital initiatives. Technology is now simply part of our brand fabric and identity. We promoted voice ordering, loyalty and most notably our 15 ordering platforms that now include text and Twitter via emoji, Samsung TV, Ford SYNC and smartwatches. Just last week we announced that customers can now order on their Apple Watch. Time will tell what is next. We also continue to grow our digital presence within international markets, helped by the increasing adoption of our PULSE point-of-sale system and the growing opportunity of global online ordering, which is currently active in 12 markets. I'm encouraged that this will help our franchisees abroad compete better and grow faster. Nearly 45% of our international sales now come from digital channels, with some areas of the world exceeding the 70% mark. And we're pleased to see more markets developing this capability. But innovation requires investment and I want to take the opportunity today to make an important point in this regard. Digital is having a tremendous impact on our performance. We aren't willing to give up our lead or the unparalleled digital experience we offer customers, one that only seems to be getting better. Therefore, we will continue to invest as long as we keep seeing these strong returns. Keep in mind as well that we receive a transaction fee for every digital order in the U.S. and those international markets using our platform. And it's a win-win for our system. Franchises get the best digital experience in QSR quite affordably, and we benefit from some offset to our investment. The paradigm has changed dramatically and it's our job to be mindful as always of investing wisely, while refusing to let go of our lead. And speaking of staying on top, the best international model in QSR continued its phenomenal run in 2015. We've now reached a rather unbelievable streak: 22 consecutive years of positive same-store sales. With strong sales and another terrific year of rapid store growth, the business continued to grow and our master franchisees performed at the highest of levels. We opened six new markets in 2015: Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Georgia, Portugal, Belarus and the birthplace of pizza, Italy. And we once again saw outstanding sales performances from countries such as Australia, the UK, Mexico and Canada. We added 901 net new stores globally last year, reaching 12,530 stores worldwide. India was our biggest store growth champion for 2015, adding 159 net new stores and recently hitting the 1,000 store milestone, the first market outside of the U.S. to do so. As of the fourth quarter, we had 3,800 international stores re-imaged. Around the globe, store returns are driving an accelerated pace of store growth and reinvestments, and attracting competitive pizza brands to convert to Domino's. In addition to brand conversions in South Africa and France, we recently announced a conversion in Germany and are looking forward to the energy and potential that our master franchisees, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, and Domino's Pizza Group will together bring to that important market. And lastly, we recognize the milestone anniversaries as both Japan and the UK celebrated their 30th years in business. I couldn't be more pleased with the strength and steadiness of our international business despite a tough economic landscape in many international markets. It's truly a tribute to a great team and fantastic group of master franchisees. In summary, I can't say enough about how pleased I am with our 2015 performance. The momentum behind this brand is tremendous. We know our identity, we pursue innovation relentlessly, we genuinely, even in the face of great success, look for ways to be better. We are big and bold with our ideas. We would rather risk and fail than not risk at all. We're honest and accountable. This identity exists because we have a franchise base that is second to none, both in the U.S. and abroad, getting it done each and every day. Thanks and I will now open it up for questions.
Operator: . And your first question is from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. So obviously congratulations, great comps and great end to the year. Just wondering how do you think about the business as you look towards 2016 and the comps? Should we be thinking about this on like a two-year and a three-year comp basis? What's the best way to think about that? And then sort of tying in, you mentioned the loyalty program helped the fourth quarter a little bit? So anything else you can talk on there? Is there some sort of big bump early on that sort of gets a little bit more normalized as we move out several months into the year, out from the launch? So, anything you could provide there would be helpful. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So first I'll take the answer on loyalty. We feel good about the start on loyalty. It's still going to be some time, I think, before we really see the full impact of that and understand how it's affecting customer behavior. You need to see a number of cycles of customer repurchase, I think, before you fully understand it. But clearly we're happy with the start. Our long-term guidance is 2% to 5% domestically. And clearly we've been performing above that level, but as we look at our business, we think that over the medium to long term that's the right answer for you as you think about the business. Certainly looking at two- or three-year comps makes sense. And so I think most of you are doing that in your analysis on the business. There's always going to be some movement quarter-to-quarter. But clearly we're pretty pleased with our results both on a one-year and a multiple-year basis.
Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just first on the loyalty program, and I don't think you'll probably give us a sense of how much it contributed to the comp, but I thought I'd ask. And then maybe just membership, what's the rate of signup versus your expectations? Or can you give us sort of a sense of how well embraced it's been so far and what you need to do? If it needs to go further, how you'll incent people to sign up?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So we're off to a strong start with it, John. And you guessed correctly. We're not going to give kind of specifics around it. And honestly it's going to take some time for us to really understand that. As I said, until you've seen multiple repurchase cycles you're not able to really be able to project how it's affecting frequency. But we're very happy with how it's rolled out. We're getting very good feedback from the customers. If you look at kind of the reviews that it's getting, it's been very well accepted by consumers. We're not going to disclose kind of the enrollment numbers, but clearly we feel good about how it has launched and about the feedback that we're getting from customers on it.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful. And then on the unit growth, I think in the last couple or three years you've gone from essentially 0% in the U.S. on a net basis to like 3%. If that's correct, is that the right way to think about 2016 and 2017? Have you talked to your franchisees and is there an aggregate number that maybe is higher than that and maybe what is that? And related to that, delivery businesses are unique in that you can't just open a store unless you – you have to consider impacts. Has there been any discussion in the franchisee base about getting impacted on delivery areas? Or have you been able to negotiate that pretty well?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So we've got the right with our franchisees to look at delivery areas. There is an area that is assigned to them, but there is a smaller area that is protected for them under their 10-year contract. As we look at the business and the growth we've had in the business and the returns that are getting generated at the store level, it has clearly helped accelerate the store growth. And we still see 1,000-plus stores that can be built in the U.S. The ramp up in growth is a reflection of the growth in the business and the great returns that our franchisees are getting by investing in building new stores. We're getting strong returns from those new stores as they're opening. So I think you're seeing growing excitement from the system about expanding the system in the U.S. So we feel good about where we are. And you've probably heard me say many times that while there are many in the industry that put out a lot of press releases around contracts that are being signed, about how many stores are going to be built, particularly as they're going into new markets, we largely just don't do that, because our view is that the franchisees are smart. And when they're seeing strong returns, they're going to build more stores. Stores get built because capital moves toward where there's a strong return, and there is a very strong return on building Domino's Pizza stores right now in the U.S. and in the vast majority of our international markets. That's ultimately what's accelerated the unit growth. Over time our view is kind of 5% to 7% growth overall on our global store counts. And we think that's a very realistic view of what you should expect from us.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: But that target does not necessarily pertain to the U.S. What is that target in the U.S. then?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, that's a combined growth for both.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So that's a full-up domestic and international store level growth is 5% to 7% range. It has clearly been predominantly international over the last few years. But it has been our expectation that as we improved the returns that you're going to see more of that shifting into the U.S. And so I feel good about the momentum we've got in the U.S. I feel great about the store level returns. And so that 1,000 more stores that I'm talking about in the U.S. I think is very realistic.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you for taking the question and congratulations on a fantastic quarter to say the least. Looking at the fourth quarter, we've I think historically thought of the category, or the pizza category, as something that actually benefits from inclement weather. But is there any sense that a relatively mild start to winter may have been a tailwind?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: May have been a tailwind? It would actually be the other way around.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'm sorry, been a headwind, sorry. Yes, been a headwind.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I think our answer on this is, as we've looked at it over time, bad weather, as long as it's not too bad, is a net positive for the business in the near-term. But the real answer is that with the variety of weather and the different geographies that we're operating in, when you're looking at a full quarter of results, we just don't think it is really that material of an effect. So could it have been a little bit of a headwind for us? Maybe, but not enough that it really materially affects the results.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then one other quick one. It's obviously pretty hard to find a hole to pick in a 10.7% comp, but within that, were there any just regions in the U.S. that were particularly strong or were underperformers?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. There really weren't. It was very broad-based.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Karen.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Good morning and offer my congrats as well on a great quarter. I guess looking back at the U.S. store growth, I was surprised at how much growth you ended up having for the full year. Is there any certain regions, Patrick, that you're seeing the strongest growth here in the U.S.?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. I think it's pretty broad-based. There are still areas of the country where we are somewhat less penetrated than others. Interestingly enough, probably the area where we have the most opportunity still to grow over time is actually the Midwest where we're based. But really when we look around the country, there's an awful lot of kind of fill-in growth that you're going to be seeing. So there aren't many markets where we don't have a good base to grow from. So as we kind of prioritize markets around the country for growth, an awful lot of it is a dozen stores here, a dozen stores there, if there's any concentration left today that I think geographically looks like there will be a little bit more than other areas, it's probably in the Midwest.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Got you. That's helpful. And then one quick follow up and I'll hop back in the queue. There's been a lot of hype, somewhat media driven, recently about a I suppose a price war in the U.S. pizza category. It would seem that you guys are not responding to that or maybe not even seeing it. Any color on sort of what you're seeing not just from of course major player that has been out there (34:58) pretty aggressive value deals? But even smaller players are they using the lower cheese cost to discount more heavily. Just kind of overall competitive environment you're seeing?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Honestly we're really not seeing it. Clearly our results were strong, and so if we saw it, we didn't feel it. But if you look at the category over the last few years, first of all, Domino's has had the same national price point now for six or seven years. You've seen ticket in the category probably growing a couple of points a year pretty consistently over the last five or six years, so 1% to 2% in that range. And so I've seen the same discussion about it. But honestly, overall we just aren't seeing it. And it clearly has not been affecting our business.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Steve Anderson with Maxim. Please go ahead.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group LLC: Yes. Good morning. And I wanted to ask about something that's popped up in the last couple of conference calls and it's regarding your insurance costs. And I know you've had to increase your costs with regard to a couple of incidents that occurred during the year. And so I just want to see if those trends had normalized during the quarter.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yes. This is Jeff. On our casualty insurance, as you know, we took kind of that unexpected charge in quarter three. At the time we said we were going to make sure we were doubling down on our safety efforts and making sure that we manage it the best way we can. It's only one more quarter on the books, but we didn't have an unexpected headwind or a tailwind on insurance from a casualty perspective during the quarter. And as we get into 2016 the expectation, at least for management is, hopefully we can make an impact by managing it better and kind of getting back that normal run rate. So the Q3 charge we did think was certainly out of the ordinary for us, at least given our history. But for us it's all about just making sure we're managing it the best way we can. And that'll be our focus going forward.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: My pleasure.
Operator: Your next question's from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG. Please go ahead.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Great. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the mix and match menu. Just curious, I know you guys said that you didn't see any real impact from the discounting going on. But did you see at all the incidences of the mix and match? Have customers gravitated a little bit more towards that in the recent past?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the way to think about it is, first, the overwhelming majority of our sales are pizza and are always going to be pizza. We've got great other products on our menu and we want people to be aware of those. And particularly we want people to be aware of those when they're ordering in larger groups. And so there is always in a group of four or six or eight people, there is going to be somebody who may not be as interested in ordering pizza. And if they don't know about the options that Domino's has, we may lose that whole order. So when we advertise mix and match, we will get a little bit of a bump in those other products in the near term. But as much as anything, it's about driving awareness of those products over the long term so that people know there are some other choices. And as much as anything that's about making sure that we're an option for larger groups that know that there are things that they can order beyond just the pizza.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Got it. And then on the loyalty program, just circling back, Pizza Profile, did that help with the enrollment in the quarter for the loyalty program?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely it did, yes. And the profiles that we've got now and the information that we have with our customer base is a very strong benefit for us. And it's what allows us to be rolling out the platforms that we are as quickly as we are for digital ordering. It gives us a real leg-up when we roll out something like the loyalty program that we already have a strong profile on the customer and their information. And really signing up for loyalty if you had a profile was about checking a box. And that accomplished it and you were now in the program. As an ecommerce company, we are always looking at conversion rates. We want to understand people who are starting the process to order, what percentage of them actually complete the order. And if you give them something that is too complicated along the way, like a long enrollment for the loyalty program, you may actually hurt your sales in the near-term. So the fact that we already have a lot of information made that sign up easier and it absolutely helps.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Got it. And then last question, can you guys just give us an update on the franchisee EBITDA at the end of 2015? I don't know if you guys called that out on the call, I may have missed it. What was the final number?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We don't have the final, final, but it is north of $120,000.
Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC: Excellent. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Peter.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. My congratulations as well. Obviously, tremendous. On the supply chain piece, that segment, at least from our perspective, has become increasingly difficult to model and you had a completely blow-out fourth quarter. I mean, could you just help us separate how much of that is – and I think we understand store growth and comp, but how much of that was due to equipment sales related to the remodels, and whether there's any lumpiness in the fourth quarter that may not recur, or maybe will occur, into 2016 and beyond?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, when you think about supply chain, the first thing you have to remember is that as cheese and other commodity prices go up and down, it's really going to mess with your percentage margin comparison. So that's first and foremost. But when you think about dollars, margin in 2014, about $131 million, $149 million in 2015, which you can find in the 10-K, more than anything this is about selling more food in the stores, which is requiring more food from the supply chain centers. There is definitely some leverage that you get from leveraging the existing supply chain systems. But going against that is also as we have gotten a lot busier, we are working a lot harder to keep up with the growth. So, when we think about profitability there, it's mostly about food volume, that's following the comps in the U.S. Separate from that, and you mentioned it is equipment and supply chain sales to our stores that are re-imaging, and building stores both in the U.S. and including some international franchisees who buy their store packages from us as well. Again, you think about that, we've been accelerating store count growth, obviously the re-images are now about half done but not done yet, another couple of years to go, so as you think about it going forward, it should be more of the same on balance.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And if I may, just to follow up on that, Patrick, in your comments, you mentioned needing to invest in the supply chain based on how much your volumes have increased. Could you shed some more light on that? I mean, does that mean additional distribution centers? And could you talk about what potential profit impact could be from that?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think the answer, John, is over time that we will need to. And if you look at the growth in our business over the course of the last five years or six years, the volumes in total from our system are up in the range of 35%, 40%. And so at some point, you're going to need to build some more capacity into the system. Obviously, it's a great problem. The way I would kind of think about that is first we gave kind of the guidance for this year to you at Investor Day. The second thing is that our CapEx into reimaging and relocating our Team USA stores, our corporate stores, is actually going to be going down as that reimage program kind of wraps up. So I don't know that you're going to see a dramatic change in the level of CapEx going forward. But we certainly are going to have to look at ways to increase the capacity in the system to make sure that we're giving great service to our franchisees in their stores.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, John.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question's from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Two things: just one asking about the – there's been a lot of questions on the pizza category and the competition and discounting, if you broaden that out a little bit and look maybe at, for example quick service and then the burger discounting going on. I'm wondering whether theoretically do you think about perhaps playing in the same sandbox with the QSR players? Or do you view pizza as a distinct occasion? There's no sign of it in the fourth quarter results. I'm just wondering how you kind of think about it theoretically and perhaps historically as more of a tie-in to casual dining discounting than quick service, but just wondering how you think about the discounting on either end of the pizza category.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Jeff. It's a good question because we certainly do look at it. You're going to have more direct impact from the pizza competitors than we do from burgers or chicken or sandwiches or anywhere else. And we've told you in the past that what's interesting about the pizza category is because it is so unconsolidated, we think we actually feel the effect of competitive activity less than most categories in the restaurant industry. So, do we look at it? Absolutely. And at some point, is there an overall share of stomach question? I think there is. But because of the overall size of the restaurant industry and the relative fragmentation of market share within the pizza industry, we just don't feel the effect of any single competitor's movement in price or promotional strategy in a material way on our business in the short term. We might feel it a little bit, but it just doesn't have a big material effect on the business. So, we watch it. We're certainly aware of what's going on there. But in terms of short-term impact, it just isn't that big.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And the one other thing was just on the return of cash. So obviously in 2015, it was heavily skewed by the recap and the $600 million ASR. I'm just wondering as you think now about 2016, leverage is already on the books, just wondering how you or the board think about the balance of, I guess, share repo versus dividend. Looks like from the dividend perspective, you made a nice boost, but the yield is somewhat of a modest low 1% range relative to the outsized repos. So, how do you think about that going forward? Any reason why the dividend, kind of the regular dividend wouldn't go up just to be commensurate with the stability of the business model?
Jeffrey D. Lawrence - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. So, I mean on the dividend, as we put out this morning, another really big increase year-over-year; a 20%-plus increase. Last year it was more than 20% increase on the quarterly dividend. So the board has decided again, and it's up to them in the future to decide going forward, that the quarterly dividend was going to continue to be an important part of how we return free cash to our shareholders. On the buybacks specifically, and as you mentioned, the ASR is winding up. It'll be done by the end of Q1 here. We do have $100 million kind of left over from the recapitalization that we weren't able to efficiently deploy in the ASR or otherwise in Q4. So we're starting kind of from a cash flush position as we start the year. And you can actually see that on the balance sheet as of the end of Q4. So how we spend that and how we view that, again, will be determined by the board. But I think what you've seen from us is if it makes sense, we'll pursue buybacks. If it doesn't make sense, we'll go heavier on the dividend. So it really just depends on what the board's thinking at that point in time.
Jeffrey A. Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Thank you. Just had a couple of questions. The step-up unit growth in the U.S., is that primarily existing franchisees? Or is it a combination of existing and new franchisees?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's all existing franchisees. So we are essentially 100% internally grown franchisees. So our franchisees are successful managers or supervisors within our system. And then they apply to become a franchisee. And even those new franchisees coming into the system, I think we had just under 20 last year who franchise and so those were already people working within Domino's. Essentially all of them become franchisees the first time by buying a store, not building a store. So, really all of the building of stores is coming from existing franchisees.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. And then just a quick question on the economics of the loyalty program, with food costs down so much, I'm sure, not an issue at all. But as you work through the first full quarter of it, any thoughts on how the economics of it work for the franchisee relative to the discount that the free pizza represents?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that franchisees are excited about the overall momentum in the business. They just finished a record year for profits. And I think there's a lot of energy around the loyalty program. And I think, as you know, when you launch loyalty programs, the goal is to make them simple upfront so people can understand the program. And then over time you see people maybe tweaking them a little bit as they can see exactly how customers are using the program. But overall, I think our franchisees are excited about the program and hopefully how it's going to affect the business long term.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Steve Anderson with Maxim. Please go ahead.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group LLC: Following up on the question of variability within different markets. If I to turn to international, have you seen any discrepancies between, certainly within the economy there was very strong, but have you seen any differences between different geographies like Europe versus Asia, or India? Some of the other geographies where – India had shown some weakness in the economy overall, but you've been able to grow that market as well. So, I just wanted to get some little more color on each of the individual countries?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Overall it really has been quite strong and pretty consistent. You're right on your comment on India. Certainly the economy there has gone through a little bit of a downturn. But I think the economy is continuing to improve. We had terrific store growth there last year. Maybe not quite as robust same-store sales growth as they had had three years or four years ago. But overall amongst major markets in our International portfolio, it's been pretty consistently strong.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. Please go ahead.
Frederick Wightman - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. This is actually Fred Wightman on for Greg. Just a quick question on the loyalty program: One of the other larger QSR loyalty programs recently switched from a frequency to more of a dollar-based approach. Just wondering if you could provide your thoughts on the benefits of the two different styles?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. We're trying to drive volume in our business. It's about driving frequency and retention of those customers. I think it's a fundamental choice that brands need to make on whether or not it's going to be about driving ticket and overall sales versus frequency of the customers, and we clearly chose that we want to drive order counts within our system. So it's a clear choice that you make. I'm aware of the example that you're talking about and the change that they made. And you obviously have to talk to them about why the shift in focus on that. But for us, as low as our market share is overall within the pizza category, we think it makes sense to be focusing primarily on order counts.
Operator: And at this time there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Thank you, everyone. I look forward to discussing our 2016 first quarter earnings with you on April 28.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining the Domino's Pizza Q4 and year end 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-10-08 10:00:00) =====
Executives: Lynn Liddle - EVP, Communications, IR, Legislative Affairs Patrick Doyle - President, CEO Jeff Lawrence - CFO

Operator: Good morning. My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Miss Liddle, you begin your conference.
Lynn Liddle: Thanks, Kelly. Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. We are going to follow our usual pattern of some prepared remarks by our Chief Financial Officer and our CEO and then we’ll open it up for question and answer. We do set this up as an investor call, so I’ll kindly ask the members of the media to be in listen-only mode and I’ll also turn all of your attention to our Safe Harbor statement in the event that any forward-looking statements are made. And with that, I’d like to introduce our new CFO but long-time Domino's team member, Jeff Lawrence.
Jeff Lawrence: Thank you, Lynn and good morning everyone. Before we discuss the results for the third quarter, I’d like to make some brief comments on our recently announced proposed refinancing of our capital structure. As communicated in our September 28 press release, the company intends to issue approximately $1.5 billion of new fixed rate notes in the fourth quarter. We plan to use the proceeds of the $1.5 billion issuance to call and retire at par $551 million of existing 2012 fixed rate notes, to pay transaction fees, and use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The refinancing would bring our total debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio from approximately 3.6 times at the end of Q3 to approximately 5.8 times at closing. The company also expects to enter into a new $125 million variable funding note facility which would replace our existing $100 million facility. Due to security law restrictions, we are unable to go into any more detail today or answer any questions regarding this proposed refinancing. We appreciate your understanding. We do plan to have a follow-up call with investors at the conclusion of the refinancing, and we will announce the date for that call at a later time. Let’s now move on to our third quarter results. This quarter, our domestic and international divisions again posted very strong same store sales growth, and we opened a significant number of new stores globally. Our earnings per share grew 6.3% over the prior year; we are pleased with these results particularly in the face of continued foreign exchange headwinds and an insurance charge we took during the quarter that I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Global retail sales which are total retail sales at franchise and company owned stores worldwide grew 6.1%. When we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 15.2%. The drivers of this retail sales growth include domestic same store sales, which rose by 10.5% in the quarter, broken down our U.S. franchise business was up 10.4% while our corporate stores were up 11.5%. Both of these comp increases were driven primarily by traffic or order count growth. We also saw some ticket growth during the quarter. We are also pleased to report that we opened 14 net domestic stores in the third quarter consisting of 24 store openings and 10 closures. Over the past four quarters, we have opened 96 net domestic stores. Our international division had another strong quarter as same store sales grew 7.7% collecting a prior year quarter increase of 7.1%. This marked the 87th consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth for our international business. Our international business also grew by 188 stores during Q3, comprised of 201 store openings and 21 closures. Over the past four quarters, we have added 742 net stores internationally. Turning to revenues, total revenues were up $38 million or 8.5% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of three factors. First, higher supply chain center food volumes driven by strong U.S. comps as well as increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our global store reimaging program. These supply chain increases were partially offset by lower commodity prices. Second, higher domestic same-store sales and store count growth resulted in increased royalties from our franchise stores and higher revenues at our company-owned stores. And finally, higher international royalties, again from increased same-stores sales and store count growth, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted us again this quarter by $5.5 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against most of our currencies. So far this year, foreign currency has negatively impacted revenues by $13.5 million. When we look at current projections, we now estimate that foreign currency could have an $18 million to $20 million negative impact on revenues for the full year 2015. You will note that this range is substantially higher than what we estimated back in January at our investor day. At that time, we gave you a range of between $8 million and $12 million, so foreign currencies have negatively impacted us to a much greater degree than any of us had expected. To put it in perspective, our 2015 global retail sales would have been more than $1 billion higher if we had used 2011 exchange rates. The good news in all of this is that we have continued to drive strong sales internationally and performed well on the bottom line despite this substantial headwind. And if currencies moderate over time, this could eventually become a nice tailwind for us. Now moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter decreased to 29.3% from 29.9% in the prior year quarter. The main driver of this decrease was the previously reported $5.7 million pre tax insurance charge reported in Q3. This was related to updated independent actuarial estimates for our casualty insurance program. This $0.06 per share charge was reported in cost of goods sold in both our supply chain and domestic stores segments. Consolidated operating margin was also pressured by the aforementioned foreign exchange headwinds, which does impact international margins. Operating margins benefited from lower commodity costs in the quarter and higher sales in all business segments. Looking at company-owned stores, operating margin there decreased to 19% from 23%, again driven primarily by the insurance charge, similarly supply chain margin decreased to 10.2% from 10.3% also due primarily to the insurance charge offset in part by lower commodity costs. As a reminder, commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar mark up to our franchisees, therefore lower commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar process, they do, however, positively impact our supply chain margin when looked at as a percentage of revenues. The average cheese block price in the third quarter was $1.69 per pound versus $2.04 in the same period last year. This led to our overall market basket decreasing 5.7% as compared to the prior year quarter. Based on current forecast, we now expect that commodities we use will be down approximately 5% to 7% in 2015 compared to 2014 levels. Let’s now shift to G&A. G&A increased by $4.8 million in the third quarter versus the prior year quarter due to several factors. Our planned investments in our team primarily in e-commerce, technology, and international drove most of this increase. Our higher same-store sales also led to increases in volume driven expenses such as variable performance based compensation, company-owned store advertising, and franchisee incentives. As we have noted before, this 2015 fiscal year does include an extra week. We continue to project that our G&A will be in the range of $270 million to $275 million for the 53-week year. We estimate that the extra week will drive approximately $4 million of this G&A expense. Switching to income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 37.6% for the quarter. We continue to expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our third quarter net income was up $2.2 million. This 6.2% increase was primarily driven by higher comps, both domestically and internationally, global store growth, and increased supply chain volumes. Our improved results were partially offset by the negative impact of the insurance charge and foreign currency exchange rates. Our third quarter diluted EPS was $0.67, this is a $0.04 or 6.3% increase from the $0.63 EPS in the third quarter of last year. Here’s how that $0.04 difference breaks down. The insurance charge negatively impacted us by $0.06. Foreign currency negatively impacted us by another $0.06. Lower dilutive share count primarily due to our share repurchases benefited us by $0.01 and most importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.15. Now turning to our use of cash. We repurchased and retired approximately 365,000 shares for $41 million or an average price of approximately $112 per share during the quarter. We also returned more than $16 million to our shareholders in the form of our quarterly dividend. Overall, our global momentum again resulted in great comps and store growth. Thank you for your time today. And now I’ll turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. I’m proud to be reporting the third quarter as mostly more of the same. The business and brand continue to thrive as a top performer in the industry and franchisees, both domestic and abroad continually impress me with the way they meet the challenge of sustained success as they continue to pile up points from the scoreboard. I believe the fundamental strength of our business is the foundation of our success, despite some of the headwinds we faced this quarter. In fact, we were able to take those hits better precisely because we are growing so strongly. I am proud of our results and our continued product and technology innovation. Our strategies are working, fundamentals continue to strengthen and the results and returns to shareholders speak for themselves. Franchisees, store managers and our team members are simply getting the job done. Focussing on our domestic business our emphasis on innovation and execution continues to fuel tremendous brand momentum. Franchisees and corporate store operators are all in executing at the highest level I have seen during my time as CEO, notably related to service and for our franchisees strategic growth. Because of this, we delivered strong double digit performance marking our 18th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales in the U.S. and continue to move forward on domestic store growth. We are also closing in nicely in our goal of having 2000 stores in the U.S. reimaged by year end. There is never a better time to grow within Dominos and franchisee profitability well on its way – is well on its way to surpassing average EBITDA of $100,000 per store for 2015. And I am pleased to see more and more franchisees understand that and act upon it as we see the strong return on investment generating increasing store growth. After thoughtful planning and testing, we announced our first nationwide loyalty program early in the fourth quarter, both the intent and execution are simple, sign up order on-line or via mobile app and start earning points towards free pizza. We’ve seen what loyalty programs do for customers across many different industries and it was time for us to get in the game. We expect to drive order frequency and connect with customers through our unmatched digital experience. We take the same strategic approach with menu expansion and believe it is best to take our time when launching new products with the full intention of their remaining permanent menu items. Our marbled cookie brownie which launched in mid September is a good example of that, and we are excited to introduce our first dessert item in over five years. Switching to technology, the story continues to be about investing in innovation. Technology is now an absolutely critical part of our brand and an undeniable element of what Dominos stands for. We don’t just talk about innovating, it’s generating real results. And for the second time this year we are using national television to promote a technology driven message. We are promoting and continuing to introduce many digital platforms available to customers including text and tweet to order, Smart TV, Smart Watch, Ford SYNC and voice ordering via our virtual ordering assistant, Dom. These platforms are unmatched technology first and have been effective in keeping Dominos top of mind and at the forefront of the digital curve something we are very proud of. We are seeing the positive impact of our online pizza profiles. In just over two years since the launch, 40% of our digital users have now created a profile and are able to use its many benefits including easy order, saved order and payment information and now our loyalty program. So continuing the theme of keeping the momentum going especially within the technology space, we are proud of our position as a digital leader. We respect the technology’s impact on our performance and results, and we continue to make the investments needed to maintain this lead. Turning to our international division, the segment performed yet again, with very strong sales comp of 7.7% and stand out sales performances included the U.K. Australia and Canada and we are pleased with the unit growth in India and Japan among others. Here is an impressive number regarding store growth. 742 net store openings on a 12-month trailing basis helped by a solid showing in the third quarter of 180 net openings. We have now exceeded 7000 total stores outside of the U.S. This milestone is a credit to our master franchisees who continue to introduce and grow the Dominos brand in both developed and emerging markets across the globe in remarkable fashion. One of those new markets which we just announced on Monday is one that may know a thing or two about pizza, Italy. We are excited to be partnering with our master franchisee e-pizza which will operate Dominos locations under the name, Dominos Pizza Italia beginning this week from its first store in Milan. The current plan is to open three stores in Milan by year’s end so while the market will take its time and is certainly in its infancy one thing is for certain, Italy loves it pizza as the Italians reportedly eat it seven times a month. As was noted by e-pizza’s management in this week’s announcement, we also continue to work together with our master franchisees to help them grow their digital presence or reach full digital capability within their market. We currently have 11 markets using their global online ordering platform with digital sales mix and participating markets increasing rapidly. I’m not only pleased to see digital growth in most markets but I’m particularly encouraged to see the results of our collaboration with master franchisees come to life. In closing, our sales and growth continue to demonstrate unparallel strength and sustain success despite facing headwinds. We’ve proven we will be strategic in our decisions and growth plans. We’ve proven we will innovate, we’ve proven to have an industry leading international model and we’ve proven we will continue to respect and aggressively pursue the challenge of sustaining our success. Thanks for your time and I’ll now open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley
John Glass: Thanks very much. In the spirit of understanding, you don't want to talk about the current debt offering, is there any way or anything you can say about how philosophically you view returning that amount of cash to investors?
Patrick Doyle: John, I really can’t get into that right now as we are kind of in the middle of that process.
John Glass: Got it. And then – so on these two other things, then one small and one larger. One, just on the insurance charge on this quarter, I understand where it came from. Is that recurring? Was that a catch up, how does one pick those numbers and think about the P&L going forward?
Patrick Doyle: I think there are really a couple of things there. I mean first what is most important is that our team members get home safely, and we had a couple of very serious accidents that drove essentially half of that charge. One was right at the end of the covered period as we went into kind of the actuarial study that we have done annually in the past, infact we are going to do that twice a year going forward now which you know should help smooth out any movement on that. That charge, we’ve gone through the same process every year in the past, we do it once a year and we’ve never had a change on that accrual of more than half a million to a million dollars. So -- the big move and there were two accidents that drove a lot of it. But I will tell you at the beginning of the year we had an increase in frequency of incidents, and some of the severity of incidents, and we take that very seriously. The trend is already getting better on that, but we’ve got to manage that closely and carefully and most importantly because we want everybody who is working for us to get home safely at the end of the day. So you know some of that is hopefully going to be more in the one-time category as long as we can manage this carefully going forward. That would be -- our expectation is that we would get it back down. I will tell you that we have had a long term trend of being flat to down on incidents in the system, and it was troublesome that it picked up. So we’re on top of it, we are going to manage it carefully, you know I can’t emphasize enough what matters more than anything is that people are getting home safely and we’re going to aggressively manage it going forward.
John Glass: Thanks for that. If I could just sneak in one more. Patrick, you said that you were advertising nationally, I think you said for the first time sort of your digital capacity and all the different ways you can order. Is it true, is that what you said and was that a fourth quarter event or did you do that during the third quarter? And if it was during the third quarter, you know is that the kind of thing that really gives a breakthrough message and gives increases or gives a step function up of digital orders as a percentage of the total?
Patrick Doyle: Yes I think some of that platform, and as we were talking about kind of anywhere came right at the end of the third quarter. You know but this is the first time we’ve gone out and really talked about how all of these different places that you can order through Dominos and make it as easy as possible for people to access our brands, but this is really about the fourth quarter. It may have hit right at the end of the third, but effectively it started early in the fourth quarter.
John Glass: Okay, right. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton Stump: Thank you and good morning.
Jeff Lawrence: How are you Alton?
Alton Stump: Too good, thanks. I guess just looking back on the operational front, obviously there is a fair amount of noise of currency and also the insurance claims in the quarter. But as you look at what's driving your comp performance, obviously, I want to talk about technology, have you seen any difference in the pace that's even better now than it was couple of quarters ago that you're seeing as a comp lift from technology or is it slowing down, I just wanted to sort of get your update on how much of a lift we're seeing or what the pace of that lift is coming from technology on comps in general?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes. We feel very good about it clearly, and you know the comps both domestically and internationally were obviously extremely strong. I think there is – we continue to find new ways to drive the business with technology, what we're able to do with the analytics around the technology as people are on these digital platforms are terrific. But I'll tell you the other thing that just adds into this tremendously is the overall momentum in the business, the energy from our franchisees, the level of execution as we're driving success overall, there is a certain amount of the success that we're experiencing right now that frankly can only be contributed to kind of the collective momentum within the system. It's driving terrific profitability for the franchisees as we've said in the script. Our expectation after 89,000 of profits last year as average for our domestic franchisees, our expectation is that we will be 100 plus which has been a goal of ours for some time. And that means that they're excited, they're reinvesting, they are driving the business forward, so there are lot of things that are playing into this, but clearly digital continues to be front and center and it’s an important part of the story both domestically and internationally.
Alton Stump: That's helpful. And then just quick follow-up on that, just the loyalty program, how big of a deal you think that could be or could drive even higher comp growth even sort off the base or is it more about getting data back that you can use going forward, just some color on that would be great?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. it just started in the fourth quarter, so I really can't get into it, I guess what I would say is we wouldn't roll it nationally if we didn't think it was going to be a positive contributor to our success going forward, but its really a fourth quarter event.
Alton Stump: Got you. Make sense. Thank, Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you, Alton.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs
Karen Holthouse: Hi. Congratulations on another fantastic quarter, guys.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you, Karen.
Karen Holthouse: So, one quick housekeeping question and then a real question. Can we get the breakdown of that insurance charged between the company's store line item and the supply chain?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, Karen, the overall charge on a pretax basis was $5.7 million, $4.3 million of that was reported in cost of goods sold. In the domestic store segment where team USA our corporate operations reside and $1.4 million of it was booked in supply chain.
Karen Holthouse: And then, one of the actually quick insurance question, is there any chance that if you says there is a handful accents that were at the beginning of the year that weather might have played a factor in that and we could hope for reversal next year?
Patrick Doyle: No.
Karen Holthouse: Okay.
Patrick Doyle: I mean, some of it can be attributed to simply the growth in the business that we've had and -- but at the end of the day the weather, I mean, its bad weather every winter. And so no – look we're going to manage aggressively. We have been as we saw it in the first quarter a couple of these were -- two were severe accidents that drove about half of this. But at the end of the day that's still not acceptable. We've got to manage it well and aggressively and we're doing that. Certainly it is our hope that we are going to get this back down. We're already seeing some good trend on that. But there are no excuses around this with weather or anything else. We've got to manage it aggressively.
Karen Holthouse: Great. And then, the real question, on the royalty program is it early enough that we can get any sense from test markets, what expectations around how incremental it could be to check a traffic? And then thinking the ramp what's sort of the plan for advertising and either to existing pizza profile or as to people who order digitally but on profiled versus broader just national advertising campaign for it?
Patrick Doyle: Karen, I think we can't into that, I mean, it's in the fourth quarter and I guess I'll repeat what I said to Alton. We wouldn't roll it out if we didn't believe in it, we've rolled it out nationally, but I'm not going to get anything, that's going to kind of indicate where we are with fourth quarter results.
Karen Holthouse: Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Peter Saleh with BTIG.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the discrepancy maybe between the company-owned store comps and the franchise comps, could any of that have been due to the loyalty test that you had in place?
Patrick Doyle: No. You're looking at about one point differential. And I guess what I would tell you is anything within a couple of points are being the same is frankly the range that we would generally expect. We're in seven or eight markets with our corporate stores, there is always going to be some kind of regional differentiation in terms of performance and anything within a couple of points between the two is I think kind of expected.
Peter Saleh: Great. And just last question, just talk about maybe little bit about the decision to launch a dessert item. Haven't launched a new dessert items in many years, but why launch dessert item rather than sticking with your core on something more innovative on the Pizza side?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Well, first of all, you may have notice we're not advertising it on television right now. We're advertising our digital and kind of the core of our business where the add dollars are going. So the Marbled Cookie Brownie is being done online and with prints. And I guess the bottom line for what do you do it is people like dessert. It is a nice add-on and generally when you're talking about something that is not center of the plate, it is going to have less effect on order growth than pizza or something that's kind of more the main meal. And this is something that is not happening within our television right now. So, the answer is this is more about kind of add-on. It's more about potentially driving a little bit of ticket. But the assumption of your question is correct, which is something like this is not going to be as focused on order count growth as perhaps pizza might be. We're advertising around access to the brands, digital innovation that's far more about order growth than the Marbled Cookie Brownie would be.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thank you very much.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer and Company.
Brian Bittner: Thanks. Congratulations guys. Question about the assets. I understand reimaging the assets may be a bit less important than a non-delivery Company. But now that you do have a pretty good amount of the domestic stores in this new image, are you in fact seeing a difference in the trends at the reimage set versus the rest of the assets at all?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I think it’s very consistent Brian with what we've said before is kind of what we're continuing to see which is an individual store getting reimaged will help the comp of that store by a point or two or three. When it gets done what is far more effective are important is the effect that it has on kind of maintaining overall momentum in the business and clearly with the comp growth that we're experiencing year-to-date were awfully pleased with the brand momentum. And we are continuing to see from that growth far more is coming out of order count growth than out of ticket. So this is about customers being excited about the experience that they're getting at Domino's and the reimaging of the stores clearly plays into that. So the individual effect on an individual store is relatively modest as we have said in the past. But we do believe that we are seeing in the results some of the overall effect of more and more of our system being reimaged.
Brian Bittner: Okay. And going back to the loyalty in the context of not what its impact is on the fourth quarter by any means, if you could just maybe just talk about it in general. How does the loyalty program that you've put in place exactly work for your customers? And maybe if you could just talk overall some things about this program that you are most excited about as you now put a loyalty program into the system?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. What I'm really most excited about Brian is the simplistic of the program. So basically you get 10 points for every order of over $10 and when you 60 points, so effectively 10 orders you're getting a free medium pizza. It's very simple, six orders, yes, so it's very simple and customers understand this and we have seen how it can affect other brands. We've done a lot of research on this in designing it and obviously we're optimistic about it or we wouldn't have rolled out nationally.
Brian Bittner: Got it. And it’s a type of -- so it’s a type of program where you know exactly what you need to do to get to an award. It is not -- a reward. It is not a surprise factor situation like some other brands are doing?
Patrick Doyle: No.
Brian Bittner: And it doesn't matter how large? Sorry.
Patrick Doyle: I'm going to say, one of things you learn from research on loyalty programs is they can get very complicated and you loss customers when they get too complicated and so this is very simple. Its transparent, people understand what they need to do. Fundamentally six orders over $10 gets you free medium pizza.
Brian Bittner: Make sense. All right. Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you, Brian.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions, maybe just first on the U.S. comp growth, it that looks like now we're talking about four consecutive quarters where you've actually done double-digit comp growth.
Patrick Doyle: We are.
Jeffrey Bernstein: And I know you don't offer much guidance, but I'm just wondering how you even think about growth from here, I mean, you mentioned the new national digital campaign which effectively started in 4Q in the loyalty program as well. But when you think about those comps going forward, I'm assuming like most of your peers the focus is more on the two and three-year trend to be fair and therefore, it would just seem like its hard to sustain that level of growth. And again I know you don't give guidance, but is it fair to say that you look at the two and three-year and you'd have a tough time from a capacity constrain perspective maintaining this type of double digit momentum?
Patrick Doyle: No. The capacity constrains issues is simply upside for us. It's something that can be dealt with. I will tell you that the best day a franchisee has or we have in our corporate stores is we have so much volume coming in that we need to add another oven or a longer make line or something like that to handle that capacity. And I'll go back to the comments that I made about our franchisees and the system. Overall, I am just extremely pleased with how they are executing. At some point if the volume coming into the store is simply too much to handle with the size of the overall store than you got an opportunity to add another store. You're seeing that as part of the increase in that store growth and that too is a great day when you look at a store and say, my volume and as a result my profits coming from the store are extremely strong and I think its time to add another store to handle some existing territory. Those are incredibly high class problems. So, look obviously we are really pleased with four quarters in a row of double-digit comps. And I would point out year-to-date our international business is north of 7% which if you look at our history going back 15 plus years that is as good that has been over that period of time as well and momentum is a power thing. So I guess what I would say is we wake up every morning and we're trying to figure out how do we sustain momentum and how do we keep the growth going in the business. We are never satisfied with the sales that we're getting. We always want more. We never satisfied with the execution we have in the store, even though we're pleased with where we are. It's our job to continue to look for more opportunities to reduce friction points for customers and it's our job to keep momentum going. And so obviously I can't go into what's happening within quarters or expectations going forward except to say that we are extraordinarily focused on keeping that momentum going.
Jeffrey Bernstein: No. That's tremendous. I assumed you were going to acknowledge the year ago compares, but it seems like it’s not necessarily just lapping at double-digit would imply you couldn't sustain this sequential momentum which is obviously a little more impressive. My other question was just on the labor line, which I know it doesn't get a lot of question because you're primarily franchise system, but from the company operate side there was some significant pressure on the third quarter. I'm assuming that pressure is probably seen by the franchisees as well. I was wondering whether you won't had any quantitative data on the current or projected labor inflation percentages you're seeing or whether in conversations with franchisees there is feeling, an inclination of price more aggressively to offset since like some other franchise system are talking about franchisees getting more aggressive to mitigate what could be significant prolong labor inflation. So just wondering what your kind of sense of the franchise community?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. So, on labor rates specifically around our company-owned store first, we saw a little bit of an uptake in that line. Some of it wage rate, some of it just higher bonuses as our performance in our corporate operations has been very good. On the franchisees side on balance we only have 375 corporate stores. I think the other 4800 or so are generally seeing kind of the same environment around wages. The other thing I'd say is kind of despite any wage inflation, we haven't seen a ton of wage inflation. I would say that our entrepreneur independent franchisees are going to manage through it. Last year when cheese was at in all time high they were able to put up their best ever on average unit economics in the 55-year history of the brand, we have a lot of great franchisees out there that really don't look for excuses, they are really just focused on managing and whether its food cost or labor line item they're going to managed through it, so we're not overly concerned about wages at the moment.
Jeff Lawrence: And the one thing I would add to that is rough the statement from before which is we believe we're well on the way to the $100,000 of EBITDA for the average franchisee, so overall different line items may move around on the P&L, but overall at the end of the day what we're looking at the most and certainly what our franchisees are looking at the most is what is the bottom line and the bottom line looks so far materially better in 2015 than it did in 2014 and 2014 was a record year.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Appreciate you easing those concerns. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Steve Anderson with Maxim Group.
Steve Anderson: Good morning. I have a couple of quick questions on foreign exchange. First wanted to ask was the impact of the foreign exchange in the third quarter known at the time of the pre-release? And wanted to ask why, if you didn't know why you weren't at liberty to discuss that. And I have a follow-up regarding guidance?
Jeff Lawrence: You know, on FX generally it’s been a headwind for us, every quarter this year the run rate on a material basis really wasn't that different than we seen over the past 12 months, so its going to be $18 million to $20 million based on our current estimate about three quarters of that, now we're at two, three quarter at the year. We've taken, but again, I don't think any surprise that FX is a headwind for us or any other QSR with international operation. And when you look at the basket we've got a real nice diversified basket of currencies. It is just that we find ourselves in 2015 where the dollar has decided to strengthen against darn near every single one of them. Despite that headwind we remained proud what we're able to do on the bottom line and we'll monitor going forward, but I don't think the FX in Q3 was any different on a run rate basis than we'd expected.
Steve Anderson: And what gives you the confidence to not increase the high end of that guidance, I mean, do you see any signs of moderation going forward?
Jeff Lawrence: Well, what we do, I mean, what we do is as far as our estimating process on FX is we basically subscribe to an independent kind of economist consensus around FX and we get all of the best thinking around where people think FX is going to go and that's how we drive our estimate. So we're not taking kind of our own personal view of the world or on FX market. We just think that you know it's been a headwind Q4 likely also to be headwind with the comment I made earlier that we expect this total tally in 2015 to be $18 million to $20 million. Again things can change, FX can change, but that's our best view over that at the moment.
Steve Anderson: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: Thank you. Can you hear me?
Patrick Doyle: Yes.
John Ivankoe: Okay, good. I'm sorry; I'm in a hotel room. Just regarding the question on labor earlier, obviously there was kind of increase in your company store labor cost I think a lot of that was due to incentive compensation, and my questions are several. As or has been that significant move towards digital ordering, what have you done with the labor in the store? Have you continued to reallocate the order takers to pizza makers, which have actually added capacity to their stores? Have you heard from franchisees that they actually think that they might be able to reduce the number of labor hours in the stores? And as we hear about minimum wages, at least from what I remember in the past, your drivers were paid kind of a full minimum wage; in other words as a non-tipped employee versus a tipped employee. In markets where the minimum wage might go to $15 an hour, your delivery driver turns into an extremely well-paid position, which I guess is fine. But do you actually have an opportunity to maybe classify some drivers perhaps as tipped employees where the minimum wage impact might not be as significant for the franchisee? Thanks.
Patrick Doyle: Yes. First of all, we do have some tip credit team members out there. And it's kind of a market by market decision. We're looking at what we need to pay to get great people in markets and that varies and obviously minimum wage varies, your ability to apply tipped credit and all varies state-by-state and sometimes city-by-city. And it various even more greatly with our franchisees who are making their own decisions on their compensation, and so, there is a lot of variation on that. And at the end of the day, we've got to pay at a level that's going to get us great team members and ultimately that's also going to include what their tips are going to be as drivers and that also varies market-to-market. And frankly as we look at their overall compensation we're taking into account kind of the level of average tipping in different markets, because we know that's going to be part of their decision, they're going to make whether or not they're going to work for us and what their total compensation picture is going to look like. In terms of labor and digital and kind of efficiency in the stores, I will tell you that there is still inefficiency in the stores, there are still opportunity to get better and how we manage our labor, but we have enormous advantage in our platform with our know-how with digital to be able to run our stores efficiently. When we were first getting digital ordering going, I will tell you that we expected labor efficiency faster than we saw it. We didn't really start seeing a lot of labor efficiency in the stores until we got to kind of this 15% to 20% digital order range. We were looking very carefully when we were kind of single digit 10% and we really, we had to look awfully hard to see it. And the reality is that you've got a fixed amount of labor in stores to cover shifts, to cover the basic functions in the store and when it was a relatively low level, our digital orders, your ability to offset labor was pretty minimal. As its gotten higher we started to see more impact from that and we're in the range now with digital sales around 50% that we clearly can see some savings in the store. What's maybe more important than that though is not just the labor savings, its kind of the overall profitability of digital orders. And what's most important on that is order comp growth. As customer experience the ability to drive frequency retention of those customers that ultimately what drivers better overall economics in the stores. Volume order counts, happy customers ultimately has more affect than labor savings or anything else. So, we believe given our the strength of our digital platform it puts us in certainly a better than average position to kind of manage kind of the overall cost structure, particularly if we see change in that going forward and we continue to make investments that hopefully we're going to continue to create even more competitive advantage around that.
John Ivankoe: Thanks great. Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Smith with Feltl and Company.
Mark Smith: Hi. Good morning, guys. Two quick ones. First, just looking at pricing, it looks like you had bit of an increase in ticket, but mostly traffic. Can you guys get more ticket or take price increases in today's kind of competitive environment?
Patrick Doyle: We've some ticket and go back to the comments I made about Marbled Cookie Brownie. That helps getting ticket. Fundamentally you have two ways of doing it. You can sell more food or you can increase price. If you can get it by selling more food that's going to help the overall profitability of the order and it is also something not going to negatively impact the customer in any way. But I think my overall take is customers are smarter today, more careful about how they are spending their money post the downturn in 2008, 2009 and that hasn't changed. They've got access to more pricing information. They are making smarter decisions and that's ultimately a great thing that helps us because we create great value. But in terms of is there significant pricing power for us, no, there is not. I don't think you can take aggressive price in this economy right now and not expect that’s it’s going to hit your order counts. So you know we do it very judiciously, when we can we try to take it by selling more food as opposed to directly increasing price, but you know both of those play in and the majority of the pricing decision is made locally by the store. They honor the national price point but the majority of the sales are being done off a local price points, local menu pricing, local coupons that are being chosen and that gives you an ability to adapt the kind of local market conditions both customer demand and the cost structure that’s in place market by market.
Mark Smith: And you spoke to my second question a little bit. When you do see a current order with dessert, is it typically incremental to the check or do customers cut a little bit out of their order to fit in that desert? And I guess just looking at marbled cookie brownie if you do move to marketing that, should we expect that to be purely incremental or will people cut something else out?
Patrick Doyle: You know you hope for it to be as incremental as possible obviously and we wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t incremental. Can you see it cannibalizing a little bit?
Mark Smith: Sure.
Patrick Doyle: And you know and we have a terrific lave cakes and you would expect to see a little bit of it come out of the lava cakes. But we wouldn’t do it if we didn’t think that it was going to be largely incremental.
Mark Smith: Okay, excellent. Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of David Carlson with KeyBanc
David Carlson: Hey thank you. I've got a couple questions for you guys and I appreciate you guys taking the question. Jeff, first on the commissary segment, I realize that $1.4 million of insurance claims was included in the costs during the quarter. But even when we adjust that out the supply chain segment profit was shy of our expectations and was about $1.7 million below the profit generated in the first two quarters of 2015. So I know cheese prices were about $0.10 to $0.15 higher in the third quarter than they were in the first two quarters of 2015, which I mean in all honesty would have expected that to result in significantly higher revenue than what you guys reported. So really hoping you could discuss some of the moving pieces and parts of the supply chain and some of the factors that may be impacting profitability.
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, so on supply chain if you just look at the margin and you know supply chain margins $31 million for the third quarter. A year ago it was about $29 million, we obviously have a bunch of flow through from volumes you know most of our comp increases in the quarter and year-to-date have been from traffic as opposed to ticket. You do have the insurance charge as you mentioned. Other than that, you know it’s not going to really material they are really fixed out to us, it was a little bit down as a percentage, the operating margin as a percentage of revenues, but again, we attribute that more to the insurance charge and anything. We are not seeing big big changes and things like you know labor rates or things like that. So really have nothing, nothing really incremental this year with – it’s a good business for us. It’s a good business for our franchisees, they get great product better than they can buy it anywhere else. And it’s got a good ROI for the business, but other than that insurance charge really nothing else to point out.
David Carlson: Okay. And then I know you guys are -- I think my question on the loyalty program is probably a little bit more general and not necessarily specific to the fourth quarter. But can you guys discuss the plan to convert user profiles to loyalty members? Are you guys offering any incentives, let's say, anything like that, just any sort of information that you can provide?
Patrick Doyle: It’s really is all they have to do is click a box on their pizza profile. And so we make that as simple for them as we possibly can.
David Carlson: And you said 40% of the digital users include pizza profiles?
Patrick Doyle: Correct.
David Carlson: Okay. And then just out of curiosity how much did the digital mix increase during the third quarter. I know this is the quarter you usually were supposed to start increasing once people go back to school etcetera?
Patrick Doyle: Yeah except that you really see that in the fourth quarter, so still very consistent.
David Carlson: It’s around 50%.
Patrick Doyle: Yep.
David Carlson: Thank you, guys.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bank of America.
Joseph Buckley: Thank you. Couple of follow up questions. Just on the insurance charges will you be accruing at a higher level going forward about thinking about next year and maybe the out years?
Jeff Lawrence: Yes, so and as Patrick mentioned earlier we are all hands on deck on ensuring that the financial picture around insurance doesn't repeat itself as far as kind of this, this little blip we had. But more importantly it’s about getting team members home safely. Our run rate going forward it will also largely be determined kind of by an actuarial estimate for the next fiscal year we expect that to be you know marginally up from our historical run rate just because of those the increase that we had earlier this year and some of the severity that we saw, we don’t think that’s going to be a materially higher run rate and again I think that again as Patrick mentioned to the extent that we are successful in managing through this I think we are going to get it down to the long term run rate over time. So I don’t expect it to be a material headwind for us or an increase really in 2016 maybe a little bit but again that will be kind of done with our independent actuary coming up in the next couple of months.
Joseph Buckley: Got it, thank you. And then a question on the supply center revenues. You mentioned equipment sales to franchisees as the reimages, remodels occur and I guess also maybe the new unit openings. Can you tell us what portion of the supply chain revenues that is and what is the margin on that, is that a profitable sale for you?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, no its – so first of all we haven’t broken out exactly what those sales are, but the answer is net of the people that we needed to add to manage this process of going through the reimaging and it will have no positive or negative effect on our bottom line P&L. So, you know what you kind of guess that is should you worry about whether or not as we finish the reimaging whether or not there will be a drop off in profits because we are no longer selling the equipment for the reimage as the answer is no. You shouldn’t worry about that because net of the people we needed to add to manage through the process it has no positive or negative effect on our profitability.
Joseph Buckley: Got it. Thank you. And then Patrick, just a big picture question. We are seeing lots of companies; lots of brands announce delivery relationships. And not every business lends itself to delivery like the pizza business has. And it is in the genes of the business long term. But I am curious what you would think about this movement towards delivery, just broadly, and what maybe are some of the things that some of these companies or brands will have to deal with that is just a natural part of your business, but is going to be some new consideration on their side?
Patrick Doyle: Yes well first clearly we are kind of the world leaders in real time delivery. We’ve been doing it a long time, we are very efficient at it and we’ve got a lot of system built up around that particularly operationally. And I guess what I would say is there are a lot of people who have gotten into the space. My understanding is that as it relates to moving packages and food, very few if any of them are today making money doing that. There are folks that are doing pretty well out there moving people around, but I think people are learning that you know moving packages around and the scale that you need to do that it’s not easy. And you know there are real operational complexicities to it beyond kind of building the software platform to do it. So we are really good at it as people have tried to compete with us around the world in delivery I think they have found out overtime that it’s operationally not as easy to operate as people may think and it has been a great source of advantage for us versus our competition both. What we are able to do with the digital platform and the scale of our business and the ability to spread those costs across the system has built a pretty effective competitive advantage for us as people have tried to get into physically moving food or packages around – I think they are finding that the economies or scale on that are pretty tough. So we watch it closely, and you know both domestically and around the world but we are pretty confident of our ability to do it awfully well and as you are aware we’ve been investing heavily to continue to drive efficiencies for us in doing it.
Joseph Buckley: And, Patrick, another kind of big picture question, is the movement towards delivery of restaurant meals more advanced internationally? Yum! was talking about this yesterday with respect to its China business. And I am just kind of curious given your international footprint, and I know China is not a very critical market for you at this point, but if you seeing delivery outside the U.S. gaining traction faster?
Patrick Doyle: Yeah, I think you know certainly if you look at China, you’ve seen both KFC and McDonald’s in major cities have done delivery. And you know that’s still less common for them across their system than more common. So as China I think has done a little bit more at the forefront for those brands in moving the delivery. There's certainly lots of aggregators out there for kind of digital ordering and most of which are not as significant scale yet and then you’ve – I think from kind of the delivery service side, there are certainly markets where that’s moving faster than others but I don’t know that I would say it’s materially different in international than it is in the U.S. I don’t know if it’s any more advanced in a lot of these markets than what we are seeing in the U.S. Our business in China – we’re still under a 100 stores but we continue to be pleased with the progress we are making there but you know obviously it is still a relatively small business for us.
Joseph Buckley: Thank you. I appreciate that perspective.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Joe.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue at this time.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you everybody. I look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day in January as well as discussing our fourth quarter earnings and year-end results on February 25th.
Operator: This does conclude today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-07-16 10:00:00) =====

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And I would like to turn the conference over to Lynn Liddle. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.
Lynn Liddle: Thanks, Jennifer, appreciate it. We are very happy to be here with all of you to discuss our second quarter earnings. And as is our usual practice, I have with me today, our Chief Executive Officer, Patrick Doyle; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lawton. They will have some prepared comments and then we will open it up for Q&A. As usual we would ask the members of the press to be in listen-only mode, since this is primarily for investors. And I will turn all of your attention to our forward-looking statements – Safe Harbor statement in our press release in the event that any forward-looking statements are made. So with that, I would like to turn it over to Mike for some opening comments.
Mike Lawton: Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we once again delivered solid results for our shareholders. Our domestic and international divisions posted very strong same-store sales growth. We opened a significant number of new stores and our EPS grew 20.9% over the prior year. We are pleased with this earnings growth particularly in the face of strong foreign exchange headwinds. Global retail sales which are our total retail sales at franchising company owned stores grow wide grew 7.5%. When we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 14.9%. The drivers of this growth included domestic same-store sales which rose by 12.8% in the quarter. The increase this quarter was comprised of franchisees same-store sales which were up 12.8% and company-owned stores which were up 12.5% and this was due primarily to strong order growth. We also saw some ticket growth during the quarter. We are pleased to report that we opened 14 net domestic stores in the second quarter consisting of 22 store openings and 8 closures. Over the past four quarters, we have opened 96 net domestic stores. Our international division had another strong quarter as same-store sales grew 6.7% lapping a prior year quarter increase of 7.7%. Our international division also grew by 172 stores made up of 178 store openings and 6 closures. Over the past four quarters we have added 708 stores outside the United States. Turning to revenues, total revenues were up $38.2 million or 8.5% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of three factors. First, higher domestic same-store sales and store count growth which resulted in increased royalties from our franchise stores and higher revenues at our company-owned stores. Second, higher supply chain center food volumes as well as increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our store reimaging program. These supply chain volume increases were partially offset by lower commodity prices. And third, higher international royalties again from increased same-store sales and store count growth, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 31.2% from 29.9% in the prior year quarter. The main drivers included improved company-owned store operating margins which benefited us from lower food cost and food cost leverage and fixed cost leverage. This margin increased as a percentage of revenues from 23% to 25.6%. Our supply chain margin percentage increased from 10.5% to 10.9% primarily from a decrease in commodity prices. As a reminder, commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar mark-up to our franchisees. Therefore, lower commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, positively impact our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues. The average cheese block price in the second quarter was $1.59 per pound versus $2.20 per pound in the same quarter last year, which lead to our overall market basket decreasing 8.9% as compared to the prior year quarter. Although, we expect cheese and chicken prices to average higher in the second half of the year than in the first half, we still expect the commodities we use will be down 4% to 6% in 2015 from 2014 levels. Currency exchange rates negatively impacted us this quarter by $4.5 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against most currencies. Based on current projections we continue to estimate that foreign currency could have a $14 million to $20 million negative impact on pre-tax earnings in 2015. Again, for perspective, we estimate that 1% strengthening of the dollar against our basket of currencies as roughly $0.015 to $0.02 negative impact on our full year EPS. Now, I will cover our G&A expenses. G&A increased by $7.2 million in the second quarter versus the prior year quarter due to several factors. Our higher same-store sales led to increases in volume driven expenses such as variable performance based compensation, company-owned store advertising and franchisee incentives. Additionally, we made plan to increase ecommerce and technology support. We have mentioned before that we charge transaction fees to stores to recoup a portion of the G&A cost of supporting our digital ordering platform. I will note here that we recently increased our transaction fee from $0.17 per order to $0.21. Based on our current volumes, the $0.21 fee amounts to approximately $1.5 million to $2 million in revenue for four week period. We do not anticipate additional rate increases in the near-term. As we noted before, this year includes an extra week. We continue to project that our G&A will be in the range of $200 million to $275 million for this 53-week year. We estimate that the extra week will drive approximately $4 million of this expense. Keep in mind too, that our G&A expense for the year can vary up or down by among other things. Our performance versus our plan as that effects variable performance based compensation expense. Switching to income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 37.3% for the quarter. We continued to expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our second quarter net income was up $7.4 million, this 19.4% increase was primarily driven by higher domestic and international same-store sales, global store growth and supply chain volumes. Our improved results were partially offset by the negative impact to foreign currency exchange rates. Our second quarter diluted EPS was $0.81, there were no significant items affecting comparability during the quarter. The $0.81 is a $0.14 or 20.9% increase from the $0.67 EPS in the second quarter of last year. Here is how that $0.14 difference breaks down. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.05. Lower interest expense benefited us by $0.01, lower diluted share count primarily due to share repurchases benefited us by $0.01 and importantly our improved operating results benefited us by $0.17. Now turning to our use of cash; during the second quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 638,000 shares at a cost of $68 million or an average price of $106.84 per share. We also returned more than $17 million to our shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend. Before I conclude, I'd like to address a couple of questions we've been frequently asked about. First, regarding our investments in technology, we would like to mention that we are testing our customer loyalty program at one market and as many of you are aware, a portion of our existing debt is callable on October, we continue to monitor the debt markets and evaluate all options regarding our capital structure. Overall, our stronger momentum continued in the second quarter and we are very pleased with our results. Thank you for your time today and now I'll turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my commentary with a bit of an obvious statement disclaimer and here it goes, it was a fantastic quarter for Domino's. You don't have to look too far to find many areas we can point to all truly contributing to the fundamental strength of the business. Brand momentum that continues to reach new heights, sustain robust domestic same-store-sales; great global store growth that continued with our trailing 12 month's net store openings of now over 800; rock solid performance from international with two new market openings; unmatched technology innovation demonstrating some of the highest levels of creative forward thinking in all of retail and a business model providing strong unit economics and continued franchise profitability around the globe as well as outstanding returns to our shareholders. This global momentum helped us deliver nearly 21% adjusted EPS growth despite the ongoing headwinds of foreign exchange. We've now had 17 consecutive quarters of positive same-store-sales domestically and our outstanding streak of positive consecutive quarters in international has now reached to 86. So using another rather obvious statement, we're very, very pleased with our second quarter focusing on our thriving domestic business. I continue to be impressed and proud of the performance of our U.S. franchisees and corporate store operators. Strong operations, record 2014 franchise profitability as well as impressive franchisee action on the progress of store reimages have laid the foundation for terrific morale and momentum within our domestic system. Our 12.8% same-store sales comp is a reflection of just that, combined with a consistent brand message that continues to remind America that this new Domino's experience is much more than just pizza. The genuine approach of listening and responding to customers going back over five years to the launch of our new and inspired pizza has become a critical pizza of what Domino's stands for and is clearly a huge element of our brand strength. We have used customer feedbacks to remain disciplined and strategic on the new product front and will continue working on and rolling out permanent menu items when it makes sense for our customers and operators. We have applied customer feedback to our pizza theater design and are pleased to say that we plan to reimage an additional 1000 stores domestically this year bringing this welcoming layout to many more customers across the nation. And most recently customer interest was a factor in partnering with Apple to launch Domino's Tracker App for Apple Watch becoming the first U.S. pizza company to bring this order tracking capability to Apple Watch devices. We will continue listening and responding to our customers. And speaking of apps and devices, we can't highlight our fundamental strength and momentum without further discussing technology, an element that gives us the competitive advantage and contributes towards our gaining market share. While the world of digital could be quite a competitive one and the tech to table space we pioneered is ever evolving one thing is evident. We have not and we will not stop innovating. Domino's continues to capture the attention of America with a truly creative approach to unique innovative ordering platforms. Last quarter, I told you about ordering via Twitter, which along with our agency CP+B was recently honored with the Titanium Grand Prix award at Cannes Lions 2015 and now I'm excited to say that by using a pizza emoji you can now place your Domino's easy order via text message. So we continue to gain ground on our goal of giving customers the ability to order from us any time, any place. As we learn more about our digital customer I can't stress enough that the primary benefit of this platform is the customer experience. This certainly helps promote frequency. Once you try digital, it's hard to go back to anything else and that is ultimately a credit to our talented development team. Our line-up now includes the ability to create a personalized pizza profile and toward an easy order, the benefit of seeing our entire menu, voice ordering via Dom, our virtual ordering assistant, Domino's tracker and list goes on and on. Our focus remains on investing in this experience and preserving that customer frequency which is a much greater benefit for us than nominal ticket increases and labor cost reductions. Maintaining this focus is what has helped us maintain our lead within the space. On the international front, we simply continued to put up rock solid results and turns in a terrific second quarter. Same-store sales were very strong as was the performance of our master franchisees and operators across the globe. Recent standout markets included Australia, Canada, Brazil and the U.K. The results demonstrate continued global success as we have now reached 86 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth in international a phenomenal streak. We were very pleased with 172 net store openings in the second quarter as well as new market openings in Georgia and Portugal. Here is the fun fact, Portugal's first ever order was a digital one, which serves as a good segue to note that we continue to share best digital practices with our master franchisee partners and learn from one another. Markets outside of U.S. are doing about 40% of sales from digital channels and while there are markets showing high levels of experience and excellence on the digital front, the opportunity exist to introduce and grow technology within many others. We look forward to helping our master franchisees established a digital presence or reached full digital capability within their market. I spoke earlier about our store reimage progress which goes well beyond the domestic market. We now have nearly 3000 pizza theatre stores completed outside of the U.S. and 16 international markets with all locations fully reimaged. The positive international story at Domino's is nothing new. But, I continue to be encouraged by the master franchisee leadership, unit economics, same-store sales and unit growth across the globe. The overall strength of the business within both developed and emerging markets continues to impress. To summarize, the second quarter our momentum and fundamental strength set the foundation for a strong first half of 2015. The Domino's brand according to a recent Millward Brown BrandZ Top 10-Year Risers study with the best performing restaurants and ranked number four overall, just behind the likes of Apple and Amazon. This accolade, we believe was result of our innovative forward thinking on all fronts, our honest, accountable communication and most importantly, our entrepreneurial culture that is anything, but complacent and faces the challenge of sustaining success head-on. Our brand strength in global momentum is driving results and I couldn't be more proud of our team across the globe, a team that is simply getting it done. Before I move on and open it up for questions, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the other important announcement we made this morning, the transition of our Chief Financial Officer position. From Mike Lawton, who has announced his retirement as of the end of August to Jeff Lawrence, who is a seasoned Domino's leader and highly deserving this promotion. As I stated in our release I simply can't say enough great things about either of these guys. Mike has been a colleague and true friend for many years since I recruited him from our former company Gerber Products. We've had so much to thank him for from running our international division for over six years to the times we accounted on him to pin shift and run both IT and supply chain when we needed him most. His leadership and measured intelligent approach to any broad business issue have been a huge contributing factor to this company's success. His shoes will be tough to fill, but I am confident there is a person equipped to do so and it's Jeff. Jeff is currently our treasurer and has been with Domino's for 15 years in finance and leadership roles on both our U.S. and international fronts. He has been an integral player in past debt refinancings and our initial public offering. Many of you in the investment community have already come to know him and those who haven't certainly will soon. And my sincere congratulations go to both of you Mike and Jeff. And now I'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull with KeyBanc.
Q - Chris O: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Cull: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Patrick Doyle: Good morning, Chris.
Q - Chris O: Patrick there has been several ordering and delivery solutions that have been started in many cities the past year, are you seeing any solution out there that has affected any of your markets?
Cull: Patrick there has been several ordering and delivery solutions that have been started in many cities the past year, are you seeing any solution out there that has affected any of your markets?
Patrick Doyle: No.
Q - Chris O: Okay. That's great. And then it appears the percentage of the orders though from the digital platform isn't increasing as fast as they had in the past, is that true? It seems like its stuck just under 50% and can you talk about how you are improving that conversion rate?
Cull: Okay. That's great. And then it appears the percentage of the orders though from the digital platform isn't increasing as fast as they had in the past, is that true? It seems like its stuck just under 50% and can you talk about how you are improving that conversion rate?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Well, all of the things that we talked about what are ultimately driving the conversion rates and really what we've seen in the past is in the fall you see really an increase in digital ordering percentages we've seen that every year, we saw it again this year kind of from the beginning of the fourth quarter into the beginning of first quarter and then it tends to frankly flatten out over the course of the next six or eight months until people start going back in doors again and students go back to university and people kind of seeing the change their ordering habits around that time of year. So you are right in the observation that it hasn't gone up in the last quarter or two but that's actually consistent with what we've seen every year.
Q - Chris O: Okay. Thank you.
Cull: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.
Mike Tamas: Hi, great, thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. You mentioned that balance sheet briefly and just wanted to ask you a question about the leverage it seem to hit the lower end of your target 3% to 6% range. So can you talk about any possibility you are taking on additional leverage at some point and then how would you envision using that additional capital whether would be another special dividend or significant more buybacks? Thanks.
Mike Lawton: As I said in the script we've got the opportunity to refinance one-third of our debt in October and it's fairly clear that the debt markets are in very, very good shape right now so it's something that we'll be evaluating. That's really all I can say at this point.
Mike Tamas: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.
Karen Holthouse: Hi, congratulations on another fantastic quarter. Looking at the global unit growth, the global unit growth year-over-year we continue to push a little bit past the high end of the guidance range from January and how should we think about that as something, is there a seasonality piece to that or the particular market driving that strength thinking just what that pace could look like over the balance of the year?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I think, and Karen you're clearly right, I mean from a straight numbers perspective we're a little bit above that range. I think what drives it ultimately are unit economics and we're having a terrific year both domestically and internationally and as unit economics continue to improve, capital continues to free up the built stores, opportunities for building stores with higher volumes at – kind of the new sales and profitability levels continue to open up. And that's part of [why strength] [ph] that you are seeing in not only on the international side, but on the domestic side if you look at kind of the trialing 12-month net store growth. You are continuing to see momentum build for new stores domestically and frankly you are continuing to see store closures really get down to a very, very low number in the U.S. So really the way to think about it is, it's a reflection of unit economics. And my view that I think I have expressed before is stores get built because they should be built. And because there is an expectation that they are going to generate a great return and fundamental analysis of any heavily franchised restaurant company has to really start by looking at the unit economics for the franchisees and if those are strong and franchisees are prospering then ultimately the franchisor is going to prosper and frankly the inverse is true. So our franchisees are doing really well that is always our first and primary focus and because they are doing well, our store growth continues to accelerate.
Karen Holthouse: And as I guess a quick follow-up to that the dollar thing that often comes up and talking about unit growth potential and I think one of the reasons that guidance at some point switched from a number of units to a percentage of units is just human capital is sort of throttle on how many units can be built effectively. How much insight do you have to make sure that unit economics or how long on enticing franchisees to maybe get a little bit over the [SKUs] [ph] in terms of where the number of managers and GMs and Area Managers and such really is in the system?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I think the rate and pace that you are seeing on growth overall in our system is really not constrained right now largely by that. There are a few markets where we have seen that in the past. I think there was a period of time in India, where we were doing kind of north of 25% store growth and that gets tough and the math is pretty simple. When you are north of 25% store growth that means not only does – do every four stores need to generate a new general manager but you also have to replace any turnover in those stores, which pretty commonly around the world is kind of in the 25% rate. So it kind of means, on average if you are growing that fast and you are replacing turnover, you might need a new manager out of every two stores over the course of the year and that seems to be a point at which it starts to be a bit of a barrier. Now you bring your resources and training and recruiting and you do everything you can to kind of push through that. But, so it's really more kind of a market-by-market sort of constraint as opposed to an overall global. We [stay] [ph] clearly in the U.S. We are not even anywhere close to a pace that where we would feel that. And there have been a couple of international markets in the past where I think that has been a bit more constraining and you also see a particularly early in markets just when the absolute numbers of stores, you got 10 stores in a market and you want to grow to 20 over the course of the year that's tough you are at 100 and you want to add 10 that's much easier.
Karen Holthouse: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
John Glass: Thanks. Good morning. And congratulations Mike, well played, and Jeff look forward to working with you more. So on the domestic same-store sales you mentioned the traffic the ticket was a little bit of a contributor, is that more than last quarter, I mean, how do you dimensionalize that versus last quarter – with last several quarters, is it a bigger, lesser, just seen this [trend] [ph] before?
Mike Lawton: Not a lot of difference. There is a little bit of ticket that's coming out of what you call just inflationary pricing and a little bit just because the promotion this year is a little bit different than what was running last year. But, it's not – again, this is primarily an order comp growth story at this stage.
John Glass: That's helpful. And then there was a discussion early in the call around mobile ordering as a percentage maybe online ordering in total. Can you give us other stats you would share with us for this quarter whereas in the U.S. for example both of those as a percentage of total orders?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I mean roughly mobile and online are about equal.
John Glass: And what do they add up to?
Patrick Doyle: Well, you're looking at kind of 25 and 25-ish kind of right in that range, mobile continues to grow a little faster than online but both are growing.
John Glass: That's very helpful. And then just finally, you mentioned that there was a customer loyalty program, what is that look like in pizza and how do you -- [some has been] [ph] hesitant to do that because it looked already very successful business why would you entice more people to order more often, so how do you think about when that gets fully rolled out, how it looks, is there any kind of color comments where you're willing to put on out at this point?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. So the first color commentary is, we are always looking for more customers to order more often. We're happy to do that and that's pretty much our core job everyday as we get up. And the loyalty program and we're testing it, its one market we're going to see how it works and then make a decision, its certainly something that's, that you're seeing success I think from Starbucks, Papa John's has certainly put a lot of focus on it in the past, but its something we're testing and we'll see.
John Glass: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Thank you very much. And I got to congrats two, both Mike and Jeff. Two questions, just one you talk about the unit growth opportunity and it seems like it's being well-captured internationally. So looking on the domestic side, I think in the past you've talked about room for another 1000 or so just wondering whether there is any interest in perhaps company operated growth now you're sitting with under 400, but may be to take advantage of the opportunity while you're in such a position of strength may be getting best real estate or what not and obviously one day you could sell the franchisees, but didn't know if there was any consideration of doing anything like that or any further incentives to franchisees to even accelerate the growth further in the U.S.?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. So the big incentive for the franchisees is the profitability on the stores, the trailing 12-month profitability at the franchise level is at record levels. And that's what's driving more and more interest and it's why you're seeing kind of the acceleration. As to corporate stores you'll certainly, I'm sure if noted that's margins on our corporate stores continue to improve, profitability continues to improve, I am very pleased with the progress that we're making there and it's something that we look at. I mean growth for our corporate stores I think overall the range that we're in is good in terms of counts. We need to be doing our fair share of growth, but what you see from us is that most stores that we will open for our corporate stores are going to be in existing markets. So it's really about filling in opportunities in markets that we're in. We opened one recently in New York City where all of our corporate stores in New York are in Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn and we continue to look at opportunities within those markets to open it. But, I don't think you're going to see anything dramatic and overall we feel pretty good about the size of our corporate store business, but it's certainly something that's a tool out there if we work getting kind of the growth that we wanted otherwise.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And then just my other question was on the G&A spend, I think Mike you confirmed the – there was $270 million to $275 million this year, just wondering if there is anything that would hold you back at all on spending even above that I mean, I am assuming there is opportunity for incremental spend when you have such strong results, I know you mentioned ecommerce and technology, but is there a priority list to investments or is there any constrain that something that's on your list that you are holding back on doing it for whatever reason, are you pretty much when you are generating this much cash flow investing as best as you can come with the ideas?
MikeLawton: As we have said on the prior calls, I mean most of the incremental spend that we got a G&A that is that we regard as kind of investment to grow the business either comes out of the ecommerce area or comes out of international. And we have not been shy about adding on an ecommerce area because we think it's been the right place to put money. If we come with more good projects, we will continue to look at that and that can be in the form of either capital or for the G&A. But, we have added that's been a big contributor to the growth and we will just continue to look at whatever make sense in that area. We are not going to be shy. There is not a constraint. In the international area, we have added many people because we have been growing so rapidly. Again, if it makes sense, we will continue to do that. So the answer is no, there is not a constraint. We have been growing those areas because we think it's good for the business. The areas that you typically think about G&A, the back office or legal or we are tight on those. But, we will do the right thing for the business on growing the top line where we can.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Halen with Bloomberg Intelligence.
Michael Halen: Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations Mike, you have served Domino's shareholders very well over the years. Can you please give us an update on pan pizza, what percentage of your pizzas currently sold are pan and can you get those to the 20% industry average if you are not there already?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. So we haven't released the exact percentage on pan and aren't going to do that. We feel very good about the product and how it's performed. We haven't promoted it recently and so when you are promoting it you are clearly going to – that's when you are going to drive kind of the growth on mix. But, we feel great. I mean that this fresh dough pan product as I think has been a real differentiator for us. And we think it's been part of what's driven our absolute growth and our relative growth over the last couple of years.
Michael Halen: Great. Thanks a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with TAG.
Peter Saleh: Great. Thank you. And congrats on the quarter guys. I wanted to ask about capacity constraints within the actual restaurants. I mean since your sales have been phenomenal as you guys have indicated, are you having any issues on the capacity side in terms of getting product out. Are you needed to upgrade any of the equipment and where do you stand on finding more drivers, I think in the past you have discussed how there has been a little bit of a shortage on the driver side.
Mike Lawton: So there certainly are some constraints in some stores. I would tell you in terms of overall results you are certainly not feeling it. And I will tell you that it is the highest quality problem that we can possibly have as a company and as a system. But it is – what is leading to accelerating store growth. It is leading to our franchisees and our corporate stores putting more capital into the stores as they increase oven capacity or make-line capacity. And so it is certainly something that we look at. And it can be a constraint certainly in some stores, but it's a minority of stores. The other thing is, as we are very focused on making sure that we are staffed that we are going to continue to great – to give great service to our customers. What I would tell you is that the net of all of that is our service levels, our service times, all of the metrics that we look at in our stores have never been better. So we are executing at the highest level that we have ever executed at as a company and as a system. So we are certainly working through any of those as we hit them. And the happiest conversation that you will ever have with the franchisee is to point out to them that their sales are so high and their profits are so good that they need to add a third duct to their oven in their store or it's time to open another new store to handle all the volume that's going into one. So the profits are there, the cash flow is there for the franchisees to invest to do it. And they are dealing with it incredibly well as we hit any of those constraints.
Peter Saleh: Great. And then just, can you just comment a little bit on the pizza theatre, it sounds like you guys are really accelerated at least in the first half of the year, the remodels and the pizza theatre especially internationally, can you talk about what you are seeing in some of the markets that actually have that are fully complete on the pizza theatre what kind of returns are you seeing?
MikeLawton: Yes. The story continues to be kind of the same which is individual stores as they get done on average, we will see a couple of point bump, stores that were under performing, we actually see a bigger bump, stores that were maybe already in better place less, but our average is kind of have been 1% or 2% on individual stores. But, what we have always said is, we are heading into this as we think it's going to be something that allows us to continue to drive the performance that we have had. It's going to lift overall momentum in the system as people see new and better looking stores. It elevates the performance of the whole system and I think you have seen that play out. I mean it is clearly part of what is contributed. So as whole markets get done or the majority of whole markets get done, I think we see a bigger effect than what it is individual stores that I think we are seeing it also just in the overall strength of the business both domestically and internationally.
Peter Saleh: Thank you very much and congrats again.
Mike Lawton: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies.
Alex Slagle: Thanks. Congrats to all of you. I'm wondering if you could provide some more perspective on what you are seeing in terms of competitive pressure in the form of more aggressive price points from peers given one major competitor still struggling out there and a number of smaller operators who can finally compete more effectively on price with the drop in cheese cost. Are you seeing any change in that regard?
MikeLawton: We really are. I mean, it's really pretty consistent from a pricing competitive standpoint. I think the category has continued to be kind of consistent with where it was in terms of growth. We may see a little bit of order growth overall in the category and maybe a couple of points on ticket. So you are seeing category overall grow maybe 2% or 3% that's consistent with where it's been previously. And I think the broad story continues to be the same even though certainly one of the competitors has not been performing quite as well. I'm relatively sure with comments that they have made that – they are driving change over their and they are going to get back on track. The longer term story continues to be the same which is the larger players are taking shares from the small players and that's from efficiencies, that's from advertising and know-how I think within our system on how to run stores well. But, clearly the new part of it is digital. And we are continuing to see share shift from the smaller players to the larger players. And we've been a big beneficiary of that.
Alex Slagle: Thanks. And then a follow-up on labor. I know labor cost in the company store is up again, but overtime bonuses versus last year which make sense but gets me thinking more about overall wage inflation pressures and wonder to what extent those have been helped by your franchisees in recent months or anything, any comments from them or perspective you have would be helpful?
Patrick Doyle: We are generating record profit out of our stores. And so our ability to run our stores well and efficiently I think is helping us to not only manage those increases, but to prosper despite those increases. And so I think the bottom line is frankly the bottom line which is profits are better than they have ever been. So whatever pressures are out there on cost, we've been able to more than handle and the profit levels are at terrific levels right now. So it's certainly something that we watch and we keep an eye on and there is certainly indication that there is more activity coming on that front. I think that puts more pressure on weaker players and people who aren't as efficient and may be don't have kind of the same structure that we have to kind of drive success in what has been a little bit tougher labor environment and will probably continue to be.
Alex Slagle: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Smith with Feltl.
Mark Smith: Good morning, guys. I just wanted to see if you can give us any more insight on digital mix just on some of the new things that you've tested text, Twitter, any insight on incremental growth from those platforms?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I guess what I'd say is, first, we're not going to give out the specifics around anything. We don't want to make it easier for our competition to kind of figure out how to prioritize investments to catch up to what we're doing. But what I would say is if you look at the totality of the efforts we're making and how it is positioning our brands in the minds of consumers and the ease of access that is giving to them it is clearly a big part of what is driving our same-store-sales growth. So I'm not going to go into the specifics on it because our competition has to try to prioritize and I don't want to make that roadmap any easier for them. But, as we have said many times in the past as we have expanded platforms, we've seen incrementality from it, we clearly own kind of the digital space in the minds of consumers as being the leaders in that area and the real innovators and so its not just about the actual access its also about kind of the brand presence in the mind of the consumers and how they think about us as being a – an innovative brand that is pioneering new things and giving them new ways to access the brand. So that's really the answer, its all working in totality.
Mark Smith: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: Mike I was hoping you could revisit the comments that you made about the take up in online ordering fees for franchisees which I think went from $0.17 an order to $0.21 an order. Could you remind you what that the implementation the timing of that was and if future online ordering pizza that's solely a Domino's your discretion as suppose to the franchisees discretion. I'm sure they have input but at the end of the day is the decision is yours and with that associated revenue that you discussed is there any incremental cost that should be assumed that that's pure profit flow through?
Mike Lawton: As we've said before our intent in the United States has been to try to provide this service at a very good cost to our franchisees. We continue to go way beyond online ordering which is what was originally envisioned and now we have many, many different ways of accessing the company at ordering through ecommerce and that's led to more cost than the $0.17 we cover. So we're up to, we increased it to $0.21 that was at our discretion, as I also said in my commentary on the near term we certainly have no intention of going above that number. We have, we are ones – we as a company have expanded the money to create those systems we're recovering it over time and we'll continue to evaluate what the appropriate fee structure is, but it certainly is not something, it is intended – it doesn't have an additional incremental cost just because we raised it today. I mean we have done a lot of things over the last year to – and last few years to continue to expand our ecommerce platforms and that's just part of recovering that cost.
John Ivankoe: No question about that. So the implementation so I guess – it was announced today, is it more or less implemented today than as well?
Mike Lawton: It basically – it was included in the second quarter revenue.
John Ivankoe: Okay. It was in the full second quarter.
Mike Lawton: It was put into place in March.
John Ivankoe: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bank of America.
Joseph Buckley: Hi. Thank you. Mike congratulations on your retirement. I wish you the best. I had a couple of questions. The follow up on that question, Mike could you repeat what you said in your script comments. I think you said it's like $1.5 million to $2 million, but I'm not sure of the time period, was that –
Mike Lawton: So roughly, I mean depending upon the volume of each quarter, roughly, each four week period has generated $1.5 million to $2 million of fees at that $0.21. I've not expressed it in terms of months because we obviously have four week periods. So but you could say at that way as well. It's basically $1.5 million to $2 million for every four week period. That's not the incremental. That's the total fees we are collecting.
Joseph Buckley: Okay. We could do the math to figure out what the incremental is of the $0.17 charge presumably. Okay and then just a couple of other questions, just on the carry out business, how did that – do this quarter – that's still growing pretty rapidly for you?
MikeLawton: Yes. It is. And one of the things we are seeing is, these newly reimaged stores we see a bigger bump in carry out that in delivery as you would frankly expect because customers are the ones the are seeing the new image. And so from a relative standpoint we see that reimaging working a little better on the carry outside than on the delivery side.
Joseph Buckley: Okay. And then just a follow-up question also on the labor, no question your margins are fantastic, but curious if you could share with us what you are seeing in wage rate inflation and if the average turnover has gone up that was a pretty big bump in waiver as percent of sales in a great comp quarter.
MikeLawton: We are certainly seeing some of it. And it's not just from minimum wage, I think the really healthy increases when you are simply seeing demand for labor and employment going up in markets and their markets where it's certainly getting tougher and that's great and that's healthy. And so I think – it is hopefully something that we are going to continue to see because that's going to be a sign that the economy is continuing to do well. I think it is very manageable. It has been manageable and our franchisees are handling it well. They make their own decisions on how they are going to approach it. But, and I would add to that the comments I was making about service levels and performance in the stores, we are doing better than we have ever done. And so we are executing at a very high level and managing nicely within a situation where there is certainly is a little bit of upward pressure and I take that frankly as a good thing. I would rather have a healthy economy and high demand for pizza and be able to pay people more and need to pay people more.
Joseph Buckley: Okay. And then maybe one last one, Patrick just a big picture question on kind of defining the brand as more than just pizza. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the game plan going forward why you are making that move and what we should expect in longer term as you execute against that?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Look, where we are going to continue to be a pizza company first and foremost that is going to continue to be the overwhelming majority of our sales. I would suspect for my life time and certainly my life time is as CEO here. That's what we are and what we are known for and we will continue to be known for. I think there are a number of reasons that the change is out there. One is we do sell other things and we want people to know that. We want them to know that that there are great sandwiches and pasta and chicken on our menu and Coca Cola products. And we want them to think about us for those things as well. And we also want those who might be a veto vote on a bigger order to know that there is going to be an option for those within a group who might not want pizza within that order. But, I think it also goes to our confidence about our brand and where we are and the example that I always use with people is Nike. If you go back 25, 30 years, you had the shoes and then Nike sportswear behind it way back. And at some point they pretty early on they dropped the sportswear and increasingly you just see the shoes. And that's a function of the – strength of the brand and the confidence of the brand. People already know what Domino's does in the U.S. and so we think we are in a position where we can do that we can be more confident as a brand. And the last really tactical, practical thing is sometimes you have got constraints on the size and signs on the front of a store and a bigger Domino's and just Domino's is relatively better signage than a smaller Domino's pizza. And that's a really tactical reason, but it plays into it as well.
Joseph Buckley: Thanks for that answer. I appreciate the tactical and those strategic answers. Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: All right. Thanks Joe.
Operator: And we have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for closing remarks.
Patrick Doyle: All right. Thanks everybody. I look forward to talking to you again as we discuss third quarter results on October 8.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call. And you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. [Indiscernible], you may begin your conference.
Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks, Kelly and good morning everybody. With the year we’re going to start with some prepared remarks this morning and then open to Q&A. But we do said this up for investors primarily so I would kindly ask the members of the press to listen only mode the Q&A session. And also to turn your attention to our Safe Harbor statement in the events of any forward-looking statement were made. And with that I would like to introduce our participants today. The first will be Mike Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer and then we’ll follow up with Patrick Doyle, who is our CEO and he’ll make some prepared remarks. Then we’ll open for Q&A. So with that Mike you’re ready to go?
Mike Lawton: Thank you [indiscernible] good morning, everyone. This quarter our positive momentum continued as we posted fantastic same store sales in both our domestic and international businesses. We opened significant number of new stores and our adjusted EPS grew 19.1% over the prior year quarter. We’re pleased with this earnings growth, particularly in the phase of some strong foreign exchange headwinds. Global retail sales which are the total retail sales at franchise and company owned stores worldwide grew 10.4%. When we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency global retail sales grew by 16.4%. The drivers of this growth included domestic same stores sales which rose by 14.5% in the quarter. The increase this quarter was comprised of franchise same store sales which were up 14.4% and company owned stores which were up about 15.9% and this was due primarily to strong order growth. We also saw some ticket growth during the quarter. We are pleased to report that we opened 17 net domestic stores in the first quarter consisting of 22 store opening and five closures, for the trailing 12 months we opened 93 net domestic stores. Our international division had another strong quarter as same store sales grew 7.8% lapping our prior year quarter increase of 7.4%. Our international division also grew by 93 stores which made up of 140 store opening and 47 closures. We had more closures than usual this quarter as we recorded 36 closures in Peru. We are working to reopen the market. Over the past four quarters, our international division is growing by 658 stores. Turning to revenues. Total revenues were up 48.2 million or 10.6% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of three factors; first, higher supply chain center volumes as well as increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our store reimaging program. These supply chain increases were partially offset by lower commodity costs which were passed on to franchisees; second, higher domestic same store sales and store count growth; and last, higher international royalties again from increased same store sales and store count growth which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased to 31.3% from 30.2% in the prior year quarter. The main drivers included; improved company owned store operating margins, which benefited from lower food cost and fixed cost leverage, this margin increase as a percentage of revenues from 23.9% to 26.2%.  Our supply chain margin percentage increased from 10.7% to 11.2% primarily from a decrease in commodity prices. As a reminder, commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar markup to our franchisees. Therefore lower commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do however positively impact our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues.  The average cheese block price in the first quarter was $1.54 per pound versus $2.16 in the same period last year which led to our overall market basket decreasing 5.9% as compared to the prior year quarter. We had previously communicated that we expect the commodities we use in our system to be down 2% to 4% in 2015 from 2014 levels. At this point in the year we now expect that the commodities we will use will be down 3% to 6% in 2015 from 2014 levels.  Currency exchange rates negatively impacted us in the quarter by $3.6 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthen in smallest currencies. We have previously communicated the foreign currency could exceed an $8 million to $12 million negative impact on pre-tax earnings for 2015. Due to the dollar continuing to strengthen during the first quarter we now need to update our foreign currency projections for the full year. Based on current projection we estimate that foreign currency could have $14 million to $20 million negative impact on pre-tax earnings for 2015. Again for perspective we estimate that 1% strengthening of the dollar against our basket of currencies has roughly $0.015 to $0.02 negative impact on our full year EPS.  Now let's discussed our G&A expenses. G&A increased by $9.9 million in the first quarter versus the prior year quarter. $1.7 million of this change was from a non-recurring gain we recognized in the first quarter of 2014 on the sale of 14 corporate stores. We have detailed this is in item effecting comparability in our 8-K. The remaining increase in G&A was due to several factors. First we may plan increases in e-commerce and technology support. I would point out that our investments and technology are partially offset by transaction fees that we received which are currently running around the $1.5 per month.  Then our higher same stores sales led to increases in volume driven expenses such as franchisee incentives variable performance based compensation and company owned store advertising contributions. For the full year we now projected our G&A could be in the range of $270 million to $275 million for our 53 week year. We estimate that the extra week will drive approximately $4 million of this total expense. Keep in mind to that our G&A expense for the year can vary up or down by among other funds our performance versus our plan as that affects variable performance based compensation expense.  Regarding income taxes our reported effective tax rate was 37.6% for the quarter. We continue to expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our first quarter net income was up 5.8 million or up 7.2 million when excluding the item effecting comparability. This as adjusted 18.3% increase was primarily driven by the higher domestic and international same stores sales global store growth and supply chain volumes offset by the negative impact to foreign currency exchange rate. First quarter diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.81 this $0.81 is $0.13 or 19.1% increase from the $0.68 as adjusted EPS in the first quarter of last year. This is how the $0.13 difference breaks down. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.04. Lower diluted share count primarily due to our share repurchases benefited us by $0.015. Higher effective tax rate negatively impacted us by $0.015 and importantly our operating results benefited us by $0.17. Now turning to our use of cash, during the first quarter we were repurchased to retailer approximately 291,000 shares for 29.5 million at an average price $101 to $0.46 of share so far in the second quarter we have repurchased 178,000 shares. We also returned nearly $14 million to our shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend. Overall our strong momentum continued in the first quarter and we are very pleased with our results.  Thank you for your time today. And now, I'll turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Mike. It was an outstanding start to 2016. Many who follow the Domino's continues to ask the same question. What catalyst can we point to in helping explain our momentum and continued positive performance? While I may run the risk of sounding repetitive the truth is the truth. The fundamental strength of the business and the equity in our brand name have proven again and again to deliver a strong financial outcome overtime and in multiple macro-environments. Global net store openings were the highest in the decade for the first quarter and our trailing 12 months net store opening number is now at 751 a net growth of over two stores per day. This momentum along with our same stores sales helped us deliver 19% adjusted EPS growth despite the effect of foreign exchange headwinds from the strong dollar. Domestically we'd now had 16 consecutive quarters of positive same stores sales. Our last negative quarter was rolling over 14.3% from the quarter when we launched our new and inspired pizza.  And our extraordinary streak of positive consecutive quarters in international has now reached a whopping 85. All in all we are very pleased with the start to 2015 and the fact that our story has strong fundamentals and sustained performance continues.  Looking specifically at our first quarter domestic business I'm incredibly proud of our 14.5 same store sales comp. We are accomplishing this by building brand equity over-time through our compelling advertising, innovative technology, strategic menu management, strong operations and more recently store reimages, it proven to be a winning combination. One of the things that excited me the most when it comes to our domestic franchisees is the progress we’ve made on store level profitability. The results are now in on 2014 franchise profitability and it was a record setting year with the domestic average of approximately $89,000 in EBITDA per store. Our work here is not done and we will continue to keep this top of mind in everything we do. But I am very pleased this continues to trend up to even higher levels. And even with franchisees investing in reimaging of the new Pizza Theater look they’re continuing to build new stores and drive domestic store growth momentum. Wrapping up on our domestic business I think about our current ad campaign where we rather ceremoniously dropped pizza from our name as one that presents the state of our brand extremely well. We are more than just pizza and that goes well beyond product and menu offerings and in the overall experience that continues to connect customers with our brand. One of those connection points to certainly technology and our leadership position of unmatched innovation continues to evolve the brands and revolutionize the Domino’s customer experience. About 50% of our sales in the U.S. now come via digital ordering channels. Our approach continues to shape this new tact to table category and our innovation won’t slow down any time soon. We recently unveiled three highly innovative new ordering platforms, Pebble and Android Wear smartwatches as well as the ability to now order on a smart TV through our partnership with Samsung. So in addition to being more than just pizza on the technology front we are proud to say we are clearly now more than just mobile, whether it’d be smartwatches, smart TVs or voice enabled platforms such as [Ford Sync] and Dom our virtual ordering assistant we’re fulfilling our goal of enabling customers to order from Domino’s anytime anyplace. The strategic investments in technology have continued to pay off in driving results and increasing shareholder return and we’re committed to these investments and doing what it takes to maintain our position as a technology leader. On the international front as Mike mentioned yet another strong quarter. This business continues to serve as a prime growth driver. Same store sales remain very strong and the performance of our publicly traded master franchisees including Domino’s pizza Group, Domino’s Pizza Enterprises and our sale has been nothing short of terrific. We’ve seen great performance from some other standup markets too notably Turkey, Canada and Brazil and we are also pleased with the improving same store sales in India. These results certainly demonstrate our continued global success as we’ve now exceeded 21 consecutive years of quarterly same store sales growth in international. We were very pleased with 140 growth store openings in the first quarter as well as market openings in Azerbaijan and Cambodia. I am very excited about the master franchise leadership in these markets and their enthusiasm about introducing the Domino’s brand to local customers for the first time. We also continued to pursue a common point of sales platform in our international stores with about 60% of stores outside the U.S. now using Domino’s PULSE. It’s a great example of sharing best practices with our master franchisee partners and we look forward to the operations management and digital tools that Domino’s PULSE offers being utilized by stores across the globe just as they have in the U.S. While there are many international markets leveraging digital in an impressive fashion there’re still plenty of markets that had yet to launch online ordering and have tremendous digital opportunity. Even with this we continue to average about 40% of digital sales in our channels in international markets. We continue to collaborate and share best practices around the world to help more markets reach their full digital capability. Wrapping up my commentary on the first quarter, our fundamental strength and continued momentum pave the way for a very strong start to 2015. I am encouraged by our franchisee profitability and the U.S. improvements in job growth and employment something that as I’ve previously noted correlates to more pizza orders. I am encouraged by our undeniable position in the technology leader and digital innovator. I am encouraged by the repeated success of our international business and beyond metrics and figures I both encourage and inspire by the Domino’s global team and how we’ve begun yet another year with passion, energy and results. Thanks for your time. I’ll now open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.
Karen Holthouse: Congratulations on a great quarter. Looking out as you go from here in the year, what are your thoughts of your hoping you looking at your company stores and then franchisees on the wage environment and you would then with increases in some stage are other signs that wages are coming up, plans to help manage through that or help your franchisees manage through that. What are the opportunities to offset it? 
Patrick Doyle: It's very manageable, when you're generating this level of top line growth we are very comfortable with the environment. We certain it's something that we can manage through minimum wage is a starting wage. And frankly that’s majority of the team members in our corporate stores and in our franchise stores are delivery drivers. And delivery drivers with tips are making substantially more than the minimum wage. So we're very comfortable that we would able to manage in this environment. 
Karen Holthouse: And then just quick modelings follow up. The change in G&A guidance how much is that relates to technology spending versus the entire bonus accruals versus something else. 
Patrick Doyle: It's a little bit of both and it's not a significant change from what was out there before it is a little bit higher. But it's certainly as you can see the variable component which also includes things like advertising contributions in corporate store is significant.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris O'Cull with KeyBanc.
Chris O'Cull : Patrick has you recent advertising campaigns resulted in an increase mix for non-pizza items. Or is there anything you can tell us about may how guess how you expect to see as you differently would this campaign any different occasions. 
Patrick Doyle: It absolutely does we've done this mix and match promotion that we've out there. Probably once a year on average something like that to remind people of the other product offerings that we have and when we do that it's certainly drive mix of other products and we saw that again in the first quarter. What I would say is we are and we'll continue to be overwhelmingly a Pizza company it is the majority of what we sell and it's going to continue to be the majority of what we sell. But we've got great sandwiches and pasta and chicken and the other items on the menu and we make sure we remind people of that on an occasional basis and it works.
Chris O'Cull: And then I had a question regarding franchise contribution rate that help recover some of the investment in the digital platform. Has that changed at all or is there any plan for that to change?
Mike Lawton: The numbers reflected in the first quarter don’t reflect the change there is certainly can be changes going forward.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
John Glass : I'm wondering, given the strength in comps, if throughput is now an issue. In other words, you've got such huge demand and that has been very clear. Is there a bottleneck in the stores? Do you have to do things to relieve that bottleneck, or capacity constraints given this level of sales gains?
Patrick Doyle: In the first quarter of the year with a lot of weather knocking around I would say the weather was even though regionally it was pretty tough it was not in abnormal first quarter for weather. Certainly you are going to feel some of that and we did a little bit our highest volume stores are getting a little capacity constrained. And you're seeing some stores that need to add some new equipment to add some new ovens but I will tell you that’s the highest quality problem you will ever face and certainly something we know how to deal with. But yes there are certainly some small percentage of our stores that are seeing volumes now that frankly they weren’t built for when they were built 10 or 15 years ago.
John Glass: That make sense. And you talked a lot about, over the last several years, of technology and leader in ordering. But I'm wondering if there's a way to use technology for the deliveries side as well. Some restaurants have begun to experiment with Uber or other kind of new technologies on the deliveries side. Is that an opportunity for you in some respects, or is the delivery driver in that piece of the business sacrosanct and that's not what you look for to gain further efficiency? 
Mike Lawton: We've got the best kind of real time delivery system around. And I guess what I'd say is when you think about an Uber or some of the other folks that are coming in the technology that they are using is terrific. But at the end of the day they are service companies and it's about can you find great people who are motivated can you back them up with great systems that are going to help them be efficient we've been doing that and doing that very well for a long time. So are there things that we can do that potentially are going to make us more efficient sure and it's part of the investment that we make in technology to help our folks be more efficient overtime, but are we going to wind up ahead of using somebody else to do it, something like that, no. We’re planning to be plenty efficient with our people and they want to see a Domino’s delivery driver showing up, looking great in uniform and that’s certainly the way that it’s going to continue.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton Stump: Of course, great job on the quarter. Obviously a huge comp, in particular. Can you talk about the specialty chicken launch, which if I recall was April of last year? If you are still seeing it benefit to comps year-over-year in the first quarter. And then as you look out in coming quarters if you can talk about any sort of new product plans? Obviously, you probably don't want to get specific but just any color on what you plan to do on the new product front in coming quarters. 
Mike Lawton: So, specialty chicken did very well for us. Our chicken mix continues to be higher than it was before we launched specialty chicken. So at some level is it part of what’s contributing to our comp, yes probably is, though I'd say at this point that's kind of more at the margins than a big part of it. And in terms of new products we absolutely have lots of things in the pipelines that we can turn to but I think the overall message as we talked about before and certainly as we talked about at our Investor Day in January we think our discipline around our menu and launching fewer things in a bigger way and doing that very thoughtfully and purposefully so that we’re able to execute well at our stores is continuing to be a fundamental strength for us. And with what we think was at least from those who have released so far the best comp in the restaurant industry in the first quarter we think our approach on this is working awfully well.
Alton Stump: Real quick, if I could follow up -- and if I missed this, I apologize. But I think you guys have talked about 2% to 4% comp growth in the US heading into the year. Is there any update on that range after, obviously, the huge first quarter? 
Mike Lawton: That’s our long term guidance for you 14.5 is a little higher 2% to 4% so year we were off the high end of that for the quarter. But obviously we’re incredibly pleased with the comp in the first quarter. And I guess what it say is 2% to 4% is the long term guidance that we’ve given but we’re awfully pleased to have beaten it by I guess 10% plus we’re pretty happy with that.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Two questions, and first one Patrick thank you for that help on the 14 bigger than 2% to 4%. That was a very strong result, so congratulations. No, I appreciate all the help I can get. The first question was on the comp. We've heard from a lot of people in the industry that the quarter started off heroic and then slowed. I know you don't give monthly sales but I'm wondering whether you can opine upon what you saw something similar and maybe whether you can make any comment on the broader industry, because I know you talked about the industry maybe growing at 1%. I'm wondering whether this is a Domino's phenomenon or is all of a sudden just a resurgence across broader pizza segment. And I have one follow-up. 
Mike Lawton: I think the pizza category is doing a little better than the restaurant category overall. I think it’s up maybe more 2% to 3%. But there is no question that we’re taking share right now with the numbers that we’re putting up. And in terms of within the quarter I am not going to comment on that. What I would say is what we are seeing is that the employment market looks awfully healthy out there. And we’ve said it many times and it continues to be true employed people buy more pizza than unemployed people. And so when we look at the overall market, the overall restaurant category we’re continuing to see the employment picture looking good, people are continuing months to months we’re continuing to add jobs, certainly we’d like to see that a little stronger than we saw at the last month or two. But the trend is clearly up, the recovery is continuing and we’ve said often that that correlates to higher pizza category consumption and we’re certainly seeing that playing out again.
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And then just on a balance sheet perspective, Mike, there was no mention of leverage positioning, and, obviously, Domino's being a heavily franchised business that's always a key part to the story. I just wondering where there any comment in terms of closely monitoring the markets or if you are content with leverage flowing to that four times or below range or how we should think about that over the next 12 months. 
Mike Lawton: As we've said we are comfortable in this three to six range. We're still solidly into that range. But yes, we'll continue to monitor we'll continue to evaluate what we think is the best approach for us. 
Operator: Your next question comes will come from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company.
Brian Bittner: A follow-up on John's earlier question. You talked about some stores that are becoming a little bit capacity constraint. What type of values are those stores doing so we can at least imagine what the upside in the current asset base looks like in the U.S. potentially? 
Mike Lawton: We've always said we think there is at least the 1000 stores yet to be built in the U.S. and is unit economics are continuing to improve. We like the building momentum on that I release the kind of final estimate on franchise profitability last year at 89,000 with moderating food cost. As you saw in our corporate numbers and with the comp that we put up clearly first quarter this year was better than first quarter last year as well. So the cash flow per store continues to go up and so we're feeling pretty good about how that plays through overtime. And from a capacity standpoint it certainly means that as sales go higher there's even more opportunity to continue to build. So we're feeling good on that front.
Brian Bittner: I appreciate that. I should have framed the question differently. What I'm asking is the actual stores that are seeing some capacity constraints on volumes. What type of AUV levels are they doing so we can think about what type of AUVs those stores are doing versus the overall portfolio? 
Mike Lawton: I don't know if I am going to get into give any kind of a specific number on that it depends on the store and we've got stores that are 1,200 square feet. And they are pretty capacity constraints if they're doing 30,000 or 40,000 a week, it's tough to do that out of a small store. But we’ve got stores, I can think of stores on military bases essentially have two lines they are effectively doubled the capacity in a single store. And they can do substantially more than an average store. So there is not a single answer that I can give on that but what I can tell you is with the increases in volume we're seeing there are certainly more stores that are followed into the category of being a little capacity constrained. And they are really two ways to solve that either putting more equipments into existing stores or building more stores and both of those are relatively straight forward to do and are pretty good for our shareholders.
Brian Bittner: Okay, thanks on that. And last question -- you guys obviously have a lot more insight into the business and the trends than we do. The acceleration in the business to mid-teen comps is obviously incredible. And I think what I'm really trying to understand better is when you look at your business and you see that inflection, how much of it is due to you truly being at the epicenter of a tightening labor market? And how much of this is doing what you are doing with the technology things and new products, just thinking about macro versus micro here? 
Mike Lawton: If you look at what I said on category growth that winning category growth is more in the 2% to 3% range. That includes store growth in that number that’s not just same stores sales we're clearly outperforming the category by a lot right now. So it is more about things but we're doing in the business and I guess I've got a fall back on what I said before it's about just a lot of different things coming together getting the food right, having the best franchisees in the business. And I mean now we've got terrific franchisees who are leaning in to the business right now, they're excited about what's happening, there is staffing up as volumes are growing. So they can continue to give great service it's about the advertising that’s been very effective, it's about we think some of the best if not the best use of technology in the category giving customers a better experience. It's about getting stores reimaged, though I would remind you that’s still only kind of 20% to 25% complete in the U.S. So it's just a lot of different things that have been coming together that we've been talking about but are really all happening right now and that’s strengthening the brands in the minds of consumers which is building pretty phenomenal momentum in the business.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory Group.
Peter Saleh: I wanted to ask about -- you mentioned the remodels but can you give us an update on the returns that you are seeing on the remodels and then also on the relocations? How many relocations do you guys expect to do at this point? And is there any impact when you relocate from maybe a less desirable location to a better location on the carryout business?
Mike Lawton: I think the last one first, yes. The relocations that are getting done you see a bigger bump on sales and more of that is within carryout. What you’re going to see is it’s still going to be a minority of the stores that are going to relocate over the course of the next couple of years this is primarily going to be about reimages. And my answer on reimages and the results that we’re seeing continue to reflect exactly what we said in the past that an individual store getting reimaged you will see a very low single digit a point, two point, maybe three points in lift versus the stores around it when the reimage is done. What we always have believed and I think what you’re seeing play out is that it’s really more about the overall brand momentum as you’re getting lots of these done and people start rethinking Domino’s pizza, it’s really more about overall brand momentum than it is about kind of the specific store that’s getting done. And we’re still roughly a two thirds delivery, one third carryout business. And so it makes sense. Only a third of our customers are walking into the store, maybe if you look take it a little bit lower so maybe 35% or 40% of orders you’re going to have less of an immediate impact on comp sales from a reimage of a specific store. But given what we’re doing with the overall business and the brand and technology and the food quality and service, everything that we’re doing we can’t have stores that don’t reflect our overall brand image. And we think it adds to the momentum of the brand. So, that’s what we’re seeing. The individual store reimages don’t produce that big of a bump in the near term but we do think it’s part of what’s feeding into the overall brand momentum.
Peter Saleh: And then on pricing or menu pricing, I know lots of the other restaurants have talked about higher pricing than historical, at least for this year. How are you and the franchisees thinking about pricing in the environment where you've got commodities actually coming down but you're probably seeing some labor pressure as well?
Mike Lawton: So I think the answer is really in the profits that you’re seeing in the stores. I mean they had record profitability last year they did that in an environment where commodities were up pretty dramatically now the commodities are easing. You’re seeing that play through in even better profitability. And our system, our franchisees were exceptionally disciplined last year when commodities were up a lot they decided that the long term benefit of the customers feeling good about the value they’re getting was more important than simply covering and a little bit of short-term pressure from a cost standpoint. And this year that’s going back the other way. So any pressure that you saw on wages which again for us is reasonably minimal because most of our people are tipped and are making far more than the starting wage you’re seeing a lot of discipline in our system but they’re benefiting now as commodities gone a little bit lower and it playing back ultimately to discipline around doing what the consumer needs, what our customers need to continue to give us more of their business.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bank of America.
Joseph Buckley: Patrick, you mentioned the tip aspect of the drivers a few times. The drivers -- are they paid a tip credit wage or are they paid at least a minimum wage and then tips on top of that?
Mike Lawton: It depends on the franchisee so remember over 90% of our stores in the U.S. are owned by franchisees, they control that. What I can tell you is it is all over the board and it’s really market dependent so there are places where people could pay tip credit and they’re not, there are places where they are paying above the starting wage, they're places where people are paying out of the tip credit. You pay what you need to pay to have good people in stores and be staffed but what remains true is that with tips our drivers are certainly making on average $10 plus and probably substantially more than that as you look across the country. So they're doing well and so it's really more about kind of market demand for labor than it is about the starting wage. 
Joseph Buckley: And in the Company stores is it a tip credit wage? 
Mike Lawton: That varies also by market and there are some markets where we're doing, there are some markets where we aren't, there are also some markets where we can't where tip credit wage is not available and you pay at the same minimum as non-tipped employees.
Joseph Buckley: And then just another question on consumer activity. Obviously, your comp is not reflecting the macro. But the macro may be a small part of it. But are you seeing customers willing to spend more? Is the mix going up, or are add-on items going up? Are you seeing the consumer willing to spend a little bit more aggressively? 
Mike Lawton: Not particularly and you've been ask the question before gas prices going down and we just don’t think that’s a particularly big factor in consumer spending right now and you've certainly seeing the same data that we have that savings rate may have even gone up a little bit in the last three or six months. So I don’t think that’s really playing in and we're not seeing that. Mike mentioned in his prepared remarks that this was overwhelmingly about order growth for us but our ticket was up a little bit. So I would remind you that ticket is both a function of price and what they're buying kind of the basket of products that are in the order. But I wouldn’t say that we're seeing a particular change in customers' willingness and ability to pay more and people are remaining disciplined coming out of the crisis now five, six years ago, customers are smarter they are remaining disciplined, they continue to want value which is a function of both the quality of the food and the quality of the service as well as the price and I'm not seeing a dramatic change there. 
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe: Congratulations, obviously -- very exceptional. I did want to talk about the restaurant modernization and I guess maybe more specifically the Pizza Theater in terms of what some initial experience has been in terms of sales lift, how far along you are with that in terms of the overall program, if the costs are where you want. And I think a theme that has been discussed a lot on this call is whether that can actually start to push business two things like lunch and earlier in the week and what have you, where I think most Domino's stores would in fact have capacity if they don't have capacity on a Friday or Saturday night, for example. 
Patrick Doyle: I think the broad answer is that we've always been very, very good at delivery. We haven’t been particularly differentiated on carry out. And the experienced with the customer has in our store and so getting that right starts with having a good environment for the customers. And I would add importantly for the team member. Our team members prefer to work in these new stores and so that helps get better people it helps us be staffed in the stores and it's relatively early in this process. We still are only 20% or 25% kind of reimage in the U.S we're moving very quickly on that those numbers are going to continue to go up very quickly over the course of this year and next year really till the end of 2017. It's probably too early to say that there are dramatic shifts in day parks and mix and that sort of things. But what I would say is having a great environment for customers in our stores certainly gives us far more opportunity looking forward to do something that’s differentiated for our carry out customers as well. And it's certainly something that we're looking at, we're excited about the prospects of getting better there. But this is foundational, they've got to look good first.
John Ivankoe: If I may, obviously there's a lot of attention, probably even more so in the investment community then maybe even the consumer, but certainly a lot of attention in both places around this personally made, what I'm going to call it Neapolitan style pizza. Do you want to have the Pizza Theater in place before you start looking into a segment like that? Or does a segment like that make sense for Domino's? Or could you even basically serve that customer or serve that demand within your existing format?
Patrick Doyle: So if you look at some of -- what people are calling the fast casual players it’s about food quality, it’s about the environment and it’s about open kitchen, it’s still about giving speed of service. And we think we’re doing all of those things and doing it better than most. As you get into kind of the specifics of your question which is really around the product itself and maybe wood fired oven, a thinner [indiscernible] that sort of thing I don’t think you are going to see us doing that but certainly having all of the rest of the things in place we’re going to watch, you’re not going to see us bringing lumber into the stores soon, to start cooking the pizzas, I mean [multiple speakers]
John Ivankoe: I think we know you wouldn’t Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: But it does give us an opportunity to look at things. So I don’t think you’re going to see us go all the way over there but it does give us an opportunity as we’re showcasing the food to look at how we drive that even more strongly.
Operator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. Presenters, are there any closing remarks?
Patrick Doyle: No. I just want to thank everybody for getting on the call. I know it is a very busy earning season right now. And I look forward to talking to you again as we discuss our second quarter earnings on July 16.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fourth Quarter Year-End 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. Mr. Hall, you may begin your conference.
Mitch Hall - Director of Financial Planning and Analysis, Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Kelly. On behalf of Lynn Liddle and Investor Relations, I'd like to welcome everyone to Domino's Pizza's fourth quarter earnings call. As usual, we have on the call, Patrick Doyle, our President and CEO; and Mike Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we'll open the call up for Q&A. We are asking, since this is an investor call, that members of the media remain in listen-only mode. Also regarding any forward-looking statements that may be made today, I will direct everybody to the Safe Harbor statement on page seven of today's earnings release. And now, I'll turn it over to Mike Lawton.
Michael T. Lawton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Mitch and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report our results this morning for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014. During the quarter, we continued to build on a positive result we posted during the first three quarters of the year, and we delivered solid results for our shareholders. Our international and domestic divisions posted strong same-store sales growth. We opened a significant number of new stores, both domestically and internationally, and adjusted EPS grew 16.7% over the prior-year quarter. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 10.6%. When we exclude the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 13.7%. The drivers of this growth included domestic same-store sales, which rose sharply by 11.1% in the quarter. The increase this quarter was comprised of franchisees same-store sales which were up 11.0% and company-owned stores, which were up 11.9%, due primarily to strong order growth. We also saw ticket growth during the quarter. We are pleased to report that we opened 51 net domestic stores in the fourth quarter, consisting of 60 store openings and nine closures. For the full year, we opened 81 net domestic stores, representing the most domestic store openings in the past nine years. Our international division had another strong quarter, as same-store sales grew 6.1%, lapping a prior quarter increase of 7%. In the fourth quarter, our international division grew by 297 stores, made up of 323 store openings and 26 closures. For the full year, we had record international growth of 662 net new stores. Before I talk about the components of our income statement, I'd like to note a change in our segment reporting. In the fourth quarter, the company evaluated its organizational design and restructured the oversight of its international supply chain centers into one global supply chain division. As a result, we have determined that our seven supply chain centers in the international segment should be included in our supply chain segment. While the consolidated results of the company have not been impacted, we have restated our segment information for consistent presentation. We have also described this change in detail in our separate 8-K filing that we filed this morning. So, now turning to revenues. Total revenues were up $76.4 million or 13.5% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of three factors: first, higher supply chain revenues from increased supply chain center volumes, higher commodity prices and specifically, cheese and meats, and increased sales of equipment to stores in connection with our store reimaging program; second, higher domestic same-store sales and store count growth; and third, higher international royalties, again, from increased same-store sales growth and store count growth, which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter decreased to 29.5% from 30.5% in the prior-year quarter. The main drivers were as follows: our supply chain margin percentage decreased from 10.9% to 10.1%, primarily from an increase in commodity prices. As a reminder, commodities are generally priced on a constant-dollar mark-up to our franchisees. Therefore, higher commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, negatively impact our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues. The average cheese block price in the fourth quarter was $2.11 per pound versus $1.83 in the same period last year, which led to our overall market basket increasing 4.8% as compared to the prior-year quarter. Also contributing to the decrease in supply chain margin was an increase in self-insured medical insurance cost. Company-owned store margins also contributed to the lower consolidated operating margin. Higher food costs led to this margin decreasing as a percentage of revenues from 24.3% to 23.2%. Currency exchange rates also negatively impacted our operating margin this quarter, with a hit of $2.5 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against most currencies in which we conduct business. Now, let's discuss our G&A expenses. G&A increased by $11.8 million in the fourth quarter versus the prior year quarter. The increase was partly due to a charge of $5.8 million to replace our corporate airplane, which we mentioned to you last quarter and has been adjusted out as an item affecting comparability. The remaining $6 million of increase in G&A came primarily from increases in e-commerce and technology support as well as investments to expand our international team. Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 37.0% for the quarter. We continue to expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our fourth quarter net income was up $3.4 million or up $7 million when excluding the items affecting comparability. This as adjusted 15.6% increase was primarily driven by higher domestic and international same-store sales, global store growth and higher supply chain volumes. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.85 or $0.91 when adjusting for items affecting comparability. The $0.91 is a $0.13 or 16.7% increase from the $0.78 EPS in the fourth quarter of last year. Here's how that $0.13 difference breaks down. Our foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.03. Our lower diluted share count primarily due to our share repurchases benefited us by $0.01. And importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.15. Now before turning to our use of cash during the year, I'd like to remind you of some information we shared at our Investor Day in January. First, I want to remind you that we have an extra or a 53rd week in our 2015 fiscal year. As we have in the past, we will be adjusting the impact of this extra week out of our 2015 results as an item affecting comparability. Regarding commodities, we currently project that the commodities we use in our system will be down 2% to 4% in 2015 versus 2014 levels as cheese and pork prices have recently moderated. For perspective, we estimate that a 10% decrease in the price of cheese has roughly a $0.015 impact on our full-year EPS. Now on to currency. In January, we estimated that foreign currency would have an $8 million to $12 million negative impact on pre-tax earnings in 2015. The dollar continues to strengthen and it is possible that even the high end of that range could be exceeded. Again, for perspective, we estimate that a 1% strengthening of the dollar against our basket of currencies has roughly a $0.015 to $0.02 negative impact on our full-year EPS. As it relates to G&A in 2015, we expect to have increases for e-commerce and technology support, which are partially offset by transaction fees that we receive. We also plan to have increases for our international support team and other strategic initiatives. The result is an expected increase of between $16 million and $20 million for the 53-week 2015 year over our 2014 reported levels. We estimate that our 53rd week will drive approximately $4 million of this increase. Keep in mind too that G&A expense can vary up or down by, among other things, our performance versus our plan as that affects variable performance-based compensation expense. Now, turning to our use of cash. Over the course of the year, we repurchased and retired approximately 1.2 million shares for $82.4 million at an average price of $71.54 a share. We also made nearly $12 million in required principal repayments on our long-term debt, and returned over $52 million to our shareholders through our regular quarterly dividends. Looking forward, we believe that we will continue to generate cash over and above what we need to reinvest in our business. We will – had primarily used this excess free cash flow to pay dividends and buy back stock during 2014. And as always, we plan to continue to use – to deploy cash opportunistically to benefit shareholders. Regarding our capital expenditures, in 2014, we invested over $70 million in capital expenditures primarily in our stores, supply chain centers, technology initiatives, and our corporate plane. We will continue to have low capital expenditures relative to our earnings, but have increased our spending as we see continuing opportunities to invest in our industry-leading digital platform, to make enhancements to our point-of-sale system, and to invest in the growth of our domestic stores, and pursue other initiatives that will grow our brand. Going forward, we have raised our long-range outlook on capital spending to approximately $50 million to $60 million annually, as we will invest capital into our domestic business and in our technology platforms. Overall, our fourth quarter capped off a fantastic year for us. Thank you for your time today. And now, I'll turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Mike. As I think about 2014 and try to find the best way to sum up the results Mike just reported to you, I find myself repeating what we told you at our recent Investor Day. I think you just have to attribute our success to the fundamental strength of the business and arguably to the Domino's brand name simply being embraced around the world. There's often a question on the part of the investment community as to whether or not these kind of domestic positive same-store sales are sustainable. Looking back at the last 20 quarters, we've only had one negative comp, which was rolling over a 14.3% in the prior-year quarter. We're also the only quick-serve restaurant of any comparable scale that has posted six consecutive years of average unit volume growth. So I guess we proved our domestic sales have been pretty sustainable. And certainly, it's hard to argue with our international same-store sales track record and our run of 84 straight positive quarters, that's 21 years of positive comps in our international business, also, the longest period of growth by any comparably-sized international restaurant business. Our store growth internationally has also been a standout in the industry and our U.S. store growth has been gaining traction too. So all-in-all, my team and I feel pretty good about the state of Domino's brand. Looking specifically at our 2014 domestic business, I'm proud of both our strong full-year sales comp and our even bigger quarterly comp. Our reimages are going well, with over 1,000 domestic reimages completed at year end and another 1,000 or so planned for 2015. I believe we're building better brand equity with each of these are our physical locations are now better reflecting who we really are as a brand today. And even with franchisees investing in reimaging, they're also building new stores as their profits have continued to grow and their returns on new stores are good. Back in 2008, average self-reported franchisee EBITDA was around $50,000 per store. In 2014, it was over $85,000. So, our system has made real progress and our franchisees are really in the game. Technology has played a big role in our U.S. success, and 2014 was no exception. We reached a key metric at the end of the year with 50% of sales coming from digital channels, half of that from mobile devices. And we've had digital growth across all the platforms we offer. Since we've spruced up our mobile web platform with responsive design features that make it simple to use on any mobile device, this channel is now being used just as much as the apps we offer. We really think our new voice-ordering app has resonated with customers too. We've had lots of positive feedback about Dom and the Dom commercials. And people are really engaging with him or it. We've had about a half – we've had already had about a half a million orders come from Dom since its launch. We also introduced another new channel in conjunction with Super Bowl, a way to track your pizza on your Samsung Smart TV. We're definitely thinking and acting like an e-commerce company, but with the all-important emphasis of feeding your family a great dinner. In many ways, I think we're actually forging a new tech-to-table sector of the larger restaurant industry. On the international front, we simply posted yet another fabulous year. Our strong master franchisees, breadth of countries all around the globe and a good mix of established and emerging economies have made for a really winning combination again and again. Despite foreign exchange headwinds, our international division accounted for 35.5% of our total operating income in 2014 on robust same-store sales and record store growth. We made it up to 80 markets around the world last year. We opened four new markets, Paraguay, Norway, South Africa and Kenya. Success stories were many with great performances in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Turkey and the UK, among others. Our entry into sub-Saharan Africa got off to a very strong start, and our business in China has begun to take hold. We have a very strong master franchise partner there and pizza delivery is becoming more mainstream. We have over 60 stores in China now. So reimages are moving into fast cliff. We've reimaged over 2,200 stores already and plan another 1,000 more in 2015 on the domestic business. Like in the U.S., technology played a key role for us around the globe in 2014. At year-end, 70% of our international stores were either installed with Domino's PULSE or in the pipeline for installation. This common POS platform provides great management and online ordering tools to our franchisees as it has in U.S. for years. Despite the fact that some markets still don't have online ordering, which we consider a real opportunity, average online ordering sales among all of our international markets were over 40% at year-end and four markets had digital sales over 50%. Globally, we estimate we're at a run rate of approximately $4 billion in digital sales annually, which definitely reinforces this tech-to-table notion and indicates to us that continued investment around technology is the right strategic move for us. Wrapping up my commentary on the year, I have to say I'm incredibly pleased and energized about the possibilities for our brand. Our store growth has been accelerating around the world, our same-store sales have been consistently robust. Our franchisee profits and store investment returns are strong. Our technology is enabling better business outcomes all around the world. Our substantial recognizable global system now has retail sales of nearly $9 billion. And we're selling pizza that has taste appeal literally everywhere, it feeds a family affordably, it's highly customizable and nutritious and it's fun. So beyond all the metrics, we have a global team at Domino's with pizza sauce in their veins and we love what we do. That attitude ultimately delivers for both our customers and shareholders. And we plan to jump into 2015 with that same enthusiasm. Thanks for your time. And now, we'll open it up for questions.
Operator: Your first question will come from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. First, Mike, just a question on the G&A. I want to make sure I understand it. For the year for 2014, it seemed like it came in higher than we had expected. I think you talked about an increase of $3 million to $6 million, and ex the point (19:01), I think it was like $8 million. So was there an overrun in G&A relative to our expectations? Or do I have maybe that wrong somehow?
Michael T. Lawton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. We came out a little bit higher. We've been both – the variable comp that's certainly compared for the year is higher than we would have originally expected because we had a really strong year.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. So that's where – if there's a source from it, that is what it is, it was the bonus accrual, it's not technology or other spending in the business, is that correct?
Michael T. Lawton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Most of it was pretty much in line. I mean, certainly as you've seen, I mean over the last two years, we've continually said that we were going to be increasing G&A and sometimes it's a function of when you can get the hiring done as you're trying to add people. And we're a lot closer to where we wanted to be staffed at the end of the year than where we were in the first part of the year.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If you look at the whole year, the overage from what we had said at our Investor Day, at the beginning of 2014, the overage was entirely around kind of variable comp and incentives out to franchisees based on performance.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. That makes sense. And then, just the reorg of the distribution businesses, is that just an accounting exercise or are there actually efficiencies you think you're going to gain now in the distribution business? Is there more of a business reason for that combination?
Michael T. Lawton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, it's certainly partly a business reason of getting the Canadian subsidiaries underneath. But it isn't something that you're necessarily going to see a big number on because some of our efficiencies also affect the whole – the system and how that affects franchisee pricing. So, I wouldn't count on a lot out of that. But I think it's the right thing to do for the business.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is open.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sorry. I was on mute. Congratulations on a great quarter. So, there's been press even in the U.S. about a promotion that's been running in Australia, Pizza Mogul, and I'm curious just the thought process around sharing that particular promotion in other markets, and any reasons why it wouldn't work in the U.S. the way that it has in Australia? Thanks.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Karen, I think what I'd say is, we've got fabulous kind of innovation coming with technology around the world. We're trying things out in lots of different places. And we all kind of learn from the other markets as they do things. And so, we've certainly been watching the success of that in Australia. It's something that they've certainly been very excited about. And we'll look at it and make the determination of whether it makes sense in other markets based on kind of the results that we see from it. But overall, what it shows, I think, once again is that innovation does not only have to be about products. It can be about ways that we're taking technology to consumer. And clearly, they've been very happy with it in Australia.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you.
Mitch Hall - Director of Financial Planning and Analysis, Domino's Pizza, Inc.: Thanks, Karen.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions. The first is on the same-store sales. As you saw your comps really accelerate here into the double-digit range from the third quarter levels, was the majority of that traffic or did you also see a lot of people checking out at a higher average?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, majority of that is traffic.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And the second question, in the U.S., you saw almost 100 net new stores opened in 2014, and looking back at my model, that's the most since 2004. I guess it makes sense, obviously, with the improving economics. But you're around 5,000-ish stores today in the U.S. Can you remind us where you think that can go? And on top of where you think that can go, where is it that you're most under-penetrated, where will these stores be built?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, I think we've still got 1,000-plus stores that we can build in the U.S. There are some geographies that have a little bit more room for penetration than others, but it's largely everywhere. There is fill-in opportunities in a lot of markets. And so, while there are some areas in the Midwest and there was some opportunities in Northern California and some other places, really, it's filling in new areas or existing areas around the country. So, I don't know that it's going to be particularly geographically concentrated, but we definitely think there's kind of 1,000-plus that we can build over time.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): And I mean, are you seeing new potential franchisees come in and negotiate with you that have kind of been on the outside looking in or is the majority of these coming from existing franchisees?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: They are all coming from existing franchisees. So, go back to kind of our model, over 90% of our franchisees started as hourly folks in our stores. They worked their way up through the system to become successful managers and then they applied to become a franchisee. And so, last year, we had new franchisees come into the system, but they were all people who were managers or supervisors from within the system that became first-time franchisees. So, 100% of the store growth is coming from existing franchisees, and that's the best possible scenario because they know the business. The unit economics are strong. The cash flow is strong in the system. And what we're seeing is kind of what we've been talking about, I think, for a number of years, which is that as unit economics get better, stores are going to get built because they should be built, because the ROI on them is going to be strong. And as we've now had yet another year of increasing profits for our franchisees despite what were record-high cheese costs last year, they're getting more and more energized about the opportunities, and so we're seeing the builds happening.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Congrats. Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brian.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. Two questions. Just one from a comp perspective. With the double – with the ramp-up to, I guess, double-digit type comps at least in the U.S., I'm just wondering if there's any maybe underlying trends in terms of what type of store were seeing the outsized growth. We often hear that some of the higher-volume stores are actually seeing the greatest lifts. So, I'm just wondering, as you look at the system, where is the greatest strength coming from? And then maybe is the reimaging providing an outside lift, or is it more delivery versus take-out shift going or pizza is (26:54)?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Jeff, it really is fundamental across-the-board growth. Is it not geographically-based, it is not about higher-volume versus lower-volume stores. It is – and as you know, we were out with kind of the same price point we've run before. And the advertising for the quarter was mostly around Dom and new ways that people could access the brand through voice ordering. So, it is really about fundamental strength. It was – the vast majority of the growth was order count versus tickets. And it is just the broad strength of the brand and where we are with consumers now. We clearly feel very, very good about where we are and about the results that we put up.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. And then just from a menu pricing perspective, one, I'm just wondering as you assess it, where it currently sits and maybe what you're suggesting to franchisees. I mean, with the commodity basket now going to be down in 2015, I'm just wondering whether there's maybe an uptick in discounting with the inflation easing, whether it's by yourself or by peers of yours that might do something along those lines?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I think our system has been remarkably disciplined. And last year, in the face of record high cheese costs, they held the line and their profits continued to increase despite being pretty modest about kind of price increases through the system last year. So – and now as cheese costs come down, obviously, that's good news for store-level profitability, but I don't think you're going to see material pricing changes from the system. They've just been very, very disciplined about doing what is best for the customer, and that's clearly played into very, very strong results.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Would you think the industry might get more aggressive or you think everyone kind of has that same discipline as the prices ease?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I can't predict what our competition is going to do. I guess what I'd say is everybody has to address margins in their own way. While food costs are off, there are probably some labor pressures out there. So I don't know – I don't know that you're going to see a dramatic change, really, from the industry. But obviously, those are decisions they're going to make.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thanks.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Chris O'Cull with KeyBanc.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Chris.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Patrick, independents appear to be have had net closures for two consecutive years. What do you think are the primary factors driving the wedge in performance between you guys and independents?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There have been three factors over time that I've always looked at in kind of the scale advantage that somebody like a Domino's has versus the independents. It's the efficiency of our food cost, it's the know-how around the brand and how to efficiently run a unit. And it's the advertising and kind of the brand strength that you have. And for many, many years, those three did not drive consolidation in the category. And you started to see now the last few years, some real consolidation. And I think the different has been technology. Our technological advantage, the ability for customers to access the brand that way, the ability for us to build a platform that we think is absolutely second to none in terms of giving the consumer a great experience with Domino's is just something that the smaller players are either not able to do or not able to do anywhere near as well and as efficiently as we do it. And I think that alone, we're doing a lot of other things right. I mean, our advertising and branding and the efficiency of our market spend and all of those things are clearly working. We think that getting the stores reimaged is going to be a positive. And we've got fabulous franchisees who are excited and motivated about where we are. They're driving the brand. It's a lot of things playing into it, but I think the big new factor has really been technology and our ability to drive business through that. And it's just something they haven't been able to match, and so it's put real pressure on their sales and ultimately their profitability. And that's why we've been taking pretty consistent share.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Very helpful. And then, one other question, Mike, since the Analyst Day, we've seen a large refinancing by Dunkin in the ABS market, and another company looks to be entering that market. Are there any reasons you would not refi the callable portion of that debt in October this year?
Michael T. Lawton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Well, we'll have to assess at that point in time based on market conditions and also recognizing that the whole thing becomes callable, not too many years down the road and it'll just be part of what it looks like at that point in time.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Does refiing the callable portion cause you any difficulties in refiing the remaining portion in July 2017?
Michael T. Lawton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: It depends on the duration of the debt and what you decide to – kind of what your plans could be going forward. So, not necessarily. It's just as we get to that point in time, we will certainly look hard at it.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies.
Alexander Slagle - Jefferies LLC: Hey. Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on Jeff's question and get your perspective on historically, when you look back, I mean, what were the biggest drivers behind the price point battles in the industry? And like, what are the things we should really watch out for as red flags?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we're obviously pretty happy with where we are in the profits that we're generating at the store level for the franchisees. Our pricing has been working. It's interesting. I've always had a very different perspective about pricing in the category than even some of comments I've heard from the investor community and some of my competitors. I think it's always been viewed as this highly promotional category. And my view is if it were that aggressive on pricing, you'd have seen more consolidation in the category over time than you've seen. This has been the least consolidated category within the restaurant industry for a very long time. And so, you're now starting to see some consolidation. And it's been pretty consistent over the last few years. So, I go back to the pricing overall, it's generating good growth for us. It's generating good growth and profits for our franchisees. Overall, I'm happy with where it is. I'm obviously very happy with the overall performance of the business. And we can generate good sales growth and good profit growth with kind of the approach that we brought to pricing, then I'm very happy with where we are. And as you know, our national price point has been the same now for a number of years. And it's clearly been working.
Alexander Slagle - Jefferies LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Smith with Feltl & Company.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company: Hi, guys. I just want to look at the traffic or order count a little bit deeper. Can you talk at all about frequency from current customers versus kind of new customers to Domino's?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's been a pretty good mix of both of those from order count. And I guess what I'd say is the customer base, certainly new customers coming in, but I think what's maybe even more important is retention of existing customers as we're giving them a better experience. And within that retention is also improved frequency. So, I think it's – those are really the three factors that will drive higher order counts, and it's been a pretty good combination of those. But I think the retention and the experience and the customer satisfaction that our existing customers have has been really the primary driver of it.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company: Okay. Second, at the Investor Day, you talked a bit about expanding company-operated restaurants. Any more insight on kind of your thoughts behind that and when maybe we see more of a ramp in build-out from here?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, I don't think you're going to see a big ramp. We just feel like we should be doing our part. The unit economics are good. You're certainly going to see us building some, but you're not going to see a notable increase in the mix of corporate stores. We feel pretty good about where we are in terms of the number of corporate stores. We think we definitely need to be doing our fair share of the building, but you're not going to see a material increase in the mix of corporate stores. You're probably going to see more it staying kind of line with where it is and basically are doing our part of the growth of the overall system.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Great. You mentioned in your prepared comments, and I think you've mentioned it before about your point-of-sale enhancements. Could you talk about maybe what kind of functionality that you would like that you don't have and how they may influence the sales and profitability of your business overall?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I mean, the point-of-sale system, obviously, it gives us something that's having one system and I think this is maybe most important, there are lots of great functionality around it and kind of what we have there. But I think what's most important is that we have one. And it gives us efficiency as we tie online ordering to it and all the rest of it. But it is just a point-of-sale system at the end of the day. There is reporting behind it and some analytics that the franchisees can look at and kind of analyze their business and how it's doing and we think that's important for them. But I think the most important thing – I think it's a great system. I think it's the best out there for managing our business. But I think what's even more important is that we've got this one system that gives us consistency. It allows us to tie these online ordering platforms to it more efficiently. And you're now at not only 100% of the U.S. But as we mentioned, about 70% of our international stores are now either on it or have signed up and will be moving on to it. And we think it just brings great efficiencies. At the end of the day, it's a tool that the franchise use in different ways – the franchisees use in different ways to manage their business. But we think having that one platform has been a really powerful tool for us as we've been driving e-commerce.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And that is, I guess, the question. So, 100% of the system is currently on PULSE, correct?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In the U.S.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: In the U.S. Is there any kind of major enhancement that you can do or would like to do to the existing U.S. PULSE system?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. I don't know that there are kind of big specific things that we're working on. We were always coming up with new ways to make it a little bit better and a little bit easier. And can you speed up the order-taking process or the accuracy or all of that? But at the end of the day, it's working well. Where we're spending a lot of our time and effort are on kind of the e-commerce platforms that are tying to it. And we think that's ultimately the big win.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory.
Peter M. Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Hey. Thanks. Congrats on a great year. I know we always talk about the 50% of the orders that are digital, but what about the other, call it, 50% of the orders that are coming in? What's the biggest hurdle to converting those orders to digital and maybe accelerating that beyond that, call it, 5% or 6% growth rate every year?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So, I think there are a couple things. So, first of all, a little under 10% of our overall orders are people walking into the store and placing the order right there. So, roughly, today, if you talk about 50% digital, what you're really looking at is 50% digital, a little over 40% over the phone and about 10% walk-in. And so, the walk-in customers, there may be some things we can do that they're using a kiosk or whatever. But the bigger opportunity is kind of around the 40% that are still calling in. And the answer is, we want our customers to be able to access the brands however they want to access the brands. And there are still people who would rather call in and place that order and do it over the phone, using their voice as opposed to one of our apps or digitally ordering, and we want to make sure that's a great experience for them as well. And so, what we're seeing is I think we're doing things to make our digital platforms better and better, and more and more efficient. But some of this is just about people kind of adopting technology, and when do they decide that they want to shift from ordering over the phone to ordering digitally. I think the one area that I would say that there is going to continue to be opportunity is today, a higher percentage of delivery orders are placed digitally than carryout orders are placed digitally. And I think there is some opportunity there. Some of that I think is just kind of habit of the customers that the same customer who wants to go into a store, see the store, see the people who are making the pizzas has also been a little more likely to be the same person who wants to do it over the phone and kind of feel like they're controlling that process a little bit more. And so, we think there are some things we'll be able to do to enhance things for that carryout customer and maybe that will push it along as well. But overall, as we've got markets now outside of the U.S. that are well over 50%, some of them push into 60% of total digital, we think there's going to continue to be upside for us domestically and certainly in a lot of international markets that are still relatively early in the ramp-up on digital. We know they've got a long runway as they get better and better at providing a good digital experience for the customers and as the customer base there gets more comfortable with placing orders digitally.
Peter M. Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Great. And then just on labor turnover, anything to talk about there, as the labor market's tightening, ability to hold on to your labor and hire new drivers?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's interesting. I've said often that the number one thing that correlates to strength in our sales is people who are employed. Employed people buy more pizza than unemployed people. And the labor market strengthening is clearly one of the contributing factors to the strength of our business overall. We think it's a good thing. So, the first thing I'd say is, I love the fact that the labor market is strengthening. I love the fact that more people are employed. And to the extent to which that means the labor market tightens up a little bit, that's a great thing. I mean, that's an overall positive for the economy and for our business. And there are some areas where we are certainly feeling it, and it gets a little bit tougher. I don't know that our turnover has gone up. In fact, it has not gone up. But certainly, there are franchisees who are more focused on staffing their stores and making sure that we're giving great service. And if that puts a little bit of pressure on wages as well, that's an okay thing because there's a big offset in terms of a healthier economy and top line as well. So, certainly, something we look at. We got to make sure that the franchisees are treating people right, that they're training them correctly, that they're doing everything they can to make it a good experience for them. And they do that in a variety of ways and is part of why having an entrepreneurial system is great because they address those needs market by market.
Peter M. Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bank of America.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. The same-store sales in the U.S. were phenomenal, but looked like the company store margins were actually down year-over-year. I know you mentioned food cost inflation. Is there anything else behind that? I guess, I would have thought the comp might have overcome the food costs?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Well, their absolute profits were up. But the percentage margin was off a little bit because of – food was still high in the fourth quarter. Food's now down. And so, clearly, that's going to help. But the traffic growth and the sales growth more than offset kind of the food cost pressure that we had. And so, ultimately, it drove more dollar profits. But that was mostly a result of food cost in the fourth quarter.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then the CapEx number for the full year and for the fourth quarter came in a little higher than I thought even with the airplane shift. So, was some of that just spending against the things that you've talked about as the overall CapEx numbers moved higher or was there anything unusual in that?
Michael T. Lawton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: The key thing is when you look at our software and what we're doing on the e-commerce and the point-of-sale and everything else that we do, we're pretty – we're really good at estimating how much cash is going to go out the door for the year. It's a little bit tougher to get exactly which piece is going to get capitalized as internally-developed software versus what part is going to hit the expense lines and then what people are working on, and that's really about the only difference that's in there.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. And then just last one – yeah, so the increase in the dividend obviously – but didn't look back there's any share buyback in the quarter and just curious why that was the case.
Michael T. Lawton - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: We've spent over $80 million in the first three quarters. And you saw a pretty rapid runoff in the price. And the fact is since I had a good chunk of the money spent, I was kind of watching to see what happened. That's all.
Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And we have no further questions in queue at this time. Presenters, are there any closing remarks?
J. Patrick Doyle - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. Just like to thank everybody for being on the call and I look forward to talking to you again as we report our first quarter earnings on April 23. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-10-14 10:00:00) =====

Operator: Good morning. My name is Johanna, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 Financial Results Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Lynn Liddle, you may begin your conference.
Lynn Liddle: Thanks, Johanna. I appreciate it. Welcome, everybody. We are very excited to be announcing our third quarter earnings this morning. With us, I have our usual folks. Patrick Doyle, our President and CEO and Mike Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer. They have some prepared remarks that they will make. Then we will open up to Q&A. Usual rules apply. We are asking since this is an investor call, that members of the media remain in listen-only mode. Then I will direct you all to our Safe Harbor statement in the press release in the event that any forward-looking remarks are made today. With that, I am happy to turn it over to Mike.
Mike Lawton: Thank you, Lynn, and good morning everyone. I am pleased to report that once again, we delivered solid results for our shareholders during the quarter. Our international and domestic divisions posted strong same-store sales growth. We opened significant number of new stores and our adjusted EPS grew 23.5% over the prior year. Our global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 13.8%. When we exclude the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 12.4%. The drivers of this growth included domestic same-store sales, which rose 7.7% in the quarter, lapping a positive 5.4% from last year. This was comprised of franchisee same-store sales, which were up 7.8% and company-owned stores, which were up 6.1%, due to stronger order and ticket growth. We are pleased to report that we opened 14 net domestic stores in the quarter, consisting of 23 store openings and 9 closures. During the trailing four quarters, we opened 77 net domestic stores. Our international division had another strong quarter as same-store sales grew 7.1%, lapping our prior-year quarter increase of 5%. In the third quarter, our international division grew by 146 stores, made up of 160 store openings and 14 closures. For the trailing four quarters, we opened 638 net international stores. Turning to revenues, total revenues were up 42.5 million or 10.5% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of three factors. First, higher supply chain revenues from increased supply chain center volumes, higher commodity prices, specifically cheese and increased sales of equipment and supplies to our stores as our store reimaging program accelerates. Second, higher international royalty and supply chain revenues from increased same-store sales and store count growth. Third, higher domestic franchise royalty revenues, again, from higher same-store sales and store comp growth. Moving on to operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter was flat as compared to the prior-year quarter at 29.9%. The key impacts to operating margin for this quarter were a change in the mix of our revenue, which positively impacted our operating margin as a greater percentage of our revenue this quarter came from international royalties, which have no cost of sales and we had a lower percentage of revenue from food sales at our supply chain centers and from our company-owned stores. This increase was offset by the impact on operating margin of higher commodity cost. The average cheese block price in the third quarter was $2.04 per pound versus $1.72 in the same period last year, which led to our overall market basket increasing 4.2% as compared to the prior year quarter. As a reminder, commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar markup to our franchisees. Therefore, higher commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, negatively impact our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues. Year-to-date commodity prices have run about 5% over last year, with cheese prices staying higher than expected. We expect Q4 cost to also increase at a similar pace and we expect the full year market basket to be up 4% to 6% over last year. Turning to G&A expenses, G&A increased $2.7 million or 5% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to our continued expansion of e-commerce and technology support as well as expansion of our international team. Through Q3, our G&A spend, which includes $1.7 million gain on the sale of stores we had in the first quarter is $2.4 million above last year. Also going forward, we expect to take a non-recurring charge of approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter in connection with the board's approval to replace our corporate airplane, which has dated avionics, with a newer model used plane. Excluding the impact of the plane, we continued to expect our G&A for the full year to be in the range of $3 million to $6 million over 2013. We noted the purchase of the plane in our 10-Q [Inaudible] up here as well since it will also increase our current estimate for 2014 CapEx spend by approximately $20 million beyond our stated range of $35 million to $45 million. Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 37.5% for the quarter. We continue to expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our third quarter net income was up $5 million, which was 16.3%. This increase was primarily driven by higher domestic and international same-store sales, international store growth and higher supply chain volumes. Our third quarter diluted EPS was $0.63. There were no significant items affecting comparability in the quarter. The $0.63 is a $0.12 or 23.5% increase from the $0.51 as adjusted EPS in the third quarter of last year. This increase is primarily a result of our improved operating results, which benefited us by $0.11, and our lower diluted share count, mostly due to share repurchases, which benefited us by $0.01. Now, turning to our use of cash, during the second quarter we repurchased and retired approximately 243,000 shares at a cost of $17.4 million or an average price of $71.69 per share. We also returned over $14 million to our shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend. In closing, we are really pleased with the quarter and our consistent positive performance so far this year. Thank you for your time today. Now, I will turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks Mike. Third quarter was certainly one that we are proud of. We are driving some strong momentum with our formula of great people and food, our focus on service and our industry leading technology. Our franchisees are delivering excellent store growth worldwide and we are pleased that they have embraced our Pizza Theater store image in neighborhoods around the world. Before moving onto the details about what a great quarter we had, I want to take a minute to highlight some other positive news we announced this morning. As I said, people were main ingredient to the success of this quarter and to our strong past record. Domino's has some of the best people in our industry, from franchisees to team members to leadership. That's why I am pleased to announce that some of the industries' most proven and effective leaders are assuming key roles on our biggest businesses. Russell Weiner came to us from Pepsi in 2008 as our Chief Marketing Officer. Since then, he has been a linchpin of our success in turning around the domestic Domino's brand. Creativity, research-based decision making and strong franchise relationships are his hallmarks. Russell has been promoted to President, Domino's U.S.A, and will now also lead our U.S. franchise and corporate operations in addition to marketing. Rich Allison, who has led a team in our international division that has greatly outperformed the sector as they did once again this quarter, has been promoted to President, Domino's International. He has done terrific things for our business in the four short years he has been with us, opening over 1,800 stores in 10 countries during that time and solidifying great relationships with our international master franchisees. My colleague here with me today, our CFO, Mike Lawton, will now additionally assume the leadership of our Supply Chain business. Having run our international business in the past as well as interim position running our technology division and past general management experience at Gerber Products Company, I am very confident that he can enhance the overall effectiveness of this business as well as find more global efficiencies. My congratulations and very strong support go out to these unparalleled leaders. Now, turning back to reporting a pretty fabulous quarter, here in the U.S. this quarter marked our [14th] [ph] straight quarter of positive same-store sales growth. A number of factors led to these strong results. Our sales growth was pretty evenly driven by both, traffic and ticket growth. We continue to promote our new specialty chicken for much of the quarter, a product we launched in the second quarter. Our advertising continued to prove effective in the third quarter bringing in new customers, and helping to increase ticket as chicken is generally sold as a side item with pizza. We also drove good digital order books. As we said in the past, digital orders have a slightly higher ticket than traditional phone orders. Some franchisees raised prices a bit in the quarter, but their increases were disciplined and we did not see it across the board among all franchisees. Overall, the momentum we have going right now feels pretty good. It's helping to moderate some of the concerns over increased commodity prices, particularly cheese. Cheese prices are certainly higher than the experts had expected at the beginning of the year, but higher sales have helped mitigate the impact. We had continued growth in domestic store counts, having opened a net 77 stores over the past 12 months. Our momentum is also helping to keep the system invigorated as we ramp up our store reimages. Over 10% of our system in the U.S. has been reimaged so far and the pace is above what we expected it would be at this time. Turning to our international division, the third quarter was another solid one in terms of sales and store growth. Great promotions, new products and in some markets strong digital ordering have helped propel sales. Many of our international franchisees continue to get robust returns on their store investment, driving an excellent quarter of store growth. India, Turkey, Japan and the U.K., continue to be leaders in store growth. This demonstrates a nice mix of growth between developed and emerging markets, a hallmark of our international group. We also opened in Norway during the third quarter, where we expect to have two more stores opened by the end of this year. A number of our master franchisees reported results recently. Domino's Pizza Enterprises, our largest franchisee, announced strong first half results in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Japan. They also continued to drive remarkable digital growth. Earlier this month, our U.K. master franchisee announced impressive results in their core U.K. market as well as in Ireland and Switzerland. They also noted that 70% of their U.K. delivery sales are now digital, an outstanding milestone for their system. Overall, our international division quarter this continued its history of driving excellent sales results as it has for over 20 years of positive quarterly same-store sales, a record we are proud to highlight. An ongoing story in both, our domestic and international businesses is our digital leadership, which is helping define our brand in the U.S. and in many countries around the world as well. In the U.S., I am pleased to report that our iPad app has the highest conversion and a highest ticket of all of our digital ordering channels. It has exceeded all of our performance expectation and sets new benchmarks, almost immediately upon launch. We continue to work to get even more iPad users to download the new app as it provides a very robust ordering experience that plays into many of the iPad device strengths. In the U.S., you may have noticed that in the past few weeks, we have been promoting our voice ordering capabilities in our television ads. This is yet another example of how we use national promotions to focus on technology rather than exclusively focusing on new products for all of our national windows. This is our first big promotion of our voice platform available on iPhone and Android apps. Without any promotion, we have already achieved over 200,000 voice orders since it was introduced in June. Our international markets continued to drive digital ordering sales as well and there are number of markets with digital ordering levels that exceed the U.S. international digital ordering average is over 40%, which is remarkable, but there are also a number of markets with the significant opportunity to drive further growth in this area. We know the benefits that we drive globally from digital orders and feel that continuing our leadership in this area will benefit our brand globally. In closing, I would like to thank our franchisees and store team members around the world for their effective work in driving such a great quarter. The store team members continue to do a terrific job taking care of our customers and I am thrilled that we are able to give them great opportunities to grow in our system. Our franchisees continue to become more and more aggressive about growing our brand and our system as they see their great efforts generate strong returns. Our excellent top-line sales growth, healthy store growth and technology advances helped us report strong EPS and produce robust free cash flow once again. We deploy that cash towards shareholder-friendly stock buybacks and our regular quarterly dividend. With that operator, I am ready to open the floor to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Good morning. First, Patrick, you talked about the remodels and you are about 10% through. Can you talk about the response you have seen from them if you are willing to talk about sales lift or maybe you could speak about their success qualitatively at least?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Sure. The answer is, we are a little over 10% now on the system domestically; we are higher than that outside of the U.S. As we do individual reimages the answer is we see a modest increase from those stores. Our belief is that as the system becomes largely reimaged, that it is going to continue to drive kind of the momentum that we have in the business. It takes a little bit of time, we are seeing some lift in those stores that get reimaged, but we think the real gain from that is going to be as we get the whole system done, everybody is seeing kind of this new image around Domino's that continues to drive the brand and momentum that we got in the business.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. You mentioned pricing was a small piece. Overall, there has been some incremental pricing taken. Can you just quantify how much was that in aggregate? Was it material versus last quarter or did that explain any of the acceleration in comp? Was it small enough that it kind of blended down to not material?
Patrick Doyle: No. What I would say, John, is we are not going to give the absolute specifics on that. It was a nice mix between orders and ticket. What I would say though is, even within the ticket, some of that is selling more food, so with the specialty chicken out there, some of the reason the ticket is up is simply that we are selling more food in each order than we were previously and a little bit of it is pricing.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Thank you. Good morning and great job on the quarter.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: If I missed this I apologize, but did you update us on what percentage of your U.S. sales came from digital in 3Q?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. We are still right in the mid-40s, so this is what we have always seen as we kind of get gains in the fourth quarter every year and into the first quarter of the following year. In kind of the spring and summer as people move away from their homes, they are out about a little bit more, we have generally seen that kind of flatten out, so we are still kind of in that 45% range that we have been in, which is kind of expected. Then generally what happens is, we get into the fourth quarter of the year and we start to see it move up again.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Then if I could follow to that segueing obviously technology has been a key share gain driver for you guys for a couple years now. It would seem like the pace of that is picking up steam though and you of course talked on several different points that you have made improvements to your platform whether the iPad or the iPhone apps. Is there anything sort of that was incremental just in 3Q versus the first half of the year that you think really helped to provide a comp lift whether through higher tickets or more frequent orders associated with technology?
Patrick Doyle: No. I think, go back to the answer around mix, I mean, this is the time of the year that mix isn't necessarily growing versus the previous quarter. It has grown materially versus the year ago quarter, but the real gain on digital is from frequency. I mean, it's ultimately about the better retention of customers, better frequency of orders from customers. As they have a better experience with Domino's, we get more orders from them. That's really what drives it more than anything else. What I would say and what you are seeing from us is, we are absolutely determined that we are going to maintain and grow our leadership in digital ordering and we are absolutely not standing still and voice ordering is kind of the newest step in that and we are really pleased with 200,000 orders now having used the voice capabilities without having promoted it and now we have gone on air and it is yet one more way in which we believe we have absolutely got the best digital ordering platform in the space and it's another way that we think we are continuing to extend our leadership there.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: That is great. Thanks so much Patrick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Slagle with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Alex Slagle - Jefferies: Thanks. It is actually a question, sort of a follow-up on John's question before that touched on the pricing and mix. I would like to get a handle on how you managed commodity inflation so well in the third quarter specifically on the corporate domestic stores, I was just surprised to see cost of goods flat year-over-year even after another big inflationary quarter on cheese costs here in the third quarter and any comments you have on that. What was different about this quarter versus previous quarters?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. You know, I think it goes back to kind of the mix. We had good order count growth, we had good ticket growth, we had kind of the increased amount of food within the basket selling chicken, which is good for our cost of goods and for the overall profitability of the business and it's really about the balance of those things that we think we got it. 
Mike Lawton: As well as levering some of the cost beyond just food cost because of the higher sales levels.
Alex Slagle - Jefferies: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays: Great. Thank you very much. Congrats to management on the promotions. It seems very well deserved. You know, just on the U.S., the category in general seems pretty clear you are taking share, hard to actually tell where the share comes from, but it would seem safe to say from independents and your national competitors. I am just wondering, Patrick, whether you have any updated data on where the category is now in terms of growth. I think in the past you have said maybe 1% or 2%, and what you are seeing if you have any data in terms of independents whether it is just their unit counts. It would just seem like, in this type of environment where you are taking such meaningful share, you would expect to see some closures on that front. Then I had a follow-up.
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I don't know if there is really a material change in kind of where we think the category is and kind of the competitive environment. I think category is continuing to grow slowly and still is. You have seen, I think a little bit of ticket growth from us now and from some of our competitors, so I think that is playing in and may continue to play in a little bit more as we go forward depending on kind of what happens with cost pressures overall in the business. I guess the other thing I would say is, in terms of the competition and store closures and all of that, capital was pretty available right now and it's part of why you are starting to see a little bit of acceleration in our store growth. It's a function of unit economics continuing to make good progress over the last few years, but the markets for lending and for capital to franchisees have come around nicely. You all were asking questions a year ago about the reimage process and what it affects. Our store growth, and our answer then was maybe at the margin it would a little bit, but overall we didn't think it was going too much and I think that is playing out the way we expected it to. Partly that's because of availability of capital for the franchisees to get these reimages done and where they choose to relocate, they can do that as well and generate some store growth, so I think that has got to be playing out a little bit with the competition as well, which is there is some availability of capital again and that may be allowing some people to hang in there that may not be getting the same kind of results that we are.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays: Understood. Then Mike, you mentioned, Patrick, at the end of your prepared remarks, just your cash usage and the repo and dividend balance. I did not know whether there was any update. I think you are probably now down below or at or below that 4.5 times level from a leverage standpoint, whether it's still status quo and you are happy to see that leverage ratio fall further or Patrick…?
Patrick Doyle: We have stopped amortizing the debt, so while it may continue to fall a little bit further if we are able to continue to grow our operating results. It won't fall further, because of deleveraging through repayment and debt. At this point, there is really not much more to update you on.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays: Got it. Is there any comment on FX? Just seems like for the rest of 2014 and into 2015, at least where rates currently stand? The impact it might be having on you going forward?
Mike Lawton: Yes. For the third quarter, the impact of FX was slightly positive, but relatively small. We have raised our cents and the dollar - has strengthened a little bit, which again would lead us at this point in time towards, say, in fourth quarter now like would be a big impact.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.  
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer: Thanks. Congrats to everybody on the promotions.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer: I have got a follow-up question just on the balance sheet. Most of my operational questions have been answered. I think a third of the debt becomes redeemable sometime next year. Can you remind us exactly when that is and also remind us what type of interest rate you need to see on new debt to actually execute anything on that front?
Patrick Doyle: Okay. Well, the debt that you referred to has a rate of 5.25%, and we could call roughly a third of our outstanding in July of next year. In terms of what rate, we need to see. That would be a function of what kind of duration we were looking on the debt. There is certainly issuance cost that goes along with that it is not really something I can give you specific rate on other than it's obviously going to be better 5.25%, so we will see at that point in time what kind of tenure you could get on the debts, what it means in terms of what it would do for the other two-thirds, it would still remain and we will keep an eye on.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of the Chris O'Cull with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc: Great. Thanks good morning. Patrick, some operators have talked about loyalty programs having higher spend, frequency and satisfaction than orders that are placed online. Can you guys talk about Domino's opportunities with either a loyalty or a rewards program?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. I mean, it is certainly something that we have looked at. Right now what's driving our frequency and growth is, we think just given people a better experience overall, but it's certainly something we have looked at. Our impression at least from comments that have been made at Papa John's that has worked for them, so it is certainly something that we keep an eye on, but overall we are obviously pretty darn happy with our results and our mix of orders and ticket and all that, but it's something we will keep an eye on.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc: Then just as a follow-up, I guess, the other competitor, Pizza Hut, has fallen behind in terms of getting conversion to online ordering. If they were to be more aggressive, let's say in the fourth quarter to try to drive online ordering usage, how would the company respond? How would Domino's respond to something like that in terms of or I mean, what's the risk of that, I guess, to the category?
Patrick Doyle: Actually, I not only don't think it's a risk. I think it's more an upside. I often talked about the fact that I really think that the biggest think that is going on in the category is the larger players, largely driven by digital have been taking share from the smaller players and I know that Pizza Hut has had a couple of bumps, but I think in their latest release they talked about now being at 40% of their off-premise sale something like that, so they are not in a bad shape in a bad way there and I think what the real opportunity is that as the three largest players continue to show that this is a better way for customers to do business with us, we are going to have an opportunity to grow the category hopefully, but also continue to take some share from the people that can't kind of put up a platform of the quality that we are able to do. We certainly take pride in what we have done and want to make sure that we main leadership in this area, but I still believe that the greater gap is going to be between what the three biggest players are able to do with digital versus everybody else rather than what we are able to do necessarily versus our other national players, national competitors who are in the same digital space. I think as they continue to advance, it's going to continue to move people across the digital ordering and I think that plays to us.
Chris O'Cull - KeyBanc: Okay. Great. Thanks guys.
Mark Smith - Feltl and Company: Hi, guys. Can you give us an update on what percent of company stores are reimaged? 
Patrick Doyle:  Yes. We are today at, I think, the percentage it has got to be about 30%, something like that. Coming along nicely, we are ahead versus the overall system and expect to be done prior to the whole system being completed, so moving along pretty nicely there.
Mark Smith - Feltl and Company: Okay. Then is there an opportunity, I know you guys have talked about that you like where you are at on your franchise mix today, but is there an opportunity to do some refranchising?
Patrick Doyle: You know, I don't think you are going to see us do that. We have always said, we are going to be opportunistic, but that can be opportunistic buying or selling. The size that we are in today, I think, with our corporate store unit is good, it is generating reasonable returns for us, for our shareholders, it is where we develop our people and our leadership. It is where we test things and it needs to be a scaled business in order to do that, so I think we are in pretty good shape there. As we move into the mode of more and more hopefully store growth in our system, it is something we got to do with our corporate stores as well, so I don't think you are going to see major change there. Overall, I think we are in a reasonable range on our corporate stores, and no, I would not expect material refranchising of those stores.
Mark Smith - Feltl and Company: Okay. Excellent. Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Patrick Doyle: Well, John?
John Ivankoe - JPMorgan: Sorry. Hello?
Patrick Doyle: Good morning. You weren't coming through.
John Ivankoe - JPMorgan: Can you hear me?
Patrick Doyle: Yes.
John Ivankoe - JPMorgan: I was saying on the Domino's website, it looks like a two-topping Pan is being offered at $8.99. I think it was previously $7.99, so is that correct? If so, when was that change made? Similarly, had there been an increase in delivery fees at all?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. We are actually, I think, we are taking a $1 more on the pan, and it's an amazing product and clearly I think we could support that. You have seen our national promotion remain consistent, but we really believe we have got the best hand-made pan pizza out there. The demand is there for it. Deliveries of few franchisees have done it and that is kind of just market opportunistic. We obviously at cost pressures, we look at what is happening with our competition, but we certainly haven't taken much there. Most stores have not increased anything there. A few certainly have opportunistically, but not materially.
John Ivankoe - JPMorgan:  Okay. Then internationally, usually very, very strong, but looking at the opportunities it does seem like India maybe demand slowed in recent quarters, so can you talk about the color maybe you are getting from your franchisee there on demand and what is being done to get the same-store sales moving in a positive direction again?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, so what hasn't slowed at all is store growth. In fact, store growth continues to get stronger and stronger, because the cash on cash returns on the stores there are really terrific. The whole restaurant industry, I think, in India has seen slower same-store sales growth. In fact most folks have been a little bit negative over the course of the last year or two. We have certainly felt that as well and the team is doing a great job of continuing to bringing along, we have launched some new products and doing a number of things to try to drive that, but we clearly need to see the economy get a little bit more robust over there again. It's still growing and still going pretty nicely, but it is not growing as much as it was three or four years ago and you have had some inflation over there, which I think has affected consumer behavior there a little bit as well. Overall, I will tell you, I remain very, very bullish on India and where it is and where it is continue to go. Certainly, our partners over there Jubilant FoodWorks, have not taken their foot off the gas at all in terms of continuing to grow the system there.
John Ivankoe - JPMorgan:  Okay. Great. Thanks and congrats on a good quarter.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Anderson with Miller Tabak. Your line is open.
Steve Anderson - Miller Tabak: Good morning. A quick question on commodities, you left your outlook for this year unchanged at 4% to 6%. Looking at some of the dairy prices and some of the pork prices, the two areas you looked at in terms of higher cost, both, it looks like they have been plateauing if not actually starting to decline. Do you think it is a little early or do you think you can give a little insight onto where you think 2015 will end up?
Patrick Doyle: 2015 is, we will talk about that on our Investor Day in January, when we have got a little more visibility. We will give you what we think is our best guess of what is going to happen at that point in time, but to your point you made in the last couple of weeks both, pork and cheese have moderated a little bit and hopefully that's the start of something good, but can't go much beyond that at this point in time.
Steve Anderson - Miller Tabak: I understand. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Meis with Citadel. Your line is open.
David Meis - Citadel: Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Just one quick question on, apologies if you guys had already answered this, but how much of the growth is coming from increased commodity prices versus through same-store sales and volume uptick?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. We haven't given an exact number on the mix on that. It's a nice mix of orders and ticket. Then I would say within ticket, it's a mix of selling more food in each order and actual price increase. The price increase is pretty modest in there when you kind of look at it along with selling some more food, so haven't given the exacts or not going to give the exacts for competitive reasons, what I would tell you is, it's a nice mix of orders and ticket.
David Meis - Citadel: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot guys and congrats again.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory. Your line is open.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory: Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Just wanted to ask, for this quarter I know the World Cup overlapped better majority of this quarter. Did you see any, I guess, positive momentum from the World Cup?
Patrick Doyle: Peter, we get just a little bit from the World Cup, when it comes around, but I would tell you it is not really material within the overall. There are a few markets that field a bit more, but every time it comes around, we are kind of looking at it trying to figure out how was it played in each market and it always depends to great extent on where it is being played. There are time zones, where frankly it doesn't have much effect, because it's the middle of the night or it is breakfast for people depending on where it is, so the answer is helps a little bit at the margin, but not a really big effect.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory: Great. Then, Patrick, I know you have talked about in the past about 1,000-store potential left in the US. Any thoughts on update on that, is that still a good number? Any thoughts on an acceleration of new unit growth potentially next year?
Patrick Doyle: Yes. It's still a good number. It is still something that we think is very possible. Like you have seen, if you look at our kind of four-quarter trailing or 12-month trailing net store growth in the U.S., you have seen it kind of continue to move upwards as we talked about before. Our goal is to continue to accelerate a little bit off of the growth we have had and it has been kind of playing out that way and we think we are doing it the right way. We are doing it because store economics continue to get better, our franchisees continue to get stronger and strong. Their income statements look better, their balance sheets are stronger and that gives them an opportunity to build stores, so they are actually still stores out there to be built. The 1,000 is, I think, a reasonable number to continue to look at as same-store sales grow and the population in the U.S. continues to grow at about 1% a year. That feels pretty good to us.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory: Great. Thank you very much.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Paul Westra with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Paul Westra - Stifel: Great. Thanks. A question on really any granularity you might be able to give us on your technology investments and maybe any G&A investments. Obviously, you are holding that line pretty tight. Clearly, results are very strong, so I am just curious about maybe the ability to maybe invest more in infrastructure that might be able to garner results for the longer term.
Patrick Doyle: I think, one thing I would point out is that a very significant amount of our CapEx, well over a third in each of the last two or three years has gone into technology. Most of that has been on areas of support, either our proprietary point of sale system or e-commerce as opposed to the core systems of the company, so we are doing some of what you suggest. As far as the increases in G&A, we are pretty tight on what we do with what you could call back office or G&A and kind of the negative terminology you might use it for. Most of what our increases have been, it has all been to support the growth of the international business or the growth of the IT area. If you are able to see our office, you would see that we are not shy about adding into IT, if it's something that's going to help us grow our revenue. I think what you are suggesting is we are certainly on the same track and we would continue to do so.
Paul Westra - Stifel: Great. Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Paul.
Mike Lawton: Thank you, everybody, for your time today. I look forward to reporting our year end results in February.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Tanisha and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 Financial Results Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Liddle, you may begin your conference.
Lynn Liddle: Thanks, Tanisha and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us on this lovely Michigan summer day. We are going to follow our usual protocol. We should be just about an hour or little bit under an hour this morning. We have some prepared remarks and we’ll follow up with an opportunity for Q&A. This is designed to be an investor call. So I will ask members of the media on the call to be on a listen only mode and I will also call of your attention to our Safe Harbor statement that you will find in our 8K in the event any forward-looking statements are made.  So beginning today, we will have Mr. Michael Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer, open up with comments. 
Michael Lawton: Thank you, Lynn and good morning everyone. This quarter our momentum continued as we posted strong same store sales in both our domestic and international businesses. We opened a significant number of new stores and our EPS grew 17.5% over the prior year quarter.  Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company owned stores worldwide, grew 11.5%. Foreign currency only had a minimal impact this quarter and when we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 11.7%. The drivers of this growth included: domestic same store sales which rose 5.4% in the quarter, lapping a positive 6.7% from last year. This was comprised of franchisee same-store sales, which were up 5.5% and company-owned stores, which were up 3.5%.  We are pleased to report that we opened 11 net domestic stores in the second quarter, consisting of 18 store openings and 7 closures. And during the trailing four quarters, we opened 17 net domestic stores.  Our international division had another very strong quarter as same-store sales grew 7.7% lapping a prior year quarter increase of 5.8%. In the second quarter, our international division grew by 122, made up of 130 store openings and 8 closures. For the trailing four quarters, we opened 611 net international stores.  Turning to revenues. Total revenues were up $36.5 million or 8.8% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of three factors: First, higher supply chain revenues from increased commodity prices and increased volumes; second, higher international royalty and supply chain revenues from increased same-store sales and store count growth; and third, higher domestic franchise royalty revenues again from same-store sales and store count growth.  Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter decreased to 29.9% from 30.4% in the prior year quarter. Some of the drivers of this decrease included the following: company-owned store operating margins decreased as a percentage of revenues due primarily to higher food costs.  Also, our supply chain margin percentage decreased from 11.1% to 10.4% due primarily to an increase in commodity costs. The average cheese block price in the second quarter was $2.20 per pound versus $1.77 in the same period last year. Pork also increased in the quarter which led to our overall market basket increasing 5.8% as compared to the prior year quarter.  As a reminder, commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar markup to our franchisees. Therefore higher commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, negatively impact our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues.  Year-to-date commodity prices have brought about 6.5% higher than last year. We expect this comparison to slightly improve over the remainder of the year and for the year, will average 4% to 6% higher than -- over last year. We believe that this increase is manageable on the overall context of our business.  Turning to G&A expenses. G&A increased by $1.1 million or 2.1% quarter over quarter. The increase was primarily due to e-commerce and technology support as well as investments to expand our international team.  Through Q2, our G&A spend which includes a $1.7 million gain on the sale of stores that we had in the first quarter is roughly flat with last year. We've previously indicated that we projected our full year G&A would increase $4 million to $8 million over our 2013 level. Based on the timing of some of our expenses, we do expect G&A will – the G&A run rate will increase in the second half of the year and we now project our G&A spend for the full-year to be 3 million to 6 million over 2013.  Regarding income taxes. Our reported effective tax rate was 37.5% for the quarter. We continue to expect that 37% to 38% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our second quarter net income was up $5.2 million or 15.6%. This increase was primarily driven by higher domestic and international same-store sales and international store growth.  Our second quarter diluted EPS was $0.67. There were no significant items affecting comparability during the quarter. The $0.67 is a $0.10 or 17.5% increase from the $0.57 in the second quarter of last year. Here is how that $0.10 difference breaks down. Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.08. Our lower diluted share count, primarily due to our share repurchases benefited us by $0.01 and lower interest expense benefited us by $0.01.  Now turning to our use of cash. During the quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 688,000 shares for $49.9 million or an average share price of $72.52 per share. We also returned over $14 million to our shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend. We made our required $5.9 million principal amortization payments in the second quarter as we indicated to you in our first quarter earnings call. We have now met the ratio specified in our debt agreement and will cease making these required amortization payments beginning in the third quarter. Ceasing these payments will leave us with about an additional $28 million of available cash over the next year which can be used to repurchase shares, pay dividends or invest in our business.  In closing, we’re pleased with the quarter and the results and our consistent positive performance so far this year. Thank you for your time today. And now I'll turn it over to Patrick. 
J. Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Mike. As you heard, we delivered yet another strong quarter with excellent sales and store growth, as well as a very strong 17.5% increase in our EPS over last year. Our dependable franchise model, robust global business, and leading digital strategy worked together to drive great consistent results.  Here in the US, we drove both traffic and ticket in the quarter. We were primarily marketing our new specialty chicken which is boneless chicken covered with pizza toppings. This product was embraced by our customers and drove good margins for our franchisees. So overall we’re very pleased with our latest addition to the menu.  We also had good adoption of our store reimaging campaign this quarter. Between re-images, new builds and relocations of existing stores, we now have almost 10% of our US stores and just over 20% of our international stores already in our new image. Our goal is to substantially complete remodeling all corporate stores by the end of 2015. Our franchisees will generally have until the end of 2017 to remodel.  We’re pleased to see that our franchisees are adopting and embracing the store remodels, despite the cost environment that remains uncertain for small businesses across the US. They are holding the line and remaining disciplined on prices despite rising wages and the potential for further increases in many places, as well as higher food costs among other cost pressures.  As the system, we’ve been very successful which is a credit to our franchisees and their buy-in of our vision and brand strategies. They are working hard to run stores that are part of their local economy serving millions of hot pizzas a day, employing tens of thousands of great people all of which is a testament to the strength of our system.  Our international business thrived in the second quarter with accelerating same-store sales over last year's results and plenty of momentum in markets across the globe. We had one of our largest net store openings for any second quarter period, which means in the first half of this year, hundreds of new image stores have been going up all around the world.  In May, we opened our 11,000th store in Brantford, Ontario in Canada, the country where our international business began 30 years ago, continues to be an important market for Domino's and the recent focus on value promotion drove double-digit year-over-year order count increases for the fourth consecutive quarter.  Our international success this quarter was based on promotions that resonated, expanding the brand through new stores and executing well on service and quality. Some notable performances include: South Korea where promotions focused on digital ordering and new product news helped drive strong results. Robust order count growth in Spain was largely a result of product innovation and value driven carryout promotions. They’ve also had a strong start to the year on store growth.  And finally, in Brazil, double-digit sales in the second quarter were driven by strong value promotions as their brand continues to expand through excellent store growth. The market is nearly at a hundred store mark.  And many of you probably still have World Cup on your mind, and I’d like to point out that only four days of World Cup overlapped with Q2 results but as with most events like this, we would not expect that this event would have a material impact on full quarter results.  Both our domestic and international markets continued to keep their attention focused on digital access. Our goal is always to be able to take an order whenever and however a customer wants, whether they need a pizza in the UK through their cell phone, whether they want to order from their laptop in Australia or from their Ford sync system here in the US, we want to be everywhere our customers want us to be with hot delicious food.  In the US, we announced a number of new digital initiatives, including the iPad app that I talked about in May. We logged over $1 million in sales through this app in its first four weeks alone. Since then we also became the first company to launch voice ordering through our iPhone and Android apps. The voice ordering is similar to Siri on your iPhone, only our computer-aided -- computer-generated voice is called Dom. We feel this was a trailblazing move in the direction the technology is headed.  Around 45% of our overall sales now come through digital channels, and we’re fast approaching half of that coming through mobile in particular. It reinforces for us the convenience is key for our customers. Even the simple customer convenience issues can be solved with a technological fix. For example, during the quarter we launched our group ordering tool online, helping customers determine how many pizzas they need for a large group order along with recommendations for the most popular pizzas.  We’re always looking for ways to make ordering easier for customers and the digital experience a richer one. We recently moved our website to responsive design which automatically rearranges page layouts to fit any screen size and results in a great experience for our customers whether they are ordering from a desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile phone. At a roughly $3 billion run rate on worldwide digital sales, we believe we are the global digital leader in our industry with an innovation oriented mindset in everything we do.  For us technology is not an add-on or a nice to have, it’s a core part of our global strategy and central to the great experience our customers have with Domino’s.  Let me just use my final few minutes to highlight our use of cash this quarter which largely went towards dividend payments and very active share repurchases. With around 2 million a week in free cash generated, we remain focused on deploying our cash to benefit shareholders.  In conclusion, it was just another boring great quarter here at Domino’s. Our team remains focused on driving consistent strong results which come from leading innovation, delivering a great experience to each and every one of our customers, building new stores and executing our reimage campaign. Thank you for your time today. Operator, I am ready for questions. 
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Alex Slagle at Jefferies.
Alex Slagle – Jefferies: Hi, thanks. I had a question on specialty chicken, if you could just give a little more perspective on that launch and any evidence you have, the dynamics of the sales that is driving new customers, increased occasions for existing customers and any color on mix of delivery versus carry-out if you have that kind of detail.
J. Patrick Doyle: It did very well for us. As you heard, we had nice traffic and ticket growth in the second quarter. As with any product as we’ve kind described in the past, this is not as much kind of center of the plate as pizza. So little bit more of it is an add-on which was a great way for us to get some growth in ticket through mix in the second quarter and that was part of that ticket growth. But overall the response was very strong, I think it played into maybe a little bit of the order growth but I think most of the order growth in the second quarter really came from continued momentum in brand, continued digital growth all of those things that have been driving results for us for quite a few years. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alton Stump of Longbow Research.
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: Yes, thank you. As always, good job once again on the quarter. I just had a quick question. Obviously, you guys saw I think across all three segments comp growth accelerate in 2Q versus the first quarter even though obviously it didn't have the weather benefit, at least I would think that had a weather benefit this quarter versus the first quarter. As I kind of look at the key drivers of that, obviously specialty chicken launched in the US. Is there anything else in your view that drove that acceleration? 
J. Patrick Doyle: No, I think honestly, the answer is we've got the offering right with our customers. We've got the brand right, the food right, the digital side of this right and that's really the momentum growth. So we're very happy with the specialty chicken and how it performed. It was good for store level margins at the time when there was a lot of cost structure from food costs as Mike had referenced earlier. But honestly, I think it is really about the continued momentum we've got in the brand giving customers an experience that’s relevant to them today and that’s really been the continuation of the strength that you saw both domestically and internationally. 
Alton Stump - Longbow Research: And then a quick follow-up, I think you mentioned, Patrick, that as a percentage of overall sales that you’re seeing mobile approach half or so of 45% total digital sales, a) is that correct – so does that imply the 20 plus percentage of sales, any color as to how fast that piece is growing on the sales line? 
J. Patrick Doyle: So you did get that right. So the way to think about it is we are about 45% digital overall. So we’re kind of approaching 50% digital and we’re approaching 50% of that digital being from mobile. So kind of 20% to 25% from mobile, 20% to 25% from desktops or laptops is kind of the overall mix on that today. Every part of the digital mix has been growing but mobile has been growing clearly much faster than laptops and desktops. But we’re still continuing to see growth on the computers as well which is interesting. It hasn’t been about cannibalization, it's really been about just faster growth is coming from mobile than from computers. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital: Two questions; just first on the international growth and obviously comps are impressive and have accelerated and I know your long-term guidance – long term guidance of 3% to 6% comp, now you’re doing in the 7% or 8%. Wondering whether there is a correlation between that and the pace of unit growth, I mean if international comps continue to far outpace the high end of that guidance, should we assume a further acceleration on the pace of openings or perhaps are there gating factors whether it’s franchisees happy with the pace today, or are they meeting your commitments or is there a lack of people or real estate or if the comps continue to run this way should we just assume that these business people overseas are going to accelerate further and there is upside in the near-term to that international unit growth?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yeah, I think what I would say is you saw in the second quarter with just continued broad strength from the international business and I think your theory is largely correct which is as we’ve always said strong unit economics are what drive people to build stores. And this has never been -- you talk about commitments from different markets, I think we said this many times but I just don't believe that stores get built because of what's in a contract. Stores get built because they’re going to generate a good return for the people investing in them. And if they don't see that return, then there’s going to be a problem in that market. And so the continued strength of the markets, of same-store sales which is flowing through in the unit economics, it certainly correlates to the continued strength in in store growth. And so you’re seeing on kind of a trailing 12 month basis, and on that basis right now, we’re just higher than the high-end of our store growth range which we've given 4% to 6%, then that I think we’re in the range of kind of 6.5% on a trailing 12 month basis right now. And part of that is clearly continued strong comps both domestically and internationally. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital: And just kind of related to that on the G&A front, I know, Mike, you mentioned that the range for this year – now we’re talking about I guess 3 million to 6 million higher than last year, that’s tweaked downward which, less about million dollars tweaking downward more about just question on the G&A spend in general with the comps as strong as they are and the unit growth accelerating, I don’t know whether there are opportunities elsewhere to invest that would support that faster growth, or are you really doing everything you possibly can think of from a technology and infrastructure standpoint and there is just no additional G&A to be spent?
Michael Lawton: Interesting way to put that question. I think the fact is the last half for the year will be -- we will be spending more on the technology side. One of our challenges both in international and in the IT area has been for the last two or three years is actually getting the right people on board as fast as we would like. We’re willing to spend the money to support the growth areas. But you don't want to do that just by throwing it around loosely and as we -- right now we’re staffed up better in IT than we were at the beginning of the year. So we’re spending at a faster rate, you saw that in the second quarter as the numbers creep up a little. We want to be investing where it’s appropriate, sometimes it takes a little more time than it’s likely. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley : Thanks. First, Mike, can you just talk about the financing environment, if you were to choose to go out to the market and borrow more money, would you be able to borrow at your current leverage or adding a turn – at the rate you’re currently paying, would that ultimately – would that, do you think, drive your weighted average up?
Michael Lawton: I think you could – we could probably add a turn at or below the current of our – the rate that we currently borrow at, it’s 5.25%. 
John Glass - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thank you. And then Patrick, you just talked about holding the line on pricing which is important in a competitive market with rising prices, how much rising commodity prices -- how much of a debate is that with the franchisees right now, I mean is that really a conversation you're having or they just will be doing this on their own volition because they understand they’re going to drive better volumes?
J. Patrick Doyle: It’s a conversation that we’re having with them but I think they are also really pleased with the results they’ve been seeing in their stores for a number of years now. And so with food costs, where they were in the first half, you're seeing that -- the volume growth has offset kind of those increases in food costs. They've taken a little bit of price which we think was appropriate but not a lot. And so that’s keeping the order count growth going. We’ve got a pretty good meeting of the minds with our system right now around kind of the approach that we’re going to take. They are seeing it work. We’d clearly be happier if cheese costs and pork costs were little lower than they are right now. We’d be flow little bit through more at the store level but I think we give them guidance. We tell them, this year is where we think you should take increase if you're going to take increases. But overall I'm really proud of the system. I think they have done a great job of being very judicious about how we’re going to take price in this environment. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer & Co.
Brian Bittner – Oppenheimer: I think you said that 10% of stores are reimaged in the US. Is that correct? And if so, that’s a pretty good sample size here. I’d love to get some color on what you're seeing from those reimage units, are they outperforming the base on a same store sales basis? If so, where a carryout or what have you, I’d love to hear some color on that?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yeah, so I think the answer, Brian, is that’s performing very much in line with kind of what we’ve expected, which you are correct. I said we’re kind of approaching 10% domestically and we’re probably just a little bit over 20% on the international side. And on a straight reimage on a single store basis we see a modest increase in same-store sales versus kind of control groups. What we continue to believe is that real play here is the overall strength of the brand, relevance of the brand over the long term. And so it helps a little bit at the margin as we’re doing these but we think the bigger play is what it means for the brand overall over the long term. And that’s kind of been very consistent with what we were expecting. Remember as a business that still does more delivery even carryout, it takes some time for customers to even see the fact that you reimaged the store, if they are primarily a delivery customer. So we’re seeing it. We’re seen some increase as we do them but it's pretty modest. And we really believe in what it means long-term for the brand. 
Brian Bittner – Oppenheimer: That makes sense. And on the international side, I love to hear an update on how – I know it's very small right now but I love to hear an update on how the stores in China are doing under Dash Brands management and kind of following up on that as you continue to grow the international business, is there anywhere around the world where joint venture and having more equity in the game would make sense, whether it would be China or somewhere else?
J. Patrick Doyle:  Yeah, so we're continuing to progress nicely in China, it's still very small. I think we ended the quarter at about 44 stores, something like that, and so you know it’s growing. It's doing better. We like the base, but we've clearly got a long way to go in China before it's going to be a big part of our business overall. So we like the start. We like Dash a lot. We think they’ve got a terrific management team there. But it's still pretty early.
Brian Bittner – Oppenheimer:  Okay, and as far as maybe looking at possible JVs around the world, is there anywhere that just maybe interests you a little bit?
J. Patrick Doyle: I think the answer, Brian, is as you've seen to date, we are 100% master franchised outside of the U.S. When we think that there is a situation where our capital going into a market will cause that market to grow faster and be more successful, we're kind of -- we reserve the right to do that. But as you've seen to-date, we haven't made that decision.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe of JP Morgan.
John Ivankoe- JP Morgan:  Hi, thank you, just a couple of follow-ups if I may. I will just do them one by one. Does the current cost environment allow you to keep that $5.99 medium two topping? I mean is that something that, that you foresee as maybe in next couple of years that's something that's permanent on the menu?
J. Patrick Doyle:  Well, two medium two tops for $5.99 has been our primary promotion for four plus, almost five years now, and clearly it's done very-very well for us. We like the fact that we've been able to be consistent with that because frankly it means that the price isn’t the news. What we're doing with the brand really becomes the news. It's resonate with customers. You've seen what it's done for not only comps but for profitability of the stores. So we feel good about it. I'm not going to project forward on that and I'm sure competition would love to know what our plans are in pricing. But clearly over the course of last four-five years, it’s been a winner for us.
John Ivankoe- JP Morgan: Yeah, I understand and I think I understand the color as well. And secondly with the U.S being 45% digital. Can you compare that to other international markets, maybe that have a higher mix and whether, assuming that that mix is higher when it grew from 45% to whatever it is today. Whether that growth in digital sales mix was proving to be incremental to traffic in your opinion?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yeah, it is, it is, and we've seen that consistently around the world that some minority of that growth in digital has been incremental to the business. And we've got different ways to kind of cut in those numbers. But clearly some of it has been incremental. In terms of progress around the world, we continue to, I think the overall average mix is probably, in the international is probably a little bit lower than it is domestically, but not a lot, probably more in the kind of 40% range on the blended average, somewhere in there. But you still have markets that are significantly higher. So Australia, Japan, Korea, U.K., you've got markets that are 50% plus, and those are all markets that have performed very-very well over the course of the past five years and continue to grow on their digital business. So we think it continues to be a great driver of convenience for our customers, which has driven some incrementality in our sales, both domestically and internationally.
John Ivankoe- JP Morgan: Thank you, and just one final quick one, Patrick and Mike. I mean with the debt where it needs to be to no longer amortize, what is the thought of not adding that additional turn of leverage at or below 5.25%? In other words if not now then when and why hasn’t it been done to-date, if I can ask in that directive fashion?
Michael Lawton :  Well certainly the ability to borrow was there. As, the answer to a prior question from Brian about, do we ever participate in other JVs or run it, then if we borrow up to the maximum that does give us a little bit more limitation of what we could do. We also have to have a use of cash that we feel is appropriate because of who our investor base is. We do take that into account and it’s a little bit different than the past where there was always a very strong view - the special dividends were great, not everybody shares that view. So, we’re weighing all both the sources – our ability to borrow at a very attractive interest rate versus what was potentially used as a cash if we’re to do so. We do have the ability a year from now to call up to a third of our existing debt and refinance, that’s not something that’s available to us today.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of David Carlson of KeyBanc.
David Carlson - KeyBanc: Hi guys. Hope everyone’s well. I had a question related to the costs at your company-owned stores, specifically actually the occupancy line. This is -- with the strong comps you guys have had historically, this has traditionally been a source of leverage when you've had the strong positive comps. There's been a headwind in the last couple of quarters. I noticed in the Q this morning you called out I think it was higher depreciation. Telephone costs is the reason for the I think it was about a 40 basis point increase year-over-year. So, that said, is there new equipment that's causing this increased depreciation, or is it more from remodel activity? And then on the telephone costs, I would think that increasing digital ordering would essentially lower your telephone costs, or the higher costs related to a new phone system or a new telecom contract. Any color you could provide would be appreciated. 
J. Patrick Doyle:  Okay. The depreciation is the combination of the reimaging as well as some equipment. So we’ll see. You’re going to see that reimage -- as we reimaged the corporate stores and we’re not at the 10% level on corporate stores, we’re actually closer to fourth of our corporate stores having been reimaged already. So you’re seeing a little bit coming through there, where also there is some computer equipment that’s coming through which has a fairly short life on up the way we do since. On the telephone side, we’ve actually changed some contracts out and as we’ve done that there is a little bit of extra cost. To get out of one contract and get into the new one overtime will be at the old rate or similar. So, it’s not a big number even for this quarter but it was just know [ph] that against the total corporates -- the scale of the corporate stores are bumping up just a little bit.
David Carlson - KeyBanc: Fair enough. So I guess it kind of leads me to as you accelerate the remodel program at the company owned stores over the next year and half, I think you’re trying to finish it by 2015. Should we continue to see de-leverage on this line or?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yeah. You’re going to see a little bit of depreciation cost in there. It’s got a flow-through. I mean the average reimage cost on a store for us is around $50,000-$60,000. So you can see it’s not a huge number for us but it will have a bit of an impact. 
David Carlson - KeyBanc: My last question is on the.. I think on the last call you guys said that your unique profiles were.. I think you’ve grown 2 million in the quarter to about 9 million individuals. Where does that number stand today?
J. Patrick Doyle: We’ll get back to you on that one. I honestly don’t remember the exact number. What I tell you is it has continued to grow very nicely.
David Carlson - KeyBanc: Yeah. Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Paul Westra of Stifel.
Paul Westra - Stifel: Great. Thanks and good morning. Just a question on the US business. Can you talk a little bit about where you believe your market share gains are coming from when you compare yourself maybe versus your largest competitors, your regional competitors, your independency gaining in markets more or less when there is more or less regional exposure?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yeah. I think the answer is that the overall story has continued to be the same which is the larger players have generally been taking share from the smaller players and the regional players. Clearly we’ve had one of our national competitors that has struggled a bit recently and so they benefit more of a share donor for a few quarters here, but overall I think the strength of the national has been playing out against the smaller regional players.
Paul Westra - Stifel: Yes. So even with the large share donor competitor you’re still seeing as good or better share gains in markets where there’s maybe less of big two competitors versus the regional players.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. As you look nationally there are some places where smaller and regional chains are relatively stronger but overall the share donor is national. So that’s kind of it affect everywhere and you’re still looking at the four largest players in the US only do about 40% of pizza in the US. So the majority player in almost every market in the country is those smaller and regional chains. So that’s where most of it has been coming from.
Paul Westra - Stifel:  Okay. Then related question. I am just trying to dig back, I know this question has been asked before. But as you look at the deal rates or percentage or however you want to calculate with mobile and in particular digital in general being a larger and larger percentage, I know you mentioned in the past that the coupon needs to be there but consumers who are on online digitally don’t always take them. I guess are you seeing a change in that deal rate and just any color you can give us the directionality of the coupon rate in orders overall as digital becomes a larger percentage?
J. Patrick Doyle:  I guess what I’d say is what continues to be true is the economics of digital orders are better for us than phone orders and walk-in orders and it continues to be better experience for our customers. Their loyalty is better, their customer satisfaction is higher and that all continues to be the same, in terms of the specific surround coupons and coupon usage I don’t think I am going to get in to all of that.
Paul Westra - Stifel: Okay. Thank you.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley of Bank of America.
Joseph Buckley - Bank of America: Thank you. Just a couple of clarification questions. I think you gave two different percentages on the US stores and maybe 1% was for US system. The other percentage was for the US company operated that are in the reimaged mode. So can I just ask you to clarify those stats, one was 10%, one was 25%?
J. Patrick Doyle: So yeah, our total domestic system is just a little bit under 10% reimaged. Our corporate stores are around 25% reimaged within that overall kind of 10-ish percent.
Joseph Buckley - Bank of America: I got it. And then you commented on the same store sales for a reimaged store. How were the new stores that you’re putting up? How did they perform from a sales perspective?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yeah new stores are opening very, very nicely and stronger over the course of the last year 18 months then I think they have done historically. So, we’re very pleased with how new units are opening.
Joseph Buckley - Bank of America: Okay. And one last one, Patrick, you’ve talked before about kind of like maybe a seasonal change in digital orders where you kind of move to a new plateau. The mix this quarter sounds pretty much similar to the next last quarter. When does that typically occur during the year? Is there a regular kind of seasonal pattern as to when you pick up more ground on the digital front?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yeah. There is. It’s interesting. It’s kind of fall into winter we see our digital mix grow and late spring in the summer it seems to kind of flatten out every year and that pattern is held for five, six, seven years now. It’s been very, very, very consistent.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh of Telsey Advisory Group.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group:  Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the strategy to relocate some of the stores. Can you give us an update on how may stores you plan within the system to relocate and what kind of benefit you expect to see from those relocated restaurants?
J. Patrick Doyle:  Yeah. I think the expectation is we will see a bit more of a lift from relocated stores than we do from reimage stores. I think as we go through this process it’s going to be a relatively small minority of stores that wind up getting relocated but not completely inconsequential. It could be 10% of the system something like that that we see maybe a little bit more, but the answer is yeah you’ll tend to see a better lift from relocated stores, but it’s going to be a relatively small percentage of the stores that will get relocated.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group: Great. And then just any thoughts on unit growth domestically and it seems like you’re adding a little bit more here and there. But what’s the -- I guess gating factor to may be accelerating that little bit faster on the US development side?
J. Patrick Doyle:  Yeah. I mean it’s continued to get better. I think our trailing 12-month net number now is 70. So that’s moved up nicely from where we were a year or two ago. Our goal is to continue to grow that and to continue to accelerate that. And I don’t think you’re going to see a short-term market increase in that, but our goal is certainly to continue to grow faster as we move forward and unit economics are a driver of that.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator:  Your next question comes from the line of Mark Smith of Feltl and Company.
Shannon Richter - Feltl and Company:  Hi. Yes it’s Shannon Richter on for Mark Smith. Just one quick question here. Can you talk about the competitive environment especially concerning pricing in both your domestic and international markets?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yeah. You know what, I think the answer is it’s really been pretty consistent for a number of years now and that’s certainly more a domestic answer than necessarily an internationally answer. Internationally, on an average the answer is probably the same. There are certainly some markets where you’re seeing a little bit more pricing activity. There has been fairly aggressive pricing activity in Australia recently, but overall it’s been pretty consistent. I think you’re seeing ticket up a little bit. Our best sense is that you’re seeing ticket up a little bit from our major competitors in the US as well but not materially out of line with what we have done.
Shannon Richter - Feltl and Company: Thank you so much.
Operator:  Your final question comes from the line of Stephen Anderson with Miller Tabak.
Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak: Good morning. Just taking a look at the international breakdown, looking at comps of -- international comp of 7.7%. Do you have some of the major country breakdowns [indiscernible] I'm talking about northern Europe and India specifically? 
J. Patrick Doyle:  Yeah. I guess what’d I say is continue broad strengths and we’re little bit of an unusual situation this quarter in that our publicly traded master franchisees, only one of them has released so far. And it happens to be the one that’s released which is I would say it released yesterday and they released a kind of aggregated number with their other brands. I think their overall number was like 5.5 something like that for all their brands, but I guess what I’d say is it’s been a continuation of kind of the strong trends that we’ve seen.
Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak: Thank you.
J. Patrick Doyle:  So I believe that is the last question. So I’d like to thank all of you for your time today and I look forward to reporting our third quarter results in October. Thank you.
Operator:  This concludes today’s call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Bonita, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 Financial Results Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Liddle, you may begin your conference.
Lynn M. Liddle: Thanks, Bonita. And thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. We should be an hour or less. We will give an opportunity for some prepared remarks, as well as Q&A. I would also ask that members of the press who are on the call realize this is for investors and stay in a listen-only mode. And then I'll turn all of your attention to our Safe Harbor statement in the event that any forward-looking statements are made during the call today. We're going to kick it off today with Mike Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer, who has some prepared remarks.
Michael T. Lawton: Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered solid results for our shareholders during the quarter. Our international and our domestic divisions posted strong same-store sales growth. We opened a significant number of new stores, and our adjusted EPS grew 15.3% over the prior year quarter. I'll start my review of the quarter by looking at our systemwide sales, which are also known as global retail sales. And these are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide. Global retail sales grew 9.1%. Foreign currency was a headwind, and when we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 11.3%. The drivers of this growth included domestic same-store sales, which rose 4.9% in the quarter, lapping a positive 6.2% from last year. This was comprised of franchisee same-store sales, which were up 5.2% and company-owned stores, which were up 1.5%. Although we don't provide specifics of order count and ticket for competitive reasons, we did drive an increase in both order counts and ticket this quarter. Also we're pleased to report that we opened 5 net domestic stores consisting of 14 store openings and 9 closures. In the full year 2013, we had growth of 58 net stores and our goal is to exceed that this year domestically. Our international division had another very strong quarter, as same-store sales grew 7.4%, lapping a solid prior year quarter increase of 6.5%. Our international division grew by 97 stores this quarter made up of 109 store openings and 12 closures. Turning to revenues, total revenues were up $36.2 million or 8.7% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of 3 factors: First, higher supply chain revenues resulting mainly from an increase in commodity prices and higher volumes. Second, higher international royalty and supply chain revenues due to increased same-store sales growth and store count growth. And third, higher domestic royalty revenues due to same-store sales growth and the positive impact of increase in our store count over the trailing 4 quarters. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter decreased to 30.2% from 31.1% in the prior year quarter. Some of the drivers of this decrease included the following: Company-owned store operating margins decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues due primarily to higher food cost; and our supply chain margin percentage decreased from 11.3% to 10.5%, due primarily to an increase in commodity cost. The average cheese block price in the first quarter was $2.16 per pound versus $1.67 in the same period last year. Pork and other meat also increased during the quarter, which led to our overall market basket increasing 6.9% during the quarter. As a reminder, food commodities are generally priced on a constant-dollar markup to our franchisees, therefore higher commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, negatively impact our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues. Because of the increasing commodity prices, we need to make a significant update to our commodity projections. We have previously communicated that we expect that commodities would be flat or down to as much as 2% in 2014. Due to the recent increase in commodities, primarily cheese and pork, we now expect that commodities we use in our system will be up 4% to 6% in 2014 versus 2013 levels. Despite the fact that we have diversified monetary risk, currency exchange rates negatively impacted us this quarter by about $1.3 million versus the prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against most currencies. We continue to expect that currency exchange rates will be a headwind for us for the remainder of the year. Turning to G&A expenses. G&A decreased by $1.4 million or 2.6% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by a $1.7 million pretax gain on the sale of 14 corporate stores that we detail as an item affecting comparability in our 8-K. Going forward, the sale of these stores will shift some income from corporate stores into franchise royalties. We have previously indicated that our estimated full year G&A would increase an additional $5 million to $9 million over 2013 levels due to increases for e-commerce and technological support, international support and the growth of the team there, and the strategic -- other strategic initiatives, offset by lower non-cash comp expect. We now expect our full year G&A will increase $4 million to $8 million over 2013, primarily a result of the gain that I previously mentioned. Keep in mind, too, that G&A expense can vary up or down depending upon such things as our performance against plan, which affects our variable performance-based compensation. Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 36.6% for the quarter, which is slightly below our expected range due to the reversal of our deferred tax valuation allowance that we also detail as an item affecting comparability in our 8-K. We currently expect our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future to be in the 37% to 38% range. Our first quarter net income was up $6.1 million or 17.6%. This increase was primarily driven by higher domestic and international same-store sales, international store growth, and the $1.4 million after-tax gain on the sale of 14 corporate stores, offset in -- all of this offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Our first quarter diluted EPS, as reported on a GAAP-basis was $0.71, on an as-adjusted basis, our diluted EPS was $0.68 for the first quarter, the $0.68 is a $0.09 or 15.3% increase from the $0.59 in the first quarter of last year. Here's how the $0.09 difference breaks down: Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.09, foreign currency negatively impacted us by about $0.02; lower diluted share count primarily due to our share repurchases benefited us by $0.01; and lower interest expense benefited us by $0.01. Turning to our use of cash. During the first quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 221,000 shares for $15.1 million, at an average price of $68 a share. So far in the second quarter, we've repurchased 154,000 shares. We also returned over $11 million to our shareholders in the form of a quarterly dividend. We did make a required $5.9 million principal amortization payment in the first quarter. Due to the terms of our debt, we will also be making a $5.9 million required principal amortization payment in the second quarter of 2014. Although we had expected that we'd be able to stop making required payments in the second quarter, due to meeting the 4.5x ratio specified in our agreements, we didn't meet this threshold. Debt to EBITDA, which you can see in the financials, and is the closest approximation that a financial statement user can see to the actual ratio we need in order to cease making required payments, but the actual calculation is impacted by cash movements within our securitization structure that did not impact -- and they don’t impact operations or financials, but they did impact our ability to meet the ratio. Going forward, we will continue to evaluate the opportunity to cease making required payments once the specific securitization terms are met. In closing, we're very pleased with the results in the quarter. We will continue to focus on improving our operating performance, growing our global store base and utilizing our free cash flow to drive shareholder value. Thank you for your time. And now I'll turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Mike. As you heard, this quarter's headline is that we once again delivered strong consistent results, and we're particularly pleased with the store growth in our international division, which was especially robust. Overall, it was a great start to the year. We had a busy first quarter. Domestically, we had strong sales results, good order growth over last year and a great promotion for our Handmade Pan Pizza. Our advertising featured our very talented store team members, and I'm delighted that this campaign seems to have resonated well with our customers. We also wrapped up our analysis of franchisee profitability in 2013, and we're pleased to see that profits continued to increase. Franchisees reported that store level EBITDA was up to about $82,000 last year from $75,000 in 2012. We continue to focus on this important metric because increasing per store profitability results in a healthier franchisee base, and with a higher return on investment in stores, it ultimately helps drive store growth. It also puts our system in a better place for store reimaging. We've been ramping up the process of getting stores updated across the system, with our corporate stores leading the way. We're well underway to having our team USA stores reimaged in the next 2 to 3 years. Another area of intense focus for us right now is corporate store performance. Company same-store sales performance has lagged franchise stores in a meaningful way for the past 2 quarters. While it will take a little time to get these stores where we want them, we want you to know that we're working to turn these results around. During the quarter, there was a fair amount of discussion about the particularly cold and snowy weather in much of the country and its possible impact on our business. Typically, weather does not have an impact on our quarterly sales because it tends to be very regional and also short in duration. However, this winter was atypical. Our best estimate is that weather drove between a 1% and 1.5% positive impact on sales in the quarter. Moving to new product news. In the U.S., we recently launched our first new food product since the Handmade Pan Pizza in the fall of 2012. It's called Specialty Chicken. It's boneless chicken with a pizza twist. We know that chicken is a popular side item for us and that boneless chicken sales have growing 11% in the last 3 years for the whole quick service industry. This product gives us the opportunity to showcase chicken and do it in a way that's unique to Domino's. It's also a product that's good for store profitability, which is important to our system and brings some new product news to our brand. On the international front, we have some great milestones in key markets. In India, we opened our 700th store, a huge achievement for the fastest growing market in our system. By focusing on both quality and service, they've been pioneers and are dominating the fast-food market in India. Despite the fact the economy is going through a rough patch, store yield economics are still strong enough to sustain robust store growth and they are expanding into new cities. We're very proud of their accomplishments. We're also pleased with the progress being made in Japan, where we recently opened our 300th store. Since being acquired by Australian master franchisee, this market has continued its strong performance with excellent sales in store growth. We continue to be very optimistic about the changes and growth opportunities in that market. I recently visited Australia, and I am impressed with what our master franchisee is doing in that market. They not only continue to build profitable stores in a fairly mature market, but they also have really stepped up their game in service and product quality. Plus, they have excellent marketing, which is helping to keep the brand dominant in their market. While highlighting some markets, I'd like to point out our recent agreement we signed in South Africa with a new master franchisee. TASTE Holdings is based in Johannesburg. They're a publicly traded company that operates nearly 150 pizza restaurants under the scooters pizza and St Elmo's pizza brands. We expect the vast majority of these will be converting to Domino's Pizza units in late 2014 and through 2015. This gives us an excellent entry into the southern region of Africa, which is a continent with attractive future growth opportunities for our brand. It's young. It's increasingly very digital, with good mobile phone penetration and emerging consumer class, growing urbanization and a modernizing retail sector. In terms of population and consumer purchasing power, sub-Saharan Africa is roughly the same size as India. Stay tuned for more from this region of the world. While our international business is certainly a major driver of growth, technology also continues to advance our brands as we lead the industry with technological innovation. This week we launched an iPad app that features amazing images to take advantage of the iPad's high-definition Retina Display. The team used gaming and animation software to power the incredible 3D graphics of our new pizza builder. It's a great app and I'd encourage you to try it out. We also recently announced that our Android app will accept payment with Google wallet, which is a free mobile payment system that allows customers to store debit cards, credit cards, loyalty cards and gift cards electronically on their mobile phone. It's just the kind of flexibility and convenience we feel is important for us to offer to our consumers. And apparently, Google thought it was pretty cool that we signed up, since they called it out specifically on their earnings call. Another consumer convenience we've discussed before is profiles, which is the ability for consumers to store their pizza orders and credit card information. We added about 2 million more profiles in the first quarter, so we're now up to 9 million profiles, and about half of our mobile app sales were made using established profiles in the first quarter. Overall, digital now comprises 45% of our sales, with some recent weeks at 50% of sales. We are really delighted with what digital ordering is doing for our business in the U.S. and around the world. Finally, I'd just add that we're off to a great start this year. We grew stores at a nice clip, had robust domestic and international sales and despite some headwinds from FX and food costs, delivered strong EPS growth once again. That enabled us to pay an increased dividend and buy back a significant number of shares, more continued evidence of our commitment to shareholder returns. I'm very proud of our team and our results. Our franchisees are running great businesses all around the world and they're doing so under a name brand with increasing recognition and strength. With that, I'll be happy to take any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A couple of questions on international. Obviously, a very, very impressive start to the year, at least from a -- well from comp annual perspective. Just wondering, you mentioned something about the royalty rates, just wondering the frequency of, I guess the opportunity you have to update the royalty rates, both in international and domestically. Maybe you can give some sort of range in terms of the high versus low of those percentages. It would seem like over time with a very strong performance, there would be the opportunity to increase those rates. And then I had a follow-up.
J. Patrick Doyle: The opportunity on the international side is very rare. We have very long-term contracts with our master franchisees. And ultimately, those contracts and their confidence that they're going to be able to build the Domino's business and generate a great return for themselves or their shareholders, if they're public, that's what attracts capital. And that's what's generated the strongest growth really in international of any of the major players in the restaurant industry. So those opportunities are very rare. Our average, as we've said before, is around 3%. Our master franchisees themselves have some ability to change their rates to sub-franchisees, and if that happens, then we've got some ability to do something. But overall, you're not going to see material changes in those rates.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And the U.S., how does that compare to -- the U.S., obviously, you don't have those big master franchisees but what's the range and the average now?
J. Patrick Doyle: I mean, our contracts are at 5.5% with some incentives out there. We may be just slightly below that. I think, we're between 5.4% and 5.5% average. And it's been that way for a very long time. So I would not expect anything there.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got you. And just in terms of the sales mix, obviously, now pushing a little bit more into, well, I guess, the chicken is the most recent push. Just wondering whether you can give any directional color in terms of, however you slice it, whether it's value versus premium on your domestic sales mix, or pizza versus protein versus size. Just wondering the trends over time, and it sounds like you're pretty happy with the profitability of the chicken, I'm just wondering if you could rank the profitability of each of kind of the big core components of your menu?
J. Patrick Doyle: Well, pizza is great business. And that's the core driver of comp growth. It is certainly where the vast majority of profitability comes from in our system. Chicken is a great part of our business. It's the second-largest part of our business. But it is materially smaller than our pizza business. But it's a good sized business. And right now, given the way commodities have been moving, the fact that we've got a chicken-focused promotion out there right now, is a good thing and nicely timed. But ultimately, you're talking about value or premium. Our pricing has been quite consistent now over the course of 4 or 5 years, and that's really a reflection of where consumers are. And the value that consumers demand. And as long as that's what they're looking for and we're continuing to drive growth in our franchisees' profitability, which as I mentioned previously, we did again quite nicely in 2013, we're going to be pretty consistent in our approach to pricing.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Lastly, Mike, if I could just ask you, you mentioned you're looking at which quarter you can stop making that $5.9 million payment once the rate gets to a low enough level from leverage. You didn't mention anything about a potential boost to the leverage again. I wasn't sure whether, where rates are today, it's just not as compelling, and therefore you're more focused on getting the leverage down to that certain level so you can stop making those payments.
Michael T. Lawton: Right now, we continue to watch where rates are but it's not, as you say, it's not that compelling. And we would -- we expected that we would stop making the payment probably, still a high probability that, that would stop next quarter. And we'll just continue to watch. We're quite content with where we are, which is at the 4.5x level.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Mark Smith with Feltl and Company.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on commodity inflation and competitive environment. What's your opportunity to take price today?
J. Patrick Doyle: Well, as I mentioned in my part, we did take -- the ticket is up a little bit and that's not really from taking price as much as being very careful and sharp on the coupons that you do offer. As I know you're aware, most of the transactions that take place have got some kind of a deal associated with them. So I don't think -- I think there's more opportunity to be careful about your couponing than there is to take menu price up at this point in time. And now, while you may see a little bit of adjustment, I wouldn't expect anything major. As long as our current expectation's commodity prices will come back down. It's taken longer than we expected. We got exactly what we expected out of chicken, which is meaningful, and that's lower. It's really a pork and cheese situation right now and making the presumption that they hopefully will still come back down fairly in either the second or, at worst, third quarter. I don't think you'll see a lot of pricing adjustment.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Does this give you an opportunity, as we've seen the trend of mom-and-pops kind of going away and some of the smaller regional guys, does this give you an opportunity over the next year or 2 to add more domestically, as you can withstand some of these pressures better than smaller peers can?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. It's absolutely -- we think our size and scale and ability to buy effectively and pass those savings through to our stores is clearly a strong competitive advantage and so yes, I think it does put us in a stronger position from a share standpoint.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.
Andrew Michael Charles - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: It's Andrew for Joe. You called out the underperformance of company stores compared to franchisees over the last several quarters. Considering the refranchising activity during the quarter, does it make sense to further refranchise as it's evidenced your franchisees are great operators?
J. Patrick Doyle: Our franchisees are great operators. And I would tell you there have been times when our corporate stores have outperformed the franchise side and the other way around. And right now, we're in a moment where the last 2 quarters, we've had some pretty material underperformance. There are some execution issues that we've got to get fixed. We like where we are with our store accounts on the corporate side today. We use it as, not only a way to generate good returns for our shareholders and, at the profitability levels we have today, we do that. But we use it to test new things and that's important for us. But I'll tell you, critically, and I think fundamental to why we run stores, is it's where we develop talent to lead our franchise system both domestically and around the world. So based on that, I would tell you I think we're pretty comfortable in the range that we're in. We've always said from time to time, you're going to see some opportunistic transactions, both buying and selling, and you're going to see us building stores, importantly. So if there is a -- there's not necessarily a magic number, but I would tell you the range we're in today with the level of talent we're able to generate through there, to meet our needs and the returns we're generating out of the stores, we feel pretty good about where we are.
Andrew Michael Charles - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And just one more. Can you just talk a little bit more about the remodeling program versus how many you did this quarter, and any insights you're learning such as the mix of carryout growing and if guest counts at remodeled stores are outpacing the system?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. It's -- you know what, it's still fairly early on that. And I would tell you, as we just announced out to our system now, what 3, 4 months ago, those efforts are just ramping up now. I think you're going to start seeing a lot of reimages starting kind of second half of this year. So we've got a couple hundred out there today that have been done over the course of the last year to 18 months. That number hasn't really materially changed in the first quarter. I think second half and then the years out from that is when you're going to see most of that activity.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just a couple of questions related to the pan pizza. It seems it's brought on some incremental new customers and the product seemed to have long-term staying power, and now that you've had it over a year and a half, what have you seen in regards to loyalty from those customers you've taken on? And when they do return, do those customers always tend to come back for the pan, or do they have a propensity to try other items you're promoting?
J. Patrick Doyle: They buy both pan and hand tossed and, when we launched this pan, we knew that there were pan occasions that were going to competition, frankly, from our customers. So people who were buying our hand tossed pizzas wanted a change of pace, and they were going elsewhere, because we didn't have a good offering. And so this has really mostly been about picking up more occasions from our existing customers who were taking their pan pizza business elsewhere. But what that has meant is higher loyalty from those customers as they're giving us both of those occasions. And so we continue to be very pleased with how it's performing. It's a terrific product. And as you saw again in the first quarter, it had some real staying power for us with our customer base.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. Thanks for that color, and finally you mentioned 45% of your sales are now digital. Can you talk about what that's done for store profitability, or even productivity as that mix has increased over the past year?
J. Patrick Doyle: It absolutely helps. And it helps on essentially every measure. The ticket is higher. Order accuracy is higher for the customers, since they're taking their own orders, so customer satisfaction is higher, and the profitability of the order is a little bit better as well. And it's also more efficient to market to those people who have already signed up. And we continue to make advances. So with the profiles set up, the ability for those customers to reorder quickly if they set up profiles is terrific. So continues to be a very positive thing for our business. And certainly, an area where you're going to continue to see focus. But as we've said, just in the last month or 2 now, you've seen a number of other things, Google wallet, the iPad app. We're continuing to drive innovation at a very high pace in this area, and it's something that is going to continue to be part of our core strategy.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I guess just a follow-up on the pricing question earlier. Obviously, I think that was in reference more to company-owned stores but, on the franchise front in the U.S., are you getting any feedback from them on average if they plan to take any pricing, given particularly cheese cost moving up so hard here over the last couple of months?
J. Patrick Doyle: Look, we all watch it. And it is certainly an area that's -- we will all talk about. None of us like to see record high on cheese and obviously, pork moved as well. I actually commend our franchisees. I think they've been remarkably disciplined about recognizing that this is relatively short term and about just taking some of that in the first quarter. That said, our franchisees still did very well in the first quarter, and we think their profits were actually up a little bit versus the first quarter of the previous year, but not a lot, but a little. And the volume clearly that we saw in the first quarter carried the day. And they understand that sales growth and keeping our customer base happy and loyal, is ultimately what's going to drive long-term profitability and growth in the business. So overall, I think they have been remarkably disciplined about looking at this for what it is, which has been a relatively short term movement that persisted a little longer than, frankly, we had hoped it was going to. But we're already seeing some easing on cheese, it's back down some over the course of the last couple of weeks. Hopefully, that will continue. But overall, they've been quite disciplined.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: Well, I was actually ask you, like, our job isn't to be cheese cost experts, but we have seen quite a bit of relief over the last 3, 4 weeks here. Any outlook if it could head down further from here?
J. Patrick Doyle: Our expectation is that it is going to continue to ease. We don't think it's going to happen quickly, but over the next few months or couple of quarters, our expectation and certainly the market's expectation, as you look at forward curves, is that it's going to continue to come down. We'll see. There have been a couple of components that have driven it. One was weather and there were some areas where production per cow was down because of the extreme weather. Obviously, as we're warming up now, that's going to get somewhat better and production should get better. Input costs are very good. Corn costs, feed cost, are very good. But the other part of it has been the export market. And dairy exports in general have been up. And that's driven the demand side overall on this. And so we'll see. Our expectation is that it's going to continue to ease, but it's going to take some time for that. We're going to be watching it closely. But over the next couple of quarters, we're hopeful that we're going to see it down somewhat more.
Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC: I have just one quick follow-up and then I'll hop back in the queue. As you kind of think about this chicken launch, obviously it's very early, just the last couple of weeks here, but any color, even as ruling this out in the test market or in the group studies, how this is compared to some of recent launches, which has obviously been very successful, whether it's the pan pizza or prior to that. Any color on that front that you can give us?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I mean, that's all in the second quarter. So I really can't get into that.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: First on the U.S. comps, you brought up winter weather helping you 100 to 150 basis points. First question is, how did you come up with that estimate? And then the second question on these U.S. comps is, even after that acceleration, the 2-year trend actually accelerated almost 300 basis points. So after you answer the weather question, if you can just go into some other dynamics that drove the acceleration in the first quarter, anything you can point out from, obviously, technology continues to help, but from a technological market share/menu mix perspective would be helpful.
Michael T. Lawton: Okay, I'll take the weather question. What we did was, we ran everything through our media mix model and we looked at what we expected by market versus what we got. So I could tell you we have a pretty sophisticated model but, at the same time, you have to take it all with a bit of a guess as to what the right numbers are. But we've always tried to give you the best picture we can as to what we think is happening. So after running it through the model, we looked at -- and that includes looking at markets where there isn't any impact from snow, areas where you got more snow than what we had the year before, areas with less snow that are impacted, and we come out with something in this range of 1% to 1.5%.
J. Patrick Doyle: The only thing I would add to that, Brian, is we also then just as kind of, "All right, does this all make sense?" We looked at our carryout and delivery mix. And our delivery mix was a little stronger than we would have expected otherwise, which was clearly a function of the weather as well. So we think it was kind of in that 1 to 1.5 point range, and obviously the blend between our carryout and delivery business insulates us somewhat. To your other question about kind of what's driving the comps. I think there have been a few things. I think we've done a good job buying our media and our media has been up a little bit over the course of the last few years, just from a straightened, not only efficiency standpoint, but effectiveness. And some of that's just a function of the growth of the system. And the more we're driving comps, the more dollars that we've got to put back in to driving the brand. Clearly, an important part of this though is digital. And I think digital continues to be a strong part of our business. We see the effect it has on customer retention and frequency, and that has clearly been a big driver of our results and continues to be a big driver of our results. And overall the execution from our system and our franchisees has been strong. And we're seeing great results from them as we look at our kind of internal measures of the service levels that they're giving and their execution. I'm proud of our franchisees and our whole system and how they're performing, and that builds overall momentum within the system as well.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And have you told us what percent of the corporate stores are reimaged as of now?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I think it's -- we haven't, but I think it's in the range of about 1/4 of them right now. I think it's around 100, maybe just slightly over 100 of them today are reimaged.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. Because I thought it was more, because I'm trying to better understand the comp underperformance at the corporate level and you talked about kind of execution being done. I was just wondering if there's anything, any correlation between execution and store reimage or anything like that, but it seems that 25% it must be -- it's just not really having an impact yet anyway?
J. Patrick Doyle: It's just -- it's straight-up execution.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then the last question, the $4 million to $8 million of G&A, year-over-year. Mike, did you say that includes the gain on the sale?
Michael T. Lawton: Yes. The primary reason that we reduced the increase is just reflective. We got the kind of unusual gain in there.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You talked about the majority of pizza sales are still on a deal and that sort of reminded me of that persistence in the industry. How much less of a deal have you been able to sell pizzas on when you do it on mobile or through the Internet? Is there a material difference? And I guess, related to that, how close are you to be able to do one-on-one marketing, so that you're not offering me a deal if I wasn't going to take one anyway, so you improve your profitability that way?
J. Patrick Doyle: It's interesting. Customers online tend to use coupons a little bit less. They -- even though they're there and in front of them, they use them a little bit less, and it's part of why ticket is somewhat higher. They also just add more food items for the digital orders. But that's a fairly small effect on that. So I think overall, we kind of look at 3 buckets of orders. We look at orders that are going out at menu price. We look at those that are on kind of the national offer, and those that use local coupons. And you can kind of manage pricing within each of those 3 areas. And overall, there is some effect with the digital. That's clearly been a little bit positive for the ticket over time. And that's kind of how we think about it, I guess, is kind of looking at each of those 3 areas, what's going to drive volume and then managing the profitability within it.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And just following up on that, so if you decided not to show coupons to customers as they logged in, you think that's a dangerous precedent that they're going to end up thinking you end up being more expensive than your competition?
J. Patrick Doyle: No, coupons have to be there. If the coupons are available to any customers, we're going to have them there for them online. And they got to know that they've got access to great value digitally when they're ordering.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And then just last piece of that is when do you start to, or have you already begun to, send people individual offers either because they haven't ordered as often in the past or you want to up-sell them something specific. How have you done that so far and are there plans to increase that?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, what we've done -- some things in terms of targeting groups, but there is lots more to come. As we get more sophisticated about managing kind of our database and people within it, there's still lots of opportunities on that front for us going forward.
Operator: And your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: As you've seen a significant uptick in the number of people with profiles, how have you seen that customer change, if at all, from having a profile, to not having a profile in terms of things like order incidence, average ticket, and maybe in reference to the previous question, your ability to communicate to that profile-holding customer directly? In other words, how good is this for Domino's Pizza?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. It's a positive on all fronts. It's -- once they've given us that information and particularly, if they put credit card in, their ability to get through the process quickly and their ability to access favorite orders quickly, all of that is a positive for the customer, so it's a positive for us, and we can see it in behavior.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Excuse me, and by behavior you mean that customer is ordering more often and maybe ordering a little bit more? I mean, so that could -- just as there's been a increase in digital ordering, do you kind of view profiles as another leg, as a future sales driver?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, we do.
Operator: And this question is from the line of Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory Group.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: I just wanted to ask about the marketing spend in the second quarter, and maybe a little bit into the third quarter, and how you're planning that with the World Cup this year, if you're planning to spend more dollars this year on advertising?
J. Patrick Doyle: You're not going to see big shifts kind of because of that. And remember the way kind of our funding works on our advertising is it's a percentage of sales from our stores. So as overall system sales increase, that means the absolute volume of those dollars is growing. But in terms of material shifts between quarters, you're not going to see any.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Great. And then can you just comment a little bit on the -- there's been a lot of talk, a lot of headlines on fast casual pizza space really starting to pick up steam here in terms of units, and the growth and, while still small, I think when you look out the next couple of years, I think it might be a little bit more significant. So can you just comment on how you guys are planning to combat the growth in fast casual pizza?
J. Patrick Doyle: We think that all of the things we're talking about do that effectively. So getting our stores looking better, reimaging our stores, building some new stores, putting them in better locations combined with better food than we've ever offered, combined with a digital platform that we think is really second to none, having some seating in these reimaged stores, making it more welcoming for those who like to sit down as they wait or to eat as well. Really opening up the kitchens so people can see the quality of the food. All of those things make us a better brands for consumers in general and make us more competitive within whatever the competitive set is going to be out the next few years. And I guess, the only thing that I would repeat is that we continue to see the largest players in the category taking share from the independents. And so to the extent to which you're seeing some of these newer players growing a little bit, they are clearly not taking share from us today. And potentially, taking even more share from some of the other locals and independents as we also are taking share from those players.
Operator: And there are no further questions. Are there closing remarks?
J. Patrick Doyle: So we appreciate all of you taking the time to be on the call and for the questions, and we look forward to being back together with you on July 22 to discuss our second quarter earnings. Thank you, everybody.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jessica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Domino's Pizza Q4 Year End Financial Results Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Liddle, you may begin your conference.
Lynn M. Liddle: Great. Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to be here to review our 2013 financial results. We'll spend some time with prepared comments, but then open it up for Q&A. And a couple of housekeeping items, do look at our earnings release and refer to our Safe Harbor statement regarding forward-looking statements. And then, also as always I would ask the members of the media to please be in listen-only mode as this is primarily an investor call. So again, thanks for all of your participation. Now I'd like to introduce Mike Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer to open it up today.
Michael T. Lawton: Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the results for the fourth quarter and our fiscal 2013. During the quarter, we continued to build on the positive results we posted during the first 3 quarters of the year, and we delivered another solid quarter for our shareholders. We opened a significant number of new stores, both domestically and internationally. Our international and domestic divisions posted strong same-store sales growth, and our EPS grew by 21.9% over the prior-year quarter. Now I'll start my review of the quarter by looking at our system-wide sales, which are also known as global retail sales. And these are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide. Global retail sales grew 7.2%. Foreign currency was the headwind again this quarter. And when you exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 9.9%. Drivers of this growth included domestic same-store sales, which rose 3.7% in the quarter lapping a positive 4.7% in the fourth quarter of 2012. This was comprised of franchisee same-store sales, which were up 4% and company-owned stores, which were up 1.2%. Although we don't provide specifics of order account and ticket for competitive reasons, we did drive an increase in order counts and ticket this quarter. Also we're pleased to report that we opened 47 net domestic stores in the quarter consisting of 62 store openings and 15 closures. For the year, we've opened a net 58 stores in the United States. This represents the most domestic openings we have completed in the recent past, and we plan to remain focused on growing our store count in the United States in the future. Now our international division had another solid quarter as same-store sales grew 7%, lapping a strong prior-year quarter increase of 5.2%. Our international division also grew by 273 stores this quarter, made up of 286 store openings and 13 closures. For the full year, we had a record international growth of 573 net new stores. Turning to revenues. Total revenues were up 26.9% or 5% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of 3 factors: First, higher supply chain revenues resulting mainly from favorable mix, an increase in commodity prices, and an increase in equipment sales resulting from the initial reimaging of our stores; second, higher international royalty and supply chain revenues due to an increase in same-store sales growth and store count growth; and third, higher domestic royalty revenues due to same-store sales growth and the positive impact of increase in our store count over the past year. Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, consolidated operating margin for the quarter improved to 30.5% from 29.8% in the prior-year quarter. Some of the drivers of this improvement included the following: A change in our mix of revenues positively impacted our operating margins as a percentage of our revenue came from franchise royalties -- a higher percentage came from a franchise royalties, which have no cost of sales; company-owned store operating margins improved as a percentage of revenues due to favorable product mix and a slightly higher ticket. Our supply chain margin percentage increased from 10.3% to 10.8% due to both lower insurance costs and lower repairs and maintenance cost, offset in part by an increase in commodity cost. Now the average cheese block price in the fourth quarter was $1.83 per pound versus $1.93 per pound in the same period of last year. Changes in other commodities more than offset this decrease as our overall market basket increased 1.6% during the quarter. As a reminder, food commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar markup to our franchisees, therefore, higher commodity prices did not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, negatively impact our supply chain margin as a percent of revenues. Now as I stated on our Investor Day in January, we currently expect that the commodities we use in our system will be flat to down 2% in 2014 versus the 2013 levels. Now despite the fact that we have diversified monetary risk, currency exchange risk negatively impacted us this quarter by $1.9 million versus the prior-year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against most currencies. And if the dollar remains at current levels, our comparisons to prior years will continue to be a headwind for us. Turning to G&A expenses. G&A increased by $2.2 million or 3.1% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was primarily due to e-commerce and technology support, an increase in non-cash compensation expense, as well as investments to expand our international team. Our G&A for the full year of 2013 was $235.2 million. As we look to 2014, we expect to have increases for e-commerce and technology support, international support team and other strategic initiatives, and these will be offset by lower non-cash comp expense. The result is an expected increase of $5 million to $9 million over our 2013 reported levels. Keep in mind that our G&A expense can vary up or down by among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that affects variable performance-based compensation expense. Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 36.7% for the quarter, which is slightly below our expected range. We currently expect our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future to be in the 37% to 38% range. Our fourth quarter net income was up $7.1 million or 18.9%. This increase was primarily driven by higher domestic and international same-store sales, international store growth and a lower effective tax rate, offset in part by higher G&A expenses and a negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $0.78 versus $0.64 in the prior-year quarter. The $0.78 is a $0.14 or 21.9% increase from the 64% -- $0.64 in the fourth quarter of last year. Here's how that $0.14 difference breaks down: first, our foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.02; our lower diluted share count primarily due to our share repurchases benefited us by $0.015; lower interest expense benefited us by $0.01; a lower effective tax rate benefited us by $0.01; and importantly, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.125. Now turning to our use of cash. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 297,000 shares for $20.2 million at an average price of $68 per share. We also returned over $11 million to our shareholders in the form of a $0.20 per share quarterly dividend. We ended the quarter with $14.4 million of unrestricted cash, but I want to point out that we posted $42.3 million of cash as collateral for our letters of credit during the quarter. While that cash is classified as restricted cash, we do have the ability to access that cash quickly if needed. Looking forward, we believe that we will continue to generate cash over and above what we need to reinvest in our business. When considering this excess free cash flow, we have 3 options. We can pay dividends, we can buy back stock or we can pay down debt. Based on our historically consistent free cash flow and our strong performance over the past year, the Board of Directors has increased our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share from their previous level of a $0.20 per share. This is a 25% increase, which reflects our increasing free cash flow and commitment to return value to our shareholders. We also will continue to use some of our excess free cash flow to repurchase stock. Already in the first quarter, we have repurchased 221,000 shares. We anticipate meeting the threshold where we are no longer required to make principal amortization payments in the first quarter of 2014. Regarding our capital expenditures. In 2013, we invested over $40 million in capital expenditures, primarily in our stores, our supply chain centers and our technology initiatives. We will continue to have low capital expenditures relative to our earnings, but are increasing our spend as we see continuing opportunities to invest in our industry-leading technology platform, the reimaging of our corporate stores and other initiatives to grow our brand. Going forward, we have raised our long-range outlook on capital spending to approximately $35 million to $45 million a year annually, as we will invest capital into reimaging our corporate stores and also invest in our technology platforms. Overall, our strong fourth quarter continued our consistent performance throughout 2013. Our focus remains on improving our operating performance, growing our global store base and utilizing our free cash flow to drive shareholder value. Thank you for your time today, and now I'll turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Mike, and thanks to all of you who attended our investor day in Florida last month, where we reported on the consistent progress we're making towards building an increasingly bigger and stronger Domino's Pizza brand. What I wasn't able to share with you in Orlando though was how well our global team performed in the fourth quarter. Mike outlined our financials in detail for you, but my headline take on our full year is simply to say that we again drove great results, and we are very happy with the progress made in 2013. We had strong global momentum in sales, store growth, and innovation, which culminated in a terrific year overall. Looking first at our domestic business, we had another strong sales quarter and year, continuing a consistent sales trend that was driven by many of the levers we've discussed in the past: Great promotions, quality products, strong service, compelling advertising and customer-friendly technology innovations. As we look back over a 20 year span, we noted that in the vast majority of these years, we posted positive sales gains with an overall average of up 2.5 -- or 2.6%. This represented a pretty wide swap of macroeconomic climates, as well as industry driven events, yet we performed pretty steadily throughout most of those 2 decades. The past few years have exceeded that average, propelled by the momentum we've experienced since relaunching the brand. This long record of consistent performance gave us the confidence to raise our long-term outlook up a point from the previous 1% to 3% to the now up 2% to 4%. Our sales success has also driven success at the store level. Store profits have been increasing every year since the 2008 trough, and we expect that when the 2013 final numbers are in from our franchisees, store EBITDA will fall between $81,000 to $85,000 per store, which makes our franchisees happy and we hope more willing to reinvest. We saw more evidence of that again this year as we began to gain some traction in domestic store growth. We delivered on our promise of modest store growth and feel that momentum can continue into the coming year. On the international front, we hit an absolutely huge milestone, 20 years of positive quarterly same-store sales. We've looked and we can't find evidence of another restaurant brand doing this ever. I'm so proud of our team and franchise community for this incredible and unprecedented achievement. With about 95% of the world's population living outside the US, clearly, the majority of opportunity to grow stores is in international markets and international will generate the majority of our expectation of 4% to 6% global annual store growth. This year certainly reinforced that point with a record 573 net stores built internationally out of a total of 631 built globally. The returns have been there for international master franchisees to keep a robust stream of new stores opening around the world and 2013 proved particularly strong. Once again, we saw strength across the board with balanced growth as we discussed at investor day. Not only did established countries such as Canada, the U.K. and South Korea post strong growth again, but we also made great progress in emerging countries such as Brazil and Indonesia. We also recently opened in a new market, Paraguay. Another important brand initiative for us is the store reimage mandate we announced for all new and existing stores worldwide. This is an important program for us, as it solidifies the evolution of our brand and better represents what Domino's has become, open, welcoming restaurants that are focused on the quality of our food. We received a very positive response from our franchisees who haven't had a mandated new store image in the U.S. in nearly 20 years. Considering all the work we've done on the brand since 2009, this move makes sense to the franchisees, and they're embracing the new image. As is our protocol, we've also research-tested this new store image, and we know that the new stores resonate very positively with customers and team members as well. We have a plan in place for our entire system to be reimaged by the end of 2017. In the U.S., a number of stores will be mandated to improve their locations, and some of them will have an opportunity to receive incentives for these moves. We've also announced that we have identified third-party lenders to help with financing for our U.S. franchisees, which should help move the process along more smoothly. Our brand momentum will also continue to feature technology and innovation, as we meet the needs of customers worldwide who are redefining convenience and demanding more of from every experience with us. Our recently launched pizza profiles, which is the ability for consumers to store orders and information, is one of those innovations that's not only delivering convenience and ordering speed for customers, but also providing a building block for other technologies. Our latest announcement with Ford SYNC would not have been possible if profiles weren't in place first. And there are other advances that will be possible in the future because of the flexible and scalable technologies we're introducing. We plan to continue to build the platforms and provide the experiences our customers are demanding, more along the lines of what technology companies are doing and be a technology pioneer for the restaurant industry. These advances continue to push our digital sales percentages higher. I'm pleased to report by the end of 2013, well over 40% of our domestic sales were coming through digital channels. And our technology dominance is just -- isn't just domestic, it spans the globe. As I announced at investor day, we ended the year with a run rate of about $3 billion in digital sales around the world. It took our company 38 years to hit $3 billion in global retail sales, but just over 5 years to hit this number in global digital sales, which demonstrates the rapid growth of this platform. Lastly, 2013 proved to be another year of strong free cash flow, and excellent top and bottom line financial results, with adjusted annual EPS up over 21% compared to last year. Results like these mean we have the good fortune to keep giving back to shareholders in meaningful ways, by both increasing the regular quarterly dividend by 25%, and resetting our share repurchase authorization once again. As we have demonstrated in the past, we plan to continue to look at our earnings and free cash and find appropriate ways to return value to our shareholders. We believe we've made a name for ourselves as a reliably shareholder friendly company, one that is flexible with its use of free cash year after year. So in conclusion, I'd like to congratulate our franchisees and team members for 2013. Domino's is gaining market share, leading in the use of technology and evolving this quintessential pizza brand into a global leader. With that, we'd be happy to take questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: So on the domestic business, you had a little bit over 1% net unit growth in 2013 and this is actually great. It's I think the best it's been since 2006, I believe. So how do you see this playing out in 2014 and beyond, given the introduction of this mandated reimaging campaign?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. So I think there are kind of 2 questions in there. One is we want to build on the momentum that we've started to show. I think the most important factor in this, in addition to great work by the development team in getting this going, is that we've improved the economics of the stores. The cash flow coming out of the stores is better, which makes it a better product ultimately for our franchisees to buy and to build. So their return gets better and it's generating more interest and that's ultimately what's generated the store growth and we'd like to continue to build on that. In terms of how the reimaging may affect store growth, I think the answer is at the margin, could it affect it a little bit, probably, but the reality of it is we've got almost 1,000 franchisees in the U.S. The ability to access capital is quite good now particularly for the largest franchisees. And you're still with -- 58 stores being built last year out of nearly 1,000 franchisees, you're still looking at a relatively small minority of our franchisees who are building stores and those are being built by the franchisees, who on average are a little better capitalized, their existing stores are doing better. So ultimately, I don't see it really affecting store growth much. I don't know that I could argue that it wouldn't affect it at all, but I think the overall effect will be pretty modest because you're looking at a relatively small group of well finance-funded franchisees. The other thing that I'd point out that's important was, while we only just announced the specifics of this and the timeframe for this, our franchisees have known for at least a year now. We said quite publicly to them as we were testing this that, look, we're still working through this, but if you're wondering as you're looking at your financing and your cash flow, whether we're going to be mandating this at some point, the answer is yes. And we said that to them almost, I think almost exactly a year ago, very publicly. So they've known this was coming. You've already seen that kind of built in to what was happening in 2013.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. I know you addressed the reimaging a lot at the analyst day, but at the end of the day, is this really just a huge push into driving the catering business? Is that really what at the end of the day, this reimaging is meant to do?
J. Patrick Doyle: No. It's really about opening up the kitchens, making them more inviting, making the carryout experience far more positive I think than that it has been. Catering, I mean...
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: I'm sorry, I mean carryout. If I said catering, I mean carryout. My fault.
J. Patrick Doyle: That was why you see the quizzical look on my face through the speaker phone.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Yes. I'm sorry. I mean catering. I mean carryout.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, absolutely. I mean, it's largely about carryout, but I will tell you even delivery customers want to know where their food is coming from. If they've seen the store once, they're driving by the restaurant, they want to see that it's a good-looking place. And so while this is certainly more going to be about carryout than necessarily delivery, the fact is I think it helps both. It helps the brand overall, which is ultimately going to help sales overall.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.
Ivan Holman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: This is Ivan Holman sitting in for Michael. I was just wondering, given robust EBITDA growth, it seems reasonable that you would just naturally do well over time. And so I was hoping if you will provide a little bit of incremental color around how we should understand priorities for cash and how you're thinking about dividends versus for the share repurchases?
Michael T. Lawton: Well, as you can see we're continuing to do both. In terms of the use of cash, we've increased the dividend nicely. And the fact that we're continuing to buy shares both fourth quarter and as I said on the first quarter, gives you an indication of our intentions that we're going to keep doing both ends. As it relates to the deleveraging, we're currently at about 4.5x EBITDA. That's right in the middle of the range that we've talked about as being appropriate for us, which we think is somewhere up 6% on the high end and 3% on the low end, 6x -- 6x on the high end, 3x on the low end times EBITDA. And so we're very comfortable where we're at. Obviously, we'll continue to look at where that takes us over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I was hoping you could shed some more color on, I mean, what's really been some exceptional performance in your supply chain or your distribution business. Even -- it looks like the U.S. is performing even better than what store growth or as you mentioned, order counts may have been on the comp side in this last quarter so, if you can explain the fourth quarter and how that might influence profit growth in the segment for 2014 and beyond?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. John, I think there are couple of things. First, overall, as you heard in Mike's commentary, I think the team has done a really nice job of controlling kind of the controllable costs. But I think the other thing you are just seeing is the value of variable margin. And as volume is going up, you're leveraging fixed costs, you're leveraging capacity in our supply chain centers. And the team has done a very good job of having that flow down to the bottom line. And what I remind you of is as they're looking at initiatives for making that system more profitable, we're unique in our profit sharing model. So 1/2 of the profits out of our supply chain system are going to our franchisees, and so they're excited when we are able to bring initiatives to them that are going to make it more profitable overall for all of us. But overall, I think the answer is just simply good management of the system combined with importantly, increasing volume going through the system.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Has there been -- it looks like the G&A was actually down year-over-year. I mean, was there any structural change that happened, I mean, consolidation of facilities that maybe I missed or you maybe you're distributing a little bit more product this year than you would have been last year? I don't know what that would be exactly, but just trying to get a sense if there is some kind of a change and if there is a lapping point that we should be sensitive to as we look into '14?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, I think GA was pretty flat in the distribution business year-over-year. So what that means is the increased volume that we're putting through is on the contribution margin, there is pretty much flow into the bottom line, which is what gets you some increase in margin overall.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A couple of questions. Just first, this is a follow-up on the franchise investment and the remodel program. I know you talked about at the analyst day that it was long overdue. I think that the feedback from franchisees is pretty positive. I'm just wondering how you're selling them on this idea, whether it's just long overdue and if were mandated or whether you're giving them kind of sales into a profitability expectations or whether there's any of those expectations that you would be willing to share with us?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I think the answer of that is we did go out and as you say kind of sell it to them, but we do have the ability to mandate it as well contractually, given how long it's been. But I would tell you that the overall take from the system was really very positive. And frankly, I'd even go so far as to say maybe even a little more positive than one would expect when you're going out and asking people to make a pretty substantial reinvestment into their system. They get it, they understand it. Our franchise system is very engaged, I think as engaged and positive about where we are as a brand that I've seen in the 17 years I've been at Domino's. And so overall, the reaction was really quite positive and very quickly kind of moved into questions around implementation, and tell me exactly how quickly I need to do it and what this means for me and relocations and all those sorts of questions. So overall, I think it's really about talking to them about how it's going to continue the momentum in the overall brand as opposed to kind of any specific selling around it. They get it, they understand now it's driving the momentum in the business.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And just 2 quick sales questions. One, I know you don't give inter period sales, but with the unusual nature of the weather we've seen in the fourth quarter and into first quarter, just remind us whether sequentially through the fourth quarter, you saw things move when weather hits in certain markets or whether you can give us some regional color in terms of the comp? I know the company operate comp on a small base was much lower maybe they were hit harder. I'm just trying to size up your defensive nature in the increment weather environment.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. Well, what I'd say, Jeff, is not kind of get into the breaking down the trends within the fourth quarter or certainly not talk about what's happening in the first quarter. What I will tell you is I think what we've said before, which is on average, bad weather, extreme weather and it actually can be also when it's particularly hot, will be at the margin somewhat more helpful for us than the opposite, but we have not in the past, seen that be a particularly materially effect in over the course of a full quarter. So 3 or 4 inches of snow, coming into a market or a lot of rain or particularly cold or particularly hot will in the short term be helpful to us because of the delivery nature of our business. But it's -- we've never seen it at the point that it is a particularly material change on a full quarter.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And then just lastly then, looking at the menu in U.S. in '14, I think you talked about it at the analyst day that it in '13, you really didn't tap into your what I think you characterized it as a fairly strong product pipeline and you were more focused on online and whatnot. So in '14, just wondering any color you can give in terms of whether we should be expecting more new product news or whether you're focused more on main items versus sides or value versus premium or any color in terms of the '14 outlook?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I guess the first thing I'd say is referencing kind of our comments at the investor day. Now you know why you we were saying some of the things we were with confidence. I mean, the fourth quarter lapping pan was still very strong, despite the fact that we didn't have new product news coming in. We knew that it was the overall momentum in our business and great advertising and execution and technology coming on the business that was driving what we knew at that point were quite good results in the fourth quarter. That said, I think it would be pretty unusual for us to go in the U.S., a full year without a new product launch. And so while I think you will continue to see far fewer new product launches from us than we may have done 5 or 10 years ago over the course of the year, I also think 0 is not going to be a particularly common outcome either.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And I just wanted to ask more about the sales trends. There's a view out there that consumers doing more online shopping this holiday season impacted traffic and that trend will continue. That seems like a trend that should benefit you because of your leadership in digital. Did you see a difference in online ordering mix this fourth quarter year-over-year or even to date?
J. Patrick Doyle: I think really, we've just seen continued growth on digital. So I don't know that we saw anything kind of more or less than we would have expected given what we were doing with profiles and everything else in the fourth quarter. But what I would point out is that about 10% of our business is people walking into our stores, placing an order there for carryouts. So 90% of our business is order ahead, either over the phone or over digital. And we are now basically right at the point where we are doing just about equal amounts of sales digitally versus over the phone. And so I mean, we've come a long way in just 5 or 6 years on the digital front. We're continuing to see nice robust growth out of that channel. And we think that's going to continue. So nothing particularly unusual in the fourth quarter about the growth, except that it continued to be strong.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the reimaged stores. I'm just curious, if you'd be able to share anything on your tests in terms of what the comp look does, what it does to store economics and mix between carryout and delivery?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I think the answer is as you're doing individual stores, it's pretty modest. But we know what it's going to do to the overall brand. And that's really where it's more important. So it is ultimately going to be about a better customer facing experience overall, with stores that really look like the brand that people are now expecting from Domino's and the experience that they're expecting. And so even as we've put together a terrific digital experience and great service and great advertising and dramatically improved product, they're walking into our stores and they're just not having a comparable experience from entering our stores. And so it's about making that yet one more area, where we're really leading and we think doing it with this image, opening up our kitchens so that people can see the quality of the food that we're using to make their meal is a really positive step forward for us.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Smith with Feltl.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Maybe a question for Mike. It sounds like you're standing by your guidance for commodities to be flat to negative 2%. Looking at cheese prices today, are you assuming that we see an easing from current levels?
Michael T. Lawton: Yes. As you're pointing out correctly, cheese prices are at very high levels. They've come down a little bit, but they're very high. We certainly do expect that to moderate and most of the other commodities that we've got we think are going to be in pretty decent shape for the year. But if cheese prices stayed where they are, my forecast of down 0 to 2% would certainly be inaccurate.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Is there a long-term opportunity as we see the big international players in pizza continue to take share from mom-and-pops and the regional guys? As we see cheese move high, is there an opportunity that maybe some of the smaller guys are pushed out of business and shut their doors, whereas you are able to withstand that a little better?
Michael T. Lawton: I would think that whenever you look at commodity pressures, you've got that tendency to raise prices and it's easier to not raise prices and continue to do what's right for the customer to keep your prices at the price points that they're looking for as long as possible when you're running good volume through your stores. And as you saw for the past year, each of the last 4 quarters, at least, what we've been talking about is we've had good solid order count growth. We were getting it in the prior years as well. I would certainly hope that, that puts us in a stronger position to withstand short-term commodity bumps than somebody who is being stretched out on lesser volume.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: And then lastly, just looking at the strong results from your distribution business. Are there any investments that need to be made as your volume increases?
Michael T. Lawton: We're in pretty good shape as it relates to volume. We do continue to make some investments just because some of the plants are older in some cases, and the investments that we're making are more to maintain the productivity or in some cases, improve them. But there's enough capacity out there in general that you won't see a lot of CapEx going into supply-chain just because we need to expand capacity in the U.S. We're in pretty good shape.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory Group.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Just wanted to ask about the media and advertising budget, how you're forecasting that for 2014, is there going to be any portion that's going to go local or is this all going to be on a national scale?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, some gets spent locally, but that's relatively small now versus what we're spending at a national level. The percentage of sales is -- that goes into the national fund is going to be consistent in 2014, with what it was in 2013. But if we can continue to generate sales growth and we can continue to generate store growth, that means that the absolute amount will be up year-over-year.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Great. And just a nontraditional kind of question. I mean, there's a lot of chatter that the new iPhone this year will have a bigger screen. Have you found that bigger screens on some of these smartphones, is that helping to drive more of your digital sales?
J. Patrick Doyle: Interestingly, I don't know that it necessarily drives more in the way of sales. I would tell you that the larger the screen, the more people can see great food photography and an appetite appeal. And so there may be some very -- I may haven't really thought about it before, but there may be some very small correlation between screen size and ticket size. I don't think it would be particularly big. Now that you've asked the question, I may go back and ask somebody to look at it, but I don't think it's going to have much effect, but at the margin, it might a little bit.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time.
J. Patrick Doyle: Thank you for listening today, and I look forward to reporting our first quarter results to you in early May.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Jessica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 financial results earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Liddle, you may begin your conference.
Lynn M. Liddle: Thank you so much. Welcome, everybody. As usual, we will begin with prepared comments from management followed by an open Q&A. We will ask, as always, for reporters to kindly be in a listen-only mode as we have fashioned this call primarily for investors. And now I will also turn everybody's attention to our Safe Harbor statement that is both in our 8-K and in our 10-Q in the event that any forward-looking statements are made. With us today, we have our Chief Financial Officer and our CEO, and we will begin first with comments from Mike Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer.
Michael T. Lawton: Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we, once again, delivered solid results for our shareholders during the quarter. Our international and domestic divisions posted strong same-store sales growth, and our international division opened an impressive number of new stores, and adjusted EPS grew by 18.6% over the prior year. Overall, we are pleased with another quarter of strong results. I'll start my review of the quarter by looking at our systemwide sales, also known as global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide. Global retail sales grew 7.4%. When we exclude the adverse impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew by 10.2%. The drivers of this growth included domestic same-store sales, which rose 5.4% in the quarter, lapping a positive 3.3% in the third quarter of 2012. This was comprised of franchisee same-store sales which were up 5.5% and company-owned stores which were up 4.6%. Although we don't give specifics of order count and ticket for competitive reasons, we did drive strong order count growth again this quarter. We opened 7 net stores domestically in the quarter, consisting of 12 store openings and 5 closures. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have opened a net 43 stores domestically, and we continue to expect to see modestly positive domestic store growth for the full year. Our international division had another solid quarter as same-store sales grew 5.0%, lapping a strong prior year quarter increase of 5%. Our international division grew by 119 stores this quarter, made up of 124 store openings and 5 closures. Turning to revenues, our total revenues were up $26 million or 6.9% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of 2 factors: first, higher domestic and international royalty revenues due to same-store sales growth and store count growth; and second, higher supply chain revenues resulting mainly from increased volumes from higher order counts, as well as an increase in commodity prices. Moving on to our operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, our consolidated operating margin for the quarter improved slightly to 29.9% from 29.5% in the prior year quarter. Some of the related activity that occurred during the quarter included the following. A change in our mix of revenues positively impacted our operating margin as we now have more franchise revenue from royalties, which have no cost of sales. Also, company-owned store operating margins improved slightly as a result of -- as a percentage of revenues due to higher volumes that leveraged labor and occupancy cost, as well as lower self-insured health insurance cost. These improvements were partially offset by higher food cost. Our supply chain margin percentage was relatively flat versus last year's third quarter at 10.3% as higher volumes were offset by an increase in commodity cost. I'd like to point out that from the first half of the year to this quarter, margin supply chain were down. You may recall that in the first half of 2012, we ran promotions primarily designed to raise franchisee profits through ticket, thus decreasing dough volumes through supply chain. This resulted in very favorable comparisons in the first half of 2013. Cheese costs were relatively flat this quarter versus the prior year, but our overall market basket increased 1.8% due primarily to increases in meats and boxes. As a reminder, food commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar markup to our franchisees. Therefore, higher commodity prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, negatively impact our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues. Overall, we expect commodities for the full year 2013 to remain tame and will come out in the 2% to 3% increase over 2012 levels. At this point, we expect that commodities we use in our system will be flat to down in 2014 versus 2013 levels. We plan to provide an estimate of our 2014 commodity price changes when we hold our Investor Day schedule for January 15 in Orlando, Florida. Despite the fact that we have diversified monetary risk, currency exchange rates negatively impacted us in the quarter by $1.3 million versus the prior year -- or prior year quarter due to the dollar strengthening against most currencies. And if the dollar remains at current levels, our comparisons in prior -- to prior periods will continue to be a headwind for us. Turning to G&A expenses. G&A increased by $4.1 million or 8.2% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was primarily due to investments to expand our international support team, e-commerce and technology support and an increase in noncash compensation expense. We have previously estimated our full year G&A to increase between $9 million and $13 million over 2012 for the full year for the same reasons I just mentioned. We are currently running slightly above that range after 3 quarters, but we expect Q4 to be fairly flat with last year. Also note that we charge franchisees for providing ongoing e-commerce and technology support, and our revenues related to reimbursement for these services will increase over $2 million for the full year to partially offset these G&A increases. Keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down by, among other things, our performance versus our plan as that affects variable performance-based compensation expense. Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 34.1% for the quarter, which is below our normal range. We revised the calculation for a deduction related to our domestic dough production, which resulted in a $1.4 million benefit that we have adjusted out of EPS for comparability. Therefore, our adjusted tax rate, excluding that amount, our adjusted tax rate was 37% for the quarter. We continue to expect that 37.5% to 38.5% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our third quarter net income was up $4.7 million or 17.9%. This increase was primarily driven by higher domestic and international same-store sales, international store growth and the tax benefit that I just discussed. Our third quarter diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.53 versus $0.44 in the prior year quarter. On an as-adjusted basis, diluted EPS was $0.51 for the quarter versus prior year adjusted EPS of $0.43. The $0.51 is an $0.08 or 18.6% increase from the $0.43 as adjusted in the third quarter of last year. Here's how that $0.08 increase breaks down. Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.07. Our lower diluted share count, primarily due to our share repurchases, benefited us by $0.01. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.01, and a lower effective tax rate benefited us by $0.01. Turning to our use of cash, during the third quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 351,000 shares for $21 million or at an average price of $59.34 per share. We also returned over $11 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends. We're now paying a $0.20 per share quarterly dividend. We also -- we did end the quarter with $32.1 million of unrestricted cash. Overall, we are pleased with the quarter and our consistent positive performance so far this year. Thank you for your time today, and now I'll turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report another great quarter with both a robust top and bottom line. With same-store sales in the U.S. and abroad having increased around 5%, we feel really good about our brand's popularity with consumers around the world. Our franchise model and engaged franchisees continued to provide highly effective, generating both strong free cash flow and a healthy profit line with an 18.6% increase in EPS. I'm very proud of our team, which has consistently outperformed many of our industry peers for the last few years. Summing it up, I'd say we've achieved this primarily in 2 ways: by innovating in both products and technology and by consistently and aggressively growing our global footprint. Domestically, we delivered strong sales, which were, once again, driven mostly by order counts. As I've said before, we look at this as a good indicator of consumer demand. Orders were driven by our improved menu, featuring a lot of variety, breakthrough advertising and a price point that clearly resonates with our customers. It's been a year since we introduced our handmade pan pizza, which has performed very well for us, and our research shows that consumers are giving us credit for the better overall taste of our food. As Mike noted, domestic store growth has been positive for the last 12 months, which also makes us feel good about our expectation of moderate store growth in the U.S. for the full year. As an aside, all new store builds are being done in our new image design, which franchisees are taking great pride in. We're getting some great feedback from both consumers and franchisees who like this new look, which is consistent with our new overall brand image. On the U.S. innovation front, I will remind you that we look at innovation beyond what you see on our menu. You may recall that last quarter, we reported that our technology is available to approximately 95% of the smartphone market after the introduction of our Windows 8 app. We followed that with our recent streamlining of our mobile ordering app, making it incredibly fast. While this may not sound like a huge accomplishment to those of you who aren't obsessed with pizza, like I am, but if you've ever ordered anything online, you know. Our customers can now create personalized profile, so they can save information, like credit card or address, as well as their favorite orders, letting them order in as little as 5 clicks or about 30 seconds. This is great news, particularly for our mobile users who want speed and convenience while using a small keyboard. We expect this to be a very popular feature and one we believe will give us a competitive advantage over a pizza company without this handy feature. We hope you all get a chance to give it a test drive soon, if you haven't already. As a result of our continued innovation and technology, digital sales have now reached about 40% of our total sales. Internationally, our franchisees are also gaining digital ground and innovating with technology. Our largest master franchisee, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, just reported that half of their sales are currently digital. They also have a stated goal of achieving 80% digital sales for their entire enterprise. Our U.K. master franchisee reported that digital sales accounted for more than 62% of its delivery sales in the third quarter, up from 58% during the third quarter a year ago. Sales from mobile devices more than doubled and were up 102% year-over-year. In India, where connectivity isn't always consistent or widespread, we've already reached 20% of orders online for delivery orders, which we're very pleased to see. And beyond progress and innovation, overall brand results continued to be strong in the third quarter for our international division, with positive results delivered, once again, in both same-store sales and store growth. We continued to see positive sales around the world, with particularly impressive results from Brazil and Turkey this quarter. We celebrated a couple of notable milestones as well with the opening of our 500th store in Australia and our 600th store in India. Speaking of India, the International Business Times reported that Domino's has the greatest market share of any foreign fast food operator there, about double that of McDonald's, KFC, SUBWAY and Pizza Hut. I want to note that our Japanese business, which has also been performing well, was recently acquired by Domino's Pizza Enterprises. DPE now operates in Australia, New Zealand, France, Netherlands, Belgium and Japan. Overall, our 79 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth certainly demonstrates our past ability to drive international results over and over, and our track record of store growth outpacing the industry have reinforced our confidence and our ability to continue to grow. One of these quarterly calls wouldn't be complete without some commentary on our balance sheet. We've generated cash flow in excess of $2 million per week during the first 3 quarters of 2013, and we have continued to deploy it to the benefit of our shareholders. Through the end of the third quarter, we've spent $77 million on share repurchases and $23 million year-to-date on dividend payments. We're proud of our track record of returns for our shareholders and remain mindful of that objective all the time. With that, I'll turn over the call for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Kelter.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Maybe I'll start kind of just going -- leading off with Patrick, what you just ended with, and then hoping to get an update from you guys on your views on re-levering the balance sheet possibly by, let's say, 1 turn, up to 5.5x, and then within that, how you think about share repurchase versus special dividend given where the stock is trading. Special dividend could be rather meaningful just doing kind of the pure math.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, well, I think what I'd say, Michael, is we continue to be very focused on generating the best returns that we can. I am not going to talk about kind of going forward use of the cash, but I think the indication of how we're managing that is in what we've been doing. We've bought back a lot of stock this year at -- clearly, given where we're trading now have been favorable prices so far this year, and as well as paying out on the regular dividend. Beyond that, you know us. You know how we think about this, which is we are always looking at the opportunities and we're going to do whatever we believe is going to generate the best returns for the shareholders based on kind of all the circumstances in the market at the time. And I recognize that doesn't necessarily lead you to an absolute answer, and the reason is because it is going to depend on kind of the exact conditions for the debt market for all of the different options that are out there. And so it's something we focus on a lot, are going to continue to focus on a lot. But I think the guidance for you is to look at the way we've been managing it.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then on G&A, which, as you said, is on pace to be up about $13 million this year, and I'm sure you'll address this more in detail in your Investor Day in January, but could you talk about an early read for 2014? Is it another invest year, with the international and e-commerce investments driving that figure up again quite a bit, or was that really isolated to a 2013 step-up?
Michael T. Lawton: Michael, we're really in the process of putting budgets together at this point in time, which obviously will lead us to much more clarity about what 2014 is. And we'll have to talk about that at our Investor Day.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then maybe lastly, could you talk about the potential for any meaningful sales drivers on the horizon, new products or otherwise, that we should be thinking about, even if you're not ready to get into specifics at this point? And I ask partially in light of anniversary-ing the bump-up from the pan pizza launch last October.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, well, if you look at what we've got out right now, it's innovation on the technology front with profiles, and it's -- we're running national television right now, talking about the speed and ease of ordering digitally from Domino's, which is not something we've really taken a head on like that before. And I think we've said many times, I think we already said this morning in our prepared comments that look for us to be driving innovation, both with products and with technology, and we continue to see great gains from both of those. So I guess what I'd say is, I think we've still got a very good pipeline of innovation out there. We are not in the product-of-the-month club anymore. You're not going to see us launching things every 6 or 8 weeks like we have in the past. We think that what we're doing is building overall brand momentum by focusing on fewer, bigger things that are truly improving the experience for our customers. And that's been pretty well borne out as a strategy with the results over the course of the past few years. So I guess what I'd say is we've definitely got the pipeline as we've slowed some of the pace of new product launches that actually has been a very positive thing for us. It helps with execution in the stores, and it helps us make sure that the things that we are launching, we've got right. And so it's kind of fewer, bigger, better on the innovation front. But we certainly have things out there that we can launch on both the product and the technology side as we deem it necessary.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner.
Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. I'm just wondering if you can kind of talk about the stock buyback. I mean, it's meaningfully slow since the quarter ended. Are you just being price-sensitive here? And kind of going forward, should we expect more consistency or kind of some lumpiness going forward?
Michael T. Lawton: Well, one thing to always keep in mind is there are a lot of closed periods. So after a quarter ends, we don't necessarily have opportunities to buy whether we want to or not, so it's not necessarily an indicator of anything. But the only thing I can keep pointing back to is we've bought back a significant amount of stock so far this year. And as Patrick said, we'll continue to evaluate whether that's what we think the right thing to do or to return cash to shareholders in other forms or anything else we may consider.
Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just a quick question on the overall environment. I mean, obviously, you've had a great pipeline of products that's helped the comps. You have a great momentum going. But if the consumer environment sort of stays the way it is now, what sort of strategies do you have in place to kind of keep your momentum going? Obviously, with innovation, it's a big thing.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, Mike, I think the answer is the consumer environment right now is pretty consistent with what it's been over the course of the past year or 2, so -- which is to say, not great. I mean, if you look at the overall restaurant industry growth for the whole category, it hasn't been terrific. I think consumers are still cautious. I think that's going to continue. I think I've said it before, but right now, I think consumers are still relatively cautious based on kind of the government getting long-term deals in place. And that's continued to be the case for the last couple of years. And so I think you're seeing a consumer environment that's very consistent with what we've seen the last couple of years. And so I guess what I'd say is in terms of changes in how we're going to operate, we're seeing an environment that is still very similar. And so I think what we've been doing the past couple of years is really what you should expect going forward. If consumers -- I see more upside than downside from the consumer. I think it can still get better out there, and it could turn into tailwinds, but it hasn't been. For the past couple of years, it's clearly been more headwinds than tailwinds.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I just want to go back to the notion as you shift to more -- less about promotional activity and more about brand-building and momentum. First of all, I presume that doesn't mean you're not going to be innovative, right? There's still new products coming, just maybe they're not going to be limited time or something. So maybe you can just frame the difference between innovation and promotion. And then what drives, within the digital loop, right, as people order on digital, what really drives or what metrics can you point to that says your incremental traffic's coming from more orders in the same household? When you look at it, are you -- is there any way you can publicly frame for us what the benefits you're getting as people use the app and use the new app, which is easier, and what kind of incrementality from an existing order base you're getting?
J. Patrick Doyle: Sure. Yes, John, so taking the first question, I think actually, you answered the question, which is our focus has been on launching things that are going to be permanent additions to our menu. That doesn't mean that from time to time, you won't see us do something that's more promotional. But overall, our strategy is very much to launch bigger, better things that are going to be on the menu, that are going to build overall brand equity for us, and that should continue. And one of the big enablers for that is our digital platform. In the past, when we would launch new products, often, we'd look at them and say, we hope this is something that can be permanent. But as soon as we go off air, people didn't have the reminder when they were ordering of that great new product that we had. We'd see the mix drop off a lot after we took it off television, and we'd eventually pull it off of the menu. With the digital platform, with people having a menu in front of them when they're ordering, it allows us to build on the menu, to add things that are going to stay there. And that's a big change for us. It's a very big change for us because it has allowed us to keep these things going -- to have incrementality after they have launched by keeping them on the menu. So that's a big change for us in the way our customers are accessing the brand that has allowed us to change some of our strategy around how we manage our menu and our product innovations. In terms of the digital orders, basically, all of the customer metrics are better with digital orders. And most importantly, the retention of those customers is higher because their customer satisfaction is higher and the frequency of those customers is higher. So it is primarily about order counts. Ticket is a little bit higher. But the most important thing is kind of the customer reaction to it, which is higher satisfaction, which is driving better retention and better frequency.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And just one other question on the Japanese acquisition by the Australian franchisee. Do you renegotiate royalty rates when that occurs or did you? Number one. And number two, is there a significant opportunity for incremental store growth in Japan, or do you view it -- and therefore, this gets catalyzed by a new owner, puts more capital into the business? Or do you not see that as a real opportunity in this case?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, so first answer is no, royalty rates did not change as part of that deal. And second, they are clearly looking at it as a growth vehicle. We've actually gotten pretty good growth, store growth, out of Japan the last couple of years. I will tell you from a company standpoint, the store growth has been offset by the yen having devalued the past couple of years. So from a retail sales standpoint, pretty darn good store growth has been pretty fully offset by the weakening of the yen. But going forward, I mean, DPE is clearly looking at it as a growth vehicle for them, and we're pretty optimistic about the medium and longer term in Japan.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I was just wondering if you could let us know how the U.S. pizza category did in the quarter and what you're seeing in terms of share shifts. I mean, are the regionals still -- smaller regionals still losing share to the larger chains? And if you are gaining share, which I'm pretty sure you are, I mean, are they coming primarily from the regionals or the larger chains or maybe it's both?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I think the dynamics have stayed relatively the same. I think you're still seeing flat to a little bit up in the category. We are clearly taking share. I would say it has been more from the regionals and the smaller players, although our largest competitor, I think, has now had 4 slightly negative comps in a row in the U.S. And so we've clearly taken a little bit from there as well. But overall, the dynamic of the larger players taking share from the medium-size and smaller players, I think, has continued. And certainly, our growth is still more about share growth than it is about the category starting to grow more.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the pan pizza. You've now lapped the 1 year anniversary, I think, on October 1, and you'll be lapping some strong growth from the initial launch last year. It's a good problem to have, but would you expect growth to continue after lapping a launch based on what you're seeing?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, I guess what I'd say is we've got a lot of momentum, and there are a lot of different things that have been contributing to growth. Pan has certainly performed very, very well for us over the course of the past 12 months since its launch last year at the beginning of October. But digital has also been driving growth, and improved store operations have been driving growth. And I think there are a lot of things that have been contributing to it. But certainly, pan performed very well over the course of the past year, and certainly, we would hope that it's going to continue to perform well for us. But you're right. I mean, we're starting to roll over that initial launch from a year ago now, but I'm not going to get into the specifics, obviously, of the fourth quarter. I guess what I'd say is, we think we've got pretty rock-solid momentum right now.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Good to hear. And then lastly, on the technology front, are you seeing competitor step-up with innovations in digital or ordering apps or anything on that front?
J. Patrick Doyle: I think there are certainly some things that they're doing out there, but I think the most important thing to look at is the gap between the 3 national players with platforms, so us and Papa John's and Pizza Hut, versus where the regionals and smaller players are. And so we think we've got the best platform out there, but I'm sure some of our national competitors would believe that they do as well. And I think what's more important is the dynamic of the national players with these platforms and how we're effectively competing against smaller players that either don't have digital ordering or certainly don't have the same kind of robust platform that we're operating on. So we're certainly seeing some things from our national competitors, but in terms of how that's going to affect our overall sales, I think the more interesting dynamic continues to be the competitive advantage that we're building versus the smaller players in the category.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Great. A couple of questions. One just on maybe the current promotional environment. One, I'm just wondering how you assess it today versus where it's been over the past year. And it was kind of interesting, maybe if you can layer in a comment about inflation because I know you mentioned that you're going to be in that 2% to 3% range. And next year, I think you mentioned flat to down in terms of a commodity basket. So I'm just wondering, one, with the promotional environment's like now and how you think the players yourself and the competitors respond whether you typically would see a big uptick in discounting with the basket going more to deflation than inflation? Or what you might be seeing or thinking you might be seeing going forward?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I think that, first, Jeff, the answer is that the competitive environment, I think, has been pretty consistent over the course of the past, really couple of years. And so no real change there. And in Mike's comments, he did say that our early expectation, our early read on 2014 is kind of flat to down on commodities. Corn prices are very low. And corn tends to flow through everything else. And so I think you're right on that front. That said, there are other pressures out there. And so I don't know that I'd see the environment changing enough next year that I would really expect pricing to materially adjust. Obviously, that could change, but I think you're going to tend to see more kind of a steady as she goes category-competitive environment. That'd be my guess.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And then just from a unit growth perspective, obviously the international is still very strong. We're obviously hearing about various macro headwinds globally. But do you see the international interest accelerating from a unit growth perspective? Or do you think maybe the macro's containing it? I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of pipeline of future growth. I guess if you could address that domestically as well, whether or not we could see a ramp-up in U.S. franchise growth in '14 with the strength you're seeing fundamentally.
J. Patrick Doyle: Sure. I think on the international side, we changed our long-term forecast, our long-term guidance on store growth from being an absolute number to a percentage range back in January. And there was a reason for that. As we looked at the capacity of our markets to grow, frankly, as they get larger and a little bit more mature in some of these markets, and they've got a little bit more infrastructure in place, their ability to support more growth grows with their business. It's easier to add 50 stores in a market when your base is 200 than to add 50 when your base is 100, just the number of stores that have to produce a new manager and kind of covering your overall fixed cost with the master franchisee level, et cetera. So from a percentage standpoint, our overall global guidance of kind of 4% to 6% growth stands, which from an absolute number means our expectation is that, that number will go up over time as the base continues to grow. And I think the macro environment outside of the U.S. also continues to be relatively consistent. Although I think we may be seeing some signs of a few places starting to get a little bit better than they were. But overall, I think you're looking at a pretty consistent environment out there. And we think that our growth guidance is the right one for the long term, which is kind of a percentage-based growth. So on the domestic side, clearly, we're pleased that we have gotten to kind of that moderate growth that we've been talking about. On a trailing 12-month basis, we are up on a net basis in the U.S. Our profits at the store level continue to improve year-over-year. So the macros on that are pretty good. And what we know is that stores get built because they should be built, that they get built when they're going to generate a good return for the franchisee. And you may be able to pull growth forward in the short term doing some things, but the real answer is over the medium to long term, good unit economics are what are going to drive growth. And as our unit economics get better in the U.S., that gives us more optimism about our ability to continue to generate some modest growth in the U.S.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And just lastly, I know you addressed the balances or always looking at the share purchase versus dividend and whatnot. But just from the leverage standpoint, I think the framework you have mentioned in the past was you kind of want to stick to it within that 3 to 6x range. And if that's still the case, I don't know whether in the short term, you're ever contemplating going outside or above that range, whether rates are still compelling or whether maybe that's kind of fleeting at this point. So just kind of your thoughts in terms of the framework is 3 to 6 still the range you're looking at?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. And that's going to depend on interest rates and the environment out there for -- in the debt markets. But I think something in that range is about right. We have gone above that range in the near term -- in the short term in the past. I don't know that we've been below it for quite some time. But I think that is a reasonable range for expectations over time. And we continue to look at it. We continue to look at the markets. And we're going to run the numbers very much the way you would run the numbers. And if we see opportunities, we'll take advantage of those opportunities. And that's really all I can say on that front.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Could you talk about the national mix of amortizing? It went up this year in 2013. Is it set at that same level? Or maybe can you remind us what level that is for 2014? Or is there any chance you'll see that medium mix shift again?
J. Patrick Doyle: No. I mean, we're spending -- our national ad fund is 6%. And we would expect that to stay in place. I think what you're seeing is -- so we had some shift from local market advertising to national spend. We think that's been effective for the system. We think franchisees P&L's are healthier. So we think it's been the right move. And it's generating growth and profits for them. So we feel good about it. And then I guess the other thing that's been happening within that is some shift towards digital which has continued to have a good ROI. Fourth, and probably some shift away from local print over the course of the past couple of years, which hasn't quite gotten the same level of ROI as in the past for us. But I think in terms of anything material changing in the near term, probably not. You'll see some subtle shifts as we kind of fine-tune things, but I don't think you'll see a significant change in the near-term.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris O'Cull.
Christopher T. O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: How do you expect the new digital profiles will change digital usage?
J. Patrick Doyle: The easier we make it for people to order pizza, the more pizza they're going to order. And I think it's as simple as that. So -- and I think if you look at how people like Amazon have shifted over time, they've tried to make it easier and easier for consumers. You're always looking at conversion rates on your site. The simpler you can make it, the more you're going to drive orders out of it and the happier your customers are going to be. And so we focus very hard on how we can make that process easier and simpler for our customers. And we think this was a nice move forward for us with the profiles, the ability of that customer to get through the process faster. And kind of in general, in restaurant industry terms, when you're improving your service times, good things happen in your business. And I think you could look at the ability of customers to get through that process no different than you would look at how we've driven service in the past with our delivery, how a lot of folks look at very carefully at their drive-through times at the restaurants. We look at how easy it is for our customers to access the brand and to order from the brand. And this speeds things up. And that's a good thing.
Christopher T. O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Do you think it will make it more difficult to upsell or get people to try new products?
J. Patrick Doyle: There will still be some upselling going on even with this kind of streamlined process. But when you get somebody to sign up and fill out a profile and to enter their credit card that goes into a token so that they can access that again, once somebody's gone to the trouble of doing that, and it's kind of put the trust and commitment into the brand that they're going to fill all of that out, you've kind of upped the relationship with that customer. And that's going to have a good effect on sales, we hope.
Christopher T. O'Cull - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division: Any color in terms of just what percentage of users have created profiles or how this has been accepted by consumers?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I'll tell you, we track that to the 0.1% and are not going to release it because I know our competitors would love to get that information.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Anderson.
Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Somebody questioned on the new prototype. He said that the new -- all new bills will feature elements from the prototype. How many units do you have under the new design? And if it's at all possible, can you show what kind of a delta between the new stores -- newer prototype versus the older type with regard to average unit volumes?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. We've got a couple hundred stores that are in the new image. And it's still relatively early in that process, to kind of get into specifics around list. I guess what I'd say is the franchisee's reaction and the customer reactions are positive. And as we get a little further into it at some point, we're going to be in a position to talk about that a little bit more, but for now, a little too early to try to be giving specific numbers around that.
Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Do you still feel confident that this will be the way to build new units going forward?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I mean, we're building -- all new units we're building now are in this new design.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Amod Gautam.
Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I'm filling in for John. You made a few comments on the solid momentum of the business. And it's looking like this might be the fourth consecutive year where comps are above the long range, 1% to 3%. So can you just kind of frame 2014 for us within that context? Is that still -- is the 1% to 3% still the fair range you want people to think about? Or is there something about continued growth in technology or incrementality in pan pizzas that makes you feel more positive about continuing share gains, possibly above the 1% to 3%?
J. Patrick Doyle: It's a fair question. And I think the answer is we're looking at that. I mean it's -- clearly, we're very happy with the momentum in the business and pretty optimistic about where we are. And so you're right, we've noticed the same thing. And clearly, we're pleased. And I think the past few years have exceeded our expectations on where we thought we were going to be. I guess what I'd say is this is a long-term guidance. We've kind of been looking at 10 years looking back at where we've been and trying to project out where we're going to be. But you're correctly pointing out, we've been slightly above to strongly above, certainly in 2010. And this year, it's been developing very nicely for us as well. So I guess that's really all I'd say right now. Your observation is correct. We have been above it. Though each of the last 2 years, we were only a couple of tenths above that range. So we're still awfully close to it. This year has been a little bit stronger.
Amod Gautam - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. The other question's a little bit shorter. Just in terms of the supply chain side, you made some comments about why supply chain margins were kind of flat this quarter, relative to the first half of the year. So I mean some of that, I think, presumably in the first half of the year was driven by leverage as well. So I was curious going forward, is the right expectation -- assuming cheese prices are stable, will the right expectation be basically that there's not going to be a whole lot of leverage going forward? Or is there something else driving potential margin expansion in the supply chain?
J. Patrick Doyle: No. We've said before that the kind of margins that you should expect out of that business are good. We have a very good return on our assets. We're very happy to be in that business. But it's not one to expect a really big increase in the amount of profit margin that's there. We get some leverage when we run a lot of builds through the facility like we had in the first couple of quarters. But it's not one that's going -- that you're going to -- that you can expect to see continued big increases on a gross -- on the operating margin percentage.
Operator: Your next question comes the line of Mark Smith.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: I just want to ask a couple of quick questions more on the online. Just confirm, you're close to 40% domestic. If we look international and global, is that number pretty similar?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, it is. It's probably just slightly lower than that on average outside of the U.S. But that's with a very broad mix. So going from 50%-plus in Japan and Korea and our DPE business to some markets that still don't have digital. And so it's still a pretty broad range. India, I mentioned, it's about 20% of their delivered sales, which is about half of their business. You're looking at kind of 10%-ish on their overall sales. So very broad range out there. We think it is a real opportunity as much or more of an opportunity for us outside of the U.S. as it is inside the U.S. because we have been earlier on the curve in international than we probably were in domestic. And from an overall standpoint, I would tell you it is less developed, I think, in a lot of markets than it is in the U.S. So our ability to go after that leverage that for growth in international has been part of the driver for us on the international business for the last few years, and I'm pretty confident will continue to be a driver for us.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. Now as we look at the changes you've gone from 20 to 30 to nearly 40, what has been the delta on labor levels? And is there still opportunity to maybe reduce labor costs in the restaurant and improve franchisee profitability as online or digital continues to grow?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. There is a little bit of leverage. It's not a big number. You're talking about orders that take maybe 3 minutes to take on average over the phone. So there is a little bit of labor leverage. And we have seen that. And as the percentage continues to go up, we would expect that we will see a little bit more. But it's not a big number. It's definitely there. We can definitely see it and measure it. But I think the real gains from digital orders are far more how it's affecting customers' retention and frequency and driving orders than it is necessarily on the margin front. It's there, but it's order of magnitude, the order of growth that it's driving is a far bigger driver of value creation for us than savings on the labor front.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Great. My first question is about the income statement, one particular line item. The international margin, which is, I don't have supply chain, some supply chain in there, was down over 100 basis points year-over-year, if I got my numbers right, and now with the first margin decline in that segment in several quarters, I'm just wondering if you can just explain some of the dynamics? Was ForEx a factor or something with the Canadian supply chain? Yes, the international margin, down about 100 bps year-over-year?
Michael T. Lawton: The margin you're looking at is the Canadian supply chain margin down a little. But that's probably -- the business in Canada is actually doing very well. Just like in the U.S., you've got issues with as prices go up, as commodity prices are up, sometimes your margin percentage changes. But that business is performing very well. And I think all pan -- it's got more to do with price, with commodity prices than anything else.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And a separate question if we can move to the balance sheet. And I know you made some comments earlier on the conference call that if you can just give us a sense of where your debt to EBITDA is today and maybe talk about some of the thresholds to look forward to, like when the amortization could be postponed. And if what it looks and just separately, what the prepayment penalty outlook looks like over the next couple of years.
Michael T. Lawton: Okay. Under the way that the debt-to-EBITDA ratio is calculated for our covenants, which includes the kind of the idea that all of our BFN is drawn down. We're currently up 4.6. When we go below 4.5, we have the opportunity to seize amortization. And we're obviously making progress toward rep and progress towards that number. In terms of the ability to refinance with the make-whole premiums, there's a fairly steep make-whole that's in place for the first 3 years of the debt. And the debt was placed a year ago, this past March. After that point in time, we do continue to have significant make-whole penalty, but we'll have the opportunity to buy back about 1/3 of the stock -- or repay about 1/3 of the debt, rather, without a make-whole if we chose to. So a complete refinancing in the next 2 years is a fairly unlikely scenario.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And if I can ask one last question, more on the product pipeline and really the product portfolio. And just a big picture, Patrick, can you maybe talk about what areas of opportunity or what holes in the product portfolio that you see that could, over time, be an opportunity for some product news?
J. Patrick Doyle: I could, but I won't, I'm sorry. Yes, we think there are definitely opportunities out there, but we'd like to keep ourselves focused on those and not help our competitors focus on those more. So I think I'm going to pass on that one.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: And perhaps just one follow-up on that and just a different way to ask, the late night date part is something that's very -- it's a strong part of overall fast food. Obviously, pizza at late night seems to be a nice fit. How do you look at the late night business? Have you done any marketing around late night? Do any of your stores, are they open 24 hours? Do you see any opportunities for the late night date part?
Michael T. Lawton: Yes, I think there is opportunity there. We have not promoted it a lot kind of directly. Certainly, I know from personal experience that Domino's fueled me through college and in late night. And I think a lot of people are the same way and have the same experience. So we think there are opportunities there. I think we've got a couple of stores open 24 hours a day in the world. That's a pretty low percentage out of over 10,000 stores. So I think there are opportunities there. And to-date, we haven't gone after it terribly aggressively. And so I think that opportunity is there.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Paul Westra.
Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Just another question or 2 on the online ordering or digital ordering, and specifically in the U.S., and I was curious if you can comment on maybe on what the maybe market distribution of online ordering is? In other words, is there a lot of -- are there some markets perhaps well over 50% already in the U.S.? And maybe just talk about maybe what is often the tipping point to convert a market or maybe even a specific user? And just trying to ultimately gauge on the pace of online ordering, whether you expect the pace to pick up as you move from 40% to 50% as opposed to 30% to 40%?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, I think the -- so there are a couple of ways to answer that. First, there are certainly regional variations and market variations in terms of kind of the overall percentages. I think our highest stores today in the U.S., I think we've got a couple that are over 70% digital orders. And there are certainly some markets that are over 50%. But it's growing pretty well everywhere. And in fact, the markets that have had the lower percentages have actually been growing faster than those that had the higher percentages. And so overall, it's pretty strong everywhere. There aren't any markets anymore that are really significantly lower than kind of our overall averages. I guess the other thing I'd say is last year until 2012, I believe the industry was either 12% or 13% total digital orders. And so from a level of development standpoint in the category, you're still looking at the category being relatively lower from a -- or actually quite a bit lower from a development standpoint. So that's presumably up this year. I would guess now is going to be, for 2013, probably in the 14%, 15%, 16% range, something like that. But with us now being at 40%, clearly the vast majority of that overall category sales are coming from us and Papa John's and Pizza Hut. And that continues to be why we're very excited about it because even though it's a -- getting to be a very large part of our business, the overall category development is still relatively low. And so that's why we're pretty confident it can be a continued driver of growth for us. The other thing I'd say is that our corporate stores, because they were all on earlier than our franchise stores, and we had the whole platform up and running, our corporate stores are pretty significantly higher on their overall mix than our franchise system at this point. So lots of reasons that we continue to be very optimistic. I think the most important one, though, is looking at that overall category development. It's still pretty low. And our expectation is that's just going to keep growing over time. And as the majority of that is going to us and Papa John's and Pizza Hut, it's part of what gives us confidence about the future.
Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then just maybe just one other question on that. And once customers do start ordering online, it's obviously safe to assume that 100% of their ongoing purchasers have gone online, then?
J. Patrick Doyle: Actually, it's not. There actually is some mix, which is, I would tell you, is a little bit surprising. First of all, I'll remind you about 10% or just under 10% of our orders are walk-in customers. So right now, if you look at our overall business, you're looking at about 50% of people calling on the phone, about 40% accessing the brand ordering digitally and about 10% walking into the store to order. And there is some mixing on that. Some people order digitally and then they'll walk into the store or they'll pick up the phone and call. It may be different people within the same household who are ordering off of the same account, who are accessing it differently. But no, there actually is some mix on that.
Operator: There are no further questions.
J. Patrick Doyle: Well, thank you, everybody. All in all, I think the third quarter was yet again very solid. I'd like to thank our great franchisees and team members for all their efforts and very effective results and our shareholders for their continued support. I look forward to seeing many of you in January for our annual Investor Day in conjunction with the ICR Conference in Florida. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Tanisha, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 Financial Results Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Lynn Liddle, you may begin your conference.
Lynn M. Liddle: Great. Thank you, Tanisha, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. We did file our 10-Q this morning, so any additional details you can find there. And of course, included in that is our Safe Harbor statement for any forward-looking statements that we had made in there or we will make today in this call. I'd also like to remind members of the media to be in listen-only mode since this is primarily a call for investors. We expect to keep it fairly short today to less than 1 hour. We have some prepared remarks, and we will follow that with the Q&A. And with us today, we have our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lawton; and our CEO, Patrick Doyle. And we'll begin with some prepared comments from Mike.
Michael T. Lawton: Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. This quarter, our momentum continued as we posted strong same-store sales results in both our domestic and international businesses. Our international division opened a significant number of new stores, and our EPS grew 21.3% over the prior year. I'll start my review of the quarter by looking at our system-wide sales, also known as global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide. Global retail sales grew 10.4%, when excluding the impact of foreign currency. When we include the impact of foreign currency in the quarter, global retail sales grew by 9.3%. The drivers of this growth included domestic same-store sales, which rose 6.7% in the quarter, lapping a positive 1.7% in the second quarter of 2012. This was comprised of franchisee same-store sales, which were up 6.8%, and company-owned stores, which were up 5.7%. We opened at 9 net stores domestically in the quarter, consisting of 20 store openings and 11 closures. As we've mentioned previously, we expect to see modestly positive domestic store openings for the full year. Our international division had another solid quarter as same-store sales grew 5.8%, lapping a strong prior year quarter increase of 5.7%. Our international division grew by 101 stores this quarter, made up of 116 store openings and 15 closures. Turning to revenues. Our total revenues were up $37.9 million, or 10.1% from the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily a result of 2 factors: First, higher supply chain revenues resulting from increased volumes from higher order counts, a change in the mix of products sold per order and an increase in commodity prices. And second, higher domestic and international royalty revenues due to same-store sales growth and international store count growth. Moving on to our operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, our consolidated operating margin for the quarter was essentially flat at 30.4%, compared to 30.5% in the prior year quarter. Some of the related activity that occurred during the quarter included the following: Company-owned store operating margins decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues due to higher food cost, which were partially offset by higher volumes that leveraged labor and occupancy cost. Our supply chain margin percentage increased slightly from 10.8% to 11.1% due to the positive impact of product mix and higher volumes, offset in part by an increase in commodity cost. The average cheese block price in the second quarter was $1.77 per pound versus $1.52 last year, which contributed to a 3.9% increase in our overall market basket during the quarter. As a reminder, food commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar markup to our franchisees. Therefore, higher cheese prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, negatively impact our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues. Overall, we expect a commodity increase of 2% to 3% in 2013, which we believe will be manageable in the overall context of our business. Currency exchange rates have been slightly negative for us due to the dollar strengthening against most currencies, and could become a stronger headwind if the dollar remains at current levels. Turning to G&A expenses. G&A increased by $3.3 million or 6.8% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher variable performance based and noncash compensation expense, as well as investments in the international and technology areas of our business. We have previously indicated that we estimate our full year G&A to increase an additional $9 million to $13 million over 2012, and at the current time, we expect to be at the high end of that range. This is due to planned investments to expand our international support team, e-commerce and technology support, and an increase in noncash compensation expense. Also, note that we charge franchisees for providing e-commerce and technology support, and we expect to have increased revenues of $1.5 million to $2 million in 2013 related to these services to partially offset the cost increases. Keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down by, among other things, our performance versus plan as that affects variable performance based compensation expense, as well as the timing of hiring of the new team members. Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 37.7% in the quarter. We continue to expect that 37.5% to 38.5% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our second quarter net income was up $5.2 million or 18.4%. This increase was primarily driven by higher domestic and international same-store sales, international store growth and higher supply chain profit. Our second quarter diluted EPS was $0.57, which is a $0.10 or 21.3% increase from the 47% EPS in the second quarter of last year. Here's how that $0.10 difference breaks down: Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.085, and our lower diluted share count, primarily due to share repurchases, benefited us by $0.015. Now turning to our use of cash. During the second quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 655,000 shares for $38 million or an average price of $58.05 per share. We also returned over $11 million to our shareholders as part of our $0.20 per share dividend that was declared in the first quarter, and we ended the quarter with 48 -- $40.8 million of unrestricted cash. I'd also like to point out that subsequent to the quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 189,000 shares for $10.9 million. In closing, we're pleased with the results this quarter as we continue to grow our business and drive strong EPS growth. We are committed to continue to drive improved results and return value to our shareholders. Thanks for your time today, and now I'll turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to report another great quarter with excellent same-store sales growth in the U.S. and overseas, strong supply chain volumes, continued store growth and a healthy increase in earnings. Our brand continues to evolve and improve, and we're now about how we connect with consumers, leverage technology and deliver a great product for a good value to customers worldwide. As an example of this, in the U.S. this quarter, we posted strong sales, despite the fact that we didn't feature a new product. We did promote our Handmade Pan Pizza, continuing the momentum from its fourth quarter launch. While we were not lapping our toughest comps of last year, we're still pleased with the excellent domestic results in the quarter. As we've discussed before, we've got a new base of consumers and sales volume, backed by quality products, such as our new Pan Pizza, value offerings for consumers and great advertising and digital marketing. We've developed a bigger brand message around transparency and consumer engagement that we believe is carrying us to a different place. We believe this is part of why we don't need constant new pizza news or limited-time products to drive our business. We continue to be pleased with the positive traffic we're seeing, an indicator we monitor very closely. Our digital platform and Handmade Pan Pizza were both a big part of what drove this traffic. We were also able to hold our ticket fairly steady. We also continued to see some positive signs of store growth in the U.S. And in fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we added a net 31 domestic units. We've got a top-notch team focused on store growth and store image, and all new stores built in the U.S. will carry this new store design rolled out last September, which is getting early positive customer reviews. We are also very pleased with the results in our international business, which continues its unprecedented track record of sales growth and robust store expansion. We again saw broad strengths among both developing and mature economies. The strength was due to the basics that we've been proven out over in country after country, offer great products at a good value and with excellent service. Our international business have been doing a great job of producing positive results now for 78 straight quarters. A few highlights include South Korea where great value promotions and a strong focus on driving volumes through digital channels paid off with double digit sales increases. And Brazil, where improved operations and better pricing have resulted in a strong quarter for them. And in Canada, we've seen some good results from the release of the Handmade Pan Pizza. Second quarter also brought more news on our commitment to staying on the cutting edge of technology and innovation with the launch of the Domino's Pizza app for Windows Phone 8. In a first for a Domino's mobile app, the Windows Phone release has voice capabilities. The app also takes advantage of the unique Windows Phone operating system by allowing customers to pin their current order directly to their start screen, allowing direct access to track an order using Domino's Tracker. Just like our iPhone, Android and Kindle Fire apps, Windows Phone 8 users will be able to get Domino's full national menu, do a coupon search and find their local store. The app is getting very good reviews from customers. So we are proud to say that we now have an app for 95% of the smartphones sold in the U.S. Our focus on technology and consumer access via digital ordering continues to give us an edge over our competition as we lead our pizza delivery competitors in digital ordering market share, particularly versus the smaller players that continue to lag behind. Even if the regionals catch up to the level of technology we currently offer, we're already several years ahead of them and expect to keep pushing to lead the industry on technological innovation. Lastly, we believe it's our strong free cash flow and the deployment of that cash to benefit shareholders that's helped to drive our share price. We produced over $2 million a week in free cash flow on average in the first half of the year, and we used that cash on both a recently established quarterly dividend and share repurchases. And we will, of course, continue to be open and flexible in the way we deploy cash to best benefit shareholders. So in conclusion, I want to congratulate our team on a great first half of the year. We're seeing good momentum, and I couldn't be happier with our performance. Operator, I'm now ready for questions. Operator?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes, I wanted to just follow-up. You mentioned, first off, that the ticket was fairly steady in the quarter. Can you help us understand that a little better by just breaking out the 6.7% same-store sales between transactions and ticket? And I know you don't do it quantitatively, but can you at least help us with whether transactions was higher than the same-store sales and ticket lower from value-oriented promotions, or was ticket also up in the quarter?
J. Patrick Doyle: No, it was all orders. It was all orders for the quarter. In fact, even a little bit more orders. I think ticket was slightly negative for the quarter.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then labor, actually, the one of the surprises for me is that you only generated 10 basis points of labor leverage in the quarter, despite the 6.7% same-store sales and that's well below what you had been doing the last several years worth of quarters. Why not more leverage on labor in this particular period?
J. Patrick Doyle: I mean, we're continuing to work on that. I think the numbers have even seen pretty good steady increase there. I think, as we continue to focus on kind of improving service and all those things, it's always about hitting that balance. I would have liked to have seen a little bit more in the quarter in terms of the labor line, but it's certainly something we're focused on. So I don't think it's more than that. It's just pure execution, and we could have used just a little bit more off that line, as you said.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then maybe lastly, any update on your appetite for taking debt leverage up a little bit within your existing facility to enhance shareholder returns?
J. Patrick Doyle: I think that the answer is we're in the range that we've kind of talked about before, kind of 3 to 6x leverage is where we think our weighted average cost of capital is kind of optimized. We are essentially in the middle of that range right now, so we look at it. But right now, I think we feel pretty good about where we are.
Operator: And your next question comes from line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A couple of questions. One, I know you don't give too much granularity in terms of comp sequentially or whatnot. But I'm just wondering if you can give some qualitative color because it does seem like, as an industry, things are doing okay at the start of the quarter, and then maybe there was somewhat of a pause or deceleration, the June and into July time frame. Just wondering if you could talk about kind of the trend line that you're seeing, and how much benefit you think you're getting from kind of greater value focus?
J. Patrick Doyle: I mean, the value focus has been very consistent. I mean, we've been talking about really the same price points for a while, and it's clearly continued to work for us. And as I emphasized, I think the great learning for us and something we're very excited about is that we are able to do this without this kind of quarterly or monthly new product launches coming to support that. I mean, we just think we're in a very, very different place with our customer base than we have been in the past. And I mean, we're going to continue to have new product launches, but what we think is important is that we're driving these results with bigger individual launches that are meaningfully changing consumers' views about the quality of Domino's Pizza, as opposed to simply creating news for news' sake. And so we see this kind of building on itself. And as we bring new customers in, maybe with the Pan Pizza or through the digital side, they have a strong experience with kind of the core of the brands, as opposed to simply trying something that is new and they like it or not and then maybe don't come back after that. In terms of the quarter itself and how that's made-up, I mean, we don't get into kind of breaking out the quarter. All I can tell you is that 6.7%. And as I said that all being traffic, the answer is it was a really strong quarter, and I'm really happy with it. But I'm not going to break it apart more than that.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Absolutely. And then the online ordering. Obviously, it seems to be a huge driver. So I was just wondering, I think you've told us it's 35% to 40%. If I remember correctly, it's increased 5 percentage points per year over each of the last 5 years. So I'm just wondering, if it does drive a higher average check and drives higher margin, it seems like you'd want that to grow as fast. I'm more than wondering where you think that ultimately stops. Can it keep growing 5% per year? And is there anything you can do other than advertise it to incentivize people to use it even -- I mean it just seems like that's the desired end game. Is there a way to incentive people to use it via discounting or otherwise to kind of build even faster, or do we think we're close to a certain level that is not going to go above 50% or whatever it might be?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, I certainly think that we'll see it above 50% out into the future. We've got 3 or 4 countries that are now at that level. Our corporate stores in the U.S. were on online ordering, all of the stores about a year or so earlier than our franchise stores and they continue to run nicely ahead of the overall franchise system on digital ordering. And so I don't see any reason why we're not going to be able to get of this number north of 50% over time. And clearly, from our perspective, based on all the reasons, Jeff, you just said, around ticket and order profitability and customer satisfaction, the faster we can push that, the better. So we continue to invest in that area. The one thing I would say is you'd mentioned the 35% to 40% range. That's still the right answer. To give you a little bit of color, we tend to get gains on the that in the fall and winter, and then it tends to go a little bit flat in the summer each year. So we're still up kind of that 5% year-over-year, but it's an interesting pattern. When people head back indoors, we tend to see the growth in the digital mix, and when they go back outdoors in the summer, it tends to kind of flatten out for a bit during the summer. And so probably the answer is we stay in this range kind of through the summer, and then hopefully, we continue to see it move up. So that's the short answer. We're continuing to focus very hard on it. It's why we launched the Windows 8 platform, the app this quarter. And you're going to continue to see a lot of innovation from us in this area.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And just lastly, on the international side. Obviously, it's hard to find anything to question about those results of 78 straight quarters. And you talked about markets that are surprise exceeding expectations. But the fact that most of your peers are having a tough time posting with like modest positive comps and you're doing these mid-single digits. Are there any markets that you're seeing that are seeing the pain and suffering that others are facing? I know -- we had heard Germany might have had tougher times whether for Domino's or for the broader market. Just wondering if you'd size up seeing any signs of slowing trend, Germany or otherwise, outside the U.S.?
J. Patrick Doyle: Not in the material markets, no. I mean, they're always going to be quarters here and there that's a little bit, off but it is broad geographically and it's broad when you split it by kind of more developed economies and more developing economies. And so overall, it's awfully good. You mentioned Germany. Germany is still very early in its development. Sales growth has actually been pretty good there. What I think you may be referring to is Germany is owned by our master franchisee out of the U.K., and they gave a little bit of an earnings warning around it in terms of just the amount of resources they had to put into it to get it going. But from a pure sales perspective and sales growth perspective, it's still looking good. So it clearly -- it's working. I'm seeing the same numbers that's, obviously, you're looking at from some of our peers in the industry, and we feel awfully fortunate that we're continuing to drive these kinds of results. But there just are no really material pockets of weakness out there to speak to.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on your comments about the U.S. marketing. The numbers have been outstanding, and clearly, you were in a sweet groove or sweet mode. But I guess I'm curious that you're describing it as kind of a material change from the product news and maybe some of the pricing news of the past. I don't perceive as being that dramatically different, so could you just talk a little bit more about that?
J. Patrick Doyle: Well, the first thing you said from kind of the pricing, I'll hit that. I mean, the pricing has been fundamentally the same for a few years now. And so we're not bringing new news on the pricing front. We've got something that's clearly been working. It's been connecting with the consumers. And so on that front, it's been working. If there was news in the second quarter around the -- our Handmade Pan Pizza, it was just a different way of talking about it, which was the fact that this brand that is known for speed had actually sacrificed a little bit of speed to make a higher quality product. But we were still talking about a product that had launched 6 or 9 months before, and continued to drive very strong results from it. And first quarter was really the same thing. We were talking about the 2 mediums for $5.99 and it worked. So I guess the answer is, Joe, I think what's different, and I guess I'd say not that different for the last 3 or 4 years since kind of our brand relaunch, but really previous to that. And we've been watching it very, very carefully. We've got a strong pipeline of new products that we can still use as we move forward. But what we've been finding is very effective is talking about the things that are differentiating the brands on an ongoing basis in the minds of the consumer, as opposed to just hitting them with a lot of the specific new news items in any given quarter. And overall, it's worked.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And are the national media -- I know you shifted more to national media effective January, is there any lumpiness in the year-over-year advertising rates that we should think about?
J. Patrick Doyle: No, not materially. No. No.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I was struck by your U.S. numbers versus what the industry has been experiencing, specifically McDonald's has talked very specifically about real retrenchment in the consumer. And I guess my question therefore is, Patrick, do you have a view on -- is it the pizza category or how much of what you're seeing is experienced in the category in general versus idiosyncratic to you? Do you have either qualitative, or do you actually have numbers on where you think the pizza category growth was in the second quarter?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. Our best guess, John, is that the category is flattish to maybe up. This is mostly share gains that we're seeing right now. And those numbers are, I think, as you know, they're not perfect on kind of the category. But that's our best sense is that we're kind of in that range. And I guess what I would say is our overall take on the consumer is that the consumer is continuing to slowly get better. There's -- it is still more of a headwind than a tailwind for us. You probably heard me say it many times, but the best driver, best indicator from an economic standpoint of growth for us is employment levels more than anything else. Employed people buy more pizza than unemployed people. And so you're seeing that slowly getting better. But I think that's leading to a category that's not moving a lot right now. And so really, I mean, we're feeling pretty fortunate, but it appears that it is mostly share gains for us right now.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And just a follow-up on that, is the share gains -- for many quarters it's been versus the regionals and independents, is the shift now becoming that you believe your share shift is now coming maybe at the expense of your 2 or 3 other largest competitors? Has that changed?
J. Patrick Doyle: I think the broad dynamic is still going to be more from smaller players and regionals. We haven't seen Papa John's number yet for the second quarter, Pizza Hut has released and they were a little bit a negative. I think they've been a little bit negative for a couple of quarters in a row now. But overall, I think the basic thesis is still intact, which is larger players are probably going to be growing a little bit better than the smaller players and the regionals, that's mostly as a result of technology. And there are some pretty special things that are going on with our brand and business right now that are causing us to grow a little faster even than our national peers. But overall, I think the basics of the thesis are intact, which is larger players are going to continue to take some share from the smaller players.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's great. And then just lastly, as it relates to a recapitalization event. You have an existing securitization. I think, previously, I had the sense that you were thinking more of adding to that, given the rate environment and you sort of -- it seems today that you are saying we're happy where we are. What has changed? I mean, perhaps, my perception was wrong, or is it really just the rate environment is shifting and now the attractiveness of adding leveraging just isn't as -- isn't there as it was maybe a couple of months ago?
Michael T. Lawton: As you know, I mean, interest rates have gone a little bit but they're still -- gone up a little, but they're still very, very attractive, and we will continue to assess -- whether this is something that we want to do. I don't think that Patrick was trying to say that there's no opportunity for us. It's just not something that we're planning on in the near term.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.
Michael Tamas - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. I was just wondering, can you talk about G&A over the next 18 months? I know you said you'd be at the high end of the range for this year. What opportunities are there for maybe that not to be at the high end of the range? And then, any initial thoughts on '14, and maybe any investments or costs that don't repeat next year that you can kind of call out for us?
Michael T. Lawton: I don't think there's a lot of opportunity that we won't be at the high end. We're -- we've been making -- one of the things that has an impact on the G&A is the rate and pace at which we are able to attract the right people that we wanted to add into international and into our IT group. So over the last 18 months or so, we've been trying to add people and it came at a slower rate than we had wanted. We have filled many of those positions now, so we've got a pretty good idea of what we're going to spend on those. We really have not figured out where for sure we're going to be in 2014, so it's a little early to comment on that. At our Investor Day in January, I'm sure that we'll be giving you more information.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I guess that the only thing I'd add to that is, fundamentally, the investments we're making are working. You look at the investments we're making in people and the international side of the business, as well as in the technology side of the business, they're clearly driving results. And so it's not -- we're not trying to figure out how to scale that back. If we're getting a good return on those investments, we're going to continue to make them.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Can you comment on the online ordering growth in the quarter? I think you gave us some metrics for 2012 a few months back. But is online -- I'm sure online orders are probably growing quicker than the comp, but any particular data would be great?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. Mitch, I think the answer is we're still in that kind of 5% of mix up year-over-year. And the color I was giving before is the way that chart kind of looks for us, and we track it fairly, fairly obsessively. The answer is you get an increase in the fall and into the winter, and then it kind of flattens out spring and summer, and then you get an increase again in the fall and the winter. Year-over-year, that means you're continuing to get kind of that 5% mix growth that we've talked about before and we're continuing to see that. We'd love to drive it even faster, and that's why you continue to see some investments from us there. But that's kind of the rate and pace of growth on that.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And separately, just with carryout. It's about 40% of your sales, if you can confirm that number. And with the new -- and I believe carryout is growing quicker than the overall pizza delivery category if you can maybe comment on some of the dynamics behind that? And if this new store design, which you're now building, is changing the mix of carryout or delivery, or any interesting dynamics to point out from the new store prototype that you're developing?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. So first off, the 40% is kind of orders. Sales are a little bit lower than that because the ticket's a bit lower on carryout. So you're more in the 1/3 to 35% range of sales. Third -- I mean 1/3 on sales and you're more high 30s to 40% on orders. And we've still got just over what 100, I think, of the newly reimaged stores. And so we're still kind of reading that, but we like what we're seeing. Clearly, the biggest change on that is a better kind of carryout experience, in-store experience for our customers without any sacrifice on our efficiency around the delivery side of the business. In terms of the overall dynamics, I -- there was a point over the last few years -- our business, if you go back kind of 10 or 15 years, carryout has clearly become a bigger part of our business over kind of a long-term trend. And there was a little more weakness on the delivery side of the business back a few years ago than kind of the overall. But right now, I think from an overall category perspective, it's pretty flat plus or minus a bit in both of those areas right now. I don't think, from a category perspective, that there's a lot of movement on either side.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And my last question is for Mike. Just on the balance sheet, can you give us where the debt -- net debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands in terms of how you calculate it? And I believe that under 4.5x, don't you -- you don't need to make principal payments and maybe if you can just go through those dynamics, I think you're kind of close to that level. And how much cash you'll save once you hit that trigger?
Michael T. Lawton: Okay. The way that, that is calculated, it takes into -- assumes that we would actually draw upon the VFN. So you add about 0.10 of leverage compared to just looking at the debt-to-EBITDA off the balance sheet. So we are currently in the 4s -- roughly the 4.6, 4.7 range, depending on how you round. We have to get under 4.5, which could happen as early as the fourth quarter of this year, and probably a little more likely, it could be in the first quarter of next year. And when we get to that, you're looking at a $26 million a year cash savings, roughly.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess, at this point, just the remaining question for me is on your supply chain business which is obviously having a great first half of the year. I mean, do you just attribute that to product mix? I mean, things like Pan and your continued success with the 2 mediums, or is there something else that's kind of going on in that business to allow such strong growth to continue in the future?
J. Patrick Doyle: The vast majority of what's going on in the first half of the year has to do with the order count and the mix that we have. You may recall that last year, in the first half of the year, some of what we were doing was promoting side items, primarily Stuffed Cheesy Bread and Parmesan Bread Bites, which was really good for franchisee profitability, but really wasn't very good for our commissary. It would be one way to describe it. This year, Pan Pizza is helping us. I would also say that the operational metrics in the commissary have been very good. Even if we -- even as we pushed up our volumes significantly, they've done a really good job of maintaining cost. So we haven't been hurt at all as they pushed the volumes up.
Michael T. Lawton: John, the only thing that I was going to say is the other thing kind of the flip side to that is with the volume growth. Franchise profitability, store level profitability continues to improve year-over-year. And that's a really big positive. So I think the biggest thing driving supply chain, other than they're doing a very nice job of running it, the team running it, is we're just getting a lot of order growth and that volume gets us some nice leverage on that. But flip side is the franchisee profitability continues to improve, and that's why you're seeing that kind of modest net store growth domestically that we've been talking about for a while.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line Alvin Concepcion with Citi.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I was just wondering, the quarter had unusually wet weather domestically. Did this have any impact on your results at all?
J. Patrick Doyle: No.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. And you talked about a strong pipeline of products coming up. I know you can't say much. But are these pretty broad innovations across your menu, or would you expect them to be more focused on side items to help drive ticket? And will those mostly be coming this year, or are you sort of saving it for next year?
J. Patrick Doyle: No. I mean, look the answer is as we have kind of slowed the pace of introductions, it means that our R&D team has the chance to work on things that we think are going to be meaningful. And I'm going to get into kind of specifics on launches and all that. I think the real take away from that shouldn't be is there something really near-term coming. I think the takeaway on that should be when you're spreading out the pace of these, it means that the R&D team, as opposed to coming up with 5 or 6 products a year, is working on a couple maybe a year that we hope are going to materially improve the overall experience for customers. And frankly, when you're not launching 1 or 2 a quarter, it takes a little bit of the pressure off on having just so many in that pipeline.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then just one more for me. You talked about domestic company restaurant margins declining, and it sounds like it's mostly due to higher commodity costs. But as you look towards the rest of the year, I believe you mentioned commodity costs are going to be manageable, and you're working on improving your labor on leverage. So would you expect margins to improve year-over-year from these levels for the rest of the year?
J. Patrick Doyle: So yes. First of all, the answer on margins. From the corporate stores in the second quarter, it was about food, it was about commodities. And so definitely felt that a little bit in the second quarter. We do expect that that's going to be a little more modest through the balance of the year. You didn't ask this specifically, but I'll add it. The offset to that is exchange rates, as they stand today, are looking, right now, worse for the balance of the year than in the first half of the year. If we stay in the range that we're in today, and consensus is kind of in that range. That's going to be a little bit of a negative offset in the second half of the year. So commodities, we expect to ease a bit. And if things stay where they are right now, FX probably goes the other way.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory Group.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: I wanted to ask about the remodels. Are you doing anything on the back of the house in terms -- on the remodel side, or all the remodels really happening on the front of the house?
J. Patrick Doyle: The focus is on the front of the house, and there are really kind of a couple of different versions, I guess, of how we do it. But front of the house is certainly the focus. We're not changing -- there aren't like specific equipment changes back of the house or anything like that. Our cooking platform remains pretty straightforward. We got big ovens back there, and I wouldn't anticipate a change in that. Then you get into a question of is it a relocation, is it a reimage and are they completely taking everything out, and some of that just depends on the age of the back of the store. If the back of the store is looking good, then you may be able to just do the lobby and it looks good. But as you are opening it up, if the back of the store is particularly old, it means the customers are going to see that. And so I think the answer is there's been a little bit of a mix on that in the early reimages.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Great. And then can you give us an update on where you stand with China, and the initiatives to move forward there?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, I mean, it's continuing to proceed. It's still relatively small. We like the results we're getting. We're getting nice same-store sales growth in China. It's -- it is -- so it's something that's continuing to progress. And obviously, given the size of the opportunity, it's something we're going to continue to focus on. Still not a big driver of results yet, as the base that we're growing from is still relatively small.
Operator: And your next question comes from line of Stephen Anderson with Miller Tabak.
Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Just one quick question on the newer stores that you have open, and I don't know if you have any metrics to compare the new store format versus the older stores. And what kind of a comp lift you're seeing from comparable locations? What kind of the change you're seeing in mix?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I mean, it’s still too early to kind of get into specifics around that. That's why we're kind of watching that. I mean, obviously, I said I think in my prepared remarks that the customer reaction to it is positive. But it's still little early on with the store base, the store counts that we've got reimaged to kind of get into specifics around that.
Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Now would you say with those stores, you are trying to aim for the new fast casual pizza entrance because that's a category that's seen a lot of growth in the last couple of years?
J. Patrick Doyle: We want to give our customers a better in-store and carryout experience, and I don't know that it's specifically geared towards anybody, it's just -- other than our customers. I mean, we're doing what our customers are leading us to do, and they want a better looking store. They want to see the stores opened up so that they can see the food prepared, and that's what's driving it more than kind of any specific reaction to competition.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Smith with Feltl and Company.
Unknown Analyst: Cher [ph] on for Mark Smith. Just one quick question. Can you talk about the health of your domestic franchisees, in particular, their ability to reinvest in stores and their capital for growth?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, so their -- I mean, their cash flow continues to improve. I think, as I mentioned, we are continuing to see their cash flow per store numbers get better, that's going to be kind of a -- what I think, we're into a fifth year of that trend. And so that's good news. The answer is the credit markets for larger franchisees, for those who may be borrowing $1 million or more, those markets are very attractive right now. For smaller players they're still not where it needs to be in terms of the credit markets opening back up. Now at some level, if you're talking about a 1 or 2 store franchisee, if their sales are good enough and their cash flows are continuing to progress, they're going to be able to potentially do it out of cash flow, and may not need to tap into those markets. But overall, the answer is credit markets are very attractive for those looking to borrow at a significant level, and they're still relatively restricted for those looking for smaller amounts of debt.
Operator: And there are no further questions.
J. Patrick Doyle: All right. Listen, I appreciate everybody's interest, and look forward to sharing third quarter results with you here in a couple of months. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: And this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Tanisha, and I'll be your conference operator for today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the quarter 1 financial results earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Liddle, you may begin your conference.
Lynn M. Liddle: Thanks, Tanisha, and thank you, everybody, for joining us for our first quarter results conference call. We're excited to be here. And with me today, I have Patrick Doyle, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer, both of whom will speak today. As always, we ask our friends from the media to remain in a listen-only mode today. And also, I direct all of your attention to our 8-K, where we have our Safe Harbor statement listed in the event that we make any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike, who will start with some prepared comments.
Michael T. Lawton: Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered solid results for our shareholders during the quarter. Our international and domestic divisions posted strong same-store sales growth. Our international division opened a significant number of new stores, and adjusted EPS grew 25% over the prior year. So now let's go through the results for the first quarter, and I'll start by looking at our systemwide sales. Global retail sales, and those are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 10.5% when excluding the impact of foreign currency. When we include the impact of foreign currency in the quarter, our global retail sales grew by 9.4%. The drivers of this growth included domestic same-store sales, which rose 6.2% in the quarter, lapping a positive 2% in the first quarter of 2012. This was comprised of franchise same-store sales, which grew 6.3%; and company-owned stores, which were up 5.0%. These increases were driven by our continued consumer offering of higher quality food and value pricing and increased advertising supporting Q1 promotions. We also attribute approximately 1% of the same-store sales growth to the benefit of New Year's Eve and New Year's Day falling in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, as the dates of these holidays did not fall in the first quarter of 2012. Although we don't provide specifics of order count and ticket for competitive reasons, we did drive strong order count again in the quarter. Value pricing, combined with the many other efforts we made to build our business in the quarter, can be a strong catalyst for order count but can also lower tickets slightly, as it did in the case of Q1. Clearly, the overall effect for us was a positive one. We closed 5 net stores domestically in the quarter, consisting of 10 store openings and 15 closures. As we mentioned previously, we expect to see modest positive domestic store openings for the full year. Our international division had another solid quarter as same-store sales grew 6.5%, lapping a strong 4.7% increase in the first quarter of 2012. International also benefited in the range of 1% from New Year's Eve and New Year's Day falling in the first quarter of 2013. Our international division grew by 80 stores this quarter, made up of 85 store openings and 5 closures. Turning to revenues. Our total revenues were up $33 million or 8.6% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of 3 factors. First, higher supply-chain revenues resulting from increased volumes from higher-order counts, a change in the mix of products sold per order and an increase in commodity prices. Second, higher domestic and international royalty revenues due to same-store sales growth and international store count growth. And finally, we contracted a third-party to manage our gift card program, which entailed the third-party assuming the majority of our gift card liability for a small fee. As a result, we reduced our gift card liability by $2.6 million, which was booked as revenue, and reimbursed the system's advertising fund $1.8 million for its historical cost of the program. We expect future impacts to revenue and G&A expense from this program to be minimal. Moving on to our operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, our consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased by 1.3%; from 29.8% to 31.1%. This change was especially driven by 3 factors. First, a change in our mix of revenues positively impacted our operating margin as we now have more franchise revenues from royalty, which have no cost of sales, as well as the change in our gift card program. Second, company-owned store operating margins increased as a percentage of revenues from the prior quarter due to higher volumes, which leveraged labor and occupancy cost. This was slightly offset by higher food cost. Third, our supply chain margin percentage increased slightly from 10.6% to 11.3% due to the positive impact of product mix and higher volumes, offset by an increase in the commodity cost. The average cheese block price in the first quarter was $1.67 per pound versus $1.52 last year, which led to a 5 -- contributed to a 2.5% increase in our overall market basket from the quarter. As a reminder, food commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar markup to our franchisees. Therefore, the higher cheese prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. It do, however -- it did, however, negatively impact our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues. Overall, we continue to expect a commodity increase of 3% to 4% in 2013, which we will believe will be manageable in the overall context of our business. Turning to G&A expenses. G&A increased by $6.5 million or 13.6% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was primarily due to the following factors: variable performance-based compensation expense and investments in the international technology areas of our business, increase in noncash comp expense, and the onetime reimbursement we made to our systems advertising fund related to their support of our gift card program, as I mentioned a moment ago. As we have previously indicated, we estimate our full year G&A to increase an additional $9 million to $13 million over 2012 due to planned investments to expand our international support team, e-commerce and technological support and the increase in noncash compensation. Also note that we charge franchisees for providing e-commerce and technological support. And we expect to have increased revenues of $1.5 million to $2 million in 2013 related to these services to partially offset these cost increases. Keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down by, among other things, our performance versus plan as it affects variable performance-based compensation, as well as the timing of hiring of team members. Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 37.0% for the quarter. While this rate was slightly under our normal range, we continue to expect that 37.5% to 38.5% will be our effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our first quarter net income was up $13.7 million or 66%. When you remove $7.4 million of items affecting comparability, primarily expenses related to the recapitalization from the first quarter of 2012, net income was up $6.3 million or 22.3%. This increase was primarily driven by higher domestic and international same-store sales, international store growth and higher company-owned store and supply chain margins. Our first quarter diluted EPS was $0.59. There are no significant items that affected comparability during the quarter. So as reported, EPS was the same as adjusted. The $0.59 is a $0.12 or 25% increase from the $0.47 as adjusted EPS in the first quarter of last year. Here's how that $0.12 difference breaks down. Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.09. Our lower diluted share count, primarily due to our stock repurchases, benefited us by about $0.015, and our lower interest expense and slightly lower tax rate benefited us by another $0.015. During the first quarter, we generated $42.6 million of free cash flow, which we used to make scheduled principal payments on our debt and repurchase and retire shares. We repurchased and retired approximately 363,000 shares for $18 million at an average price of $49.65 per share. We ended the quarter with $75 million unrestricted cash. In closing, we are pleased with the results for the quarter. We will continue to focus on improving our operational performance, rolling our global store base and utilizing our free cash flow to drive shareholder value. Thank you for your time today. And I will turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We're off to a great start for 2013, as you can see from the results we reported this morning. They speak not only to the strengths of our franchise business model and the consistency it can produce but also to the power of our brands, our very strong operators, our compelling technology and our quality food at a good price. In the domestic business, we drove solid traffic despite the fact that we were not on air with a new specific product. Instead, we featured a variety of great food at the same great value we've offered for some time now, which our customers responded to. And value is something that pizza is known for. For under $25, including a tip for delivery, you can feed a family of 4 with pizza, something that we feel keeps our category strong in an uncertain economy versus other segments of the restaurant industry. Our value offerings were backed up by really strong advertising during the first quarter, which included high-scoring ads that resonated well with our customers. And while we did not promote our new Handmade Pan Pizza on TV in the first quarter, we know that this high-quality, fresh not frozen dough product continued to be popular among our existing customers as well as new ones. It's a product that continues to perform well. Now that we have this additional pizza platform, it gives us room to grow in a new cross-segment and take some share, which we recently have been taking from regional chains and independents. Strong sales and traffic were the highlights for our domestic results in the first quarter, while continued sales strength and robust store openings were clearly the highlights for our international business. You may have seen that our U.K. master franchisee posted very strong results in the first quarter, not only in the U.K., but also in Ireland, and they posted some encouraging results in Germany and Switzerland as well. South Korea, Turkey and Brazil also experienced great results in the quarter, demonstrating the broad geographic strengths of our brand and its resilience in a variety of economic climates. We also drove great store growth this quarter. One example was Japan, where they hit the 250-store milestone. While Japan is a developed market economically, it's not a mature pizza market yet. So we see more potential for growth there. We like our mix of both developed and emerging economies. And we see excellent opportunities for sales and sales growth around the world, as delivered pizza remains a very underpenetrated segment. One opportunity we're proud to be developing worldwide is our innovation around online ordering and technology. Domestically, we continue to drive orders and sales from all of our digital platforms. We are also continually improving these sites with enhancements like card on file [ph], which is now available for online orders and will soon be available for all mobile orders as well. Digital ordering averaged over 35% of total sales in the quarter, and mobile ordering continues to be our fastest growing segment. Technological innovation continues to be an advantage in a number of our international markets as well. In Australia, they recently launched an app that allows customers to give stores real-time feedback. Customers can also see how their local store is rated by others and what the top 5 customer-rated stores in the country are. Japan recently launched an iPhone app, featuring the popular Japanese Vocaloid, which is a synthesized singing animated character popular in Japan. In the U.K., ordering through mobile devices is now over 1/4 of all orders, with over 60% of delivered sales coming through digital channels. Clearly, digital ordering is where the pizza industry is going, not just in the U.S., but worldwide. As Mike noted in his comments, even though we now have a regular dividend, we still have the flexibility to deploy free cash flow for share repurchases. We also deployed cash for a scheduled principal payment on our now 1-year old debt facility. We recognize that interest rates have come down even lower than our current favorable rate since we refinanced last year. However, provisions of our debt structure make it unattractive to restructure our existing debt now or in the near term. In conclusion, our consistent results, our technological advantage and powerful global brand have resulted in a great start to the year. We're well-positioned for the year ahead with no plans to rest on our laurels. We intend to open more stores, offer compelling consumer promotions along with high-quality products, delivered with the service that we've been known for worldwide. We're focusing on technology and staying ahead on innovation, both in the U.S. and in many of our international markets. And as always, we are continuously making sure that we're also doing what we believe is best for the long-term strength of our company and our shareholders. With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for questions. Operator, I am ready for the first question.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: To check in [ph], you had mentioned in your past analysis that weather wasn't a major driver of your business. Now that the first quarter is under your belt, do you still feel that way? Or did the weather possibly helped the first quarter, given how extreme the shift was this year versus last year. Anything that fell out of the norms of your model?
J. Patrick Doyle: The answer is, it's possible that it's slightly helped, but -- kind of the inverse of what we said last year about the first quarter which was working against us and it's just -- the model says, it's just not enough to be material to the overall results. So, no, don't think weather was a factor.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And you mentioned no plans to refinance the debt because of the penalties that you'd incur. Are there any other options that you have available to you that you might be considering, maybe extending your leverage within the confines of the existing facility?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, we look at it. I think in the near term, probably no news on that front.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then one last one. The stock continues to move higher, inclusive of multiple expansion given how strong your fundamentals are. Is there a point where you stop buying back stock and look for other accretive ways to deploy the free cash flow?
J. Patrick Doyle: The answer is as it's always been. I mean, we're always going to look at what we think is going to -- can produce the best returns for our shareholders. And so we're always looking at every possible way of doing that. And so that's going to be driven by our analysis.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Bittner.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Patrick, Mike, congrats to you and your team on these excellent results once again. I want to actually ask about the supply chain business. You had a 20% increase in operating profit in that segment year-over-year. The volumes out of your domestic business were obviously up a lot less than that. So it seems though there's some type of operating leverage in that business as your volumes do increase. I mean, is that so? I mean, what type of contribution margin does incremental throughput come at in that business? Or is there something else that you're -- that happened in the quarter that got you that operating leverage in that segment?
Michael T. Lawton: Brian, you're right. There is some operating leverage there. But there's also a lot of what happened with mix because the margins on different products are not the same. And you look year-on-year last year with what we were doing with Stuffed Cheesy Bread and Parm Bread Bites and the fact that volumes were actually down a little bit as opposed to up. You look at that, this year, we have pan pizza. We have a different mix going through there. So there's a combination of factors at work.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: As we kind of go forward here, though, if you get volume upticks, I mean, you expect the profit growth of that segment to grow faster than volume growth, right?
Michael T. Lawton: Yes, we certainly get some leverage off the higher operating volume. But this -- yes, I think that it is fair to say that the margin that we had this quarter is probably up on the high side of what one should be expecting.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. On the technology side, are you still really in the learning phase when it comes to using this platform to actively drive incident rates and actively drive average check, whether it be one-on-one marketing or just interaction throughout the payment process? Or is this something that's much more active now, kind of transitioning away from education phase and starting to apply it?
J. Patrick Doyle: I think the answer, Brian, is probably somewhere in the middle of what you just laid out. I mean, there is still enormous learning that's taking place. We actually have the CMOs and the CIOs of our largest international markets downstairs. I was just meeting with them an hour ago. And a lot of the discussion, all of the discussion, is really around learning from around the world then -- and best practices. And I think there's still enormous learning and enormous leverage that's -- that we're going to get out of the digital platform. We're obviously -- we're doing great things with it. We continue to believe that it is a big reason why you're seeing share gains for the larger players versus the regionals and the independents. But there is clearly a lot to come on that front. I mean, our calendar going out a few years is pretty full with innovation that we think is going to continue to drive impact with customers.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Patrick, at the Analyst Day in January, you indicated in 2012 that your online orders in the U.S. were up about 27%. I was wondering if you can share that information here in the first quarter if that rate has sustained.
J. Patrick Doyle: I -- yes, I think it's -- I'm trying to find the numbers here, but, yes, it's clearly still growing double digits. And if you look back 4 or 5 years, the answer has been, kind of mix has been growing at about 5% a year; the overall mix of sales. We tend to see that ramp more in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter every year than during the spring and summer and early fall. It's kind of an interesting pattern that's -- not sure we entirely understand yet kind of what drives that. But yes, we're continuing to see the gains, the trajectory on growth continues to be kind of in that same range. And -- so I don't have the exact year-over-year number on it -- on growth, but it's staying at pretty much that same pace.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And at the Analyst Day, you -- it was brought out that the big 3 chains in the U.S. have about a 85% market share of online orders, and which is, obviously, dominating. As we look forward, how durable do you think that is, especially with technology becoming more and more accessible? Can you maybe give us a sense of, can this competitive advantage sustain on a long-term basis?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, we really think it can. I mean, we're investing very heavily in both people and capital, in technology. There are solutions for regionals and independent players out there, but they simply don't give the same experience to customers that they can get through our platform or frankly, through the platforms of Pizza Hut or Papa John's. And so, I've described it before, but while we believe -- and if you look at Google Play and iTunes and how things are rated, we do incredibly well versus our largest competitors, we think the bigger gap in technology is between the 3 of us and the regionals and independents. That continues to be true. And I think it's going to be something that's very difficult for them to overcome. There are -- they do have platform -- third-party platforms that they can access. But it's just not the same experience as you can get from us. So yes, we do think it's a serious competitive advantage. It's something that we're going to continue to invest in, to try to maintain and grow. I'm sure that some of them are going to do better things into the future, but I think it's tough for them to catch up with us.
Operator: Your next question from Joe Buckley of Bank of America.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a couple of questions on the advertising. So was the pickup in national advertising present through the entire quarter? Does that begin with the beginning of the year?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, I think so. I mean, there are going to be some weeks that are going to bounce around a little bit, but overall, the quarter had a good lift on GRPs versus last year.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then the pan pizza wasn't featured, but did you get pretty good carry-through from the fourth quarter launch and the walk-in [ph] support in the fourth quarter for the pan pizza?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, we sure did. We sure did. It is performing very, very well for us. And first quarter was a good test for us. What's -- you learn a lot on the strength of the product once you go off air. We were off air for the entire quarter. And now we're back on air with pan. But it performed very, very well for us through the first quarter. So couldn't be more pleased with that product.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And just one more, Patrick. You mentioned a 35% digital order mix, I believe. Was that for domestic?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I was talking about domestic. North of 35% of sales domestically and -- but it's a very comparable number in international as well with broad spreads market-to-market. There are markets that are over 50%. And there are still markets that are relatively early in their development and there are some that are still not offering online ordering. So -- those are relatively small. But yes, overall the average outside of the U.S. is about the same as the number inside the U.S.
Operator: Your next question from Alvin Concepcion with Citi.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Just another follow-up on the pan pizza. I think on the last call, you mentioned you're bringing in some new customers with it, but the demand was being driven mostly by existing customers. Was that still the case this quarter, particularly since you were off air? And if that was the case, as pan pizza is being advertised again on TV, have you seen that dynamic change at all?
J. Patrick Doyle: We can't get into the second quarter. But for the first quarter, yes, that was absolutely still the dynamic. It has really been about increased frequency, increased retention. And mostly, the dynamic has been customers of Domino's who have gone elsewhere when they wanted to buy pan pizza are now staying with us for those occasions. So it does bring in new customers, but it has not been bringing in new customers particularly out of line with what we typically see when we're on air with promotions. And so most of the growth has been in orders in fourth quarter and in this -- and in the first quarter have really been through higher frequency from existing Domino's customers.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Great. And then, are you looking to launch the pan pizza in other markets this year? And if so, what's the timing look for that?
J. Patrick Doyle: Not going to get into specifics on that one.
Operator: Your next question from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just first a follow-up on the advertising spend. Is that -- is the increase ratably equal across the quarters? Or will there be quarters where you've got heavier weights than you did based on the incremental spending versus a year ago?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, I don't know if I want to give our competition too much information on this front. But I guess what I would say is that first quarter was probably going to be a bigger increase overall than you'll see the balance of the year. But I'm not going to go into more than that, just for competitive reasons.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then -- this is a bit of a left field question. But given the increases in digital technology and online ordering, is there a catering opportunity for Domino's? School lunches, for example, some school system [indiscernible] sometimes get Domino's pizza for lunch. Is there an opportunity to nationally expand your ability to market to larger organizations or create national accounts where people can order and maybe online is sort of what can unlock that opportunity for you?
J. Patrick Doyle: We actually already do some national account business, which has been kind of an interesting little growth area. It's still relatively little. But the ability to deliver for a company function to the 50 or 60 or 70 locations for some event is something that we're pretty uniquely suited to do. And so I think the answer is, we've looked hard at catering. I don't know that people think about Domino's the way you often think about kind of catering. But we do think that there are things we are going to be able to do to make large orders easier for customers into the future, and digital clearly helps that. So more to come on that. I don't know that catering exactly the way that we all kind of think about catering will be a big area. But I think there are definitely things we can do to make larger orders easier for customers.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just, Mike, can you just -- I'm sorry, the G&A commentary I lost a little bit. Can you just recap, what is extraordinary this quarter about G&A? And I know there's some ongoing investments. So maybe you can just recap what's going to stay in the first quarter and what persists in the balance of the year?
Michael T. Lawton: The -- as I said, the main components are the fact that we've got an additional contribution to our marketing fund as a result of our redoing the way we handle gift cards. That was about $1.8 million. And in future quarters, that will not probably have a comparable number. Anything we do with gift cards going forward will be much smaller. We did have an increase in noncash comp versus last year. We will continue to see that throughout the balance of the year. We also had some higher variable comp because we did have a very good quarter. And that does have a tendency to move up and down. And then we also had significant amounts versus last year for -- we did have additional expenses for the investment we've been making in IT and international.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And that I presume goes through -- that's spread across the 4 quarters?
Michael T. Lawton: Yes.
Operator: Your next question from Mark Smith of Feltl and Company.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: First off, just as we look at the consumer spending environment through the quarter and customers maybe falling back early in the quarter, can you give us any insight into cadence of comps and whether you benefited from a value proposition early in the quarter?
J. Patrick Doyle: No, I'm not going to go into kind of breaking apart the quarter. Clearly, we have had strong order account growth. We're very aware of what's been going on in the rest of the restaurant industry, and particularly January, I think in a lot of the category looked a little bit slower. Clearly, our results were well above what most in the category were seeing. So it's a little harder for us to kind of pull it apart because happily, we kind of overperformed versus I think a lot of the industry. I think the answer is, consumers in many ways have cleaned up their balance sheets. I think they knew what was coming to a great extent with some of the changes on taxes. And our belief was, as we were watching our numbers coming in, that the impact was maybe more muted than what people had expected. But then we also started seeing results from the rest of the industry. And it certainly looked like there was some effect from that. So it's a little hard for us to say, since our numbers appeared to have been better than a lot of the category. But overall, my take is, customers have gotten a little more conservative about their balance sheets. That means that they're able to weather things a little bit better when there are changes. And I think they knew that the changes were coming. All of that said, we're a good value and we've continued to be a good value. Our offer was consistent with what we've done in the past. But we think that certainly continued to be strong for us in the first quarter and part of why we had a strong quarter overall.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay, great. And then, second, just as we look at competition, you said you continue to take share from regionals and independents. But as we look at more kind of niche specialty pizza players and the fast casual space, is there anything that makes you nervous or that you see changing in the pizza category?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, first, I have no idea what fast casual is in pizza. I mean, if you look at fast casual, largely it's defined as better quality, better-tasting product, and we think we have that. So we think that's part of why we've had strong growth over the last few years really since we relaunched our brand. There are a lot of people out there doing interesting things in the pizza category. We continue to watch all of those things. I will tell you that none of those are at a scale that you see any real effect. Some that have gotten a lot of attention have already closed a lot of stores. And we've seen that in some markets as well. So overall, the answer is, there are a lot of independents and regionals out there overall. We know that they have been losing share to the largest players. And so are some brands that are doing better and on their way up within that? Absolutely. But the net effect is -- that is, larger players have been taking share from the smaller players.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. One last question. Just as we look at the timing and getting some benefit from New Year's, any other holiday shifts that had an impact or that we should be watching through the remainder of the year?
J. Patrick Doyle: I don't think so. It was really just New Year's in this year. But that was close to a point. And the rest of the year, I don't know that we're seeing anything -- we're looking at each other here. I don't think there's anything particularly big coming from a shift.
Operator: Your next question from Peter Saleh of Telsey.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: I just wanted to ask something, we've continued to see growth in comps and in the pizza category. I know we've talked about this in the past, but what are your thoughts on accelerating unit growth in the U.S.?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, the answer is, we still expect some growth this year. We've been saying kind of modest growth. And we think it's going to continue to be relatively modest in the U.S. Obviously over time, we'd like that to become more meaningful. But I think we still need to prove that. And that's clearly an area that where there's upside, if we can get that going. But I think still for the near term, I'd expect relatively modest growth on the domestic side.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Are franchisees who want to grow, are they having any trouble finding financing?
J. Patrick Doyle: No, it's gotten much better for larger players. So if you own 10 or more restaurants, and you're looking to borrow $1 million or more, the answer is, that market has gotten very robust. If you're a small player, particularly if you're looking to buy your first store, that market is still relatively tight. And so it's 2 very, very different markets. For our larger franchisees, the financing environment is really quite good at this point.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: And then just last question on China. Where do you stand on China and getting more robust growth going there?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, we're happy with progress in China. It's still relatively small, but we're moving along there. And over the longer term, we're optimistic. And near term, given the scale of the business, as we're still ramping up, I don't think it's going to be a big driver. But longer term, we're certainly optimistic about China.
Operator: Your next question is from Steve Anderson of Miller Tabak.
Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: I want to go a little bit further on the new year sort of development plans domestically. In light of your new prototype that you've launched, have you set any numerical goals that you look at, at least from a company-owned standpoint?
J. Patrick Doyle: We have not yet. But we will move faster on reimages and relocations with our own stores than we would ask our franchisees to. But we're still kind of working through the analysis on the new designs and how they're doing. And so, no conclusion on that yet. But -- so, I think the short answer is no. We don't have specific timeframes around that yet.
Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: How many of those do you have in operation right now?
J. Patrick Doyle: A bit north of 100.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks?
J. Patrick Doyle: No. I'd just like to thank everybody for being on today's call. And look forward to updating you further on the business in July when we report our second quarter results. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: And this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is LaShondra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 and Year End Financial Results Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Liddle. You may begin your conference.
Lynn M. Liddle: Thanks to you, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to be here with you today. I'm just taking care of the little housekeeping items, such as making sure that you've all looked at our Safe Harbor statement in the event that we do make any forward-looking statements and also kindly ask the media to be in a listen-only mode this morning. With me today, we have our CEO, Patrick Doyle; and our CFO, Mike Lawton, who will make some prepared comments for you, and then we'll open it up to Q&A. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Mike.
Michael T. Lawton: Thank you, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. We continued to build on the positive results we had in the first 3 quarters of 2012 and delivered another solid quarter for our shareholders. The international division led the way with both strong same-store sales and store comp growth, and our domestic stores also posted positive same-store sales and store comp growth. Our bottom line grew in the fourth quarter with 21.6% net income growth over the prior year, which provided additional free cash flow for share repurchases. Here's how the fourth quarter came together. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 9.4% when excluding the impact of foreign currency. When we include the impact of foreign currency in the quarter, our global retail sales grew by 9.7%. The drivers of this growth included domestic same-store sales, which were up 4.7% in the quarter, lapping a positive 6.8% in the prior year quarter. This was comprised of franchise same-store sales, which were up 4.9%, and company-owned stores, which were up 2.5%. Our Pan Pizza launch in the fourth quarter positively impacted our same-store sales and also drove an increase in order counts. Our international division had another good quarter, as same-store sales grew 5.2%, lapping a 4.7% increase in the fourth quarter of 2011. Now we opened 32 net stores domestically in the quarter, consisting of 51 store openings and 19 closures. For the full year, we opened 21 net domestic stores, and we remain focused on growing our store count in the United States. Our international division grew by 183 stores this quarter, made up of 223 openings and 40 closures. For the full year, we had a record international growth of 492 net new stores. Turning to revenues. Our total revenues for the quarter were up $37.9 million or 7.6% from the prior year. This increase was primarily a result of 3 factors: first, higher supply chain revenues resulting from both increased volumes from higher order counts and a change in the mix of products sold per order; second, higher international revenues due to increased same-store sales and store count growth; and third, higher domestic royalty revenues due the same-store sales growth and the impact of increased store count. Moving on to our operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, our consolidated operating margin for the quarter increased 0.9% from 28.9% to -- from 28.9% to 29.8%. This change was primarily driven by 3 factors: first, company-owned store operating margins increased as a percentage of revenues from the prior year quarter due to reduced utility and occupancy costs as well as adjustments in our self-insurance reserves; second, a change in our mix of revenues positively impacted our operating margin, as we now have fewer company-owned stores and more franchise royalty revenues; and third, our supply chain margin percentage increased slightly from 10% to 10.3% due to the positive impact to product mix and efficiencies at our facilities. On a separate note, commodities were up slightly during the fourth quarter, but ended fiscal '12 -- 2012 fairly flat, and the market basket in the stores was down 0.3% for the year. As I stated at our Investor Day in January, we currently expect to see a commodity increase of 3% to 4% in 2013, which we believe will be manageable in the overall context of our business. Turning to G&A expenses. G&A increased by $3.9 million or 5.7% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was due to investments we're making to feed our international growth engine and to continue our technological advantage. There was also additional expense from variable performance-based compensation. Our G&A for the full year 2012 was $219 million. As we look to 2013, we expect to have increases for international support personnel, e-commerce and technological support and other strategic initiatives. Additionally, we now expect 2013 G&A to be higher than previously communicated because of an increase in noncash compensation expense, which I will elaborate on shortly. The result is an expected increase of $9 million to $13 million over our 2012 reported levels. Keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down by, among other things, our performance versus plan, as that affects variable performance-based compensation expense. I'd also note that we charge franchisees for providing e-commerce and technological support, and we expect to have increased revenues of $1.5 million or $2 million in 2013 related to these services. Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 37.7% for the quarter. We currently expect that 37.5% to 38.5% will be our normalized effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. Our fourth quarter net income, as reported, was up $6.7 million or 21.6%. This increase was primarily the result of our higher domestic and international same-store sales, international store growth and higher company-owned store and supply chain margins. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS was $0.64 versus $0.52 in the prior year quarter. $0.64 is a $0.12 or 23.1% increase from the $0.52 in the fourth quarter of last year. Here's how that $0.12 difference breaks down: Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.13. Our lower diluted share count, primarily due to our share repurchases, benefited us by $0.01, and a higher effective tax rate negatively impacted us by $0.02 due to a slightly lower effective tax rate in the prior year quarter when we had a lapsation of some federal and state statutes of limitation. Now turning to our use of cash. In the fourth quarter, we utilized some of our available cash to repurchase and retire approximately 1.1 million shares of our stock for $45.5 million or an average price of $40.05 per share. For the full year 2012, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for $88 million, or an average price of 35.68 per share, and we ended the year with $54.8 million of unrestricted cash. Looking forward, we believe we have cash beyond what we need to reinvest in our business. When considering this excess free cash flow, we've got 3 options: we can pay down debt, we can buy back stock, or we can pay dividends. Given that we are comfortable with our level of debt, we currently do not plan to pay down debt any faster than the required amortization. Based on our evaluation of these options and our historical consistent free cash flow, the Board of Directors has initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.20 a share. We also plan to continue to use our excess free cash flow to repurchase stock. In recognition to the loss to economic data option holders as a result of the initiation of regular dividends and due to the board's desire to both reward and retain our proven management team, the Compensation Committee approved an additional grant of equity instruments. This additional grant does not take the place of our usual annual grant and is the reason we updated our G&A outlook. Further details will be disclosed in both our 10-K and our a proxy statement. In closing, our strong fourth quarter continued our consistent performance throughout 2012. Our focus remains on improving our operating performance, growing our global store base and utilizing our free cash flow to drive shareholder value. Thanks for your time today. And now, I'll turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Nothing makes me happier than reporting another great quarter and another terrific year. Really, everything went our way in the fourth quarter, and it capped off a very successful 2012. We maintained our store growth and sales momentum, we grew market share in the U.S. and in international markets, we increased EPS by 20%, and we reached 10,000 stores worldwide, putting us in a league with only a select few restaurant peers. We also hit over $2 billion in digital sales globally, making us a top technology brand around the world. And as Mike just mentioned, we're proud to have also just announced the initiation of a regular quarterly dividend. Domestically in the fourth quarter, we launched our Handmade Pan Pizza, a very high-quality, fresh-dough product that we believed would be a hit with consumers, and we were right. We helped drive higher sales as well as increase traffic into our stores, something that's a key metric for us. Early indications are that online customers were some of our best pan pizza customers, engaging strongly with this new product. Consumer feedback on the product has been very positive, and our theory is that consumers prefer a fresh-dough product over frozen alternatives. We now have a product competing nicely in this category, and we're gaining a meaningful foothold with lots of opportunity for future growth. Meanwhile, the net domestic unit growth we recorded in the fourth quarter means that we ended the year up 21 net new stores. Modest growth, but we consider it a hopeful sign for continued U.S. store development in the years to come. Promotions that increased store-level profits at our successful Pan Pizza launch, coupled with tame commodities, all led to a strong year for franchisee store profits, which ultimately leads to an energized franchise base. In fact, our franchisees recently voted to increase our national advertising spend going forward, upping it to 6% of top line sales from 5.5%. Through extensive market research and media modeling, we were able to make an informed and thoughtful recommendation for increased national advertising toward domestic franchise owners. This is expected to be a shift from local advertising into national advertising, and we think this is a positive vote of confidence from our franchisees. Our franchisees in the U.S. have a lot to feel good about, including our strong technology focus, which we believe is giving us the edge over smaller pizza players and garnering market share increases. Our best information so far indicates that our growth in 2012 was higher than the overall category and that our ability to continue to gain market share in the U.S. grows with our continued innovation around technology and the consumer experience. From store operations to direct marketing, technology was an important focus for us in 2012 and will remain an area of investment and leadership for us in 2013. Another area of leadership for our brand is in our international division, where we have once again produced excellent results. International store growth was robust all year, and the fourth quarter was no exception, as we ended the year up a net 492 stores, our best year ever for international store growth. That dynamic store count growth was matched by another remarkable year for same-store sales, up 5.2% in the quarter and for the year. For those keeping score, that is 76 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales, which is 19 years of positive growth from this division. And the international franchisees did this in a year when the macroeconomic picture wasn't all rosy. But again, we drove good, steady results from a wide mix of countries. In large countries, small ones, new markets or established markets, our geographic diversity and long runway for growth has helped keep our international business vigorous. Our international business continues to be a growth engine for Domino's Pizza. Notable markets with good sales growth in the quarter included South Korea, Turkey and Brazil, and even an economically troubled market, like Spain, managed to have positive sales results in the quarter. Continued success in store growth in our international business has resulted in the change in our long-term outlook, as communicated in January. We now believe that we will drive 4% to 6% global net unit growth, which is an increase over our previous range of 350 to 400 net new units. This also led to an increase in our global retail sales range, which we now believe will fall in the plus 6% to plus 10% range. This change reflects the confidence we have in our international business and the tremendous growth potential that this division can drive growing forward. We believe investors have good reason to be happy with their investment in Domino's in 2012. We increased adjusted EPS 23% in the fourth quarter and nearly 20% for the full year. We used $88 million of cash to repurchase shares, we paid a $3 special dividend,, and the stock price rose 28% in 2012. And now, we're establishing a regular dividend, maintaining the ability to repurchase shares. In conclusion, 2012 was a tremendous year. I have the privilege of leading a great team here at Domino's. From committed and passionate franchise owners to strong visionary leaders in our management ranks and team members that bring positive energy to our stores, the success we drove in 2012 couldn't have happened without the commitment of all of them. I want to thank our shareholders for their trust and loyalty, and I look forward to strengthening your commitment to the brand in 2013. With that, operator, I'm ready for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: A quick, quick question on just kind of the industry dynamics and where you think your company sits right now. A lot has changed in the industry and the spending environment since your fourth quarter ended. You've had some softness across the industry. What are you guys seeing in the overall pizza space? And at the end of the day, do you think that your new Pan Pizza, the technology tailwind you have, all the things from a bottoms-up standpoint, do you believe you kind of are -- have the ability to negate these slowing trends that we're seeing across the industry?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, Brian. I'm not going to get into kind of the first quarter, obviously, but I guess what I'd say is nothing that's been happening in terms of kind of the government and what's happening there has been a surprise. And we've been talking about value for a long time, we've been delivering value for a couple of years, and it's been delivering good results for us. So really no change on that front. And kind of what happened in January didn't come as a surprise. Pan Pizza clearly performed very, very well, I think even exceeded our expectations a little bit. And the technology has continued to move along nicely. So I'm not going to get into Q1, as I know you know I won't. But what I would say is that nothing that's happened in the first quarter has been a surprise in terms of what's happened with the government and all of that. So we were prepared for that, we were doing what we expected to -- that we needed to do to kind of meet that environment.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. I figured I'd take a stab at it there. As far as this dividend, how did you decide on the amount of the dividend? Was it that payout ratio as a percent of earnings? Or was it some other type of calculation? And at the end of the day, how are you going to think about growing this dividend into the future? Again, is it going to based on the payout ratio? Is there some type of just growth you want to sustain the rate at going forward? How are you thinking about that?
J. Patrick Doyle: I think the answer is we wanted it to be a meaningful dividend. It's kind of 35% to 40% of our net income for last year and roughly 1/3 or so of our free cash flow. I think free cash flow last year came in at about $146 million. So it still leaves us $100 million of free cash flow on last year's number that we can use flexibly. And so I think the answer was this is an environment where there are a lot of investors looking for yield. The consistency of our cash flow lends itself to being able to do this. We wanted to give people a material yield, but at the same time, maintain some flexibility with still incremental free cash flow to make decisions going forward on how we're going to spend it. So that's really the thought. And as to what the future is going to be, that's going to be decisions we're going to make in the future as we see how the business is growing and developing.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: Okay. And last question that you may or may not answer. As far as the Pan Pizza, are you able to give us an idea of what percent of the order mix that was in the fourth quarter and possibly what the effects on the average ticket were for the overall business?
J. Patrick Doyle: What I can tell you is -- well, I'm not going to get into the specific mix, because I know our competitors would love that number, as I think you knew. The answer is, it did exceed our expectations a little bit, and we did finish the year -- after a first half where order counts have been down, we were strong enough on order counts in the second half of the year, and particularly in the fourth quarter, that we finished with modestly positive order counts for the year. So the overall effect was great. We definitely drove more customers into the franchise. I'm not going to give the specific number on mix, but I will tell you that it was a bit ahead of our expectations.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to ask about the switch from 5.5% national advertising to 6%. Can you give us an idea of how much your overall ad impressions in the U.S. might be up in 2013 as a result of the shift?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, Michael. The answer is it will be up somewhat. You've still got media inflation to offset. You will see some of this going to digital, which -- as opposed to just mass media advertising. And importantly, as I said in my prepared remarks, our recommendation to our system is that this is a shift in spending, that this is not an incremental spend, but that they're taking basically an equal amount out of their local spend, which is mostly print, and moving it to the national level, because we're just simply seeing a better return on investment of those dollars. I think what's most important in it, frankly, is that our system had the confidence and the trust in what we're doing and the results that we've been driving to make that commitment to us. So I think the answer, Michael, is you're going to see some increase in mass; you'll see probably a little more increase in digital, where we continue to have a great return on investment. But it should be a shift in spending, not necessarily, in the totality of their advertising spend, a net increase.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then on a different topic. Your franchisees in international opened 75, 80 new units -- net new units in 2012. And I'm curious, I mean, if you open many more than that in 2013, you'll be pushing through the upper limit of that 4% to 6% unit growth guidance that you just gave. And I ask partly because the public franchisees that are out there are all talking about growing more units for you next year, and at your Analyst Day, you talked about some of the secondary countries gaining speed and growing more units for you. So might that 4% to 6% range turn out to be almost antiquated before the year starts?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, Michael, first of all, it's a long-term forecast. You said something about 75 stores that I didn't get at the beginning. We opened 492 net internationally for the year. You said something about 75 and I didn't...
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That was for the fourth quarter. I wasn't clear, sorry. Or maybe I got it wrong. Either way, the question stands. I'm not sure if I got something wrong. But the question about the -- getting through the 6% number, it seems like it's something that you'll be able to do with relative -- maybe relative ease.
J. Patrick Doyle: Well, we've got a bigger base. I mean, we finished the year at over 10,200. So you'd have to be -- we'd have to be well north of 600 net stores. And last year, we were just a little over 500. So that would be -- we were right in the middle of that range last year, where we were, and that is our best guidance for where we think we're going to be, is kind of that 4% to 6% on a long-term basis.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And just for clarity, the 75 to 80 units was how many more new units they built for you this year versus the prior.
J. Patrick Doyle: Okay, it was the net increase. Got it. Got it. No, I mean, look, it was a terrific year for us on store growth. And part of that is what led us to increasing the range on net openings to kind of the 4% to 6% range. But -- so now I get it on 75, that was the net increase in the openings versus the prior year. But no, that would be a pretty big increase to get us over the top of that 6%.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Just a couple of questions. First, on the U.S. business with the new menu that you've implemented over the past couple of years, it's obviously there's been an evolution, and it seems like it's perhaps changing the mix of customers. I'm just wondering if you could talk about your delivery business versus your takeout business in terms of the growth rates of both, how do you think about profitability for both, just kind of thoughts in terms of the different ways people use your brand?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. So carryout has grown a little bit faster than delivery over the last few years, but we're getting growth from both sides of the business. But in the overall category, particularly going back even a little bit longer term, carryout has clearly been a little stronger than delivery, if you go back kind of 3 to 5 years. From a profitability standpoint, the ticket on a carryout customer is lower than the ticket on a delivery customer, but your costs are also lower because you're not delivering to them. So net-net, we're relatively agnostic between -- from a profit standpoint on carryout or delivery. They're both nicely incremental for us when we pick up new orders on either side. So -- but yes, I think the one thing in there is carryout has definitely been a little healthier than delivery over the last few years.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And then just in the advertising spend that you talked about. Just to clarify, I know you had said it's going up from 5.5% to 6%. But you're saying the -- so what does the franchisee spend in total? Presumably it's well above that major shifting in their -- first, I want to figure out what the franchisee paid in total, because it sounds like you're saying they're not going to increase their spend, it's just moving 50 basis points to you.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, typical is that they're spending a couple of percent more. So they've got 2% or so more that they're spending on -- mostly on print. So the coupons that you're seeing showing up in the Sunday papers and in your mailbox. And we're simply seeing a better ROI on the activities that we're doing at a national level than we've seen on some of the local. We did a lot of research around it, kind of media mix modeling, and went back to them with a recommendation and said, "We think you should keep your overall spend consistent with what it's been, but the shift 0.5% out of your local into the national."
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And that was approved across the board? So now everybody does the same thing?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And then just lastly, the international -- obviously a very impressive run, and you mentioned that it's obviously not all rosy outside the U.S., and you highlighted some of the markets that surprised you to the upside. I'm wondering, just because you have a better view of the world, perhaps, than we do, and maybe the 2-year trend slid a little bit, I'm wondering whether there were any markets where they're starting to see increased pressure or slowing trends?
J. Patrick Doyle: What I'd tell you is what we've been most worried about -- and I think you've heard me say this before, has been Europe. And it just hadn't been showing up in the numbers. And I think you've seen in the restaurant industry, you've seen a little bit more pressure there than the other regions, and it hasn't shown up in our numbers. And this was another quarter where we were watching it carefully. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, Spain actually finished positive in the fourth quarter, which was a bit of a turn for us. So that's the -- that's it. I mean, there are some smaller markets that have been negative. I've talked about Greece in the past, and there are certainly a few others out there. But overall, geographically, it's been pretty strong everywhere.
Operator: Your next question comes the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just going back to the Pan Pizza introduction. The idea was this was a new product platform for you, and maybe there were some customers you hadn't reached before. And you also said a lot of the orders came from online, which maybe suggested the existing user base was using it. So maybe directionally, how many do you think you got new customers that came in to the brand? They were lapsed users, or were you just really getting your existing base excited about a new product, and they were buying more of it?
J. Patrick Doyle: John, I think the -- really, what we saw is there were occasions -- I mean, we brought in some new customers, but I don't know that it brought in any more than we are typically bringing in. I think what we saw more was customers who already did business with Domino's that would take their pan business elsewhere started giving us some of those occasions. And I think that was -- I think what that was really the primary thing that was going on.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Got you. Okay. And then just a couple of -- Mike, just a couple of questions for you. One is, the distribution business grew a lot. You explained that was the variance there. But relative to the first 3 quarters, distribution revenues grew substantially more. And there was a comment about mix, I think. What was -- was there something specific? Was it the pan that drove more distribution mix, or what else was in the quarter that may have driven that unusual amount of growth?
Michael T. Lawton: The Pan Pizza drove a lot -- we measure volume in our commissaries in pounds, and the Pan Pizza volume drove a lot of pounds through our commissaries.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Pan Pizzas are just heavier than normal pizzas?
Michael T. Lawton: It's heavier. You're also -- there's more toppings on it, you're selling a little more cheese. You're...
J. Patrick Doyle: We had very nicely positive order counts, too. I mean, we just simply had more traffic, whereas we were kind of fighting traffic earlier in the year.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: But your comps were -- I mean, was your traffic above your comps, then, for the fourth quarter?
J. Patrick Doyle: Our traffic above our comps?
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: In other words, did -- it was traffic growth in excess of the total comp growth.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, it was in that range. It was in that range. We had very strong order count growth in the fourth quarter.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. Interesting. And then just on the change in the compensation expense. I understand it this year, but it sounds like it's a permanent or at least 3- or 4-year phenomenon where you've got expense of this incremental compensation, noncash compensation, over a period of time. Would that be right? And would it be about this order of magnitude in future years?
J. Patrick Doyle: It's -- because we've changed the vesting period on both this grant and on future grants from 3 years to 4 years, it will be spread over 4 years, and it would probably be the same, or slightly lower, in the next 3 years. We'll also have slightly lower noncash comp on the grants that would be given on the typical basis because it will also be spread over 4 years in the future instead of 3.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then just one last one is the shift from that -- local and national advertising you cited, sort of couponing or the print as being a reduction. Are you actually able to coupon less now because of the strength of brand new products, you're actually able to reduce the amount of couponing? Or is just -- is that a false read-through from what you said about the shift?
J. Patrick Doyle: It's all about mix. So it's not that we necessarily can promote less or be out there with less activity. It's just simply we've gotten pretty good at reading the return on investment for the dollars that are being spent, and the return that we're seeing from activities that are being directed nationally are better than the returns we were seeing from local activities, which are mostly about the print. And so we shifted the dollars that way. So it's not necessarily that you can be less promotional or that we're sending out less deals, it's just about how you communicate them and how the customer reacts to them, and we're simply getting a better return from kind of nationally-driven activities, read: mass media and digital, for the most part, versus the print.
Operator: Your next question comes in the line of Mitch Speiser of Buckingham Research.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: The 2 company stores that you opened in the U.S., were they the new prototypes? And can you talk about how they're performing in terms of carryout versus delivery or any differences you're seeing in the customer experience?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. So I think one of them was a reopen of a store that had burned down, but we did do it in the new image. But the answer is, we're now up to something in the range of 100 stores that have gone through a reimaging process or were new stores that opened in the new image. We're not ready to kind of give conclusions around that. We need to kind of see how those stores perform over a period of time. We think there is going to be a need to reimage at some point. But we're trying to -- we're trying to watch these for -- and get a couple of quarters under our belts before we draw a conclusion from it. So early read, customers are happy, we like what we're seeing, but it's still too early to kind of draw a conclusion.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. And with the business going well in the U.S., and it looks like U.S. units are beginning to uptick a bit, but still, as you noted, modest. Have you begun to rethink franchisee incentives at any level to drive more accelerated U.S. unit growth?
J. Patrick Doyle: I mean, we've got targeted incentives out there. And they're targeted at some specific franchisees that have been willing to commit to kind of strategically growing their businesses with us, as well as some individual markets. We've always had incentives out there. We've shifted them around some, and we're kind of happy with the early returns on that. But it's kind of early on. As you say, at 21, it's still relatively modest. I think longer term, what's important is we think we had another year -- we know we had another year where franchise level profitability was up, and that's ultimately what's going to drive increased store growth is their confidence in a strong return on investment. So we're spending a lot of time there on how do we increase profitability even more, how do we make their return on investment even stronger? And that's ultimately really what's going to drive the store growth for us.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Have you discussed what the cost of the new prototype is versus a legacy type of store?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. It's somewhat more expensive than the previous kind. If you build in kind of the same footprint with roughly the same kind of layout as we have today, which is the lobby kind of at the front of the store, it's relatively in line with existing costs. If you do kind of what we're calling the Pizza Theater, which is very open, and the lobby is kind of going down the side of the store and is likely going to be a somewhat bigger footprint, that's going to be somewhat more expensive. And as we do more of them, we drive more efficiencies in those costs, so we would hope to see those costs come down, but as we're doing them now, they are certainly a little bit more expensive than our past design.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay. I think my last question. Just on national media, in general, does that include any national couponing?
J. Patrick Doyle: No.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: It's interesting to see, as your business migrates more to online and mobile ordering, what have you, and there's more funds allocated to national media, that there's increasingly the likelihood that you can really begin to take some people out of the stores, or maybe just reallocate some people away from things like answering the phones and what have you. So I mean, are you kind of getting to that point of critical mass where you're actually going to be able to lower labor hours or just reallocate labor hours very specifically, even on an increase in order counts?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I've worked -- we are definitely in that range. We're -- and I will tell you that early on, John, we didn't see as much of it as we would've expected, early. It did take some critical mass. When we were at kind of at 10% or 15%, we thought we were going to see labor efficiencies, and we really weren't. As we've gotten up to the level where we are now, kind of north of 35% in sales, we definitely see that now. Interestingly, one of the things that Mike mentioned from a margin standpoint at our corporate stores was around utilities. Part of that is phone lines. We've gone through and gone back and realized, as we're taking fewer orders in the stores, we don't need as many order-taking stations and we don't need as many phone lines into the stores. And it's about $30 a line, and if you take a couple of those out and spread that out over a year, it's 1/10 or 2/10 [ph] . And so there's just a number of ways where it shows up over time. But yes, at this level, we're certainly in the range where you start to see some labor efficiency.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And is there significantly more to do go? I mean, I know you do have a national call center, which kind of acts as a rollover from what I understand. But the combination of that and online, I mean, is it still like a hundreds of basis point opportunity over, I don't know, the next 5 or 10 years?
J. Patrick Doyle: No. From a labor perspective, it's not going to be that much. It's not going to be that much. There's still certainly more, and there still are stores that are below the average, clearly, and as they ramp up more, you'll get some more savings there. But it's not going to be hundreds of basis points on the labor line.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then secondly -- and I apologize if I just didn't understand this. The increased incentive comp in 2013, I mean, was that just more or less an award for what you guys have achieved over the last 3 years? I mean, was it something about retention or what have you that happened? Or I think to an answer to a previous question, was it just around the timing of what -- of the way these options are going to be vested?
J. Patrick Doyle: I think there are a couple of things. I think, number one, it was a reward to the management team for performance and to retain us over the medium and long term. At the same time, we did move from a 3-year vesting to a 4-year vesting, which I think is also healthy from a retention standpoint. But it is also something that's -- we had a DER policy, a dividend equivalent rights policy, in effect in our option plan. It doesn't tie directly because the IRS had rulings on DERs and kind of how those are treated. So it's looking at initiation of a regular dividend and the effect of that on the value of stock options, and it's also just around kind of rewarding and trying to retain and incent the management team.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: But this at least -- some component of this should be kind of viewed as an isolated 2013 event that may or may not recur in 2014?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. That's right. And it's just -- the reason you talked about recurring is, as they vest over 4 years, you're going to have some expense here. But no, that's absolutely right. I mean, this is going to be an unusual grant, it will be -- get expensed over a period of 4 years. But it's certainly not something you should expect on a recurring basis in terms of more new incremental grants like this.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Smith of Feltl.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: First off, just wondering if you can give us any insight into the health of the franchisees domestically, what they're seeing in financing? And then internationally, outside of the public guys, any insight you can give us into the health and desire to continue to grow?
Michael T. Lawton: This is Mike. On the U.S. side, right now, franchisees that have a desire to grow that have got experience are in great shape in terms of their access to financing. If you don't have a store and you want your first store, still real tough. If you've got a lot of stores, a lot of experience, most of our big franchisees are in very good shape. They have great access to money fairly cheaply. In the in-between guys that have got 3, 4, 5 stores and maybe up to 20, over the last few months, their access to financing has become a lot better than it was 1.5 years or 2 years ago. We've certainly seen a lot more opportunities for them grow if they desire. Outside the U.S., we've seen, obviously, great growth last year. We had 492 net stores. We haven't seen any indication that there are many franchisees that were part of that growth that are -- intend to slow down.
Mark E. Smith - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then secondly, it's maybe too anecdotal. But yesterday, I was in California, bought gas for $4.69. Can you just walk us through, historically, with gas price spikes, what you've seen from the consumer? Also the impact on distribution and at the store level from delivery?
Michael T. Lawton: Historically, we have not seen a lot of change in the consumer behaviors as gas price spiked. And we also haven't had -- when you think of the gas prices going up and you think of us as a delivery company, typically, the first thought is, well, that means a lot more reimbursement to drivers, that means expenses go under a lot of pressure. There is more reimbursement to drivers, but it's not a huge additional cost at the stores. And when we see the gas price spikes, we typically have, from our history, a little more concern about how, over time, that can feed into the overall cost of the food supply, our ingredient cost. We've been -- we just provided information earlier in my comments that with what we see out there right now, it's still looking at 3% to 4% for the year, and we aren't seeing a change to that at this point based on the ag economists and the people that we use for inputs into our estimates.
J. Patrick Doyle: So, yes, that's the big deal. I mean, we saw that in 2007 when gas prices spiked up a lot, it started to flow through into -- into commodities. And that's honestly where our biggest concern is when you look at gas prices. Consumer behavior, reimbursements, they're just -- we just haven't seen that much in the past that it's -- that's that material. The bigger issue is if it starts to flow through commodities.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh of Telsey Advisory Group.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: I just wanted to ask if you guys could just take us back a step. I believe in 2010 there was a shift as well on the advertising from more local to national. So if you could remind us what that shift was and kind of just relate it to what's going on today?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. In 2010, we went from 4% to 5.5% nationally. There was -- there had been, at that point, kind of a 2% minimum required local co-op spend. So it was money that was being collected at DMA by DMA and would be spent largely on kind of local television and some radio. So in 2010, what we did was we eliminated that 2% requirement on DMA-level spend or co-op spend, as we called it. So there were kind of 3 buckets then, and we went from 3 buckets to 2 buckets. We eliminated the 2% requirement. They could still do it if they chose, but we've eliminated the 2% requirement and added 1.5% to the national level. So the requirement for them actually went from 4% plus 2% down to 5.5%. So it was actually a reduction in the requirement of 0.5%. We were comfortable doing that then because we could see the efficiencies that we were going to get by making that shift, and we saw those. And 2010 was a clearly a very, very strong year for us with the relaunch at the same time. But yes, you've got that exactly right. So we had to shift back then. It increased the national at that time from 4% to 5.5%, offset by the 2% requirement going away at the co-op level. What we've just done is moved from 5.5% to 6%. So actually, the requirement was returning to kind of where it had been then, but with the recommendation to them that they'd probably fund that by a commensurate reduction in their local spend.
Operator: That was the last question. Are there any closing remarks?
J. Patrick Doyle: No. I just want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to reporting our first quarter results to you on April 30. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 earnings call.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).  I will now turn the call over to Ms. Lynn Liddle.
Lynn Liddle: Thanks Christie and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us on our third quarter, very pleasant announcement, and with us today we have Mike Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Doyle, our Chief Executive Officer, who have prepared comments that will follow with an open Q&A.  A couple of housekeeping things; we do ask the media to be in a listen-only mode, since this is primarily an investor call, and second of all, I refer all of you to our 10-Q and our 8-K that were filed this morning and contain a Safe Harbor statement for forward-looking comments.  So with that, I will turn the call over to Mike.
Mike Lawton: Thanks Lynn and good morning everyone. In the third quarter we grew our same store sales both domestically and internationally and we achieved strong store growths in our international markets. We also drove shareholder value with 22.9% adjusted EPS growth over the prior year quarter. Overall, we are really pleased with another quarter of strong results.  I am going to start at the top of our results by looking at our global retail sales. Global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company owned stores worldwide grew 8.4% when excluding the impact of foreign currency.  As many of you know, currency exchange rates have had a negative impact for us this year due to the dollar strengthening against most currencies. When we include the negative currency impact, our global retail sales still grew by 4.9%.  The drivers of the growth included domestic same store sales, which were up 3.3% in the third quarter, lapping a positive 3% in the prior year quarter. This was comprised of franchisee same store sales, which were up 3.6% and company owned stores, which were up by 0.5%. Our international division had another good quarter as same store sales grew 5%, lapping a very strong 8.1% last year’s quarter.  We closed five net stores domestically, consisting of 10 store openings and 15 closures. For the trailing 12-month period we have opened five net stores domestically and we still expect to be modestly positive as we close out this calendar year. Our international division grew by a net 121 stores this quarter, made up of 130 store openings and nine closures.  Turning to revenues, our total revenues were up $1.8 million or 0.5% from the prior year. This increase was primarily the result of two factors: First, higher international revenues due to both increased same store sales and store count growth, which was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency; and second, higher domestic royalty revenues due to same store sales growth.  This increase was driven by a higher average ticket due to our product mix and marketing promotions, as well as a slight increase in order counts. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in company owned store revenue from the sale of 30 corporate stores in the third quarter of 2011. More detail regarding our revenue by business unit can be found in our 10-Q, which was filed this morning.  Moving onto our operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, our consolidated operating margin increased 2% from 27.5% to 29.5%. This increase is primarily due to three factors: First, our company owned store operating margins increased 3.2% as a percentage of revenues from the prior year quarter; in part due to the positive impact of our higher average ticket and lower commodity prices, primarily cheese.  Second, a change in our mix of revenues positively impacted our operating margin as we now have fewer company owned stores and more royalty revenues. And third, our supply chain margin percentage went from 9.5% to 10.4%, an increase of 0.9%. This was due to positive impact of product mix, efficiencies in our facilities and lower commodity cost.  The average cheese block price in the third quarter was $1.71 per pound versus $2.08 last year, which led to a 2.6% decrease in our overall market basket during the quarter. As a reminder, food commodities are generally priced on a constant dollar markup to our franchisees. Therefore, lower cheese prices do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do however positively impact our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues.  Although cheese prices have moved up recently, we now expect that our overall market basket in 2012 will be flat to up slightly over 2011 levels. We expect that commodities will be up more in 2013 than they have been in 2012. While it is still too early for us to provide a range, we believe the increase will be manageable in the overall context of our business. We plan to provide an estimate of our 2013 commodity price changes when we hold our investor day, which is scheduled for January 18 in Miami, Florida. So we expect to see good attendance from those of you coming from cold northern climates.  Turning to G&A expenses, G&A increased by $2.3 million or 4.8% quarter-over-quarter. About $500,000 of that increase resulted from a 2011 gain on sales of some stores that we detailed in items affecting comparability in our 8-K. The rest of the increase was primarily due to investments in technology, international and other strategic initiatives.  We said earlier that we expected our full year G&A to be up $5 million to $7 million over reported 2011 levels. We continue to run below our expectations, as finding the right people to fill open positions in IT and international has taken longer than planned, but we are committed to making these strategic investments. We now believe that we will be at or slightly below the low end of the G&A range we previously gave.  Regarding income taxes, our reported effective tax rate was 36.6% for the quarter, due to a tax item affecting comparability explained in our earnings release. Excluding that item, our tax rate was 38.4%. For the year, we expect to be at the low end of the range of 38% to 39% that we had previously communicated.  Our net income as reported was up $3.9 million or 17.6%. This increase was primarily the result of our higher domestic and international same store sales, international store growth and higher company owned store margins. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates on our international royalty revenue.  Our third quarter diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.44 versus $0.36 in the prior year quarter. On an as adjusted basis, diluted EPS was $0.43 for the quarter versus prior year adjusted EPS of $0.35. The $0.43 is an $0.08 or 22.9% increase from the $0.35 as adjusted in the third quarter of last year; here’s how the $0.08 difference breaks down.  Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.08. Our lower diluted share count, primarily due to our share repurchases benefited us by $0.025. Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by about $0.015 and a higher effective tax rate negatively impacted us by about $0.01.  Now turning to our liquidity. During the first three quarters of 2012 we generated $87 million of free cash flow, which we have used to pay a portion of our $3 per share special dividend, make scheduled principal payments on our debt and repurchase and retire shares.  In the third quarter we repurchased and retired approximately 190,000 shares of our common stock for $5.9 million or an average price of $30.85 per share. We ended the quarter with $34.6 million of unrestricted cash and we will continue to deploy our cash to maximize shareholder value.  Overall, we are pleased with the quarter and our consistent positive performance so far this year. Thank you for your time today, and now I’ll turn it over to Patrick.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks for the update Mike. Some of you might be thinking you’ve heard this all before; adjusted EPS up 23% over last year, same store sales up over 3% domestically; in fact in the last 15 quarters, 12 were positive and one was flat.  Internationally sales were up 5% on the same store sales basis, which is an astounding 75 consecutive quarters of positive same store sales. Well, you have heard all this before; it’s because the Domino’s model is a model of consistency. We think this steadiness is the hallmark of a business that’s reliable and growing with strong free cash flow and a franchise structure that tends to be very dependable.  Our international business has continued its long string of success, with nearly 19 years of solid growth from this division. I’m confident that’s a record in the restaurant industry. Our international franchisees are clearly offering the products, service and value that resonate with customers around the world.  We’ve also had other exciting news out of our international franchisees lately. Domino’s Pizza U.K. recently announced that it acquired the rights to Switzerland, Luxembourg and the option to acquire Austria. This is just a year after they bought the rights to franchise in Germany. This kind of expansion of an established and committed franchise group is great news for us and our systems.  And The Economic Times awarded our franchisee in India, Jubilant Foodworks, with the title of Emerging Company of the Year. The chain has been growing sales at a nearly 50% compound annual growth rate over the past six years. They are a clear leader in the restaurant industry in India and we are proud of their many accomplishments. This includes the incredible pace of their store growth, as they currently lead our system in new units.  And we had a robust net store growth all around the world during the quarter. This resulted in an important milestone at the end of September, when we celebrated the opening of our 10,000th store. We believe we are part of a very elite group, as there are now only eight restaurant chains that can claim to have 10,000 units worldwide. We are extremely proud of this historic event, and I was personally proud to celebrate this landmark moment in Istanbul, Turkey, which is another one of our fast growing markets.  While we’ve seen our share of challenges over the past 50 years, reaching the 10,000th store milestone has always been an important goal for our franchisees and management, which took focus, diligence and perseverance to achieve. But of course we are not finished growing. This is just a platform to launch our next phase of worldwide expansion.  While the U.S. is our largest market in the world, our international division has been the accelerant for growth in the past decade. Pioneering markets such as Australia, Mexico, India, The United Kingdom, and new markets such as Nigeria and Macedonia, which both recently opened, are all part of the vibrant, substantial Domino’s brand that we have become worldwide.  We’ve had robust store growth internationally, but new units have been harder to come by in our more mature domestic system. We had net negative store counts this quarter, but we are encouraged by the fact that we’ve had fewer closures year-to-date than we did last year, and as Mike mentioned, we expect to be positive for the year.  We’re also excited about our new store design package, which was announced in August. It’s important news for us, because it’s another element of the continual evolution of our global brand. One of the great features of the new store design is that it is very a la carte.  To do everything we showcased in our press release, you would need a few hundred more square feet than an average U.S. store currently has, but not everyone will choose all of the options we’ve made available. A store with 900 square feet in Manhattan will probably not choose a large waiting area with a television, but if you’ve got a 1600 square foot space in Istanbul, you might choose to have a grab-and-go cooler, a large waiting area and a nice pizza theater for customers to experience the pizza making process.  The cost of a remodel with the updated design is not materially different from store remodels of the past. It is possible however to spend more than our usual range if every option we put out there is chosen in new stores. As the rollout of these stores continues, we expect it will bring the costs of some of the more expensive elements down.  We think this new store design is inspiring to our franchisees and is friendlier to the customers who pick up their orders. We don’t believe that the higher cost options will impact franchisees growth plans. Store level economics continue to improve in the U.S. and we are hopeful that these new units will generate an even more favorable economic model.  While we are talking about stores, I want to take a moment to highlight the 387 corporate stores we have here in the U.S. We announced a change in leadership for the store portfolio recently; Steve Akinboro will now lead that division.  Steve has been with us for three years, a little over three years in fact, serving on the franchise side of our business and is the Vice President for the Western Region. He’s had great success helping to drive positive sales growth and new store growth in the region, as well as increased scores on a number of internal operational measures. I’m happy to welcome Steve to the leadership team. We are also pleased that the former head of this division, Asi Sheikh, intends to stay with our brand as a franchise owner. I believe he’s going to have great success.  So while store growth and new store designs are important in setting us apart from the competition, another key element of our success continues to be technology. Our international master franchisees lead in many ways. In Australia, 40% of digital orders are now through mobile devices. In the U.K. digital orders are now 58% of delivery sales, with total digital sales up by 39% in the third quarter versus the prior year.  Here in the U.S. our digital platforms continue to perform well and set us apart from the competition, particularly the smaller players. About 40% of our delivery orders come through from digital and that continues to grow. Roughly a third of our total orders come through digital channels now. Consumers love our digital ordering, so improving and expanding this ordering platform will continue to be an important focus of our strategy.  Consumers also love our new product news and early in the fourth quarter we launched our new Handmade Pan Pizza featuring fresh dough. And with one in every five pizzas sold in the U.S. today being a pan pizza, we felt there is a significant opportunity in this product segment. It may be tempting to equate this to the re-launch of our Hand-Tossed Pizza in early 2010, but it’s not quite the same.  Hand-Tossed is our core product and makes up the majority of our product mix. Pan on the other hand is currently a much smaller part of our sales, but it is a much larger part of the product mix for many of our pizza competitors and now we can compete in this segment too. We’ve spent three years making sure that we did it right. The big differentiator in my opinion is that our Pan Pizza, just like our Hand-Tossed Pizza, is made from fresh dough. We’ll see what American consumers prefer and we’ll be able to update you further on this exciting new product during our fourth quarter earnings call.  We believe both innovation and consistent performance continue to set us apart. Whether it’s store design, technology or new products, we think our continuous improvement and focus on the customer experience is what keeps this 52-year old brand fresh and dynamic. Our substantial global footprint with over 10,000 stores makes us a significant brand that has impressive global reach and name awareness worldwide.  I’m proud of the results we delivered in the third quarter and look forward to updating you in February, and with that, I’d like to open the line for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Michael Kelter, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs: A update on the Pan Pizza launch; I wanted to kind of dig in a little bit more there and I know you don’t want to necessarily talk about numbers, but maybe you could just give us some sort of description of your early experience with the launch relative to your expectations and maybe anything that surprised either way, positive or negative.
Patrick Doyle: Hey Michael. Yes, it happened in the fourth quarter, so we are not going to talk about results from that. All I’ll tell you is we think it’s a terrific product. We spent a lot of time making sure we got it right, about three years in fact, and specifics around its performance, we’ll discuss in February once we are talking about the fourth quarter. But it did launch after the end of the third quarter, so nothing that I can talk about at this point.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs: And on a completely separate note, the international unit growth appears to be on pace for at or potentially above your 350 to 450 guidance for the year. So I guess my question is, when might you evaluate whether you need to take that guidance higher, and looking forward, will the global macro slowdown impact the pace of openings in 2013 or you feel like you might build upon the 2012 pace?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, so generally we kind of look at where we are once a year and the longer-term guidance we are giving. You are right; on a trailing basis right now we are ahead of that 350 to 450 guidance. That’s obviously a good thing. If we were going to make a change, you would likely hear about it in January at our Investor Day.  And I’ll tell you, as you saw and as I’ve been saying a few quarters in a row, we keep looking at the international side of this, waiting for signs of weakness to appear out there, because clearly there has been slowdown, particularly in Europe, you probably saw the U.K. already released, they were up 3.7 same store sales in the third quarter, and it’s really the same story.  Things have held together nicely. We are very happy with 5% same store sales growth. Greece has continued to be weak. Spain has not been great, not horrible, but not great, but the rest of it has really held together nicely.  Now I guess what’s probably more important from a store growth standpoint is we track very carefully the kind of payback period on stores around the world, including the U.S. and the best indicator of store growth over the medium term is the ROI on those stores, and it continues to be very strong in international and in fact if anything, maybe getting stronger and we think that’s what generates store growth.  So as long as that trend continues, we feel pretty optimistic about store growth and as you pointed out, on a trailing 12-month basis right now, we are over the high end of our longer-term guidance.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley: I wanted to ask about the composition of the comp store sales this quarter, maybe sort of thinking about it going forward, we are still talking about maybe a more favorable mix driving in over traffic and so first of all, is that a function of maybe the digital ordering, up-selling customers better, if you could comment on what the role of that is playing in this favorable mix equation.  And also, how does Pan Pizza fold into it out from a mix perspective? It’s higher for a medium pizza, it’s a more expensive pizza, its obviously got more weight to it. Do you view this as more of a mix driver than it is a traffic driver?
Patrick Doyle: So a couple of parts. I mean first, we are happy that we had positive orders in the third quarter. It’s something we’ve been talking about, but we are still getting some ticket growth and we really feel like the order count growth is ultimately going to be the driver of the health of the business over the long-term.  In terms of Pan Pizza, yes, it’s $7.99, so it’s more expensive than the two for $5.99, but it is one pizza for $7.99 instead of two pizzas for $5.99, so there’s some kind of play in that. What I would tell you is our overall experience continues to be the same; order counts get driven by center of the plate items in the restaurant industry and for us, that’s pizza.  So selling a Pan Pizza or selling two mediums for $5.99 is going to tend to do better in general on order counts than when you’re talking more about side items. And so I made that comment before and I think that still holds true and clearly there’s got to be some balance in that, because selling sides are good for the profitability at the store level and as profits are better at the store level, then ultimately that’s going to generate better returns for our franchisees, which will hopefully generate some store growth.  So there’s always going to be a balance on that, but in general, I would tell you that when we are talking about pizza and promoting pizza, you are probably going to see on average a little bit more on the order count side.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley: Great. And then just as a follow-up, have you ever had or have you ever launched a Pan Pizza before? It’s not my recollection, but it seems that maybe sometime in the distant past you’ve done this, and is there any relevance of that experience to this time around?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, we did, a long time ago. Actually it pre-dated me. I’ve been here a little over 15 years now and the answer was, I don’t think we did it right. I think we didn’t take the time to make sure that it was the best possible pizza, and it’s really why we haven’t been a player in this category.  So I think the answer is we feel very good about this pizza. It’s a terrific pizza. Hopefully all of you have had it now. Hopefully, you’ve all had it more than once and we feel great about the quality and the taste of the pizza and I think when we did it in the past, I don’t think we got the product offering right.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays: Thank you. I just had a couple of questions on the follow-ups on the U.S. comp. Just wondering first of all, if you can just talk perhaps about the industry. I mean, it seems like you and your largest peers continue to surprise to the upside. I’m just wondering if you can talk about whether you are seeing now acceleration in the industry growth. I know previously you had said low single digit growth at best, but it would seem like, unless the independents are in a more severe decline that the category might be growing faster.  And then my other question is just kind of a follow-up on the Pan Pizza. I know it’s early, but it sounds like with three years of test, you probably have some interesting learning. I’m just wondering whether you can share perhaps what changes took place over time. I think you mentioned one in five across the industry are sold as pan pizza.  I’m just wondering kind of what your expectation is. I know you don’t want people to be as built-up as when you did the entire new pizza platform a few years ago, but kind of your thoughts on what you could have achieved. Thanks
Patrick Doyle: Yes. Look, it’s a great pizza and what we’ve learned over the three years is, it takes some time to get this right. It’s a thicker pizza, and you’ve got it in the pan. It requires a little bit more heat to cook it, and so balancing that out with the rest of your menu is a little bit of a trick, and that took us some time to get that right.  But other than that, I mean I’m not going to get into kind of speculation around where it’s going and kind of fourth-quarter commentary, but it’s a great pizza. And our view is at the end of the day, the quality of what you are selling is what’s going to drive sales and our learning has clearly been over the last three years, that if we come out with products that consumers are excited about and we take the time to make sure we are doing it right, then we are going to get good results out of that.  And Jeff, I’ve now forgotten what your first question was. Oh industry, right.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays: The broader category.
Patrick Doyle: Yes, so category; no, I don’t think the category is necessarily growing any faster than it was before. I think the answer is very similar to what I’ve said in the last couple of quarters, which is I think you are seeing finally some share gains by the larger players. So I think there is a little bit of growth in the category, but I think what you are seeing is the larger players are taking share from the regionals and smaller players.  You have seen some of that strain out there. I think on some of those smaller players, there was a small chain out in Boston that filed recently. But overall, I think it’s about share gains from the nationals versus the regionals and smaller players.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays: And just lastly, can you give us an update. I know this past quarter you paid that $3 special, kind of one-time dividend. I’m just wondering your thought process. It seems like share repurchase is the primary focus, but a return to maybe a more regular dividend relative to kind of the intermittent kind of one-time or any thought around that or would you prefer to steer clear of kind of regular?
Patrick Doyle: Well, no. We consider everything and the answer is, we look at things hopefully the exact same way that our investors do. We run the numbers. We look at what we think is going to generate the best overall returns for our shareholders.  Clearly, again this past quarter the answer for us has been share repurchases and I guess the other thing is, like everybody else, we are kind of going to be waiting to see what the tax rate is on dividends and capital gains in January and that will play into our thinking as part of the way we look at the returns that are going to be generated for shareholders, keeping in mind that some shareholders are not going to be tax-paying entities, but we are going to run the numbers the same way we always have and it’s possible that those tax rate changes, if they happen, will then play into that as well.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer: You’ve really become much more focused on driving your carry out business over the last couple of quarters. Just wondering if you’ve seen any change in the mix from your carry out business thus far.
Patrick Doyle: I think we’ve seen actually a little less growth on that this year and I mean overall, while we had some slightly positive orders in the third quarter, we didn’t get robust order growth yet in the third quarter, but it’s been a balance and while we did see more carry out growth in the previous couple of years, I think we’ve seen less of that this year.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer: Okay. With the stock buybacks, there definitely were a little bit light of where I was looking for and it seems as though you still have a lot of cash on your balance sheet. Is there any reason why you didn’t buy back more stock this quarter and you are kind of keeping a pretty healthy amount of cash on the balance sheet?
Patrick Doyle: Well, we are pretty conservative about the amount of cash we keep on the balance sheet. It’s also a pretty short window in the third quarter. But no; I mean, it’s just something we are always looking at and I think we would up with a little bit more at the end of the third quarter than at the end of the second, but I wouldn’t read a lot into that.
Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer: Okay, all right. Thank you guys.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks Brian
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America.
Joe Buckley - Bank of America: All right, two questions. Patrick, could you elaborate a little bit on the market share gains by the large companies? I know you’ve talked in the past about some of the technology advantages. Is that the primary driver that you think that may have changed the game a little bit versus the regionals and the independents?  And then the second question, could you just talk about media spend third quarter versus fourth? Did you keep some of your firepower in reserve so fourth quarter media spend might be stronger, especially around the Pan Pizza launch?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, I’ll take the latter one first. No, I don’t think we necessarily were carrying that much more into the fourth quarter than the third. I think if I remember, somebody can check, we may have been up just slightly on our advertising fund reserves versus the prior year, but nothing really material on that Joe.  And in terms of the dynamics of the share gains, it’s a really interesting one. The real change has been the digital side and so I think your theory on that is a good one. As I look at it, there have always been kind of three things that Domino’s and our national competitors have brought to the table.  First, just the scale and what that means in terms of purchasing power; second is kind of brand strength and our ability to advertise and build our brands; and third is know-how around the business and systems that we’ve developed over decades that make our franchisees and store managers more successful at running the stores.  And personally I would have expected you would have seen more share gains over time from those things than you saw and the answer is, really over the course of a couple of decades, you have been seeing much in the way of share movement towards the national players in the pizza category and you are now seeing it, and it’s six or eight quarters in a row I think if you look at it, and I don’t know if that’s a long term trend yet, I hope it is.  But I think some of it may just have been the economic environment and the financial strength of the national players and their franchisees to kind of weather the storm and maybe come through it a bit more aggressively.  And the other part of it is as you say, technology, and the better customer experience, the efficiencies that that gives us in our business, and frankly the difficulty that regional and smaller players have in putting together an ordering platform, a digital ordering platform like we have.  So I don’t know the full answer and obviously, I don’t have as much insight into what competitors are doing and how their numbers look around that as I do from our own numbers, but I think it’s clearly playing into it and I think that is at least part of the reason that you are seeing some movement towards the national chains.
Joe Buckley - Bank of America: Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thanks Joe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.
Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research: First, on the third quarter comp. I believe you advertised sandwiches early in the quarter, and then the two for $5.99 at the end of the quarter. Can you give us a sense on if they were both on traffic drivers or if sandwiches maybe were more a driver of checks? Just trying to get a sense of where the increased order counts came from.
Patrick Doyle: I mean, we don’t really get into breaking down the quarter more finally, but the answer is overall it was a good quarter and pretty much everything we were doing worked for us. So I’m not going to get into the specifics around it, but it was a pretty strong quarter overall, kind of start to finish.
Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research: Fair enough. And on the store margin, it was a big quarter of margin expansion. Cheese costs I’m sure were a big driver of that. I did notice that the labor leverage was a bit less than it has been in prior quarters. Could you maybe discuss on a go-forward basis, are some of the productivity initiatives now complete?  The labor leverage that we’ve seen over prior quarters was in the north of 100 basis points. Now it’s running at about 20 basis points. Is it fair to expect that those days of 100 basis points of leverage are behind us or are there more productivity initiatives on the horizon?
Patrick Doyle: We’ve certainly captured some of the opportunities that we were pursuing. But if you look at the labor productivity that we have in our corporate stores, there’s still a lot of things that we can do, but I don’t know that you’ll see those in the next quarter or two. I think what you saw this quarter is probably a more reflective of what you’ll see short term.
Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research: Okay great, thanks. And moving along, I think Mike, you gave us your food cost outlook for the year. Can you tell us what that implies for the fourth quarter?
Mike Lawton: Cheese prices have spiked up. We are currently up over $2 a pound, so we’d expect them to run higher than they did in the third quarter. But as you can see, we are still expecting a very, very manageable number in Q4, because we expect them to be up only slightly for the whole year and we were a negative versus last year in Q3. We could be flat, very slightly up Q4.
Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research: Okay great, thanks. My last question is on the new prototype store. Can you give us a sense of how many stores have this new design? And is it comping better than the overall average, and because they are such nice looking stores, are they more, I guess front and center in a trade area, and is that maybe driving the takeout part of the sales mix?
Patrick Doyle: Right now, we’ve still only got a few dozen of them out there. So we are very happy with kind of the initial reaction and response to it, but I want to be careful about kind of the statistical significance of what is still fewer than 50 stores. By the end of the year we are probably going to have a much more robust sample of those stores built and we’ll get more comfortable with what it’s doing in terms of better than average lift in those stores.  But the early read is certainly positive. We are happy with it. Consumers are happy with it, but I want to be careful about kind of projecting any early positives from that to a broader base until we’ve got a bigger sample out there, because you’re always going to have just that much more excitement from the early people that are adopting something and so I just want to be a little bit cautious about that, but overall, we are happy with it.
Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi.
Alvin Concepcion - Citi: A question on the Pan Pizza launch. I mean, you mentioned one in five pizzas that are sold are pan. Of that in general, what portion of the pan pizza customers do you believe are less brand loyal and maybe willing to switch based on history?
Patrick Doyle: Well, we don’t have a real history with pan yet, so we are going to find out on that. But we think we’ve got a great product. We’ve got a great pizza. The taste and quality is right. We think that the fact that we are making it fresh is a differentiator versus both the frozen pizza that people are buying in grocery stores, as well as some of our competitors and so we think it’s a compelling proposition, but time will tell.
Alvin Concepcion - Citi: Okay, great. And then on commodities, you mentioned 2013 is going to be higher, but manageable. What are some of the levers you’d consider pulling to manage through that? Is pricing on the table or will traffic and mix be more the key there?
Patrick Doyle: Right now, I’ll tell you that we think it’s going to be as Mike said, manageable, and so we’ll see as we get closer to it. There isn’t a lot of visibility out right now for us past kind of the first half of the year and for us, so much of it is driven by cheese, that it’s a little difficult right now to peg that strongly for the full year.  Cheese is a bit above where we’d expected it to be right now and our expectation is that we are probably going to see it back off somewhat, but we’ve got to see. But overall as we look at it, as Mike said, we think it’s manageable and kind of how we work through that, yet to be determined as we get a little more visibility on it.
Alvin Concepcion - Citi: All right, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory Group.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group: Congratulations on the quarter. 
Patrick Doyle: Thanks Peter.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group: I just wanted to ask about the domestic business and just the health of the franchisees. It seems like they are in much, much better shape today than they were maybe three or four years ago. And so I guess the question is around unit growth; are you seeing franchisees coming to you and looking to expand on a unit growth basis?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, they clearly are better off financially. I mean, the overall store level profits are up materially from where they were three or four years ago. Some folks are still digging out a little bit from the downturn.  Good news is that availability of debt for larger players has gotten materially better, I think over the course of the past year and at very good pricing. The bad news is that availability of debt for smaller players is still pretty weak. So if you are a larger player with 20, 30, 40 stores that wants to borrow $1 million or more, there’s pretty good availability out there. If you are a two-store person looking to add a third store, debt availability is still pretty weak, and so that clearly still plays into it.  And look, our franchisees are exposed to the same things that all of us are as consumers and as business people, and the environment out there is still perceived as being a little bit wobbly. So there’s still a little bit of conservatism, but we’ve got a number of folks who are certainly getting much more aggressive about either building or doing some buying, and we think that ultimately will be a positive for us.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group: Just a follow-up on that; can you just remind us again what percentage of your system is composed of these larger franchisees versus some of the smaller ones?
Patrick Doyle: I mean on average, our franchisees are just over four stores per franchisee. So I know we have fewer than 100 franchisees who have 10 or more stores in our domestic system. So you are still looking at a system that on general is still made up of smaller entrepreneurs, small business people, and fewer larger players.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group: Great. Thank you very much.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Smith with Feltl & Company.
Mark Smith - Feltl & Company: Comment on competitive pressure as we look at pricing, what you are seeing out there today, and as we start to look out to 2013, what opportunities you have to take pricing.
Patrick Doyle: The consumer really decides that more than kind of the competitive situation and the answer is consumers are still relatively conservative. And to the extent to which we look at the competitive environment, I think it’s been pretty consistent over the course of the past kind of year or 18 months and from our standpoint, we are still seeing a consumer that’s being very careful with how they are spending money and we’ve got to continue to give them good value. So I don’t know that I see a whole lot of room on pricing out there.
Mark Smith - Feltl & Company: Second question, can you just talk a little bit about potential health care cost changes and the impact that could have on you, but maybe more so on your franchisees and what you can do to help them?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, I think that the real answer on that is there are a whole lot of rules that are still kind of being worked through in DC and how much or how little we are going to get affected by PPACA is really going to be a function of those rules. So as they look at look-back periods and definitions of full-time or part-time and just a lot of things that still need to be worked through, that’s really going to drive the answer on it.  So it’s certainly something we are watching very carefully and I think until those rules are kind of settled, I can’t give you a real tight answer because that’s still going to drive a fair amount of variability on what that answer is going to be.
Mark Smith - Feltl & Company: Would you say that this is been over-hanged for a potential domestic unit growth at this point with your franchisees or are they not as concerned about it right now?
Patrick Doyle: No, I guess what I’d say is the overhang if you will, is uncertainty around the market in total. So it’s not around that as much as it’s around the overall economy, around what’s going to happen with tax rates. Just all of these things, I think kind of weigh on all of us and there’s a reasonable amount of uncertainty out there right now and so until we know what tax rates are going to be, until the election is over, until kind of rules are resolved on healthcare reform, all of those things, there’s some uncertainty out there and I think people, once there is more certainly, one way or the other people will get a little bit more aggressive again.
Mark Smith - Feltl & Company: Perfect. Thank you.
Patrick Doyle: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.
Unidentified Participant: Yes, I’m (inaudible) for John. Two questions if I could; the first is on digital sales. Patrick, you discussed I think a 40% number on a one-third of order transactions in the U.S. I wanted to clarify what the difference was there.  And then you touched on it, kind of as a driver of share of sales gains, but as the digital sales continue to potentially increase as a percent of orders, I wanted to get a sense for how you think about the labor or other productivity savings that you’ve achieved at the store level and how to think about that going forward.
Patrick Doyle: Yes, so the answer is 40% of our delivery sales are digital and about a third of our total sales are digital. So clearly, as people are at home or at the office ordering, they are more likely to do it than if they are going to pick it up. And a little bit under 10% of our customers actually just walk into a store and order there on the spot and then wait for their pizza. So that’s a small part of our business, but that plays into kind of that mix differential as well.  So in terms of labor, the answer is some of the improvements in labor efficiency that you’ve seen have clearly come from a higher mix of digital orders and we are well into the range on those orders that that incremental business going to digital will drive some labor efficiencies.  I’ll tell you when we were first getting this going in digital, we didn’t see it as much for the first 10% or 15% of sales as we thought we were going to and then you could start to see it hitting. And in hindsight I guess it makes sense, until you kind of carved off enough of those orders, you look at it and say, are you really going to cut out hours from your schedule, and the answer is, we didn’t see as much of it early I think as maybe we thought we were going to. But at this level, it clearly drives some efficiencies for us and I’ll expect that that will continue as it grows.
Unidentified Participant: Okay, and then switching gears a bit, I mean, as you think about free cash flow for 2013, how is the CapEx kind of shaping up? I mean, is it something to think about within kind of that long-term range of $25 million to $35 million?
Mike Lawton: We are in the process of putting budgets together, but at this point I would continue to work with those numbers in your model and we will give a further update on that in our Investor Day in January.
Unidentified Participant: Got it. Thanks a lot.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Steve Anderson with Miller Tabak.
Steve Anderson - Miller Tabak: Can you hear me?
Patrick Doyle: Yes, I can.
Steve Anderson - Miller Tabak: Okay, just wanted to touch base with you. You gave some results for same-restaurant sales in the U.K. Have you been providing any results for India or when can we expect that to be released?
Patrick Doyle: I don’t believe that they have released yet. And I think they are -- we are checking, but I think they are a couple of weeks.
Mike Lawton: They are a calendar quarter.
Patrick Doyle: Yes, they are on a calendar quarter, so I think they are a couple of weeks out. But it’s Jubilant Foodworks and unless we can look it up faster than I can stall to give you the answer…
Lynn Liddle: November 7.
Patrick Doyle: November 7, I stalled long enough.
Steve Anderson - Miller Tabak: Okay, great. So I guess at that time, we can get some color on the new unit openings as well?
Patrick Doyle: Well, you will get it from them.
Steve Anderson - Miller Tabak: Yes great. All right, thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions from the phone lines at this time.

Operator: Good morning. My name is LaShawna, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Domino's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Lynn Liddle. Ma'am, you may begin.
Lynn M. Liddle: Thanks. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. Hopefully, you saw that we also released our 10-Q this morning. Within that, of course, is our Safe Harbor statement, which I will refer you to. Also, we do these calls primarily for investors, so I will ask the media to kindly be in listen-only mode. And today, we're going to have some prepared remarks from our Chief Financial Officer and our Chief Executive Officer, followed by some Q&A. So with that, I would like to start by introducing Mike Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer.
Michael T. Lawton: Thanks, Lynn, and good morning, everyone. We continue to build on the positive results we had in the first quarter and delivered another quarter of solid results for our shareholders. Our international division lead the way with both strong same-store sales and store comp growth. And our domestic stores posted positive same-store sales and net positive store growth. Our bottom line grew in the second quarter with 17.5% EPS growth over the prior year, which provided additional free cash flow for share repurchases. Here's how the second quarter came together. Our global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchise and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 7.9% when excluding the impact of foreign currency. When we include the negative currency impact, our global retail sales grew by 4.3%. The drivers of the global retail sales growth included domestic same-store sales, which grew 1.7% in the second quarter, lapping a positive 4.8% in the prior-year quarter. This was comprised of franchisee same-store sales, which were up 1.9% and company-owned store sales which were up 0.3%. Our international division had another strong quarter as same-store sales grew 5.7%, lapping a very strong 7.4% last year. We opened 3 net stores domestically, made up of 8 store openings and 5 closures. Our international division grew by a net 111 stores this quarter, made up of 120 store openings and 9 closures, bringing the total store count to over 5,000 as of the end of the second quarter. Turning to revenues. Our total revenues for the second quarter were down $8.8 million or 2.3% from the prior-year quarter. This decrease was primarily the result of 2 factors: First, supply chain revenues declined as a result of reduced volumes that were due primarily to slightly lower order counts at the store level; second, company-owned store revenues declined due to the sale of some corporate stores in 2011 and early in 2012. Both of these decreases were mitigated by higher international and domestic franchise revenue. More detail regarding our revenue by business unit can be found in our 10-Q, which was filed this morning. Now moving onto operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, our consolidated operating margin increased 1.7% from 28.8% to 30.5% due primarily to a change in our mix of revenues resulting from fewer company-owned stores and increased franchise revenues. We also had an increase in our company-owned store operating margin. Operating margins for our company-owned stores, as a percentage of revenues, increased 3.6% on the prior-year quarter, in part due to the impact -- the positive impact of a higher average ticket, some product mix and reduced occupancy cost. Our supply chain margin percentage was flat at 10.8% quarter-over-quarter. The average cheese block price in the second quarter was $1.52 per pound versus $1.68 per pound last year, which led to a slight decrease in our overall market basket during the quarter. Now as many of you are aware, grain and other commodity prices have risen recently as a result of the dry weather across the country. Despite these recent increases, we continue to expect that our overall market basket in 2012 will be up just 1% to 2% over 2011 levels due to the fixed pricing that we have on approximately 35% to 40% of our expected purchases in 2012. Turning to G&A expenses. G&A increased slightly in the second quarter versus the prior-year quarter. Our intention was and remains to strengthen key areas of our business including information technology and international. We've been working on filling all of the open positions in these key areas and are making progress. However, finding the right people has taken a little longer than planned, and due to the delay in filling these open positions, we're now trending below our previously-anticipated spend in these areas. We're now currently estimating G&A to be up $5 million to $7 million over 2011 reported results. Our net income, as reported, was up $2.8 million or 11.3%. This increase was primarily the result of our higher domestic and international same-store sales, international store growth and higher company-owned store margins. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our international royalties. We reduced our share count by purchasing approximately 1.1 million shares for $36.9 million or an average price of $32.15 per share during the quarter. And so far during the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 129,000 additional shares for $3.7 million or an average price of $29 per share. Our second quarter diluted EPS, as reported on a GAAP basis, was $0.47. There were no significant items that affected comparability during the quarter. The $0.47 was a $0.07 or 17.5% increase from the $0.40 in the second quarter of last year. Here's how the $0.07 breaks down. Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.055. Our lower diluted share count primarily due to the share repurchases in 2011 and in 2012 benefited us by approximately $0.03, and foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by about $0.015. In closing, we're pleased with the operating results this quarter as we continue to grow our business and drive strong EPS growth. We're committed to continue to drive improved operating results and return value to our shareholders. Thanks for your time today, and now I'll turn it over to Patrick.
J. Patrick Doyle: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As Mike just said, we couldn't be more pleased with our 17.5% increase in EPS despite a fairly tepid world economy. We had solid earnings growth, positive same-store sales right in line with our long-range outlook, as well as robust store growth internationally and a continued strengthening of our domestic store profitability. This quarter is a perfect example of how our model can reliably produce strong EPS growth with the long-range outlook that we provide. This kind of performance for domestic and international sales, combined with strong store growth and the thoughtful deployment of our free cash flow has been the investment thesis we've presented and demonstrated over time. Our domestic same-store sales this quarter were right in line with where we'd expect them to be based on historical precedent and our long-term outlook of plus 1% to plus 3% up on an annual basis. Meanwhile, our international sales continue to be strong despite the noise out of Europe. Our business there continues to perform well. The U.K. is our largest operation in that region. They reported their half year results just yesterday, and they're continuing their remarkable streak of positive same-store sales and store growth. Anecdotally, they also reported that they experienced terrific online sales the afternoon of the men's Wimbledon match with over GBP 1.2 million in sales that Sunday alone, evidence that sports online ordering and pizza delivery are a perfect consumer combination. Even though I talked a bit about Europe, I'd like to make the larger point that one of the great strengths of our international portfolio is that it is not greatly concentrated in any one geographic area. We're a diversified brand with stores in every region of the world, which is why our international performance has been so consistent. It's also part of what drove the accelerated store growth we saw in the quarter, up 111 net new stores. On a trailing 12-month basis, we've now actually grown 481 net new stores internationally, a record pace for Domino's Pizza international. We have real traction with the Domino's brand around the world, and the resulting strong per-store returns have been a catalyst for this accelerated store growth. We highlighted our international success this quarter when we announced another important store growth milestone. We exceeded 5,000 international Domino's Pizza stores. We commemorated this milestone with celebrations in some of the newest and fastest-growing markets in our system -- Brazil, Germany and Malaysia. We now operate nearly 10,000 stores globally in 72 international markets. Our congratulations go to our international master franchise partners, their teams and the Domino's international team for reaching this milestone and for their continued success. On the U.S. side, we also posted consistent same-store sales and strong store profits again this quarter. This continued improvement in store profitability drove modest U.S. store growth of plus 3 net new stores. Underlying this though was a positive trend of fewer store closings, 5 versus 28 in the prior-year quarter. As we've experienced in so many international markets, we believe this is a direct result of improved unit economics and better store profitability. Compared with the first 6 months of last year, first half 2012 franchise reported profitability was up by about $5,000 per store or up about 18% per store. Our corporate store profits were up even more. There are a lot of moving pieces when it comes to what has improved store profitability lately, from promotions and pricing and a manageable food cost environment, to improved energy and labor efficiencies. But we know one key element is technology. Online orders continue to drive sales and mobile ordering is growing at a steady clip. Both of our U.S. mobile apps, iPhone and Android, are in the top 10 lifestyle and food and drink rankings in the iTunes store and on Google Play, and both are ranked higher than either of our main competitors. Our ordering apps -- iPhone, Android, Kindle -- have been downloaded almost 3.5 million times. Domino's now offers its mobile ordering app to more than 80% of the smartphones in the U.S. We also announced during the second quarter that for the first time in our history, we surpassed the $1 billion mark in digital sales in the U.S. alone during the trailing 12 months ending April 2012. As a company, we're going to remain focused on innovation for our consumers, and much of that will come in the form of new technology, offering convenience and efficient ways to order from us. That includes the new Kindle Fire ordering app we rolled out earlier this month. As Mike mentioned, we were very active this quarter repurchasing our stock. We bought back $37 million worth of shares, bringing us close to our share repurchase program's maximum. Since we were nearing our approved limit, we went to the board this month to get a reauthorization to purchase more shares. I'm pleased to say that the board agreed, and we now have $200 million available in our open market repurchase authorization. We've now gone to our board for share authorizations 3 times since going public in 2004. This demonstrates our commitment to act on the behalf of our shareholders, not just create fodder for press releases. Historically, we have never sat on cash. We strategically deployed it, including both special and regular dividends, share repurchases and debt buybacks. In conclusion, we have a lot to be proud of this quarter. We've continued to have success internationally. We opened stores and sold pizza to consumers worldwide. We had a new store growth milestone internationally and grew store profits here in the U.S. And we deployed our cash judiciously towards share repurchases to benefit our shareholders. With that, I'd like to ask the operator to open the lines for any questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Glass.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: First, if I could just ask about the U.S. same-store sales. And certainly, it suggests your model within that 1% to 3% can deliver mid-teens earnings growth. But, one, company stores, same-store sales were less than franchise, if you could just comment on that? And secondly, I think last quarter, there was conversation about transaction counts being negative. And my guess is they still are, at least the company stores. So -- and maybe you were thinking about last quarter, how do you address the transaction count issue? You want margins to be good, but you also want to grow transaction counts. So maybe were you disappointed at all in that? And going forward, just conceptually, how do you think about transaction counts versus total comps?
J. Patrick Doyle: Sure. Thanks, John. First, the corporate versus franchise. I mean those numbers are always kind of moving around. I think we're actually rolling in the second quarter of last year about 0.5 point higher numbers on the corporate store side. And the answer is the same as it usually is, which is it's just about geographies and a little bit of movement up and down. And I think you're always going to get some differential just given the size of the base of the corporate store side. So we were negative on order counts in the second quarter, and it's something that we absolutely continue to focus on hard. That's, to me, the one disappointment in the quarter is we've got to be positive on order counts domestically over time. And we're doing things to address that. But -- so I think you're going to see things from us that are going to, hopefully, move that the right direction, but that's something that was an outcome of decisions that we made over the course of the quarter on what we are promoting, et cetera. But clearly, we want and need positive order counts on the domestic side.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: And just to follow-up on that, do you believe it is something -- it's self-inflicted as the choices of things you promoted, or is it a competitive issue with perhaps Pizza Hut's resurgence in their sales growth, or do you think it's a combination?
J. Patrick Doyle: No. I think it's really about the things that we're doing. The fact is, I think while the category is competitive, we really don't see that much effect on our business from anything that any individual competitor is doing. I mean, we've done a lot of analysis around that, and our ability to grow the business is 95% about what we do as opposed to anything we're experiencing from the competition.
John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And just lastly, you did highlight something interesting. Obviously, the combination of sports and delivery pizzas goes way back in the U.S., and now you're setting examples internationally. Is there any -- currently any international or global tie-ins that you're doing at sporting events? Is that an opportunity over time, really one of your non-pizza competitors sponsors a major -- the Olympic event, is there a way to think about how you tied up your brand globally into sports to firm up that tie-in?
J. Patrick Doyle: It's -- generally, it's very regional in terms of the different events that are going on. So for instance, with the Olympics coming up here, that's probably for a few weeks, a net positive thing, mostly in Europe just because of the time zones. And so what we've experienced is when we had the Olympics in Japan and Korea, because of the time of the day that they're running live, it doesn't affect the business as much in the U.S. But the answer is -- so the answer is, there are opportunities for tie-ins with sports that are going to tend to be, for us, more a local thing or a country-by-country decision than anything we're going to do globally.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I wanted to just follow up, actually, first on John's question on the transaction counts being down in the U.S. And you said you were doing some things to address that. Can you be -- to the extent that you can, be a little more specific? Are we talking about some new products on the horizon that you're excited about? Some incremental promotions, or -- the -- in the way you're going to approach it that way or something different than that?
J. Patrick Doyle: Well, despite what I just said about competitive activity not affecting us that much, we're not going to tip them off too much to our plans. I guess, what I'll -- all I can say is it's certainly something we're very focused on. It's important for the long-term health of the business. So when we're not getting order count growth, it's something we're going to look at and work on very hard and we've got to get it back that way. So you will certainly see some changes, but other than that, I'm not going to tip off the competitors anymore.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then looking outside the U.S., international same-store sales were better than last quarter and flat on a 2-year basis despite some slowing in the global economy. I'd love to hear just some granularity to the extent that you can provide it on where you're seeing a little bit of softness and where things are holding up really well?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. It's -- you know what? It's pretty broad. I've said in the past that we've certainly seen weakness in Greece, but we've got 35 stores there, and are working with our master franchisee on the ground to strengthen that business. We've seen a little weakness in Spain, but only a little. And really after that, the rest of Europe is strong. Asia is strong. I mean it's really -- it's very, very broad-based. And it's frankly something that we've been concerned about. I mean as you see the weakening economy, particularly in Europe, as we see those sales come in, it's something we've been looking at very closely for signs of weakness. And it just hasn't been there.
Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And one last one. McDonald's yesterday said that their latest projections regarding the Affordable Care Act, that it would cost about $10,000 to $30,000 per restaurant in 2014 or thereabouts. For them, that's a small percentage. For you guys, it's much more meaningful for your franchisees as a percent of profits. I'd love to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about it, and what that might look like for you guys in a couple of years here.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, well, I mean clearly, McDonald's employs a lot more people per store than we do on average. I will tell you that this is the case of -- or an instance of the devil's in the details, and the details aren't resolved yet. There are still a lot of things that need to be nailed down in terms of look-back periods and how long does somebody have to have been an employee for you and how consistently do they have to have been above a 30-hour level. And just all sorts of things that, frankly, from a unit economic standpoint, could still have a pretty material impact. So the answer is, it's certainly likely to be a cost, but in terms of nailing down the exact number, we've done it for -- the way it's written today. But I'm pretty sure you're going to see change between where we are today and when it gets enacted.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner.
Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division: With domestic store profits sitting here at all-time highs, what are you hearing from your franchisees as far as what type of visibility do you have into the backlog for domestic unit growth? Because it is -- and that unit growth is kind of more about just not so many closing, not really so many opening. So I'm also kind of just wondering if you could also kind of touch on what maybe you are doing internally at the corporate level to maybe also try to drive some enhanced unit growth domestically?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. Yes, I think the answer, Brian, is you got it exactly right. I mean in terms of second quarter, the story was more about lack of closures than it was about new openings. And that's ultimately a very healthy thing. I mean, the 5 closures in the second quarter was as low a number as I can remember for a very, very long time. And the unit economics are getting much healthier. I think my answer in terms of openings is going to be consistent with what I've said in the past, which is, we want to get back to some modest positive net growth domestically. We have more people working on it, and working with our franchisees on that than we have in the recent past. But it's still going to take some time. Financing is now, I'd say, much better and more available for larger franchisees. There is definitely access for our bigger players, but for 1 and 2 store folks that want to add another store, it's still relatively tough out there. So that's some of the constraint. And I think you're going to see what has been, I think, a little bit more conservative mindset given what we've all gone through the last 3 or 4 years. It's going to take some time before that's really going to crank up again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a little clarification on the G&A. Is the $5 million to $7 million full year increase what the reported number will look like? Is that net of any additional franchise payments or additional services you're providing?
Michael T. Lawton: That would be versus last year's reported numbers, so it will include -- it's not net of anything that we would collect from the franchisees for online or anything like that which is booked in revenue.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. So reported G&A number will be up $5 million to $7 million from the reported number of last year?
Michael T. Lawton: That's correct.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. The payments that we get, for instance, on online ordering come in as a revenue. They're not kind of netted out against the expense.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. And then, I've seen the sandwiches being advertised again recently. And I guess I'm curious, can you talk a little bit about that? Is this the first time in a while you've featured those on TV? And just maybe within your answer, talk a little bit about what you promoted this quarter versus the first quarter, where some of the side item promotions factored into the transaction counts of buying and better profitability?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, so it has been mostly sandwiches for this quarter so far with the -- along with the early-week carryout special. But -- I'm sorry, your question was on Q2 or on Q3?
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Well, it was sort of both. Sandwiches have been more Q3, haven't they not?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, sandwiches have been -- yes. So far, in Q3, it's been mostly sandwiches. You're right, it has been a couple of years since we hit sandwiches. They've continued to do very well for us over time, even without advertising support. So it was definitely time to come back around to those. Second quarter was more around Artisan. I think for the quarter, we also had -- cheesy bread was finishing up kind of in the front part of the second quarter. And -- but sandwiches have been real successful, held together very nicely without television support. And it was just definitely time to come back around and hit those again.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Okay. Is there any new news around the sandwiches, or are you basically just featuring the existing products?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, I mean there's a new sandwich in the line, but it's really featuring the whole line again.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: A couple of questions. One, a follow-up on the franchisees with the less closures and the hope for openings. I know there was discussion about financial incentives. So you talked about kind of financial side of things. I'm wondering whether that's ever been considered before considering the strong positioning you're in right now to accelerate the growth, whether it be royalty relief or just marketing spend? You mentioned the one and twosie franchisee who has a tough time getting financing, whether you'd provide any kind of support for that to what would seem to be to accelerate the growth in good time.
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, Jeffrey, the answer is, we've always got some incentives out there, I mean, have always had. We've got some that are a little more targeted right now at some specific geographies where we think there are opportunities for growth. If the question goes towards are we going to get into the lending business to try to generate store growth, the answer is no. We use our balance sheet very lightly for that. So are there going to be exceptions on that along the way? Yes. Do we have a little bit? Yes, but certainly, we're not going to make the material shift in strategy and using our balance sheet to kind of support the store growth. We don't think that's the right answer. But -- so, yes, there are some growth incentives out there. They may be a little bit better with some specific opportunities, but we kind of balance that out, and there have typically been some in the past as well. In fact, there have always been some in the past.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got you. And just as a follow-up to the, I guess, the margin versus traffic question. I think last quarter, you talked about -- some quarters, it's self-inflicted and you're not opposed to necessarily, not that you ever want to see traffic down a little bit, but you run some of these side items perhaps acknowledging that, that was going to be the case with lower traffic. Obviously, the second quarter was somewhat of a mix, but now with the third quarter being the sandwich promotion at least thus far, would that be a product that you would say is more of a center of the plate driver and therefore should drive traffic? And inherently, I guess you would be more disappointed in the third quarter if you didn't get the traffic lift or are you willing to sacrifice that further? I thought kind of center of the plate pizzas were the one that you said, you know what, that will drive the positive traffic again, if and when we want to do that?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. I guess what I'd say is, anytime -- I mean, there is absolutely going to be some balance and there are going to be some things that you think are going to drive it a little better than others. But anytime order counts are not positive, we're not going to be happy about it. And so as we put together our plan, that is certainly always the goal. There are some things that we know are going to drive that a little bit more relative to others, some things that are going to drive ticket a little bit more, and it's about getting the balance. But anytime that I'm telling you that orders aren't positive, I'm not going to be happy with that.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got you. And did you say from a franchise side that profitability was up $5,000 in the first half of the year? I think you have told us in the past that 2011 profit for the full year was up -- was in total $69,000 per store? Is that apples to apples, that $69,000 a store?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes. Yes, I think it was around $70,000 last year. But kind of in that range. So we got -- we've talked about a range in the past of kind of $50,000 to $75,000. In the '08 time range, we were at the bottom end of that. We've now gotten back to up to the top end of that. And yes, you heard it right. The first 6 months or first half of the year, we were -- our franchise stores look like they were up around $5,000 versus the first half of last year. So a really nice move forward. And if you look at our corporate store numbers, they're actually up quite a bit more than that on a year-over-year basis.
Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got it. And just lastly on the cash usage -- cash usage, I should say, seems like in the past was all about debt paydown and now it seems like debt is pretty close to par, which I'm guessing is what you're seeing now and, therefore, we should expect a more -- just a more aggressive share repurchase activity in future quarters?
J. Patrick Doyle: Only if you tell me what the debt is going to trade at, the stock is going to trade at and overall market conditions. And that's -- I mean, that's the answer. I mean, we're looking at all the possible uses of the cash, and we're going to use it in the way that we think is going to generate the best returns for our shareholders, and that's going to change based on how the debt is trading and how the stock is trading and overall market conditions. So clearly, second quarter, the answer was we thought buying our stock was the best use of cash, and that will change based on the market conditions.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: My first question is on margins. And the margin expansion was very strong this quarter. It has been for the past few quarters. And just on this quarter, how much of that expansion would you say is more maybe fundamental in terms of online ordering driving margins? Perhaps that increased focus on add-on sales driving margins versus just lower cheese cost or lower commodities. I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of this expansion you would say is more fundamental or sustainable?
Michael T. Lawton: Mitch, I would say that the majority of it's got to do with the kind of product mix that we had, pricing that was out there. The fact is commodities for the quarter were relatively stable year-on-year, so it was not that we were getting a breakout of commodities, we just priced for it. We did get a little bit more leverage on our labor, which is attributable to, in part, to the online. But I would put more of it on the product mix of what we were selling.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay, great. Because I believe your store margins now for the company stores are in that 24.5%, 25% range. Do you view that as a level that can be held up over the next few years?
Michael T. Lawton: I think that's always dependent upon a lot of circumstances between what food costs could do, what ObamaCare can do, what -- I mean, there's a lot of things that can affect us over time. We're going to try and make up for it, what those are, but it certainly is a level that we like to be at.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay, great. And the Parmesan bites you did as a $1 add-on in the first quarter, and I believe you did heavily advertise it. There wasn't any advertising, I think, for that add-on in the second quarter. Can you give us a sense did that momentum sustain without the advertising?
J. Patrick Doyle: We're still definitely selling Parm bites. But you're always going to have the mix on that ease off when you go off air. So are they off from where they were when we were on television? Absolutely. But they're still moving nicely.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Yes, I'm sure it is off a bit. But yes, I guess, it's still -- would you say it was a margin contributor in the second quarter?
J. Patrick Doyle: Versus the prior year, yes. Versus the first quarter, it was probably off a bit. It was off a bit.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay, understood. And just a question I've been getting a lot, I'd just like to ask you, it's been very warm weather. And any history around heat waves and how your sales seem to do during particularly hot weather periods?
Michael T. Lawton: Now we've talked in the first quarter about the fact that we had unusually weird weather in the first quarter and analyzed it and had not had a lot of impact, and really the same kind of holds true for the second quarter. Weather just is not over the course of a quarter and across the country, as big as U.S., just doesn't make that much difference.
Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated: Okay, great. And I think my last question is just you mentioned lower occupancy as one of the store level margin drivers. Can you just comment on that more? Was it sales leverage, or was it renegotiating leases that helped out the occupancy more?
Michael T. Lawton: It's a little bit of renegotiating leases, it's a little bit of leverage, and it's also a little bit of the fact that energy cost that you use in the store are down a little bit. Natural gas has been coming down in a few markets, and that's helped a little bit.
Operator: Your next question is from Alvin Concepcion.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: We've heard a few companies call out a domestic consumer slowdown impacting sales trends. But it doesn't appear to have been an issue for you in the quarter. Have you seen any signs of that in your business or for the pizza category in general?
J. Patrick Doyle: Well, our -- as I've said before, our order counts weren't positive in the second quarter. But I think the answer is, the U.S. consumer is still being pretty conservative about how they're spending money. The pizza category looks like it's continuing to be up a little bit, which is a positive from where it's been prior to the last couple of years. So we view that as a positive change overall. But I think that the U.S. consumer is still pretty darn conservative. And until we get some of the uncertainty resolved around the economy and taxes and et cetera, I think the consumer is going to stay pretty conservative.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on international. You mentioned Europe continues to perform well. Are you gaining share there? And if that's the case, where do you think it's coming from?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, I mean, I think we've been gaining share for quite a while outside of U.S. and continue to. The best information we get is that outside of the U.S., we think the category is growing at about a 5% kind of a clip. And if you look at our store growth and our same-store sales growth, we're clearly taking share out there. And some of that is -- but with a growing category, it's more a question of who's getting more than their fair share of the growth as opposed to it necessarily coming out of somebody else's hide. And so I think it's more of that. We're clearly outperforming the category by a lot outside of the U.S., but it's in a pretty healthy category.
Alvin C. Concepcion - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. And just one more. Can you talk about the consumer reaction so far on the gluten-free crust? I mean, did you see new customers checking out the pizza that weren't there before?
J. Patrick Doyle: Yes, we did. And we got pretty much exactly what we expected out of it. It's a small part of the business. It was expected to be a small part of the business. But for those who wanted gluten-free crust, it's a pretty big deal that we're offering it now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Anderson.
Stephen Anderson - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on the international side. There's -- a pretty large competitor has announced that they're moving more towards value platforms. In fact, one of the competitors mentioned they are cutting prices across India just as an example. Have you or the franchisees have felt any kind of pressure to engage in more aggressive discounting as some of your competitors have?
J. Patrick Doyle: No. I mean, the fact is category is growing. And you look at India and you know the story well there, our business has been absolutely booming in India and commodity prices have been up pretty good in India. So the answer is, no. I mean we've -- our group over there has announced when they've taken price increases and they have taken some price increases to offset the commodity pressure in India.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe.
John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: If I may, I mean, just looking at one of your competitors, Pizza Hut, I guess I'll say it, not to be obvious, in the U.S., they're talking about a delivery carryout like kind of a light model that I guess will be maybe used for smaller markets and other types of things. And I was wondering if -- I mean, are those the types of markets that you're in, or are those the types of markets that you could be in? I mean, is there any thought of kind of developing something similar to the format that they've talked about? So that's one question. And then completely separately, Patrick, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned Brazil. And I just checked my notes, and I don't think it's a top 10 market for you guys. But it might be interesting for many of us on the call for you to kind of talk about where you are in Brazil, who your partners are, what the growth strategy may be in that, what's obviously a very big market in the next several years.
J. Patrick Doyle: So the answer in terms of Pizza Hut's, the model that you're talking about, is it's our model. They're basically talking about kind of a move away from their restaurants, their red roofs and using smaller footprints. And I think they've talked about that publicly before, that as they've looked at kind of their model and our model, they've seen some of the advantages in the approach that we've taken, the smaller footprint, et cetera. So that's the answer there. They're kind of -- if they're talking about that, I think that's really a move towards more Delco units than where they've historically been. In terms of Brazil, it is still relatively small, but it's growing nicely. We're getting good results there. We've got a strong partner down there that owns an Italian concept with a couple of hundred units. So, good experience in the restaurant industry. And we're getting good results. So you're right, it hasn't cracked the top 10 yet, but given the size and scale of the market, we're pleased with where we are, and really making very, very good progress down there. So that's something that probably won't hit the radar quite as much for a few more years, but it's an area where we're putting on a lot of focus.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh.
Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC: Great. Just a quick question. Where do you guys stand on China, in growing there and finding franchisees to develop further?
J. Patrick Doyle: We've got a couple of dozen stores in Mainland China now. We're making progress. We've got a new partner that we're very happy with. We think we're running our stores better than we were before. They've got a good team on the ground. And I think we've got the model where it needs to be. We'd experimented with some bigger units over there over the past few years. And while we were experimenting with that, the consumer came towards us and started putting more value on the convenience of delivery. So we've kind of reset our model over there and definitely, it looks far more like a standard Domino's business now than it would have 2 or 3 years ago. So still very early, but like our partners, like the progress that we're making, we think we've got the model where it needs to be now. And kind of like Brazil, big market, so it's an area that's going to get a lot of focus over the next few years.
Operator: Your final question comes from the line of Joe Buckley.
Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I'm actually good.
Operator: And there are no additional questions at this time.
J. Patrick Doyle: All right. Well, thank you, all, for your questions today and being on the call. We look forward to speaking with you in October for our third quarter call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-05-01 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, my name is Tamisha, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2012 Financial Results conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Linda Liddle (sic) [Lynn Liddle], you may begin. 
Lynn Liddle: Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us this morning. A couple of quick housekeeping things, make sure that you do take a look at our Safe Harbor statement in the event that any forward-looking statements are mentioned and then also, this is an investor design call so please members of the media, if you would be in a listen-only mode, we would appreciate that. We have some prepared remarks this morning followed by Q&A and we're going to begin with our Chief Financial Officer, and then our CEO will join us after that. So we're going to start with Mike Lawton, Chief Financial Officer. 
Michael Lawton: Thanks, Lynn and good morning everyone. During the first quarter, we continued to grow our same-store sales both domestically and internationally, and had strong store growth in our international markets, which we believe shows that our strategies are working. We continue to drive shareholder value with 12% adjusted EPS growth. Overall, we are pleased with the operating results this quarter. 
 During the quarter, we announced the successful completion of the recapitalization of our company and as a result, we incurred certain expenses that affected comparability this quarter, which are disclosed in our filings issued this morning. Subsequent to the quarter, we used a combination of cash on hand and some of the proceeds from our recapitalization to reward our shareholders with a $3 per share special dividend. 
 So now, let's dive into our first quarter results. I'll start by looking at our system-wide sales for the quarter. Our global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchisee and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 7.2% during the quarter when excluding the impact of foreign currency. When we include the negative impact of currency, our global retail sales grew 6.1%. The drivers of the global retail sales growth included domestic same-store sales, which grew 2% in the first quarter, lapping a negative 1.4% in the prior-year quarter. 
 Broken down, franchisee same-store sales were up 2.1% for the quarter, while company-owned stores were up 1.6%. Also, international had another strong quarter as same-store sales grew 4.7%, which was lapping a very strong 8.3% in the prior-year quarter. 
 We closed a net 9 stores domestically, made up of 13 store openings and 22 closures. Our international division grew by a net 77 stores this quarter, bringing the total store count to 4,912 as of the end of the first quarter. 
 Turning to revenues, our total revenues for the first quarter were down $4.6 million or 1.2% from the prior-year quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by lower company-owned store revenues resulting from the sale of 58 company-owned stores during 2011 and to a lesser extent, lower supply chain revenues. The decline in our supply chain revenues was due primarily to reduced volumes that resulted from lower order counts at the store level and a change in the mix of products sold per order. These declines were partially offset by higher commodity prices. 
 Our promotions this quarter focused on side items, primarily Stuffed Cheesy Bread and Parmesan bread bites. While these did not end up growing order count, they did as intended, raised ticket and sales and store level profits. 
 The previously mentioned decreases in our domestic businesses were offset in part by higher international revenues resulting primarily from same-store sales and store count growth and higher domestic franchisee revenues. More detail regarding our revenue by business unit can be found in our 10-Q, which was filed this morning. 
 Moving on to our operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, our consolidated operating margin increased 1.1% from 28.7% to 29.8% quarter-over-quarter. This was due primarily to a change in the mix of revenues attributable to fewer company-owned stores and increased franchise revenues. 
 Operating margins for our company-owned stores as a percentage of revenues increased 2.9% from the prior year quarter, in part to due to the positive impact of a higher average ticket. These increases were offset in part by a 0.6% decrease in supply chain margin percentage versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to an impact of slightly higher commodity cost, higher fuel costs and to a lesser extent, lower volumes. 
 As a reminder, food commodities are priced on a constant dollar mark up to our franchisees, therefore increases in commodity costs do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, negatively impact our supply chain margin as a percent of revenues. 
 The average cheese block price in the first quarter was $1.52 per pound versus $1.69 in last year's quarter, which moderated the overall increase in our market basket during the quarter. We continue to expect our market basket for 2012 will increase 1% to 2% over 2011 levels, which is consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. We have fixed pricing on approximately 35% to 40% of our expected purchases in 2012. 
 Turning to G&A expenses. G&A increased $1.3 million or 2.7% quarter-over-quarter. When you exclude the $1.7 million impact from the sale of company-owned operations in 2011 and the $300,000 of recapitalization-related expenses incurred in 2012, G&A was down $700,000. This $700,000 decrease was due primarily to lower variable performance-based bonuses quarter-over-quarter and the timing of expenses. 
 We have previously indicated that in 2012, we expect an additional $8 million to $10 million of incremental G&A expense from 2011 reported levels, which seems to contradict what I just said. Please remember that variable G&A, including variable compensation can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Where we stand today, we still expect to have higher G&A in 2012, but we are currently trending towards the lower end of the range previously given. 
 Regarding income taxes. During the first quarter, we had a higher effective tax rate versus the prior-year quarter, due primarily to evaluation allowance recorded on a deferred tax asset of $900,000. We continue to expect that 38% to 39% will be our normalized effective tax rate for the foreseeable future. 
 Our net income as reported, was down $6.4 million or 23.5%. This decrease was primarily the result of $7.4 million of after-tax expenses that affected comparability this quarter, these are outlined in a table in our 8-K. Our net income benefited from higher domestic and international same-store sales, international store growth, and higher company-owned store margins, and was negatively impacted by our lower supply chain margin. 
 Our first quarter diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.35, and $0.47 when adjusted for items affected comparability. These items are outlined in the 8-K released this morning. The $0.47 is a $0.05 or 12% increase from the $0.42 as adjusted EPS, in the first quarter of last year. 
 Here's how the $0.05 difference breaks down. Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.05; our lower diluted share count, primarily due to our share repurchases in 2011, benefited us by $0.02; foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted us by $0.01; and our higher interest expense for the quarter negatively impacted us by $0.01. 
 Now let me step back for a moment and talk to you about our interest rate going forward. As a result of our recapitalization, our all-in interest-rate including fees and amortization of financing cost, will be approximately 5.7%, which is lower than the rate prior to the recapitalization. This rate assumes no draws on our revolver. 
 Now turning to liquidity. We ended the quarter with almost $215 million of unrestricted cash, of which approximately $185 million was paid out after the end of the quarter in the form of a $3 per share special dividend. We'd also like to remind everyone that we currently have $82 million remaining authorized under our open market share repurchase program for future share repurchases. This is another way that we can deliver returns to our shareholders, and management will continue to evaluate all potential means to deliver these returns. 
 In closing, we are pleased with the results in this quarter. We will continue to focus on driving shareholder value through our operating results and our use of strong cash flow. 
 Thanks for your time today and now I'll turn it over to Patrick. 
J. Doyle: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. I can report that we delivered another good quarter with positive EPS growth, robust international unit and same-store sales growth and positive U.S. sales comp that fell exactly in the middle of our long-term guidance. 
 Our brand and system continue to strengthen both domestically and internationally and our technological leadership continues to resonate with consumers around the globe. Our international brand equity comes from having a recognized name that's known for quality products, excellent service and engaging technology. 
 For example, one of our international store growth leaders this quarter was Turkey, a market with excellent store operations and great service. And digital ordering is driving gains in countries like India and the U.K., where they recently reported a 44% increase in online sales, and that mobile orders now comprise 16% of the U.K.'s total digital orders. 
 These business drivers are behind an international enterprises that produces strong stores with excellent returns, which in turn spurs franchisees to build more stores, and now the reason why our international business continues to grow at the rate and pace we've seen over the last few years. 
 As a matter fact, as of last quarter, we now have more Domino's Pizza stores outside of the U.S. than we do within the U.S. 
 I want to take a moment to really punctuate that point, and congratulate our Domino's International community for reaching this incredible milestone. It's a testament to our strong international franchisees and our international team, and more proof of the opportunities that exists for our company on the international front. This achievement was helped by robust unit growth in the first quarter, one of the strongest first quarter store growth performances in our company's history. In fact, it marked the highest first quarter global store growth number for Domino's in a decade, and the highest Q1 for our International division ever. 
 The day when Domino's Pizza worldwide has 10,000 stores is not far off. It's a milestone I look forward to celebrating soon. 
 International sales, meanwhile, continued to grow strongly in the first quarter as well. I've often said that pizza isn't recession proof, but it is recession resistant and we're proving that theory right now in many of our European markets, where the economy has been weak. Our Asia region also posted strong results with solid sales in Japan, Australia and South Korea. The U.S. also performed well again this quarter, sustaining the positive sales trend on our bigger base and continued to benefit from the great brand equity we've built over the past few years. 
 During the quarter, we once again promoted a non-pizza side item, Parmesan bread bites, which was excellent for building tickets. It was also a very profitable item for the stores to sell, which makes our franchisees happy. While it didn't drive traffic like a pizza-focus promotion might do, we felt that focusing on some -- on promoting some higher margin items, combined with promotions for some higher traffic driving items during the year, would balance out our marketing calendar, and drive up store profits and sales in 2012. 
 Our corporate stores posted better profits in the first quarter and our franchisees saw strong profit growth as well. We know that profitable franchisees make for a healthy system. Our focus is on helping our franchisees generate strong store profits and to turn those profits into new stores, so that our domestic store growth rate improves. 
 Managing our marketing calendar is an important part of managing our system from a store growth and sales perspective. So some promotions may be designed to drive margin and others to drive more traffic, but we're making sure we're managing the promotions and brand message for the entire system, and it's one of the most important jobs of a franchisor. 
 One topic that's been all over the news recently is the price of gas, so I thought I'd spend a minute on that topic. Let me remind you that for us, the biggest potential impact from gas prices is the effect they can have longer term on commodity prices. 
 At the store level, franchisees may have to pay delivery drivers and increase in mileage reimbursement, but it's usually not a big impact in overall store. In our supply chain, we experience the impact of diesel prices but we also have fuel surcharges that help offset some of those costs. So while we do care about higher fuel costs, the direct impact to us and our system is smaller than many people assume. 
 One thing that continues to impact our system in a decidedly positive way is technology. In the first quarter here in the U.S., we launched our new Android app, joining the iPhone app that we launched last June. We're happy to report that roughly 7% of our total U.S. sales now come from mobile devices, including our 2 apps and existing mobile website. 
 The new Android app is already over 1% of total sales. So over 20% of our digital sales, now come from our mobile site and these 2 apps. The iPhone and Android apps are definitely helping sales, and they give consumers the ordering access that they've asked for and expect from an innovative company like ours. 
 Our recent TV commercial highlights another unique innovation from Domino's. We're using our iPad pizza hero game to hire great team members. If customers do well making online pizzas with the game, they might just get hired at a local Domino's store. We're probably not going to get a flood of new hires this way, but it does demonstrate that we're using innovative thinking here with technology often at the core. And we've got more technology news on the way this year. With Kevin Vasconi, our a new Chief Information Officer on board, we're excited about what the team can do to build on our technological advantage. 
 While technology differentiates us from many in our sector, another important feature of our business story is free cash flow and the financial management of this company. We averaged over $2 million a week in free cash flow over the last 12 months. This robust cash flow stream enables us to use our cash for any number of purposes for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders. 
 Most of you were probably on our call March 19, when we reviewed our successful recapitalization. So I'm not going to repeat all the details from that call. But I'd like to reiterate that we're very pleased with the new debt structure and that we were able to reward shareholders with a $3 special dividend. It shows our commitment to shareholders and our ability to make significant moves to reward them. 
 So with store level profits improving, consistent sales and store growth off to a great start combined with a successful recapitalization of our debt, I'm pleased that 2012 has started off well. 
 With that, I'd like to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. 
Brian Bittner: So the market was looking for a little bit higher domestic comps in the quarter, so maybe we can just first address the trends there. I understand the 2% that was reported was definitely in line with your long-term outlook. But I still think there are several reasons why I think the domestic comp could potentially outperform that goal in the more medium term. I think it might be logical to think that maybe the fantastic weather we had in January and February, might have shifted some spending away from delivery in the near term. So maybe you can talk to us about what you saw from a weather affect internally, maybe how you think about that internally? I realize you don't like to address inter-quarter trends or talk about how trends happen throughout the quarter. But any color you could potentially give us on that would be great. 
J. Doyle: Yes, it's Patrick. I -- first, I'll take the weather one. So we did a lot of analysis on weather and did some regression analysis, and really, dug deep on it because weather is something that gets talked about a lot across our industry and this was, for us, as negative a weather quarter as we could have. That said, our analysis said that it still just wasn't that big a deal for the quarter. It probably was a couple of tenths maybe slightly more than that, but it really was not a big effect. So when we kind of pulled out the weather by region and looked at the overall effect, at the end of the day for the quarter, it really was not that big a driver of the comp result. So I think the answer is first, what you said, which is our long-term guidance is kind of 1% to 3% for the domestic business and we came in, in the middle of that. Obviously, we've been performing the last couple of years at a higher level than that, but we think what we're proving is that we can grow off of this new higher base. That said, I think when we look at the quarter, it really -- the net effects of the quarter were primarily driven by what we were choosing to promote. Parmesan bread bites sold very, very well, but you're not going to drive robust order growth with a side item. I mean there is -- the analogy would be burger chains going on air, selling french fries. The answer is: you want people to know the Parm bread bites are there. It's effective for driving ticket and profits within the store, which I think really was the big positive new story out of the quarter, were store level margins moved really, really nicely forward. Fourth quarter was good, and first quarter was even stronger. I -- and we saw that corporate store margins were up 2.9% and we saw a nice movement from the franchisees. And that's something that I've been kind of calling out for a while, that we're very focused on and it wasn't something that we were seeing -- the level of improvement that we wanted over the last couple of years. We saw really nice store level margin improvement. So I think that's -- those are kind of the different kinds of factors. Weather, really was not that big a deal. It was as bad as it could be for us by being good, in the middle of the winter, but we just didn't see that much effect out of the weather. So I think honestly, we can kind of take that one off the table, and it really came down to what we were promoting; how it affected the overall traffic of the business, that we love what it was doing for store profits and we're still growing off of that higher base. 
Brian Bittner: And the restaurant margins have definitely improved, but I guess really the best way for shareholders to realize the benefit of that is for it to translate into unit growth because -- just because of the model. So maybe you can talk about -- maybe those margin improvement, how it -- it's obviously impacted the franchisees earnings, but what about the backlog for unit growth? Has it improved the backlog for unit growth? Maybe you can talk about the U.S. backlog for unit growth for 2012 and 2013. 
J. Doyle: Yes, I think the answer is, you're still not going to see anything meaningful in the near term on store growth. But over the medium term, getting store level profits to where they want to be is -- it clearly can become a driver for us. So I wouldn't start raising expectations around domestic-leveled store growth in the near term. But our view is, very strongly, that stores get built because they should be built. And it takes some time for that to cycle through, but our franchisees are in a much better place with their overall profitability than they've been. And frankly, then playing over to the international side, it's why we're seeing just incredibly robust results from the international side on store growth. If you look at the 77 net up, on the international side, it's the best we have done in the first quarter with the international business and you'll see that it's up pretty markedly from first quarter last year. The one thing that I would say on the domestic side is, if you look at the trends on closures, that trend is definitely moving in the right direction. So that's part of that net growth. Our other stores that are at the bottom, that aren't doing as well, that are kind of getting weeded out, the answer is you'll see some sequential reduction in the number of closes. That's probably showing up before you're going to see growth store openings. 
Brian Bittner: And this is just the last question from me. How should we think about the strategy for the rest of the year for the U.S.? Is it going to be a strategy where you're continuing to try to drive margin improvements and focus less on driving traffic? Or is it going to shift back towards traffic? How do we think about the strategy? Because it did shift in the first quarter and... 
J. Doyle: I think the answer is, you're going to see balance from us over the course of the year. It's got to be a balance of both ticket and some things that are more center of the plate, for us that means pizza, that are going to drive volume more and order counts more. But we look at it on a -- on an overall basis over the year, and obviously I'm not going to get into the specifics around what's coming. But I think the answer is expect some balance around side items and pizza. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. 
John Glass: If I could follow up on that line of questioning on the U.S. comps. Why did you choose now, to focus on store level margins? I've gone back just quickly and looked at store level margins, it seems like they've never been better. So it's not as if, I would think that there's a big complaint that they should be higher. Then maybe you could just underscore that, is there a significant, or is there an increased concern that margin should be higher at the store level by the franchisees? And I'm also surprised that given your ability to advertise both online as well -- and use the online messaging, as well as you're promotional activity on traditional media, that you couldn't balance both, that you couldn't have both drive traffic, as well as check? And maybe just the final -- might as well ask them all at once, maybe could you give a granularity, how much did order counts actually fall? And what was the order of magnitude that -- by which they fell off this quarter, just so we understand what the balance was this quarter. 
J. Doyle: Yes, I mean, we're not going to get into the specifics on the orders, but the answer was, they were a little negative. But that's as specific as we're going to get on it, and a number of things kind of going into that. But we're -- so that's the -- that's kind of, that side. But the margins I -- and in terms of franchisee profitability, you're right, they were very, very good. And relative to where they've been and yes, our franchisee is concerned about the profitability level. The answer is clearly they're -- they are unanimous in that, they would like them higher and so would we. And I guess the -- but I think the real punchline on that, is if you look at domestic unit growth for Domino's, we haven't moved for 2 decades, really. I mean, there have been years that have gone up and down, but the practical answer is, store growth hasn't moved now for quite some time and we're going to fix that over the medium term and part of that is, getting unit level profits to a higher level than where they've been. So we've got to do that in a balanced way. It's not a -- this may sound like it's a big shift in strategy. It's not. We've wanted to move store level profits up. We've made nice progress the last couple of years. We made particularly good progress in 2010. 2011 we made a little progress, not a lot. And it's something that we continue to focus on. We feel like if we can get unit profits moving consistently in the right direction, that's ultimately going to create great value for our shareholders, because it can generate store growth. I don't want to get ahead of myself in terms of kind of expectations around that. I -- the expectations we've given on stores are that the vast, vast majority of that in the near-term is going to come from international. And that that's really robust. But I understand there are fundamentally 4 levers for growing the top line in this business: international stores and comps and domestic stores and comps. And we've had 3 of the 4 of those, moving nicely. We've got to figure a way to get that fourth one going, and we're spending a lot of time and effort on figuring out how to get the store growth going. It's going to take some time but fundamental to that is continuing to improve store level profitability. 
John Glass: And if I can just -- one quick follow up. What store -- I can only see store level margins to your corporate stores, but so -- I'm not sure if that analogy carries over. Maybe franchisees are not as profitable. I understand they pay a royalty. But how much better -- what are, do you think, are franchises store level margins today? And how much better do you think they need to be, in order to -- for them to start opening stores again? 
J. Doyle: Yes, so -- I mean first of all, from a corporate store standpoint, that -- the royalty is included in there, right? It comes into our -- kind of, into the G&A ultimately. But in terms of how we measure store level profitability, we look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, franchise to corporate. And on average, dollar level profits, franchisees still make somewhat more money than our corporate stores do. We don't have perfect visibility on all of the store's profits, franchisee's profits in the first quarter, but we know they moved very nicely, the right direction. I can't tell you, if they were exactly the same kind of movements, as we saw in the corporate stores, but we get enough of them on a period basis to know that they're moving nicely in the right direction. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: Couple of questions. Just first, a follow up on kind of, the U.S. comp trend. I'm just wondering whether you'd give any color in terms of sequential trends through the quarter, only because it seemed like the broader industry might have slowed later in the quarter. And I think the debate going in was, when you look at comparisons on the U.S. business obviously this past year, you lapped a negative 1 to 2 points which some people might have -- where they expected a stronger comp. But then obviously, 2 years ago in the first quarter was your best comp in a long, long time. So I'm just wondering: one, the sequential trends through the quarter; and two, how you think about kind of, 1 year ago versus 2 year ago -- 2 years ago? Maybe consensus was too aggressive. I don't know what do you want to share, perhaps what your internal target was? I know it's 1 to 3 long term, but I'm just trying to get sense of 1 versus 2 year, especially because we look at the rest of the year, and the 1 year becomes more difficult from a comparison standpoint. So if I could get a sense to how you look at that. 
J. Doyle: Yes, so we're not going to get into kind of splitting out trends within the quarter, but you got it exactly right on the comps going back. It was a little negative. It think it was 1, 4 negative, last year but that was rolling over 14.3, the previous year. So it's a little bit unusual that you'd be talking about a 3-year comp, you really kind of need to, because last year was clearly very much a reflection of the previous year. And I think frankly, overachieved versus where all of us thought it was going to be. And so I -- really I think the answer is, go back to, kind of the long-term guidance which is, what we've said is, we've built this new bigger base of business. And we really believe that expectation should be -- over the long-term that we're going to grow kind of, low single digits off of that new higher base. We don't expect to give it back. We expect to grow off of it, but 2% is kind of right in the middle of really where we kind of expect the business to be, over the medium to long term. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: Okay, so then -- right, as we look after the rest of the course of this year. I know the first quarter, as we've talked about already, was more profit-driven promotion rather than traffic driven. But despite the balance that you're talking about, that you would say for the rest of the year that that's more of a reasonable run rate and it wasn't perhaps a deceleration or a shortfall in the first quarter that would correct itself, and still drive the outside comp, the rest of this year. 
J. Doyle: I guess, yes I'd -- go back to the 1 to 3. I mean, that's where we think expectations should be. Obviously, there are going to be quarters that are over or under that. But that's where we think we're going to be, the majority of the time and that's kind of, why we choose that range. I think Mike wants to look back to something I said earlier. 
Michael Lawton: I want to go back an earlier comment that Patrick made on store level margins, which you can see in the 8-K Royalties have not been backed out of that number. So it's not -- just a correction of the statement. But when look at comparable profits -- when we look at profits between franchise and corporate, we line them up on an exact same basis. And franchisees are on a dollar basis, a little more profit -- profitable than the corporate stores, but yes. And the franchisees definitely did enjoy more profits in the first quarter of this year. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: Got it. And just, Patrick, one other follow-up question. On the international side of things, I know you talked about -- perhaps Europe was a little weaker but pizza is somewhat recession resistant. I'm just wondering if you could talk about whether there were any slowdowns, in some key markets. Some of your multinational peers are talking about that. And it seems like, obviously your international result have sustained themselves pretty impressively. But I'm just wondering if you're starting to see any signs of a slowdown, perhaps more in Europe rather in Asia? 
J. Doyle: Yes, I -- the answer is, it has held up really well. And we felt that a little bit in Southern Europe, in kind of, Greece and Spain. One thing that I've said many times and continues to be true is that I think the best predictor of the health of this category is employment levels. And so if you see the employment changes out there, at least at the extremes in Europe, Spain at 24.4%, and Greece I think is in the -- is at least in the high teens, we feel that. But I'll tell you, overall, Europe is holding up very, very nicely. And it's been something that -- when I look at, kind of the list of things that I worry about -- we look for weakness in Europe. Clearly the economy has been weakening over there and we're just really not seeing it showing up in our business. So we're feeling pretty good about it. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research. 
Mitchell Speiser: Great. And Patrick, yes, just continuing to focus on U.S. unit growth, now with margins looking like they are steadily improving. Can you just maybe discuss some of the key constraints as to why franchise unit growth has not been maybe as strong as some people would like it to be? And it sounds like you're putting a lot of resources behind, trying to get franchisee unit growth going. Can you discuss maybe some of the things that you're thinking about to spark U.S. unit growth? 
J. Doyle: Yes. I think there are a couple of things that go into it. And one has been over the last couple of years, as we've had some stores that were not performing as well. Even though we've been making progress coming out of the downturn, you got a bell curve on store level profits. And so while the averages have been moving, some stores didn't move as quickly or were at a lower base. And for our franchisees, I think you for our healthier, better franchisees, a smart decision on their part from a straight ROI perspective was, to buy some stores that weren't performing as well. And so we've had franchisees who were growing pretty strongly, but they were doing it by buying stores that were not performing as well or were even distressed. And so as we see that starting to ease, and it definitely has and it's part of why you see fewer closures in the quarter, and if you kind of look at those closures sequentially over the last few years, you're going to see kind of nice progress being made on that front. That's, kind of one part of it. They've got to choose where their capital is going to go, and if there's a steady supply of stores that they can buy and turn around, that's a smart investment decision for them; and ultimately, it makes us a better systems. So while in the very short term, I might like them to be building stores, the fact is, over the medium term, longer term, we're far better off as a brand and a system to have the stronger players buying the stores that aren't performing as well. So the other side of that equation then is, what does it take for them to start building new stores? And if the choice is starting to go away on buying stores that aren't as good, than when did they start generating new store growth. That becomes an ROI decision for them, as they look at improvements in their P&Ls, it's going to change their confidence around the business. We're still are looking at availability of financing being a little bit of a problem still for -- particularly for smaller players. Our larger players are able to tap the debt markets again. Single-store folks that want to build or buy a second store, that's still is constrained. There's not as much availability of debt financing out there for the smaller players as there was. And that's something that I'm not sure that I see easing. I think that's going to be a tough market for a while. For smaller players to access the debt markets. I think it's going to move to more local banks and relationships that they have than some of the sources of financing that were out there. Larger players, very different story. The bigger lenders are back in, and our larger more successful franchisees are clearly able to capture the debt market again. So we still think that there are 1,000 stores to be built, over the longer term in the U.S. That's going to take time to do it. It's going to take time for us to get real moves in store growth in the near term. I wouldn't start building expectations around that in the near term. But it's certainly something we're focused on. We've got a very great team, that we built around us and so they are out understanding this and what the obstacles are. And hopefully, that's a lever we're going to be able to get moving again. But it's still going to take some time before that's going to be a meaningful lever, I think for shareholder value creation. 
Mitchell Speiser: And if I can slip another in there. On online ordering, you gave us several metrics. And you gave us -- this one, I apologize. But just on the -- just the total percent of online orders in the U.S. and where that was about a year ago? 
J. Doyle: Yes, so we're north of 30% now and a year ago, we were probably 5 points lower than that, something like that. We're probably in the 25 range. And the other thing that's moved along briskly, is the mobile side of this. So 7% of total orders now are on mobile. That's 7 out of -- north of 30 on total. So you're looking at -- better than 20% of our digital orders are now on mobile. And by the way, we dug up the numbers and I got this one right, we were right around 25% on digital sales a year ago. 
Mitchell Speiser: Great and just one last one then I'll pass on to the next person. The food cost basket for the year, you mentioned is unchanged. Can you tell us what it was in the first quarter? 
Michael Lawton: As I mentioned in the script, it was between 1% and 2%, which is consistent with what we expect for the rest of the year. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America. 
Joseph Buckley: Just a couple of questions. Again, I guess would be the U.S. to debt. But, if you should look on [ph] the QSR pizza categories in the first quarter, Patrick. And I know you don't want to go back and forth [ph], which I understand, but what are you promoting so far in the second quarter? I know you ha the new Artisan Pizza offering. But what else have you been promoting so far in the second quarter? 
J. Doyle: Yes, so Artisan as you said, and kind of early week carryout special, and we've also got some of the cheesy bread mixed in, which was, a little more fourth quarter, played just into the first quarter, but a little bit more in the fourth quarter when we were doing that. So it's right now, it's a mix of, really of those 3 things. 
Joseph Buckley: Okay and what are your thoughts [ph] on the QSR pizza category in the quarter, we saw the Pizza Hut numbers. QSR in general has been pretty strong. Has the pizza category, led QSR overall? Or is it, kind of, in line or -- I just want your... 
J. Doyle: Yes, I think and I know there's -- I heard a different number thrown out there from one of our peers. I -- our belief is that you're seeing low single-digit growth in the category. I think you may be seeing share gains from the national players versus the regionals and local players. And it may be why there's a little bit of a difference in the number I'm talking about, and what one of our peers was talking about. I'm looking, I believe at the total category, so not just the national players but also the regionals and smaller players. And I think that's, kind of a couple of points up right now and I think the nationals are doing a little better than that. I mean clearly, with Pizza Hut coming out with their number, stronger and us in the 2 range, I think there's some share shift going towards the national players. And we'll find out about the third national, I guess tonight. 
Joseph Buckley: Okay and then, Mike, just a question for you on the international side. When you look at the overall revenue growth, are the differences in the rate of growth in the first quarter between the -- kind of traditional franchise royalties and fees, and the distribution revenues, that are included in the international? 
Michael Lawton: The distribution revenues were relatively flat because of -- I'm double checking but -- I think that they were -- I think overall that the distribution revenue was relatively flat, but I'm having trouble checking the number here. 
J. Doyle: Yes, it was actually flat. 
Michael Lawton: I -- Yes, it was very flat. So most of the growth did come out of the royalties. 
Joseph Buckley: And the distribution revenues being flat, would that be a function -- I know, I'd guess currencies are getting impacted, maybe commodity price is impacted. Is there anything else that would have made it flat? 
Michael Lawton: Yes, it's the relative strength of Canada versus the rest of international. Because the only place we own the distribution centers is in Canada, and so Canada I think was not quite as robust as the rest of international. And that's why you see a little bit of a shift towards more royalty revenues from distribution. 
Joseph Buckley: And that -- it makes good sense. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steve Anderson with Miller Tabak. 
Stephen Anderson: Just 2 quick questions. First of all, you mentioned that the Android app now contributing about 1% of total sales. Is that the number we should use for the total contributions to the first quarter comp? Or how should we look at this? And how should we look at it, going forward? 
J. Doyle: Yes, it's actually -- it's a little over 1% now. And so no, it was not the average for the first quarter because it actually launched, I think towards the end of February. And it's ramped up very, very nicely in terms of the number of downloads, the way the orders are moving on it, we're really pleased with how it's performing. And we kind of, can go back and look at the growth curve on that versus the iPhone, and there are some mix shifts in there. That's not all, obviously incremental. And we see some coming off of the mobile website because frankly, the app is probably a better overall experience. But the total on mobile is now north of 7%, which is just a very, very nice move for us. And we continue to see that growing. 
Stephen Anderson: Now is the contribution more from a -- the ramp up in Android faster than it was from -- coming from iPhone or vice -- or how does that compare? 
J. Doyle: No, I think it's reasonably comparable. And I think overall, Android has a little higher share than, kind of the iPhone platform. And so over time, probably the answer is, it gets a little bit bigger just because there are more Android phones out there, I think than iPhones in total. But overall in terms of the ramp, I think it's pretty comparable, than what we saw with the iPhone. 
Stephen Anderson: Final question, what are you seeing in India? I remember that was a big growth driver in the last quarter for you in terms of resting [ph] restaurant sales. 
J. Doyle: Yes, I mean, I can't get into specifics because they haven't -- they are publicly traded and they haven't released their numbers yet. But I would tell you, in general the answer is, everything is still on track. And it's a market we're very, very excited about. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion with Citi. 
Alvin Concepcion: I just wanted to get some more clarification on your comment that you're marketing pizza versus side items would be more balanced. So relative to the first quarter, would we expect more marketing focused on driving order counts, which would then impact profitability? Or was the first quarter more indicative of the balance? 
J. Doyle: Well, first quarter was pretty side-item focused. I mean, it was -- we had early-week carry out special but it was some Cheesy Bread and then mostly Parm bread bites. So I guess, since we're out right now with Artisan, the answer is, it's going to be at least a little more balanced because the first quarter was pretty much about the side items, with the exception of the carryout special. So over the course of the year, it's going to be balanced. The first quarter was probably a little more weighted toward side items. 
Alvin Concepcion: Okay great and were there any noticeable changes in the mix of delivery orders versus carryout orders in the quarter? 
J. Doyle: No. We're pretty consistent with the past. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Peter Saleh: Great, so I just wanted to ask about the domestic franchisees. Can you remind us again, are franchisees allowed to open or own any other concepts, aside from Domino's? 
J. Doyle: Yes, no it -- so you've got 1,100 franchisees and it's something that's kind of unique about our system is, they're focused on us. So those who've come up through the system, are dedicated to Domino's. We've got just a few that we kind of experimented with over the last couple of years that have come in with outside customer experience. But that's a very small minority of the overall. So the vast, vast majority are just operating Domino's Pizza stores. 
Peter Saleh: Great and then, the vast majority of your unit growth is really coming from international and we do continue to hear of weakness in Europe from many of your peers. So I'm just wondering, what is your confidence in the new unit growth expectations over the next 12 months, if we do see a weakening in same-store sales, over in Europe? 
J. Doyle: Yes, I mean, I'd -- first, I'd go back to the previous answer which is, we just really haven't seen it, in Europe yet. But I mean, look at some point, if you see a weakening of comps, does that start to play into your store growth, at some level? Yes. But what I would say is, what you're seeing right now is more an acceleration, and that's because unit level economics are on average, pretty robust in our international business. And, so it would be almost more a momentum effect if things slowed down than kind of the actual -- an actual change in the ROI, short of them turning negative, right? And so it might affect kind of just their level of confidence but the returns are incredibly good right now, on average. And that's why you're seeing the kind of robust growth that we're getting. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Mark Smith with Feltl and Company. 
Mark Smith: I think most of everything has been asked, but I just wanted to clarify a few things. First, you said that delivery versus carryout, there's no real change. Is that flat sequentially? Or on a year-over-year basis? And then if you can talk more on that, do you see any impact from weather on carryout? And then lastly, can you talk about, how much you were promoting it this quarter, versus a year ago? 
J. Doyle: Yes, a year ago, we had a couple of very significant 1-week promotions on carryout, and we do not have the same fund [ph] this year. We were promoting Monday, Wednesday, we've got more of a regular carryout offer going for -- to develop that type of customer. I think as we said, there proportionately, we haven't seen a big change. And part of the reason for that is, year-on-year over the last few years, we have been growing the carryout business as percentage -- as a percentage of total sales. We may have seen a bigger increase this year if we'd run the same carryout specials that we did a year ago because -- but instead we're not seeing that, because the national growth numbers kind of are -- maybe offset by the fact that we were kind of heavily emphasizing that last year. So we're seeing kind of flat on both. We're not seeing a big change but that could be due to the mix of the offers. 
Mark Smith: And does the weather help when its warmer. Do more people feel like driving over to the store to pick it up? 
Michael Lawton: As Patrick said on weather, we don't see big differences but we certainly would expect that our carryout business would see a bit more benefit with a good weather. But as I said, we're -- we didn't see a lot of shift this year, versus last year. 
Mark Smith: Okay. And then the lastly... 
J. Doyle: I just wanted to go back to the weather comment. I mean just -- we pulled it apart hard, looking at that. It was going to be as -- it was going to be the best quarter for us to really understand, how much it can affect it because it clearly, the weather was very, very warm, which is generally a bad thing for us. And it just didn't amount to that much of a change. That much of an effect. 
Mark Smith: Okay and then real quick, I know that you talked a little bit about the pizza category. But did you guys see any different competitive pressure or easing in kind of pricing pressure this quarter? 
J. Doyle: No, I mean not a lot. Pizza Hut was out with their box of pizza and breadsticks. But overall, one of the things we always keep in mind around here is, the majority of our competition in the pizza industry is not the national players. The majority of our competitors out there, this is a store-by-store deal. And most of those competitors are -- the regional chains and the local chains, and that's going to tend to not drive as much movements in kind of their promotional processes, et cetera. So overall, even from the national competitors, I wouldn't say we saw really meaningful differences, in terms of what they were doing. But I think just as importantly, I always try to remember that the bulk of our competition is not the other national chains. 
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. 
John Ivankoe: Hopefully quickly, in Europe or I guess maybe even your developed markets more specifically, I mean, was there anything that, either happened in the first quarter and recent quarters tactically from a promotional product development perspective, that's really, really worked for you guys? That kind of, shows how, again, that you can take or even grow share, grow traffic. And what should be, as you pointed out, the declining overall industry environment? Is there anything specifically going on there, that we just, might not be seeing? 
J. Doyle: I mean, I think technology is a big part of that over time. And I think that's the newest, biggest leverageable competitive advantage, that we've got both domestically and internationally. So and -- I think that's the most important one. 
John Ivankoe: And like for example, in the U.K. I think you're -- I mean, you're actually -- you're indexing even more than the U.S., is that correct? 
J. Doyle: Yes, in terms of total digital. Yes, it is higher. 
John Ivankoe: Okay, and in Continental Europe, I mean, again, I mean, it is surprising, as you've laid out total employments to not see a fairly significant contraction in your business. Yes, I mean -- so I mean, your knowledge on the franchise level, I mean, they haven't had to resort to significant discounting or what have you? The price points have been able to hold relativity steady? 
J. Doyle: Yes, we've -- yes, it's held together pretty darn well. And I think some of it is -- this category is still certainly much less developed outside of the U.S. than inside, on average. Our view over the longer term is, you've got kind of a 5%-ish growth in the category outside of the U.S. and kind of low single-digit growth inside the U.S. And so some of it is, I think there's just still more room for the category to grow outside of the U.S. 
John Ivankoe: Great, understood. 
J. Doyle: Yes, by the way, I was hoping it was going to be your dad asking the questions but unfortunately I guess it was John Ivankoe Junior. 
Operator: And there are no further questions. 
J. Doyle: Okay. I guess there are not. So with that, I'd like to thank you all for participating in today's call and we look forward to speaking with you in July for our second quarter call. Thank you. 
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2011 Q4  (2012-02-28 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Lynn Liddle, with Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. 
Lynn Liddle: Thanks, Amber. I appreciate it. Welcome everybody this morning. A couple of housekeeping notes, in the event that we do have any forward-looking statements, I will turn your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which is listed on both 8-Ks. And then also, to members of the media, please listen-only mode this morning. And we're going to do our usual start with Michael Lawton, our Chief Financial Officer; and then turn it over to Patrick Doyle, our CEO, and then follow up with some questions. 
 So with that, I'll turn it over to Mike. 
Michael Lawton: Thanks, Lynn and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss the results for the fourth quarter I'd like make a brief comment on our announcement today regarding the proposed refinancing of our existing debt. As you can see in the press release we issued today, we have announced the intention to engage in the refinancing of our existing securitized debt with a new securitized debt facility. Due to securities law restrictions, we will not be discussing the refinancing or answering questions regarding it on the call today. And our Investor Relations team will be implementing a quiet period until the transaction closes. All of your questions regarding the refinancing will be answered after the closing, when we plan to hold another conference call. We appreciate you respecting these guidelines in the Q&A session.
 So now let's dive into our fourth quarter results. The fourth quarter was another outstanding period as we posted solid domestic and international same-store sales growth and continued strong international store growth. We used our cash to benefit our shareholders through our share repurchase program and continue to drive shareholder value with 30% adjusted EPS growth in the quarter.
 Now let's look at our system revenue for the quarter. Our global retail sales, which are the total retail sales at franchised and company-owned stores worldwide, grew 9.9% during the quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency. When including the negative currency impact, our global retail sales grew 8.8%.
 Looking at the drivers of the global retail sales growth. First, our domestic same-store sales grew 6.8% in the fourth quarter, lapping into a strong quarter in 2010, when we were up 6.3%. This yielded a very strong 13.1% 2-year sales comp for the quarter. Broken down, franchise same-store sales were up 6.6% for the quarter, while company-owned stores were up 8.7%.
 International had another solid quarter as same-store sales grew 4.7%, which was lapping the strongest quarter in 2010 when we are up 9%. This resulted in a 13.7% 2-year sales comp for the quarter. In the quarter, we opened 16 net stores domestically, made up of 33 store openings and 17 closures. We remain very focused on achieving store growth domestically. Our international division grew by a net 185 stores this quarter.
 Turning to revenues. Our total revenues for the fourth quarter were up almost $22 million or 4.5% from the prior-year quarter. Approximately $18 million or 81% of the total revenue increase was attributable to our supply chain division, largely due to higher commodity costs versus the prior year quarter. We also benefited from higher domestic franchise revenues due primarily to higher same-store sales. Further, higher international revenues, resulting primarily from same-store sales of store comp growth, contributed to the overall revenue increase. The increase in our international revenues was partially offset by negative impact of currency changes during the fourth quarter of approximately $1 million.
 Looking ahead at 2012, we currently expect the dollar to be stronger than last year, which would negatively impact our international revenues. Partially offsetting 2011 revenue increases were lower company-owned store revenues, resulting from the sale of 58 company-owned stores during 2011. More detail regarding our revenue by business unit can be found in our 10-K, which was filed this morning.
 Moving on to operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, our consolidated operating margin increased 0.5% from 28.4% to 28.9% quarter-over-quarter. This was due primarily to a change in our mix of revenues attributable to fewer company-owned stores and increased high-margin franchise revenues. We also experienced an increase in company-owned store operating margin. These increases were offset in part by a lower supply chain margin percentage, which was impacted by higher commodity prices.
 As a percentage of revenues, our company-owned store operating margin increased 2% from the prior-year quarter, in part due to a reduction in labor hours per transaction versus the prior year quarter, which we attribute in part to growth of our carryout business and an increase in online transactions.
 Now let's move on to our supply chain margin, which decreased 0.4% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of higher commodity cost. With food commodities priced on a constant dollar mark up to our franchisees, increases in commodity costs do not impact our supply chain dollar profit. They do, however, negatively affect our supply chain margin as a percentage of revenues.
 Our top commodities, including cheese, increased versus the prior year quarter. The average cheese block price in the fourth quarter was $1.76 per pound versus $1.61 last year, which drove a 6% increase in our market basket in the fourth quarter. Our market basket for the full year 2011 was also up approximately 6%. Our expectation for 2012 is that the growth in our market basket will moderate somewhat and increase 1% to 2% over 2011 levels.
 Turning to G&A expenses. G&A was flat during the fourth quarter versus the prior year quarter. Lower variable performance-based bonuses and lower expenses resulting from the sale of the company-owned store operations in 2011 were offset in part by higher expenses for online ordering in the call center, which are services we provide to our franchisees. Our G&A for the full year of 2011 was $211.4 million. In 2012, we expect an additional $8 million to $10 million incremental G&A from the 2011 reported levels. Keep in mind that our 2011 G&A expense includes $2.2 million of gains on certain company-owned operations. So if you exclude these gains, we expect G&A to be up $6 million to $8 million.
 The increases are for international infrastructure growth, investments in technology, higher stock compensation expense and other strategic initiatives, offset in part by lower variable performance-based bonuses. We expect to have significant paybacks as these investments are critical to support the future growth of our global business. Keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down by, among other things, our performance versus plan is that it affects bonus and stock awards expense.
 Regarding income taxes, during the fourth quarter we had a slightly lower effective tax rate versus the prior year quarter, due primarily to the lapse of federal and state statutes of limitations, which also contributed to our full year effective rate being slightly lower than 38%. We currently expect that 38% to 39% will be our normalized effective tax rate for the foreseeable future.
 Our net income as reported, was up $6.7 million or $27.9 million for the fourth quarter. This increase was primarily the result of our strong domestic and international same-store sales growth, record international store growth and lower interest expense in 2011.
 Now our fourth quarter diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.52 and we had no items affecting comparability in the quarter. The $0.52 is a $0.12 or 30% increase from the $0.40 as adjust to EPS from the fourth quarter last year. Here's how the $0.12 difference breaks down: Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.09 in the quarter; our lower diluted share count, primarily due to our share repurchases, benefited us by $0.02; and our lower interest expense benefited us by $0.01.
 Now turning to our liquidity. Free cash flow continued to grow from almost $103 million in 2010 to nearly $129 million in 2011. In the fourth quarter, we utilized some of our available cash to repurchase and retire approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock for $35.8 million or an average price of $31.25 per share. For the full year 2011, we repurchased and retired approximately 6.4 million shares of our common stock for $165 million or an average price of $25.72 per share. We currently have $82.4 million remaining authorized under our open market share repurchase program for future share repurchases and we ended the year with over $50 million on restricted cash.
 Turning to our capital expenditures. In 2011, we invested over $24 million in capital expenditures in our stores, supply chain centers and technology initiatives. Going forward, we have raised our long range outlook on capital spending to approximately $25 million to $35 million annually as we will invest capital into technology, supply chain and company-owned stores.
 In closing, our strong fourth quarter contributed to an outstanding 2011. During 2011, our domestic same-store sales grew 3.5% and our international same-store sales grew 6.8%. The company grew by a net 391 stores, which is a result of the record performance by our international division, which opened 413 net units for the year. As a result, we had adjusted EPS growth of 25% for the full year. Our focus remains on improving our operating performance, growing our global store base and appropriate utilization of our free cash flow to drive shareholder value.
 Thanks for your time today. And now I'll turn it over to Patrick. 
J. Doyle: Thanks, Mike. Last year, during this time, I told you that we faced a big task in 2011 to exceed our 2010 results that we had a strategic plan in place that our team could execute. I reminded you that we built a new sales base to grow from and we had a new level of customer loyalty in the U.S, and we built some very strong brand equity around the world. I said that we expected continued growth in 2011, and I'm happy to report that we had a great year. We ended it with positive annual sales domestically and internationally, exceptional global store growth and overall positive results. We're not the same company we were even 2 years ago. We really are a different Domino's. Domestically, we had higher levels of consumer engagement online and we upgraded our food quality versus the past. We strategically launched 3 new products last year, Improved Chicken, Artisan Pizza's and Stuffed Cheesy Bread, which together brought our overall food quality even higher. In the U.S., we lapped our 2010 plus 9.9% annual sales comp with a 3.5% increase this year. We opened more new stores internationally than ever before, and we are one of the top performing stocks in the restaurant industry, up 113%.
 Our excellent results in 2011 came not only from our tremendous international sales momentum or our strong domestic sales at a higher level of consumer engagement, but also from our technology. For example, Domino's Pizza in the U.S. processed over 1 million orders during the week of Cyber Monday alone, our best week of digital sales ever to that point. In fact, we estimate that we did over $1.8 billion in online sales globally in 2011 or about $34 million a week around the world.
 We're also very active in social media. In the U.S., we've grown by 400% in the past 12 months in both Facebook and Twitter followers. In the fourth quarter, we created the first-ever global Domino's Day on Facebook, with 20 countries participating in the event, spanning 14 different languages. This resulted in an a record day for Domino's Pizza online sales.
 In June of last year, we launched our iPhone app which in just 6 short months has driven our total mobile sales to over 6% on sales. I'm happy to report that we also recently launched an Android app, which should help drive these sales even higher and now enables us to cover more than 80% of smart phones. Meanwhile, digital orders are now about 1/3 of our domestic sales overall and continue to grow at a steady clip. Our technological advantage is truly global, with online sales in Japan now roughly 50% of their total orders, and 50% of delivery orders in the U.K.
 We believe that we're a truly innovative brand with industry-leading digital promotion that truly offer one-to-one marketing to our consumers. This is an advantage that few of our competitors can claim, particularly smaller regional chains. 
 You probably saw our announcement yesterday that we named a new Chief Information Officer, Kevin Vasconi, who comes from us from Stanley Black & Decker the Security Solution Division, where he was Chief Information Officer and Vice President of Engineering. Prior to that, he spent 8 years at R.L. Polk & Co. as Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer of Polk Global Automotives. Kevin has lots of consumer experience and has built great technology platforms throughout his career. He's a great leader and we're looking forward to having him on the team. It's an important position, given how technology is so pivotal to our business today. I also like to thank Michael Lawton, for his service as interim Chief Information Officer and especially for the team's hard work in getting our new Android app out. Mike's been doing double duty lately, and the new app was an important undertaking on top of his very busy schedule as CFO. Thanks, Mike.
 We're very proud of what we did in 2011 and it was an important year for us. We had strong momentum going with all of our initiatives in 2011 but one, domestic store growth. We expected to see better domestic store growth numbers in 2011 based on the good year our operators had in 2010. However, we experienced spikes in commodity prices in 2011, which eroded store margins during the summer and made franchisees more hesitant to expand. What we know is this: The best way to develop new stores is make unit economics robust and profit so compelling that franchisees want to grow in a meaningful way. So this is where our team is the most focused, identifying cost-saving opportunities and better efficiencies so our franchisees can generate better profits. The franchisees are ultimately responsible for their own profitability but we're committed to finding ways to help them perform better.
 Additionally, strong franchise owners have been able to acquire stores from weaker operators for much of their store growth needs as opposed to building new stores. The program we announced in 2008 to remove weak operators and move underperforming stores into the hands of stronger franchise owners has definitely improved the strength of our system. We remain committed to this program and as the franchisees have gotten stronger and weaker franchisees have been removed, the opportunity for growth from strong operators will increasingly have to come from building new stores. We've also made some changes internally, moving some strong leaders in the company into roles that we believe will help drive better results in domestic store growth going forward. Our goal, as always, is for positive store growth in 2012.
 On the international front, our store growth picture is very robust and stronger than our competitors. So much so that we recently increased our long-range outlook for global net units, now expected to be 350 to 450 global net new units per year, up 100 to 150 net new units from our previous outlook. We also recently increased our outlook for international same-store sales, from our previous range of plus 3% to plus 5% to an expanded range of 3% to 6%. When you combine this new international same-store sales number with an increased number of new global stores, our global retail sales expectations also climbed to 5% to 8% annually.
 As one of the top public international restaurant brands, Domino's Pizza benefits from scale, but also with a long runway for growth. In the pizza delivery and carryout segment, internationally, according to third-party and internal data, we are about 1.5x bigger than our nearest competitor, but with significant growth opportunities. Since we only have an estimated 11% market share internationally in off-premise pizza. So while we've still got new markets to open, we also have significant growth left in the countries where we already compete. In fact, existing markets will generate the vast majority of our growth during the next few years. For instance, during 2011, we opened 54 net new stores in the U.K., 58 net new stores in Turkey and 75 net new stores in India, our fastest-growing market.
 We also had some noteworthy international store opening milestones during 2011, including our 400th store in India, and our 200th store in both Japan and in Turkey. We're proud of our international master franchisees accomplished worldwide last year and we look forward to strengthening the business in 2012 as the international division is a very big part of the equation that is DPZ. 
 Lastly, I'd like to say a few words about our balance sheet. As Mike mentioned, due to legalities surrounding our recapitalization that's in progress, I'm unable to speak specifically about the refinancing and we will be unable to take questions on our debt at the conclusion of my comments. But from a 30,000-foot view, we've taken our debt from $1.7 billion in 2007 to $1.45 billion at the end of 2011 and our debt to EBITDA ratio was 4.9x at year end. As I said many times, this is a company that best operates with leverage. As in years past, we expect to generate strong free cash flow again in 2012 because of our franchise model.
 As it relates to how we deploy that free cash, our goal is always to strengthen the business and benefit our investors in ways that create the best shareholder value.
 So in closing, Domino's Pizza had a tremendous 2011. We followed a successful year with another successful year. Our achievement is part of a larger strategy that we began crafting and executing in 2009. It was not a phenomenon that ended with the launch of our new pizza. It's a strategy of great food, continued service excellence, technological advantage, and a global franchise model that sets our brand apart.
 With that, Amber, I'd like to open the line for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions]
 Your first question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. 
Brian Bittner: I just got 2 questions on the domestic business and then just a quick follow-up, if I may. Just wondering if you can elaborate on how the rollout of new products in the fourth quarter, such as the Artisans and the Cheesy Bread, inflates with your comp momentum versus how well the core products performed? 
J. Doyle: I mean, it gets hard to really pull that apart. I guess, that's what I'd say, because, obviously, it's all happening at the same time. But I guess what I would say is the new products certainly helped. We were rolling over a little bit easier comp in the fourth quarter of 2010. So if you look at our kind of 2-year comp number for the fourth quarter, it was pretty much in line with what we've been doing on a 2-year comp over the course of the year. But the new products performed very well, we're very pleased with both of them. But the more important story continues to be higher levels of retention and customer satisfaction and frequency from customers, which is really that new base of business that we've been talking about. 
Brian Bittner: And the second question on these comps, just the GAAP between the company-owned and franchise comp, I know it's been asked before, but it's still pretty large and just wondering if this has anything to do with company-owned stores being test markets and therefore, possibly being a forward indicator of the franchise comp? Or, really, do you think it's just a geographic impact or are you guys just better managing those company-owned stores? 
J. Doyle: First of all, if you look at the fourth quarter of 2010 number, it was actually, I think, a point the other way. So franchisees beat team USA by about a percentage. So probably you just got a little bit better of a flip-flop going on quarter-over-quarter over the years, but I wouldn't read a lot into it. We're very happy with how the team is running the corporate stores. But if you look at it on a longer-term view, I think the answer is both sides are doing very, very well and I don't know that I would read a lot into kind of the specifics of the team USA versus the franchise stores. 
Brian Bittner: Okay and then just the last question. I mean, rather than asking anything about the debt, just wondering if you could elaborate on really how you decide whether to use excess cash that you have for special dividends or share repurchases as far as that value creation equation. I mean, how do you just think about that? 
J. Doyle: Yes, Brian, I can't really go into that as you'd expect. I guess what I'd say is what we said before, which is we run the numbers, I think the same way that our investors do. And we look for what's going to generate the best return for our shareholders. And apart from that, until we've kind of gotten through this process, I can't say a lot more. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research. 
Mitchell Speiser: First on store margins. In the U.S., the labor leverage was pretty significant in the quarter. You did mention carry out and online ordering were a driver of that. I believe your labor was down 170 bps. Can you give us a sense of how much that was from, from the shift to carryout and online ordering? 
J. Doyle: Yes. It's hard to pull that apart in any kind of a short-term basis, but I would tell you that we're definitely seeing some of the leverage on labor from both of those, and fourth quarter was better. I mean, even when I talk about the pressure on store-level margins. It was better for our corporate stores and fourth quarter was better for our franchisees, as well, than the first 3 quarters were. So nice forward progress there. It's a trend that we need to keep going. But you're right on the labor leverage. It's definitely there. We've got a newer, higher level of sales, the stores, as they're adjusting to that higher level of sales, figure out how to get more efficient over time as we kind of settled into that new higher base and kind of continue to grow from it. But while I can't really give you a specific answer on how much of it comes from just higher sales versus carryout, versus online ordering, what I can tell you with confidence is, it's sum of all 3 of those. 
Mitchell Speiser: And it sounds like it should be ongoing as these percentages continue to rise? 
J. Doyle: We would certainly hope so. 
Mitchell Speiser: Okay, great. And separately, your Chief Marketing Officer has talked about the -- what you call the french fries factor, adding up lower-priced items on to your current marketing programs. Can you discuss that a little more in detail and how that is maybe different from the way that marketing in the past? 
J. Doyle: Sure. Yes, what Russell was talking about on that is, if you look at what generates orders, in the hamburger business or in the pizza business, it's kind of the center of plate items, right? It's -- you generate orders by selling more pizzas or sandwiches or pasta, but you generate orders by selling kind of the main items. But what makes those profits more profitable, what makes those orders more profitable, is to get good add-ons to those orders and to have kind of the right selection of those things. French fries are very profitable for the hamburger companies. And so, for instance, we kind of soft launched Parmesan Bread Bites in the fourth quarter and we have since launched them in the first quarter and are out there, it's our current campaign. And in the fourth quarter, we had launched the Stuffed Cheesy Bread. Great products and very good margins. So the extent to which we can add those onto the orders, it's going to make each order more profitable and some of that plays into the margin gains you saw on the corporate source side and as I've talked about, in the franchise side in the fourth quarter. 
Mitchell Speiser: Great, and if I can slip one more in, this one's probably for Mike. The international revenues, I noticed the supply chain revenues outside the U.S. was down 0.9, was there a ForEx factor in there or have you done anything different with your distribution centers, perhaps in Canada, if you can explain the decline in revenues for international supply chain? 
Michael Lawton: Nothing different with the supply chains. There was certainly a little bit of a currency impact in there. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Joseph Buckley: I just had a couple of questions. First on the G&A, Mike, are you still expecting a $2 million to $3 million offset for franchisee contributions to some of the additional services like the call centers? 
Michael Lawton: Yes, we are. 
Joseph Buckley: Okay. And then technically, just on international, and I know as you have some publicly-traded branch or franchisees out there, but can you give us a sense of the relative strength of same-store sales by some of the major markets? 
J. Doyle: Yes, I guess, what I'd say Joe, is it's still very broad. And if you look at the fourth quarter on a 2-year basis, it was exactly equal to the 2-year number for the full year for international. I think it was 13 -- was it 13.7, I believe, on a 2-year basis both for the quarter and for the year. So the answer on it is pretty consistent with what we've been saying for a while, which is even as there are kind of some concerns out there around kind of global economic growth, we just haven't been seeing signs of it, except we've clearly felt that a bit in Greece. But as we look overall in our major markets, and as you've seen some of them have already released their fourth quarter or second half of the calendar year numbers, they've all continued to hold up quite well. 
Joseph Buckley: And just one last one. With gas prices rising again, can you remind us where the system is in terms of delivery surcharges and whether or not you put royalty on those if they are implemented? 
J. Doyle: Yes we do. I mean, they're part of the sales side of the stores, so we do collect a royalty on that. And the answer is typically it's in the $1.75 to $2 range per order is kind of the average on that. There hasn't been a lot of movement on that. And I think given a little broader answer on it, as we look at grass prices, there are really 3 ways in which it can affect us. One is kind of the direct reimbursement to our drivers or for the franchisees to their drivers. And that's a direct riddle that at some point, you've got to deal with the cost on that. But on order of magnitude on that, overall is relatively small. You've got potential changes in consumer behavior and our experience with that in the past is that we just don't see that much direct change in consumer behavior shifts back or forth between carryout or delivery. We've scrubbed that data up, down and sideways. And honestly, just have not seen a whole lot on that front. The bigger medium-term to longer-term concern is it doesn't start to flow through food cost, doesn't start to flow through commodities. And that's the one that's potentially big enough that it could turn into a headwind if oil prices continue to move up materially. But so far, commodities are looking pretty good and our outlook is still for pretty modest increases for 2012 over 2011. 
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. 
John Ivankoe: 2 separate things, if I may. Firstly, could you discuss or just remind me in a little bit more detail what the little bit of the increase in CapEx is? What type of return that you think you got from that and whether that's kind of a longer-term level or it migrates back down over time or possibly even migrate itself over time? 
J. Doyle: No. I mean, that's why we increased our outlook is we think that's something that we're going to see on an ongoing basis, particularly as we look at technology. It continues to be a real differentiator for us and for our brands with consumers, and it's an area where we're going to continue to invest going forward. So that's -- we raised our range for our outlook by $5 million on both top and bottom ends and we think that's where it's going to be for the near term. 
John Ivankoe: And separately, based on what I think is deserved confidence in terms of your consistent free cash flow generation. I mean, have you thought about maybe pursuing some of the work perhaps even exceeding some big markets like China or Brazil, for example, what you may be co-investing with master franchisees that might potentially exist in those markets. In other words, does the company feel or does the company feel like you have an opportunity to actually take more risk in developing markets in terms of place in order of capital to work? 
J. Doyle: I think the answer, John, is the model has worked incredibly well. We're generating better growth than anybody, I think our percentage store growth now, going back over the last few years, is better than any of the major international players. So we love the model. I would never say never. If we hit a point where we look at a market and say, you know what, we're convinced that our getting directly involved will make a material difference, we would certainly leave that open as an option. But as you've seen to this point, we haven't felt the need to do that or frankly seen the opportunity that we think it's going to generate the kind of return that we want. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffery Bernstein with Barclays Capital. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: A couple of questions. Just, first, when you look at the U.S., you talked about the unit pipeline now accelerating in '11, I guess, because in part due to the spike in commodities. I know you mentioned you're hopeful for a return and that opens in '12. I'm just wondering, is that feedback you're getting from the franchisees that those short-term spikes were the primary drivers? And I'm just wondering, you talk about initiatives to help them perform better so that they accelerate their growth, I'm wondering what that might entail? Would you consider incentivizing U.S. franchisees with some financing help or discount to royalty or add contributions? Just trying to size up the re-acceleration, causing the inter growth being more stable and comp growth longer term. I'm just trying to size up that U.S. unit growth. 
J. Doyle: Yes -- no, absolutely. I mean, the answer is we look at all those things. But it really comes down to a couple of things. One is what you mentioned and what I mentioned, which is the spike in the summer in commodities hurt the profits in kind of a near-term basis more than we had expected. We hadn't forecast the spike to be as big as it was. And in our franchisees, a rationale about making their investment decisions. And so when the near-term profit picture isn't as good, then they're going to slow down some of their investments. That did get better in the fourth quarter, which gives us some more confidence and commodities are so far staying pretty well under control in 2012. But the second part of it is -- and this goes back now really 4 years is, we decided to focus very hard on improving the overall performance of our system in a number of different ways, one of which was people who weren't operating their stores at the level that we felt that they needed to be operated at, were going to be asked to sell or, in some cases, moved out of the system directly. And that's resulted in something approaching 200 franchisees leaving the system over the course of the last 4 years. And the bulk of those stores, some of them closed back in '09 and '08, but the bulk of those stores have been purchased by the stronger, better franchisees. And again, being rational investors, there is a period of time where the best return they could get was to buy some underperforming stores from franchisees, who were leaving the system. As the system is performing better, those sorts of opportunities start to disappear, and people who want to grow are going to need to build new stores. So we've got a plan around it, we've got a new team working on it, but we think there are a couple of other things that have played into it. Certainly, our goal is to continue to grow the system going forward and certainly we hope to get back to that. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: Okay, but no plans for any help or financial aid to the franchisees that do so? 
J. Doyle: We've always  got some incentives out there and those have changed from time to time, but nothing we'll talk about today. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: Okay. And then the basket, you talked about the commodity spike and it sounds good that the basket's only going to be up 1% to 2% in '12. I'm just wondering what is the cheese assumption versus the $1.76 in the fourth quarter of '11 and everything other than cheese, should we assume the majority's locked and therefore, we're not going to see much movement in that basket? 
Michael Lawton: Now we're about 25% locked on the basket for the rest of the year. The assumption on cheese is it will average a little bit lower than last year. And as you can see, if you look at the block price today, we are at the $1.47, $1.48, we've already seen the cheese price come down pretty significantly. We do expect meat prices will run a little higher than last year, but we think that'll be offset by the fact that cheese is expected to be lower. 
Jeffrey Bernstein: And then just lastly, it's kind of an anomaly, I guess, for the pizza players. But we've heard from your restaurant peers that favorable weather has been a big benefit in the first quarter. I know you don't give current quarter trends, I'm just wondering if you could talk theoretically on the pizza delivery business. Would that have a negative impact, favorable weather being negative for delivery, I guess, or how do you think about weather at all in the first quarter of '12 and how that impacts you guys? 
J. Doyle: Yes, the broad answer is on the quarter-to-quarter basis, weather moves. While we've looked at them and kind of analyze the effect, they may hurt or help you in kind of a short-term basis. We've never seen big movements on a quarterly basis. And we do, do almost 40% of our orders now are carryout. So there's kind of some offsetting effect on the delivery versus the carry out. Net-net, in the very short term, 2 or 3 inches of snow was a good thing for the business. Big downpours of rain is pretty good for the delivery business. But on a quarterly basis, you're just not going to see that big a move from weather to really adjust -- to really change the numbers materially. 
Operator: Next question comes from Brad Ludington with KeyBanc Capital Market. 
Brad Ludington: I wanted to ask on the rollout of the Parmesan Bread Bites, you've been introducing those with a pretty compelling $1 add-on price point. I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about starting out at $2.99, which I know they're still on the menu at that price if you don't do it as an add-on to the deal. Was that $1 add-on the original plan or were you having some trouble going as that initially -- what drove that price? 
Michael Lawton: It's at trial price. The goal is to get people to try it and love it and then you get them to come back. So absolutely part of the plan. 
Brad Ludington: Then just back on the domestic franchisees and where you talked about opportunities to improve unit economics with them. Of course, like you said, commodities will help if they come in. Are there any specific opportunities that you have in mind where you can help them that maybe you're doing at the company stores? I mean, where do you see opportunities to help them on even economics? 
J. Doyle: Yes. I mean, there are lots of them. I mean, as we look at variability in labor spends, variability in food spends, energy opportunities, there are just -- there are a lot of places. And we're doing a lot of work, we've got teams kind of around each of the initiatives. And some of that is kind of ongoing in nature, but we've got some very specific efforts that we're putting against some of those areas and we see some fairly meaningful opportunities. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Alvin Concepcion with Citi. 
Alvin Concepcion: You brushed on the topic of consumer behavior earlier, so I just wanted to follow-up on that. Did you see any changes in the consumer spending pattern from fourth quarter into January and February? And on that, I mean, are you seeing any mixed changes for value items versus premium? 
J. Doyle: Can't get in to talk about the first quarter. But my answer is what it's been in the past, which is employed people buy more pizza than unemployed people. And net-net, if the economy improves, that's probably a net positive for us. But I can't get into specifics around the first quarter. 
Alvin Concepcion: And then just to sort of on menu mix in the fourth quarter, have you seen any changes there, value versus premium? 
J. Doyle: No. I mean with the launch of Stuffed Cheesy Bread, we clearly were selling a few more sides in the fourth quarter. But otherwise, nothing notable. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Anderson with Miller Taback. 
Stephen Anderson: I just wanted to go clarify with you in terms of the unit growth, have you set a numerical goal for domestic in your growth as you have for the overseas units? And can you say -- can you talk about how credit conditions if there's been any changes with regard to the franchisees if they've been able to either purchase additional locations or build new ones as the economy has improved for that in recent months? 
J. Doyle: Yes. I mean, the answer is we've only set a global outlook for store growth. So we haven't split that apart into international and domestic. All I'd say is similar to what I said in the past. It's certainly going to be overwhelmingly around the international side, but we would like to get back to some growth domestically, as well. And I think the financing market has gotten both marginally better but it's clearly better for larger franchisees that have potentially bigger needs and longer relationships with the financing companies, still pretty tough for the smaller players. 
Operator: Next question comes from Mark Smith with Feltl and Company. 
Mark Smith: Mike, a quick question. Your 1% to 2% increase in your commodity basket, is that including, I guess, what expectation on fuel prices? 
Michael Lawton: There's not a specific expectation on fuel built in the commodity. Obviously, as Patrick mentioned earlier, if fuel was to dramatically spike up at some point, we do think that passes through the commodities. So we're expecting that we're not going to see a huge jump in gas price build. 
Mark Smith: Okay. Second, did you guys give your kind of mix on the call center, both on orders as well as on kind of how many restaurants are in that? 
Michael Lawton: We haven't. The majority of our stores are not on the call center. And most of our call center's really aimed at call overflow. So while it's important to us to provide good customer service and reduce the number of calls that are made to stores that ring too many times, this is not a key component to answering most of the order or taking most of the orders that go into our system. 
Mark Smith: And then lastly, just looking at the tax rate. Near term, it looks like you and a lot of your peers are definitely getting some benefit near term on taxes. Should we expect that to continue into the first half of '12, kind of excluding your long-term guidance, near term, could we see it maybe come in lower? 
Michael Lawton: I think the long-term guidance is still right. I think you may be referring to the YZ credits and the higher acts, some of the labor credits that are out there. We certainly are trying to take advantage of those, primarily in our corporate stores, but we've provided long-term estimates because we think that those are probably the best thing to go with. 
J. Doyle: You can predict the longer-term tax rates at the federal level, that'd be helpful for us. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Peter Saleh with Telsey Advisory Group. 
Peter Saleh: Just a quick question on the -- actually the iPhone app and what your expectations are for the Android app. For the iPhone app, when you launched it last year, did you see a significant adoption, a significant downloads early on, or were your downloads more consistent as we went throughout the year? And I guess what are your expectations for the Android app? 
Michael Lawton: We saw a continued number of downloads of the iPhone app as the year progressed, we got off to a good start and it just continued to grow. We expect that the Android has the potential to actually exceed the iPhone, given that there are more Android users out there. And so far we're getting very good customer reviews of the Android app. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jon Tower with Morgan Stanley. 
Jon Tower: Just a couple of things. On the incremental CapEx spend, you've mentioned that a good amount of that's going to tech investments. I was curious to know if that is corporate-related or you're going to push that down to the store level or is there something in the distribution side that you're going to be investing into that? Separately, seeing that the distribution sales are pretty much the largest part of your overall revenue, are there any opportunities on the cost side to make some investments for the next few years to improve margins over time? 
Michael Lawton: The first question, as far as where we'll spend the CapEx and you've got within technology, there are a number of areas that we continue to invest. We've done a lot with online ordering and with the iPhone and android, obviously. There's still a lot going on with the customer interface side that we can do to make it better. There are going to be more venues that we need to look at and investigate and potentially invest in. We're also doing funds to improve our proprietary point-of-sale system, this affects the store level. We have a great point-of-sale system, we think it gives us some competitive advantages. But there's still an opportunity to make that better than it is. As far as improvements on the commissary side, we have fairly large commissaries, we use 17 of them, supply the whole country. We're continually looking for technological advancements. We've made some over the years in different facilities as they're rebuilt, we'll continue to look for those opportunities. But I would not expect to see a particularly meaningful improvement in the margin as a result of those. 
J. Doyle: I guess, the only thing I'd add on it is the way we go through our budgeting process every year is the first thing we're always looking at is every opportunity to reinvest in the business that's going to generate a good return, and that's always going to be more interesting than other uses of free cash. But the net answer is if that gets us into kind of the range that we've been in. So it's not like we're kind of setting the number and then figuring out what's the best way to spend those dollars. The answer is we go out and look at every area that we could be investing into the business that would generate a good return. And after we've done that, then we start looking at other ways to distribute cash. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research. 
Mitchell Speiser: On the international comp, which was up 4.7%, it definitely was solid versus a year ago. We do know what the top franchisees reported and if you do a little bit of math, it does and correct me if I'm wrong, maybe like the rest of the world excluding the big franchisees, the comp may have been down, maybe 1% or so. I guess my question is was there any areas in the world that were weak besides Greece in the fourth quarter? If you can give us a little more comment on that. 
J. Doyle: We definitely weren't down in the other markets. And so, no. I mean, overall there was pretty broad strength around the world. And so, no -- I mean, I mentioned Greece, obviously, because it's been getting a lot of press. But overall, the answer for the year was good and pretty broad strength. 
Mitchell Speiser: Okay. Next on U.S. unit growth. As you look at the 2012 pipeline for your U.S. franchisees, do you see an increase in the number of stores? I believe about 66 gross were opened in 2011. Just given what you're seeing today, should we expect more in 2012? 
J. Doyle: I guess, all I can say is our goal is to get back to something at least modestly positive in 2012 on kind of net stores. And we think the environment is better than it was in 2011, barring big moves in commodities. But the fact is, if you look at the other side of the equation, which is kind of the availability of stores that are up for sale and/or weaker franchisees looking to move, those numbers have been going down, which means people who want to grow are going to need to look more at opening stores. 
Mitchell Speiser: And my last question is just on the dividend. It's been talked about in prior quarters. When you think about a special dividend versus an ongoing dividend, can you give us just how you view that difference and can a special dividend be followed by an ongoing dividend? Just any thoughts on how you look at the dividend policy. 
J. Doyle: I'm getting a flag thrown on that question. I think the answer is all I can tell you is what I've said before, which is we look at what's going to generate the best returns. And until we've got this done, saying anything more than that is going to get me in trouble with our general counsel. 
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Patrick Doyle. Please go ahead. 
J. Doyle: So I want to thank you again for your interest. It was a terrific year last year, and appreciate your participating in today's call. And I look forward to speaking with all of you when we conclude our recap. Thanks, everybody. 
Operator: Thank you for participating you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Carmen and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Domino's Pizza 2009 third quarter financial results conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Lynn Liddle, Executive Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Miss Liddle, you may begin your conference. 
Lynn M. Liddle: Thanks, Carmen. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call and I would like to direct your attention in the press release to our Safe Harbor statement as it relates to forward-looking statements and I would kindly ask the members of the media on the call to be in a listen-only mode. We have some prepared remarks this morning that we will follow with an open Q&A. So with us today we have our Chief Financial Officer, Wendy Beck; and our Chief Executive Officer, David Brandon. And we will start today with some prepared comments from Wendy, so if you want to take it over, Wendy. 
Wendy A. Beck: Thanks, Lynn and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our overall results for the third quarter. Our global retail sales increased through positive international same-store sales and flat domestic same-store sales growth. Equally as important, we grew our bottom line over prior year levels and drove improvements in our operating margins at all three divisions.  Additionally, we continued our trend of repurchasing debt this quarter which benefits our EPS, our balance sheet, and our debt service coverage ratio.  Walking down the P&L, let’s start by taking a look at our top line for the quarter. Our global retail sales grew 3.9% during the quarter when excluding the impact of foreign currency. However, when including this negative impact, our global retail sales were down 1.9%.  The increase this quarter was driven primarily by international same-store sales growth, as well as store count growth in our international business.  Now looking at the different business unit components, domestically our same-store sales were flat for the quarter versus the third quarter of 2008. Franchise same-store sales were up 0.3% while company-owned stores were down 2%. We continue to see domestic store closures with a net 30 stores closed this quarter. These were a result of our efforts to eliminate weak operators but also a sign of the difficult economy over the past 18 months. Going forward, we see some easing of this and are seeing some improvements economically.  Additionally, these net domestic closures are going to be buffered by our strong international store growth so we still expect to end the year with positive global store growth between 175 to 225 net new stores.  And speaking of our international division, our international same-store sales were positive 2.7% on a constant dollar basis and our international division grew by a net 43 stores in the quarter. As a result of this domestic and international top line performance, our total revenues for the third quarter were $302.7 million, a $20.9 million or 6.5% decrease from prior year. This was due primarily to lower cheese prices which affected our domestic supply chain revenues, the impact of the store divestitures in 2008 on our company-owned store revenues, and lower international revenues driven by the negative effect of foreign currency.  Breaking down the decrease, domestic supply chain revenues decreased approximately $14.7 million, or 8.3%, which is primarily the result of lower cheese prices during the quarter versus the prior year quarter. Our company-owned store revenues declined $5.1 million, or 6.6%, mostly due to the 82 stores we divested in 2008 and to a lesser extent, lower same-store sales.  International revenues declined $700,000, or 2.1%, due to the negative impact from foreign currency, partially offset by higher same-store sales and store count growth.  Throughout the year we have discussed the negative impacts caused by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Our royalty revenues were again negatively impacted during the third quarter by approximately $2.3 million.  Based on our current forecast, we do not anticipate to be negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of 2008. As you may recall, we were negatively impacted $3.6 million from the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Foreign currency also negatively impacted international supply chain revenue by $600,000 during the quarter. These declines in international revenues were offset by approximately $2.2 million of revenue improvements, primarily due to higher same-store sales and increased store count.  Moving on to our operating margins, our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased 3.2% in the third quarter versus the prior year period. The increase in our consolidated operating margin was mainly caused by the impact of lower cheese prices. Lower cheese prices hurt our supply chain revenues but do not impact our supply chain dollar margin. They do however impact our supply chain margin as a percent of revenues.  Our supply chain margin increased 1.9% from the prior year quarter. Commodities have dropped significantly year over year. The majority of this increase was due primarily to lower cheese prices in the quarter that had no impact on dollar margins. The average cheese slot price in the third quarter was $1.19 per pound versus $1.98 last year, or approximately a 40% decrease.  Also contributing to our margin improvements was a deflation in other non-cheese commodities. Additionally, our supply chain margins benefited from reduced fuel prices and operating efficiencies put in place over the past year.  Our company-owned store operating margin increased 4.5% from the prior year period. Lower food, delivery, and utility costs accounted for a majority of the margin increase. Food costs as a percent of revenue dropped 4.2%, mostly due to commodity price deflation. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2008 was our highest peak when looking at commodity costs and we are seeing the effect of this in 2009.  Delivery costs were lower because our driver delivery reimbursement dropped with lower fuel prices, and utilities were down as a result of lower gas and electric rates. Offsetting these lower costs were higher labor expenses in the quarter resulting from another round of federal minimum wage rate increases. However, had we not had these rate increases, we would have seen a decline in our overall labor expenses. We continue to closely manage this line item.  Now looking at our G&A expenses, G&A increased $4.2 million in the quarter versus the prior year. Breaking down the increase, $1.8 million of the increase was from gains recorded in the third quarter of 2008 related to the sale of company-owned stores. Excluding this item, normalized G&A increased $2.4 million versus the prior year quarter, due primarily to targeted investments we have discussed over the year. Partially offsetting this increase in the quarter were lower bad debt expenses, which we see as a strong indicator of the strengthening of our franchise system.  As for our income taxes, the only item of note this quarter is that we recorded approximately $200,000 of tax reserve reversals related to certain state income tax matters. This had minimal impact on our effective rate for the quarter and is also outlined in the items affecting comparability table in the earnings release.  Next, our bottom line earnings -- our third quarter diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.31, or $0.17 when adjusted for items affecting comparability. The $0.17 as adjusted EPS figure is a $0.04 increase from the $0.13 in 2008.  Our improved operating results benefited us by $0.04 in the quarter, and our lower net interest expense as a result of our lower debt balance has also benefited us by $0.02 in the quarter. Foreign currency negatively impacted us by $0.02.  Now turning to our balance sheet, in the third quarter we repurchased at a discount $71.8 million of principal on our senior notes for a pretax gain of $14.3 million. Subsequent to the quarter, we repurchased an additional $20.9 million of principal on our senior notes for a pretax gain of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, including our fourth quarter purchases, we have nor repurchased $160.9 million of principal on our senior notes for $108.9 million, resulting in $52 million of pretax gains. These debt repurchases will save us an estimated $3.1 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter and $5.5 million in fiscal 2009.  As mentioned on our second quarter call, during the third quarter we entered into a new $50 million letter of credit facility, which allowed us to transfer our existing letters of credit and draw down an additional $35 million on the revolver that is currently at an interest rate of under 2%.  So we now have $33.5 million outstanding letters of credit under the new facility and $35.2 million of cash restricted on our balance sheet.  In closing, I hope this financial recap has been helpful in putting some additional context around the information we released this morning.  With that, I will turn it over to Dave. 
David A. Brandon: Thanks, Wendy and good morning, everyone. First of all, we are very pleased over the fact that we are holding our own on the domestic sales front. It is still very difficult out there but we certainly feel like we are doing better than most and there are reasons why that is happening. We’ve driven positive traffic in the U.S. for the first three quarters of this year and that has been a very important focus of ours, to get more people involved with our brand and connected with our brand and we feel very good about that.  We’ve had slightly positive same-store sales through the first half of the year in our domestic business and again we think in the context of what’s happening out there, that’s a very positive sign. The third quarter was obviously flat but as we benchmark versus other players out there and look at the overall environment, we feel very good about this. And clearly as Wendy indicated, our profit picture continues to improve.  While a lot of other players out there in our industry are shrinking, we feel pretty good about the fact that we are both building and we are growing and it’s further indication in a clear way that in even the worst of times, our business model works well and we believe strongly that we should achieve even better results as the economy and the consumer spending environment improves.  Now our global retail sales grew steadily, thanks to another strong performance by our international business. We continue to be blessed by the fact that our diverse portfolio of businesses around the globe drive growth and it really minimizes risk because of the diversification that we have.  We are going to be celebrating our 49th anniversary in a few weeks and we will continue to celebrate that we have a very proven, easy-to-understand business model and how fortunate we are to have so many levers that we can pull to drive sales and profits during all kinds of economic cycles, particularly the difficult one that we are working through now.  I feel like we are very well-positioned for the future based on where the brand and the company sits today. We’ve done a lot of work in the area of cost-cutting and controls. I know everybody is talking about that right now because in many instances it’s out of necessity but we really started this process a few years ago and I really feel we got ahead of the curve. We sold off, as you’ll recall, some of our corporate stores in instances where we thought franchisees could run them better and our profit opportunities weren’t as great. We reduced headcount so that we could run lean overheads at our home office. We took some tough measures for a couple of years where we were paying very minimal salary increases. We had no bonus payments. It was tough but it was necessary based on what we needed to do to prepare for the current economic circumstance.  We did a lot of work in our supply chain area, cutting costs, moved to a twice-a-week delivery process which saved us a significant amount in fuel and mileage and created a lot of efficiencies. We worked on a special cheese contract that has added a lot of value. We’ve worked on our purchasing efficiencies and certainly have done a great job overall in our supply chain area.  So while others are hunkering down and cutting costs out of the necessities of the moment, we were able to be investing in and growing our business in really three key areas that I just want to briefly mention -- marketing, franchise operations, and technology.  First of all in marketing, we are investing in our marketing in a number of ways, particularly in the new product innovation area. We’ve created several new product platforms, Domino's Legends Pizza, our bread bowl pasta products, lava cakes, and of course the one that I am going to highlight a little bit more specifically today is oven baked sandwiches.  If you dial back, it was only a few quarters ago that for just $250 per store to purchase a few small wares, we literally became the largest sandwich delivery company overnight. In the past year, sandwiches have become nearly a $200 million business for us. We’ve sold nearly 40 million sandwiches in 12 months and as you know, we are on air right now with four new varieties, a line extension of this platform and we expect that these will further extend our reach in the delivered and carry-out sandwich category.  We’ve also increased our marketing spend this year. We have more weeks on TV in a substantial way versus a year ago, which provides us with a more robust marketing plan overall and certainly allows us to get more heavily involved in online marketing, which continues to be a very important and growing segment of our marketing spend.  I am also pleased to announce that our franchisees have voted to increase the national ad spend for next year, which will put us in a position where in 2010 Domino's Pizza will have a record year as it relates to the number of weeks that we will be on television, as well as other important marketing initiatives. Now something that we are very proud of, we continue to increase traffic at a time of consumer malaise, something that makes both our team and our franchisees very happy. And speaking of our franchisees and franchise operations, we believe that we’ve done a great job over the last year to 18 months in investing in the most important aspect of our business and that’s our franchisees. We are helping them to stay healthy and making sure that our good operators are rewarded with acceptable levels of profit.  Franchisees have always been and continue to be the key to the success of our brand and our company and I am pleased to state that our relationship with our franchise community is currently working as well as it has in my 10 plus years here at Domino's. We are just working together really, really well in the spirit of cooperation and getting things done and moving the business forward.  We’ve closed a few weak stores, and we’ve talked about that. We’ve exited some poor operators. We’ve talked about that in the past and the net of that is that it’s really created a stronger franchise base.  We’ve also invested in improving our auditing system to keep our store operations at the top of their game. And one of the indicators that that is working is that we were rated number one in the American Consumer Satisfaction Index this year. We led everyone in fast food, including Starbucks and Papa John’s. We improved from our first year score by 15% and being number one not just in the pizza category but in overall QSR we think says a lot about the work that we are doing at the retail level.  We are very focused on increasing our franchisee profits and getting them healthier and getting them better returns on their investment. It’s our number one corporate objective for 2009. We’ve been identifying areas of opportunity for profit enhancements and we’ve been promoting them heavily across the system and it’s important to note that our franchisees today are receiving profit sharing checks from our supply chain centers that are currently at record high levels, which just further adds to their profitability during the year. We spoke a while back about our mandatory franchisee training program that was part of our commitment to strengthening the system. I am pleased to report that over 90% of our franchisees will have completed our high performance franchisee training program by the end of the year, which means we have put over 1,000 franchisees through this program since the beginning of the year, something we are very proud of. It was a big initiative and it is going extremely well. Last I want to talk a little bit about technology -- a large part of our franchisee retraining includes a focus on technology and how our pulse system can be used to help them improve their business going forward.  The pulse system has excellent tools for efficient labor scheduling and theft prevention, features that our franchisees love because they improve their bottom lines. It also gives us a chance to promote online ordering nationwide and online ordering for us now is 19% of our sales on average. We have online order penetration as high as 45% in some of our stores. This affords us the ability to increase our ticket because the ticket is naturally higher with online orders and it’s important to note that we are now America’s fourth largest e-commerce site, just behind Amazon, Staples, and Office Depot in terms of the numbers of transactions that are taking place online.  According to NPV Crest, we have leap-frogged the competition by becoming the leader of online ordering market share. Our growth in online sales has outpaced the category in the last 12 months.  I just want to speak a minute about international. It’s been growing stores and posting positive results for 63 consecutive quarters. We’ve had yet another positive quarter in terms of same-store sales in the third quarter of this year. We are still on track for our long-term outlook for this business unit of sales comps of between 3% and 5%. Interestingly enough, the U.S. only has about 1,000 more stores presently than our international business as we expect to cut the ribbon on our 4,000th international store some time in the next few months.  And based on current store trends, our growth in international should put us in a position where our international store count would surpass our domestic store count in the next four to five years, something that is truly unbelievable based on how far we’ve come in the last 10 years or so.  International currently contributes nearly half of our global retail sales and 35% of our profits and Wendy mentioned the negative impact of currency exchange that has been hurting us during the first half of the year. That seems to be improving in our direction this quarter and as we project forward and we try to stay out of the business of projecting currencies but it looks like that’s an area where we potentially can have some better news in the quarters that come ahead.  This brings me to our last topic, and that is our balance sheet and a topic of overall importance and that’s our capital structure. To be clear, we are very -- and I want to underscore very -- comfortable with our current debt levels. We have a long history at this company now of levering up the balance sheet, rewarding our shareholders in tax efficient ways, delevering as a result of the cash flow that we generate and doing it all over again.  That 3.5% to 5.5% leverage ratio is really our normal and it has been our normal for really the past 11 years. Our primarily franchise store model and the resulting free cash flow we generate makes increasing the leverage on our business the right corporate finance decision. It was back in 2007 when we refinanced our debt via a very attractive securitization method and it continues to be the right decision today.  Our asset-backed securitization facility is unique and we want to keep it as long as we can because we recognize we may not be able to duplicate it in the future. It has a 6% fixed interest rate with only one major covenant, and one that we’ve discussed in the past, the DSCR, or debt service coverage ratio. It is a five-year financing with interest only payments until 2012 and we have the option to extend this for two additional years and in fact we have the ability to automatically extend it if we reach a certain level with our debt service coverage ratio.  It has been our plan and our intention to extend this financing and take full advantage of it until 2014 when it will end.  I am pleased to report that based on our current EBITDA trends and projections, and our aggressive debt buy-back activity so far this year that Wendy reviewed with you, our current projections show that we will meet the necessary DSCR covenant levels to qualify for this extension. And that is even using our most pessimistic assumptions.  Our normal approach to managing our business, which we believe is prudent, is to model three different scenarios as we look out into the future. One is the worst-case, one is the expected case, and one is the optimistic case.  In the worst case, we assume that our sales comps are below our stated long-term outlook and in the optimistic case, we assume our sales comps are above that outlook. And I want to mention that even under our worst case scenario, we are able to comfortably meet the DSCR hurdle that would automatically extend the ABS financing for another two years. So we feel very confident we will be able to achieve this important objective not only for our company but as a significant benefit to our investors.  Now, once we start to approach the end of this financing, we plan to refinance this debt in whatever manner is most attractive at the time and based on our projections, this will not be a problem -- in fact, the leverage ratio that we’ll likely achieve in the next refinancing of our current debt will be lower than any of our past refinancing events. So we like where we are and we like where we are going as it relates to our capital structure and I wanted to make sure I emphasized this at the present time.  So in conclusion, I am as excited and as optimistic about the direction of our business as I have been in quite some time. It is still very challenging out there in terms of the overall environment but we are executing better in all phases of the business and I am particularly excited about some of our aggressive plans for driving growth in all of our operating units in the future.  So with that, I will turn things over to the operator and we’d love to entertain your questions. 
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. 
John Glass - Morgan Stanley : A couple of questions -- one is on the international comps and understanding they are still better than the U.S. but they have slowed sequentially, is there anything behind those numbers? In other words, are there markets that are significantly underperforming or outperforming that that would make the numbers slow sequentially?
David A. Brandon: Yeah, we had a couple of events in the quarter in a couple of our key markets that we would characterize, at least at this point, as more extraordinary than anything that we see as a pattern or a trend. And one of the reasons that I particularly emphasized the fact that we think that 3% to 5% growth rate in international continues to be a good kind of long-term expectation is for the fact that we still think that that’s a very good run-rate for that business. So it was a little softer than that by a small amount in this quarter but we don’t see that at -- at least at this stage, we don’t see that as any kind of a trend or problem. 
John Glass - Morgan Stanley : What were those events or where did they occur? What was the nature of them, I guess?
David A. Brandon: That would be a much longer discussion than we should have -- we can have today and probably one that I would need some help from the team in terms of being as thorough and as specific as I would like to be. 
John Glass - Morgan Stanley : Okay. You mentioned that the -- you’ve invested in marketing and franchisees and technology. I just want to clarify -- you talked about those investments as largely being in the past in the script but in the release, you talked about being prepared to invest in the future. Are there future investments that are material that we need to be aware of in any of those areas that might have an impact in either the capital spending or the margins of the business in the upcoming quarters?
David A. Brandon: Well, in the release when I talked about how we are now prepared to invest, it’s really an affirmation of the investments that we’ve already talked about, the fact that we have done a lot of work in retraining our franchisees, the whole initiatives around our F-rated franchisees and forcing some of those transactions, the new OER program that we’ve got out there that’s lifting the quality performance of our stores. What I am really relating to is the ongoing initiatives that we continue to invest in. I’m really not announcing anything new or different. 
John Glass - Morgan Stanley : Okay, and then just last question -- can you clarify how many weeks you’ll be on TV in 2010 versus ’09 with the new franchisee vote?
David A. Brandon: Yeah, I could but I won't. That’s not something that we are going to advertise for reasons that I think are pretty obvious but I am comfortable in telling you that it will be more weeks than we’ve ever had in our history and we feel very good about that. 
John Glass - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Great. Thank you. A couple of questions as well -- one, thinking about the broader category, the segment obviously faces the ongoing headwinds of the higher average check but it does seem like, and you mentioned that perhaps you are happy where you are relative to the broader category. I’m just wondering whether you could talk about kind of the lower priced items perhaps being -- countering that headwind, where you kind of see the category and where you are currently positioned versus perhaps some of your national and local competitors, perhaps what the broader industry is comping in the U.S. versus what you are doing at this point -- just some broader color on the category and how you are bucking that trend. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Yeah, as we set the table for this year, we believed that it was going to be a very, very difficult year for our category and most categories, particularly at the dinner day part. And our whole strategy was to focus on traffic, with the notion being that during these difficult times, if we could hold traffic or even increase traffic in this environment, get more people involved with the brand, more phones ringing, more people visiting our stores, even if we were using some lower ticket items as ways to attract that consumer and getting into some day parts that have traditionally lower tickets associated with them, that overall we were going to be in a much stronger position not only for our performance this year but how that was going to set us up for growth when the consumer comes back and the dinner day part gets healthier.  And at least through the first three quarters, we are excited about the fact that we are traffic positive. I don’t think there’s a lot of people out there who are but we’ve got more people coming into the brand. We think that speaks highly to what we’ve done with expansion of our menu and working on day part with sandwiches and some of the other things that we’ve incorporated.  Since our sales are only slightly positive for the year year-to-date, you can see that we are trading off a little bit of ticket in terms of some of the menu variations that we put out there but we think it’s absolutely the right strategy because again, when the dinner day part starts to become healthier, we are going to be the beneficiary of that.  So the category is still tough, the dinner day part is still tough. We are glad that we are out there with a more diversified expanded menu. We think the players out there that don’t have those levers to pull and those things working on their behalf are probably going to take hits as a result. The more that they are a one-ball juggler at the dinner day part I think the more difficult it is going to be for them to grow traffic and ultimately grow sales. So I like where we are.  As it relates to the local and regional players, you know, that’s 150 different discussions and it’s really by market, by operator but all in all, we think our menu expansion has helped us because oftentimes those local competitors, one of the advantages they had was a broader menu offering and the fact that we now have sandwiches, we have pasta, we have dessert items, we have some of the things that traditionally we have not offered we think puts us in a better position where we can go toe-to-toe with those guys. So generally, we feel good about our positioning but again, that varies greatly as you go market to market.  I hope that answers your question. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Yeah, I’m just wondering versus your relatively flat U.S. comp, what you are hearing from your own industry sources as to what the category is growing at this point or what the category is shrinking, I should say, at this point. 
David A. Brandon: The category generally is experiencing negative traffic and the only players that we can monitor with great specificity are the public companies who report and you know one of our major competitors has already reported and one hasn’t yet but that’s as specific a data as we can get in terms of individual brands and companies. But the industry data that we have overall shows that the dinner day part continues to be hurt and that the overall traffic continues to be negative. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Great, and then just talking about commodities, just wondering whether you can give us an update for perhaps the remainder of ’09 and whether you have any initial thoughts on ’10 based on what you are able to secure? I think you said after the second quarter that you thought your basket for ’09 would be down high-single-digits. Obviously we’ve seen further easing for most of the quarter on cheese. I’m just wondering whether we can get an update on that.  And then just as it relates to cheese, it seems like it’s down significantly year over year but rallied huge in recent weeks. Just wondering how that volatility changes your approach or perhaps that of the broader category when it comes to discounting.
David A. Brandon: I’ll defer to Wendy on that, only I’ll just caution you to say that after 49 years, we are not too proud to admit that we have no idea as to where commodities are going and how quickly they can move, particularly cheese, but we’ll tell you what we know at this point and most of that is based on what we are experiencing today. 
Wendy A. Beck: So overall, we anticipate the majority of the commodities to be relatively flat in quarter four but down significantly year over year from the fourth quarter of ’08. Cheese, as you mentioned, is rising. Right now current forecasts show that it could be as much as $0.30 a pound rising in the fourth quarter but again, it’s hard for us to forecast that so we’re looking at that, at the time that it may be rising and yes relatively still gaining a benefit from the prior year. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : And kind of an initial basket for 2010, if you were to just use current prices, obviously not being able to forecast much better than anybody, but how does that basket look for 2010?
David A. Brandon: Yeah, I’ve got all kinds of people in the room shaking their head at me that we don’t project baskets for 2010, so we’ll -- you know, we are obviously beginning to work on our budget for next year and we are starting to wrestle with some of those issues but we are not prepared to go public with any point of view. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Okay, and then just lastly, the shareholder value topic, I know you often mention $1 million a week in free cash so a healthy $50 million a year -- I’m just wondering the best approach to creating such value. I know you don’t currently have an ongoing dividend or any share repurchase activity going on. Just wondering whether we might see either of those increased or perhaps further debt pay-down, kind of what you are seeing as the best opportunity, especially if discounts on the debt you are buying back are more limited going forward?
David A. Brandon: Well, as we’ve shown and history is the best teacher, we’ve at various times thought that the right thing to do was deliver a very tax-efficient dividend. At other times, we’ve bought back stock at substantial levels and other times we’ve bought back debt to deleverage. That’s all based on a variety of assessments that we make in terms of what is in the best interest of our shareholders.  In the most recent past, you can see that our primary objective has been to make sure that we positioned our company to take full advantage of the securitization and the way to do that is to extend it two years and the way to make sure that happens is to manage that debt service coverage ratio to a level where we can be assured that that’s going to happen.  The best way to make those numbers work is to make sure that our EBITDA continues to increase. At the same time, we reduce that debt by repurchase and certainly if you can go out there and repurchase that debt at a substantial discount, it has an even greater multiplier effect.  So in the recent past, we felt that the best way for us to deploy capital and the best interest of our shareholders long-term is through debt repurchase and although we never telegraph what we are going to do going forward, that certainly has been the most recent strategy that we’ve embarked upon and we think is yielding us significant benefits. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Even if a discount wasn’t perhaps available going forward, that would still be the preferred approach in the near-term?
David A. Brandon: Well, right now all things considered, we believe that deleveraging the company and creating the benefit that that achieves for our shareholders is a very intelligent thing to do and it is also important to note that current tax law is encouraging us to embark upon that strategy because we get a significant tax deferral benefit as we deleverage the company and that’s a new rule that has provided us a new incentive to make the economics of debt repurchase even stronger than they once were, so we’re going to take advantage of that and think about tax consequences as we think about extending the financing and as we think about what creates the greatest shareholder value. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital : Great. Appreciate the color. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi. 
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: Just a little bit more color on the U.S. market -- obviously same-store sales were pretty decent relative to the industry and you didn’t see the deterioration that some of your other competitors have seen. How much of that is due to new product versus promotions and how -- you know, with the industry kind of slowing down and you have low commodities, what’s the level of promotions that you are seeing from your competitors, both the chains as well as the mom and pops?
David A. Brandon: It’s hard to separate new products from promotions because sometimes they overlap. You know, we promote new products and sometimes we put new products in combination with existing products so [I think more a basket] under the umbrella of marketing, I think our marketing right now is in a very good place. Our advertising is scoring well and working well. Our new products are doing well. We are achieving our mix objectives. Our promotions seem to be driving consumer behavior and providing us some benefit in terms of lift and overall I am extremely pleased with what our marketing group is doing in combination with our franchise partners because national marketing is really important but also equally important is the local store marketing and the marketing that we are doing at the market level.  So I feel really good about how that’s working and I see it building momentum and one of the reasons I said I’m as excited as I’ve been in a while is it really feels like we are starting to see some of these things really catch hold and they will make even a bigger difference as we move forward.  What was the back half of your question? I’m sorry. 
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: Sure, just the level of promotions coming out of mom and pops as well as the chains. 
David A. Brandon: We are not seeing what I would characterize as unusual behavior out there in terms of kind of crazy discounting or people using price as a lever in desperation to try to gain some share. And that’s a comment in terms of the national outlook. Now I can tell you about a couple of markets, and I think it’s more prevalent in markets that were substantial growth markets -- you take a market where there was huge growth, real estate inflation, back three or four years ago, you know, tracks of homes were being built by the day and so retailers went out and in some cases built spec stores based on anticipated growth. And then all of a sudden these markets hit the skids and real estate goes to hell in a hand basket and at the same time, these homes don’t get built and you’ve now got a situation where you are overbuilt with the number of stores and everybody is trying to keep those stores alive and you discount as a strategy to try and build some share and support your infrastructure.  That type of scenario is pretty limited. It’s only occurring in a handful of markets where you could probably guess where those markets are, where the growth trajectory went from extreme meteoric rise in growth to substantial reductions in growth.  Other than that though, other than those specific kind of sunbelt markets, I would tell you that on a national basis, the pricing has been fairly disciplined and I don’t see it as a threat to what we are doing with our marketing or our margins. 
Greg Badishkanian - Citi: Good. Very helpful, thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan. 
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: Sorry if I missed this point -- what is the shift in national advertising from ’09 to ’10 as a percentage of sales? Have you quantified that?
David A. Brandon: No, we haven’t really released that. What we -- and we’ll talk about that. That’s maybe something we’ll go into more detail in the future. It’s a relatively recent event and it was something that we worked out with our franchisees. We got 100% participation and support that affords us the ability to really have a larger, more robust national advertising fund for next year that will afford us the ability to do some pretty exciting things. But in terms of how that mechanism works, I’m not sure what we’ve said and what we can say at this point and so we’ll come back to you later. 
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: In the past it’s come out of regional co-op -- I mean, should we think about something similar in this case or it’s an actual increase in spend?
David A. Brandon: Yeah, it’s more of a shift but time will tell whether it’s an increase in spend because the shift is occurring to national but then the co-ops have the ability to replace with additional spend at the local level and oftentimes history has shown us that that’s what happened, so time will tell in terms of how this all works its way out but under any of the scenarios that we can imagine, it’s an extreme positive for the brand for us to have the kind of leverage that we are going to have in our national advertising fund. 
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: You know, you’ve obviously outperformed significantly in 2009 -- could you put that in the context of -- you know, I just remember a few years ago where you guys really had to firm up your new product testing, market testing in terms of properly predicting the success rate of your products. I mean, do you feel that you are in the right place at this point or are you continuing to fix what you’ve done in terms of your capabilities in predicting future success?
David A. Brandon: I really like where we are, John. I think the platforms that we’ve chosen have all been good ones. They’ve all proven they resonate with consumers. They are all great products. They are lifting the quality image of our brand. The oven baked sandwiches when we have a two-to-one preference over the leader in the category, that’s huge and it lifts the overall brand. You know, when we’re out there with lava cake dessert products and legend high-end pieces, these are things that are having more of just an impact on mix and some incremental sales -- they are really lifting the quality image of our brand and we think that’s extremely important.  I really like where we are. We are going to market faster than we ever have. It used to take us too long once we had an idea that we felt was a good one to be able to get it to market. We are getting to market really quickly. We are able to react and move fast and we have a pipeline now where once upon a time we might have a meeting and we decide which one of our two choices we would use to fill a marketing window -- now we have a list of choices and depending on the scenarios that we are looking at, we have the ability to be flexible and move in one direction or another.  So I like where we are, I like what our marketing team is doing and I feel some momentum that we didn’t have before and it feels pretty good. 
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: And one last thing for me -- a lot of companies have obviously flexed down their cost structures, given what is a challenging top line environment. Is there anything that you foresee, assuming the top line environment improves, that you may need to flex back? In other words, increase your cost structure or do you think you can accept any increases in revenue, whether same-store or new store growth, you know on the cost structure that you’ve managed your business down to?
David A. Brandon: It’s a great question. We’ve made those investments. I mean, the training investment has been made and it’s in the plan and it’s part of our performance this year. The OER and the more careful oversight of what’s going on at the retail level, that’s been made. The technology investments for the most part have been made and anything that we have to make will have pay-backs associated with it that will be attractive.  We feel really good about the investment that we made in the thin crust plant that affords us the ability to do a vertical integration play that allows us to be manufacturing a product that we were paying a significant margin to have somebody else manufacture for us. That plan is up and operating. I visited it, it looks great. It’s doing a terrific job and the pay-back on that CapEx project is going to be extraordinarily fast.  So we have made a lot of the investments, we are well-positioned, there’s no big needs out there -- just big opportunities. And so the only thing we’ll be talking about in terms of net investment would be something that comes along that we believe can give us a great pay-back and really jump-start the business. 
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: Okay, great. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Joe Buckley with Merrill Lynch. 
Joe Buckley - Merrill Lynch: A couple of questions -- the company store performance lagging the franchisees, is that still a function of geography more than anything else in your view?
David A. Brandon: You bet. Interestingly enough, Joe, we have corporate markets where we are dramatically outperforming our franchisees and doing a terrific job. But as I think I’ve mentioned on past calls, we have certain strategic concentrations in terms of market positions in places like Las Vegas and Phoenix and Southern Florida that are having a significant impact currently on the overall performance of Team USA. Those are just very, very tough markets and I think they are for everybody in the retail industry. 
Joe Buckley - Merrill Lynch: And then a question on the extension to 2014 on the debt -- EBITDA is still down year over year. It was down last year as well. In that worst case scenario, can you give us some sense of what EBITDA has to do sort of worst case that you would still qualify for the extensions?
David A. Brandon: Joe, our worst-case scenario is very pessimistic. We really create a situation where we close a bunch of stores that we don’t ever believe would be closed. We have significant negative sales. We stress test this pretty well in terms of how we look at the negative scenario and when you look at the impact of that on our EBITDA, I mean, it really creates a situation where our EBITDA does not grow a substantial amount. It maintains a pretty flat posture when you stress test the model at that level. And what I am here to report is even at that what I consider to be overly pessimistic approach to stress testing the model, when you combine that EBITDA and that free cash production with the continued deleveraging of the company, we get there. And to me, that’s a very important significant outcome. It’s a very -- and that’s the reason we’re highlighting it today because we have reached a point in terms of our debt repurchase and what we consider to be reasonable EBITDA trend assumptions where we feel comfortable that that’s a scenario that is going to live its way out. 
Joe Buckley - Merrill Lynch: Okay, and then last question, the product pipeline, from what you described, can we assume that there’s a pretty robust product pipeline for 2010 that might include some new introductions? And I guess I’d ask whether or not there might even be new categories as there were in the past 12 months?
David A. Brandon: I’ll just say this is a tough area for me because I’m excited and I would love to yap on about some of the things I’m most excited about. We have a very busy marketing calendar for 2010 -- very busy and it will include a number of different topics that I think will resonate with the consumer and will create news and I really better shut up beyond that, other than that’s kind of where we are and that feels pretty good to me. 
Joe Buckley - Merrill Lynch: Okay. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Smith with [Felt] & Company. 
Mark Smith - Felt & Company: A couple of questions for you -- first can you give us any insight on comp trends during the quarter and if there was any impact from Labor Day and some of the back-to-school shopping pushed back a little bit?
David A. Brandon: Yeah, I think one of the things that really is difficult right now is that patterns are really difficult to establish. We see gyrations of consumer behavior out there that’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen. You know, normally you get in a certain track and that track is kind of consistent and if it’s a track, positive track it stays positive and if it’s a negative track, it stays negative.  We are seeing much more volatility from week to week, weekend to weekend, topic to topic. So my general response to your question is that as opposed to a lot of times in my past where it feels like you can say gee, the back half of the quarter was stronger than the first half or visa versa, it’s really kind of all over the place and it makes it very difficult for us to forecast.  And I think it’s just a sign of the times. The consumer changes and reacts very quickly to whatever the news of the moment is and it does have an impact on their behavior.  So no real pattern of -- no real trend or pattern of behavior in the quarter that I think would be material or useful as it relates to projecting that forward. 
Mark Smith - Felt & Company: Okay, and to follow-up on some questions from earlier, you talked a bit about product mix and some of your new products and the impact on check -- can you talk at all about the profitability as you’ve seen a shift in some of this mix, especially for your franchisees? 
David A. Brandon: Yeah, certainly our margins at the store level will be up this year and as a result of the fact that not only have commodities but as traffic has improved, it certainly has a significant impact. You’d have to go into each one of these products one by one and talk about their food costs and their margin but we won't do that anymore than our competitors will do that, other than I can tell you that the food costs and the margin opportunities associated with these products that we have launched and that we are launching, are all within the band of what’s acceptable in terms of our operating model. We can’t sell our franchisees to get excited about a product that they don’t make money on.  Now in some cases, we do a lot of coaching about penny profit versus margin because you don’t take percentages to the bank but when you combine the impact of commodities and the fact that we are traffic positive and the fact that our sales are trending better, the combination of that is improving unit economics at the retail level substantially and everybody views that as a good thing.  For instance, we wouldn’t be rolling out four new variations of our sandwich line if we weren’t very pleased with the profitability of that product. And we wouldn’t be devoting entire windows to bread bowl pasta and sandwiches if we didn’t really like what that was doing for our profit at the store level. 
Mark Smith - Felt & Company: And last question, can you talk at all about your franchisees’ health, especially regarding kind of changes in the credit markets and opportunities to increase some growth, and also again looking at their profitability and any significant increase in cheese prices and how that may affect them?
David A. Brandon: Our franchisees are healthier than they’ve been in quite some time. Obviously if margins are increasing and sales are better, they are going to feel that. When their profit-sharing checks are at record levels from the supply chain center, they are going to feel that. We’ve gotten rid of some of our poorest performers in some of our stores around the edge and frankly we’ve closed some stores that were not particularly buyable based on who owned them and where they were positioned. So we’ve done a lot of that work and by far and away our franchise system is stronger and more secure today than it was a year ago, or even earlier this year.  So we feel very, very good about that and we continue to monitor that closely and work hard at trying to get those margins at the retail level up to the point where our franchisees are really getting the kinds of returns that they like to have.  The financing market is improving a bit, still tough. There’s some transactions happening out there. There will probably be some more. We’ve got some of our healthier franchisees who are generating enough cash now that they are looking opportunistically at investments so we are still putting together our plan for 2010 but I think generally we feel that it’s going to be a much more positive plan in terms of net store growth in our domestic business than what we’ve seen in the last couple of years and that feels pretty good to us. 
Mark Smith - Felt & Company: Excellent. Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Forte with Telsey Advisory Group.
Tom Forte - Telsey Advisory Group : Thank you. Two questions and one to some degree was just answered -- on store closures, it looks like you had a comparable number to last quarter. If you had a continued challenging sales environment and a tight credit market, do you feel any differently today about purchasing stores versus letting the stores close? And then second, real quick, I think you made a comment earlier about seeing encouraging data points regarding economic -- the economic behavior. Are there any around the dinner day part that you could share?
David A. Brandon: Yeah, as it relates to the whole store growth situation, as the unit economics improve at the store level, you are just going to see less closures because some of the more marginal franchisees and you always have the bottom 20%, particularly in a system as large as ours, you are always going to have those around the bubble. Well, when those margins start to improve, they kind of come off the bubble and they become more encouraged. And you also see your stronger franchisees start to invest in growth.  So comparing quarter to quarter on store closings I think can probably mislead you as much as it can help you because some of those are timing issues and some of them are planned and the point is in the big picture, we see a deceleration of closings, the potential for an acceleration of openings. We’ll have more opportunities for franchisees to buy some of these failing stores as opposed to having them either close permanently or temporarily close -- that’s a positive thing. Whether we as a corporation are a buyer or a seller really depends on a number of opportunistic factors that we can consider and we will continue to do that as we move forward.  I just think the big picture here is that we’ve got a lot of the heavy lifting behind us in terms of closures and the exiting of poor performing franchisees and as I look forward, I think that’s going to be a much better, stronger picture in terms of our domestic business.  As it relates to economic indicators out there, I hopefully didn’t mis-communicate or mislead anybody -- I think generally speaking the dinner day part continues to be under substantial pressure. I think it’s getting tougher out there. I don’t think it’s getting a lot easier. I don’t see any indications that there’s a significant releasing of discretionary spending on behalf of consumers at the dinner day part. I still think consumers are pretty much in the bunker and being very careful and that’s one of the areas they can save the most money. So I think the industry generally is continuing to experience a reduction in the out-of-home meals at the dinner day part and that’s probably going to continue for a little while and that’s why I am glad we don’t have all our eggs in that basket anymore because we’ve now diversified the menu to the point where we can play in some of these other day parts and we have the benefit -- and this should never be overlooked -- I mean, we had the benefit when that dinner day part gets under pressure, in some cases we become a beneficiary because we do get trading down opportunities and we are certainly less volatile than most other dinner day part players, simply because we do get that trade-down effect. 
Tom Forte - Telsey Advisory Group : Thank you. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael [Wallowman] with Sidoti & Company. 
Michael Wallowman - Sidoti & Company: Just two quick questions here -- can you guys give us a kind of an indication here of what the FX impact would be here in the fourth quarter if currency kind of stays flat to where it is now? Would you actually be seeing a benefit or would it be really more of a neutral compared to fourth quarter last year?
David A. Brandon: I’ll pass that over to Wendy. 
Wendy A. Beck: Okay, so for fourth quarter last year, that was where it significantly took a turn and we had a negative impact of $3.6 million in the prior year same quarter, or $0.04 EPS so what we are anticipating this year is that we will be relatively flat year over year and possibly with a small benefit. But that’s based on the latest consensus report that we’ve received and that can change drastically. 
Michael Wallowman - Sidoti & Company: Okay, and then the last thing here, positive traffic through the first three quarters here, can you guys give us any kind of an idea of the breakdown how much of that traffic is stemming from being open now for the lunch day part and what traffic looks like at the dinner day part compared to that?
David A. Brandon: You know, a quick answer, no. We start to get into some details that again we think are a bit proprietary and would be helpful for our competitors and we never like to do that.  But what we will tell you is that getting the stores open and having a lunch business is an ongoing opportunity for us because it’s building and it’s growing and having the stores open and getting people out there detailing local companies and people and saying hey, we’re open for business, and oh by the way, here’s our menu and we’ve got a lot of things for you to choose from -- we like where we are today and we think there’s a lot of upside there.  We are also pleased over the fact that sandwiches, by way of example, there’s a significant number of our pizza orders at the dinner day part that go out with sandwiches and that shows us that that’s a product category that is not just about lunch but also has helped kind of create a greater level of interest in the brand, even at the dinner day part.  And furthermore, we’ve been delightfully surprised at how many sandwiches we sell at late night. It seems like there’s a lot of people that enjoy that opportunity at the later day part than just ordering pizza.  So the platform is working for us across a number of dimensions and we feel really good about that but to quantify that and give that specific information is probably more than we want to talk about. 
Michael Wallowman - Sidoti & Company: All right, thanks. 
Operator: And your last question comes from the line of Colin Guheen with Cowen. 
Colin Guheen - Cowen & Company: Most of my questions have been answered but I guess just stemming from the last question, as you look at the lunch platform, is there real opportunity looking into 2010 and 11 to start putting products that have shorter cook times at lunch into the units and/or some [sort of] merchandising strategy that we might be seeing?
David A. Brandon: Yeah, there may be opportunities for either shorter cook times or products that will hold heat and still perform at a high level in terms of the taste and quality, so we are experimenting with a lot of different things that would afford us to be a little bit more of a player in the quick serve area where people don’t have to wait 10 minutes for something to bake. We think there’s some opportunities there and there’s some people out there that have proven there are opportunities there and that’s certainly not an area of the business that we are afraid of pursuing, so we’ve got some interesting thoughts in mind [inaudible] some of these products that might work in that environment. 
Colin Guheen - Cowen & Company: Thanks a lot. 
Operator: There are no further questions. Do you have closing remarks?
David A. Brandon: My only closing remark is to thank you all for participating in our call today. We had some great questions and I hope this has been helpful and we are pleased and proud of what we did in the third quarter and we are already fast at work at trying to make the fourth quarter equally as successful and we will look forward to reporting that to you in the early part of next year. Thank you very much. 
Operator: Thank you for participating in today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

===== 2009 Q2  (2009-07-22 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Lynn Liddle – Executive Vice President Communications, Investor Relations Wendy Beck – Chief Financial Officer David Brandon – Chairman, Chief Executive Officer
Analysts: Gregory Badishkanian – Citi Joseph Buckley – Bank of America, Merrill Lynch Jeffery Bernstein – Barclays Capital Steve Reese – J.P. Morgan Michael Wolleben – Sidoti & Co. Tom Forte - Telsey Forte Group Colin Guheen - Cowen and Company
Operator: At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the 2009 second quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce our host for today's call, Miss Lynn Liddle, Executive Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations.
Lynn Liddle: Thank you everyone for joining us this morning. With us today are Wendy Beck, our Chief Financial Officer and David Brandon, our Chairman and CEO and they'll be both making some comments. We'll follow with Q&A. But before we begin, a couple of points I'd like to make. This morning there was an inaccurate wire report written about us and I just want to make sure I clarify the record for everyone. They reported $0.16 of EPS and we in fact had $0.21 in EPS as adjusted, so I just want to make sure everybody has that information correctly. We think that erroneous report may have led to some others and caused a little bit of confusion in the market this morning. Additionally, I'll turn your attention to our safe harbor statement in the event that forward-looking statements are made and I will ask the reporters on the line to be in a listen only mode. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Wendy Beck.
Wendy Beck: Good morning everyone. We are overall very pleased with our results and I'm happy to run you through those results for the quarter. Then I'll turn it over to Dave who will give you more color. Turning to our results for the quarter, let's start with the top line. Our global retail sales were down 4.7% for the second quarter resulting from a negative impact of foreign currency and lower domestic same store sales.  However, excluding the impact of foreign currency, our global retail sales grew 3.8% during the second quarter. This was driven primarily by international same store sales growth as well as store count growth in our international business. Looking at those individual components, our domestic same store sales were slightly negative, down .7% for the quarter versus the second quarter of 2008. Franchise same store sales were down .4% while company owned stores were down 3.3%.  As Dave will touch upon later in the call, our domestic stores were negatively impacted by an unfortunate viral video incident within the quarter.  As anticipated, we had additional domestic store closures during the second quarter, closing a net 20 stores. These closures reflect both the continued economic challenges as well as our efforts to strengthen and improve our franchise base over the long term. International same store sales were positive, 4.1% on a constant dollar basis, making the 62nd consecutive quarter or over 15 straight years of international quarterly same store sales growth. Additionally, our international division grew by a net 164 stores in the quarter which included 90 new stores in Spain that Dave will discuss in a moment. As a result of this top line performance, our total revenues for the second quarter were $316.6 million, a $17.7 million or 5.3% decrease from prior year that is due primarily to the impact of store divestitures in 2008, lower cheese prices on our domestic supply chain revenues, and lower international revenues driven by the impact of foreign currency. Breaking down the decrease, our company owned store revenues declined $8.3 million or 9.7%, the majority of which was due to having fewer stores as a result of the 2008 store divestitures and to a lesser extent, lower same store sales. Domestic supply chain revenues decreased approximately $7.1 million or 3.9%. Lower cheese prices hurt our supply chain revenues, but do not impact our supply chain dollar margin. However, these lower cheese prices benefited our domestic store unit economics. The decrease in cheese prices was partially offset by increases in non cheese commodities such as boxes and chicken during the second quarter.  International revenues declined $2.3 million or 6.8% due to the negative impact of foreign currency partially offset by higher same store sales and store count growth. As mentioned on both our year and first quarter calls, we anticipated a negative impact from foreign currency throughout fiscal 2009. This did negatively impact our royalty revenues by approximately $3.2 million in the second quarter. Foreign currency also negatively impacted international supply chain revenue by $1.4 million. These declines in international revenues were offset by approximately $2.3 million of revenue improvements primarily due to higher same store sales and increased store count. Moving on to our operating margins, our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased .9% in the second quarter versus the prior year period. As a reminder we define operating margin as revenue less cost of sales. The increase in our consolidated operating margin was mainly caused by the impact of lower cheese prices. Our supply chain margin increased 6% from the prior year quarter. This increase was due to lower cheese prices in the quarter that had no impact on dollar margins. The average cheese block price in the second quarter was $1.20 per pound versus $1.91 last year, or a 37.2% decrease. Offsetting these supply chain margin increases was the impact of higher non cheese commodity prices such as chicken and boxes. Our company owned store operating margin increased .3% from the prior year period. Lower food and delivery costs accounted for a majority of the margin increase. Food costs as a percent of revenues was lower because of cheese costs, while delivery costs were lower because our driver delivery reimbursement dropped with lower fuel prices. Offsetting these lower costs were higher labor expenses in the quarter resulting primarily from last summer's minimum wage rate increases. As a reminder, we will be impacted by another round of Federal wage increases at the end of this week as the third successive annual increase takes effect. Turning to G&A expenses, G&A increased $11.5 million in the quarter versus the prior year. Breaking down the increase, $6.9 million of the increase was from gains recorded in the second quarter of 2008 related to the sale of 27 stores while $4.9 million of the increase was due to stock compensation expense and professional fees recorded in the quarter as a result of our stock option plan changes. As previously announced, we implemented a stock option exchange program during the second quarter which resulted in an incremental stock comp expense of approximately $1 million pre tax. Separately and also as previously announced, we amended stock option agreements to include a retirement provision, resulting in $3.7 million pre tax of stock comp expense, of which we were required to accelerate approximately $3.4 million pre tax of existing expense during the quarter which is in line with our first quarter disclosure. Offsetting these increases in G&A was $2 million of net proceeds received in the second quarter for our insurance settlement related to the viral video incident that Dave will discuss in more detail. Excluding the items I just mentioned, G&A increased $1.7 million versus the prior year quarter due primarily to an increase in our labor costs resulting from additional bonus expense recorded during the second quarter 2009 versus the second quarter of 2008 as a result of us not meeting our performance related targets in 2008. Also, we saw the effect of merit increases and the investments we made in our new franchise audit and training team in G&A in the second quarter of 2009. So our G&A expenses for the second quarter excluding the non recurring items just mentioned is fairly indicative of our anticipated run rate for G&A for the remainder of the year this year. On the income statement, you will also note that we had a $12.9 million gain on extinguishment of debt which I will discuss further in a moment. As for our income taxes, we recorded approximately $2.2 million of tax reserves related to certain state income tax matters. This increased our effective rate to 46.8% for the quarter and is also outlined in the items affecting comparability in the tables in the earnings release. However, as previously indicated, we anticipate approximately 40% normalized rate for the foreseeable future. Next, look at our bottom line earnings. Our second quarter diluted EPA as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.25 or $0.21 when adjusted for items affecting comparability. The $0.21 as adjusted EPA figure is a $0.01 decrease from the $0.22 in 2008. Foreign currency negatively impacted us by $0.03 and our improved operating results primarily from our international supply chain segment benefited us by $0.02 in the quarter. Now let's look at our balance sheet. In the second quarter we repurchased at a discount $25 million of principal on our senior note for a pre tax gain of $12.9 million in the quarter. Subsequent to the quarter, we repurchased an additional $20 million of principal on the senior notes for a pre tax gain of $4.6 million in the third quarter. Year to date, including our third quarter purchase, we have now repurchased $88.3 million of principal on our senior note for $49.6 million, resulting in $38.7 million of pre tax gain. Subsequent to the quarter, we entered into a new $50 million letter of credit facility. We are in the process of moving our existing letters of credit from the variable funding note facility or our VFN to the new facility. This will allow us to draw down the VFN completely, and to date we have borrowed an additional $35 million subsequent to the quarter. Given the uncertainty in the financial markets, we felt it was prudent to maintain and control as much liquidity as possible at a low variable interest rate that approximately 1.8% in the second quarter.  So looking at where we stand currently with our letter of credit, we now have $33.5 million outstanding letters of credit under the new facility. We continue to generate strong free cash flow which feeds our robust cash position, ending the quarter with $61.7 million of restricted cash. In closing, we believe that during these uncertain times, we continue to maintain a strong cash position while demonstrating that we will opportunistically deploy our cash in a manner that drives shareholder value. We are satisfied by our overall results, especially in light of both the economic and internal challenges within the quarter. As we have continued to show, we have a proven business model that is resilient even during these challenging times. This concludes our financial update. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.
David Brandon: Good morning everyone. I'd like to begin by saying that I'm pleased with how we fared in the second quarter and I want to remind you all why we love our business model and why we think we are very well positioned during this challenging economic environment. During these times of uncertainty and volatility, our shareholders benefit from a number of factors which include the fact that we're primarily franchised and that we can bundle the entrepreneurial energy, the investment, and the passion of our dedicated franchisees. We have very steady and predictable cash flows. We have a unique capital structure that provides a lot of flexibility for years into the future and we believe we have a very sound strategic plan with some very important growth initiatives that continue to show great promise. Now thankfully all this helps us weather the current economic storm much better than most brands and companies will. And in spite of the fact that we've had to endure an unfortunate incident early in the quarter that killed our momentum for a couple of weeks, we saw an overall continuation of much of our positive momentum from the first quarter and held steady on many trends that indicate that we're continuing to lead in our category. I'm proud to outline some of those, but first I'll start with my final comments, and I mean final comments regarding the bad news event that took place during the quarter and is thankfully now behind us. But it did have an impact on our domestic sales comparisons so it needs to be included in this briefing. You likely heard about the shot heard round the world that we experience when two now ex team members of a Dominoes franchisee who had a serious warped sense of humor, decided one day to pull a hair brain prank in a store. They inappropriately handled the food in some fairly disgusting ways and they posted it on You Tube and it went viral everywhere. We took quick and decisive action. With the help of some online customers, we identified the culprits. The franchisee fired them immediately and they are being prosecuted. We set the record straight for our customers and we moved on as quickly as possible. Unfortunately we experienced a short term hit to sales primarily in the weeks following the incident that we estimate cost us between 1% and 2% in domestic same store sales for the quarter. So while this impeded our second quarter same store sales progress, we think we are past this unfortunate event and we believe it will not have a lasting negative impact on the overall image of our brand. Now I'm pleased to report that we did have business interruption insurance in place and as Wendy has already told you, we were able to negotiate a net settlement with our insurance provider of $2 million which clearly has eliminated any short term negative financial impact of this problem for our shareholders. Now the other bad news that we have to talk about is no surprise to anyone. It's what we're talking about and wading through every day in the retail sector and in our overall economy. And that is, we have an anemic economy and a consumer that's nervous. Some may say that the consumer is in panic mode and they're very reluctant to open their pocket books. They continue to witness rising unemployment, concerns over the underwater mortgages, the whole credit card debt issues, failing industries and companies, volatile gas prices, threats of tax increases, all the unrest and uncertainty in the world, all manifesting itself as it relates to Dominoes Pizza in an overall retail sector that is at best, limping along. Consumers are looking for value, or better said, they're obsesses with value in this environment. A sluggish quick service restaurant industry particularly in the recent past and the pizza and dinner day part segment is being hit as hard or harder than any other segment that we study. So watching all the industry news, it appears as the early predictions of a second half recovery may have been a bit optimistic and that flat sales may be the new up 5% for awhile based on the way the economy is performing. So in this context, we feel pretty good about our previously stated forecast for 2009 being flat sales for Dominoes, and as I mentioned earlier, we've been able to put several of our initiatives in the win column that makes us feel good, grateful to be leading our category, encouraged on where we can go from here and of course knowing that we have to continue to work hard and smart as a system to keep things going. Now during the second quarter we executed against our strategies of bar-bell price points for every customer and menu expansion with our Big Taste Bail Out promotion and the rollout of Bread Bowl Pasta. Both promotions performed well and achieved important traffic gains. In fact, I'm pleased to report that we've now experienced our second consecutive quarter of positive traffic growth for Dominoes Pizza, and that was a very important goal as we set out the plan for the year, and we're really proud of that. We want to keep it going. Additionally, Bread Bowl Pasta has added yet another product platform to our brand which we can continue to build upon, and our lunch business continues to grow and thrive giving us great incremental lift. Notably, without product at day part expansion, our results would not have been nearly as positive as they have been this year and we feel good about the direction we're headed with our menu management. Proof that our execution is making a difference is a recent win for us, and that is that we were ranked number one in the fast food segment in the American consumer satisfaction index, and as you know, this is an important measure of customer satisfaction. It gets a lot of visibility across the country every year. We've had one of our competitors who's made a real big deal about this every year because they've been very proud of their position and they've haven't been quite as vocal this year because we took over as number one. The consumers rated us higher than anyone in the Pizza category, and we were even higher than all of the major players in the fast food industry as a whole. We are now the overall most improved since the survey began. We improved our first year score by nearly 15% which is huge. Additionally, the most recent MPV Crest market share report ranks us number one in on-line sales with a 28% share of that market ahead of both Papa John's and Pizza Hut. This is up from an 11% share just 24 months ago. Our push to drive technological leadership is an important part of increasing our market share and it provides consumers with lots of ordering options which helps our top line sales and helps our store profits. Our franchisees remain engaged in line with these strategies. They've been executing well and continue to outperform corporate stores again this quarter in sales which obviously we want to do better and better with our corporate stores, but the fact that our franchisees are leading the way is a very important for our business model and for the overall success of our brand. We recently held our world wide rally for our franchisees in Las Vegas and it served as a great opportunity to keep moral high and relationships strong.  Recent improvements in our supply chain profits have also led to improved profit sharing payments which helps improve unit economics for our franchisees. We've even featured some of our franchisees in our ad campaign for Dominoes American Legends Pizza. Since our franchisees are really the heart of our business, and they really were the inspiration for each one of the pizzas in our American Legends line, we decided to include them in our consumer messaging. Now turning to another important element of our business, the cost environment, it continues to be favorable with cheese close to record lows and with the rest of the food basket only slightly higher than a year ago. However, as Wendy mentioned, there's another increase this month in the Federal minimum wage which will impact our corporate stores and to a certain degree, our franchisee's profitability as it has over the past few years. The company will continue to invest this year and make targeted G&A investments in our franchisees and team members. And as you've heard before, we're doing that through training and motivational programs, holding everyone accountable but also offering rewards and incentives to reinforce positive behavior and results, and these costs will continue to show up in a higher G&A year over year as Wendy has already discussed. One division that continues to see great success is our international group. We're very proud of them. They've had robust sales comps in store growth again. Last quarter we announced the opening of Spain. We're pleased to report that we now have 90 Dominoes Pizza stores open and running which adds a new European country to our footprint, and we're very proud of what we've accomplished in a very short period of time. This presence in Spain will not have a material impact on our 2009 earnings, but our international team did a great job in getting this market open and it's going to mean big things for us in the years to come. Another important factor of our international success, particularly in today's economic environment is that this business remains a low risk model for us with no significant capital investment spend. We believe that sustained profit results are proof that the master franchise model is the right one for us internationally. Now we've reinforced again and again that Dominoes is a strong cash flow generator over the course of the year. We continue to generate about $1 million a week in free cash flow and we use that cash in opportunistic ways to benefit our shareholders. We've recently deployed cash against debt reduction, taking advantage of both a favorable tax treatment and attractive prices on our debt. We will continue to do this opportunistically. Our CapEx investments remain lower than most any company our size and scope and we will continue to show great discipline around this spending with every investment requiring either a very short payback or a very long term important positive business building opportunity for the company. With that, I'll pause and Wendy and I will open things up for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Gregory Badishkanian – Citi.
Gregory Badishkanian – Citi: A few questions on same store sales and I think you had a 1% to 2% impact from the You Tube video for the quarter, so would you say that same store sales are running in the positive range at this point?
David Brandon: Yes, if we were to take away the impact which was pretty abrupt and pretty measurable of that incident, we would have completed the quarter positive somewhere between a point to two points, a continuation of the momentum that we saw in the first quarter. So we feel very good about the quarter and the fact that we were able to collect on this insurance payment, we think although we would have loved to have had a positive number, we wish it never would have happened. It really lessened the blow in terms of any impact it had on the financial results of the quarter.
Gregory Badishkanian – Citi: Talking a little bit about initiatives, oven baked sandwiches, pasta, if you could let us know in terms of how they've been performing relative to your expectations and anything new in the horizon that you can share with us knowing that your competitors are listening to this as well.
David Brandon: Right. Thanks for referencing that. It was only a couple of years ago if you put in football vernacular, we had a playbook of one play in it, and it was pizza, and now what's really interesting and fun and exciting about where we sit is that we carefully described what we're doing as platforms. We have a sandwich platform. We have a pasta platform. We have a brand new high end premium pizza platform. And the recent platform is appropriate is because we can build upon what we already have. It opens up a whole new realm for us in terms of flavors and varieties, line extensions, the kinds of things that give us the chance to not only expand our menu, but create more news so that new things are not one time events. So I think what you should for from us is to continue to build upon all of these proven platforms. We've driven the mix of each one of them up well into the double digits and proved that we have a lot of people out there who are interested in these products, who enjoy them, and we can build upon that as we move forward. So we couldn't be more pleased.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley – Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.
Joseph Buckley – Bank of America, Merrill Lynch: Could you talk a little bit more about the company store performance versus the franchise performance and why you think the disparity was so great?
David Brandon: Two factors; one is our franchisees are getting better. The training programs that we're putting them through, the fact that we've weeded out a lot of the F franchisees, the fact that we put a new OER system in place which raises the bar in terms of accountability of operational performance. Our franchisees are running a tougher race than they were before and that's good thing and we feel good about that. As it relates to what's going on with our team USA, our team USA has pocketed investments and our portfolio stores located in specific markets. We don't have the ability to kind of homogenize the whole United States in terms of their results. We kind of live on the basis of how certain markets are performing and without going into a lot of detail, when you have a significant corporate store presence in Las Vegas, Nevada, in Southern Florida, in Phoenix, Arizona, you start to see that we've got some very material assets of our corporate store business located in some of the hardest hit areas of the economy. And so unfortunately, they're in a situation right now where I love the results they're achieving in certain markets, but they're overall average is being negatively impacted by what I would call disproportionate negatives in some of the other markets. We're going to have to slog through that and we're working with our marketing and operations to do better, but without question our team USA unit is flying into some significant headwinds in some of these markets that have really been impacted particularly in the real estate area.
Joseph Buckley – Bank of America, Merrill Lynch: You mentioned the second consecutive quarter of traffic being up. Could you provide some details on that, just what the traffic check mix might have been and what's causing the pressure on check? Part of it I'm imagining has to be the mix as you introduced the sandwiches and the pasta, but I'm curious if you're seeing more competitive pressures on check more recently.
David Brandon: This is an area where we really tip toe because we're not looking to give away anything that could be helpful to us. I think your overall assumption for the quarter can be that we did have positive traffic, so our new product platforms continue to bring in new customers and open up a new realm for us in terms of new interactions with new potential long term customers, and we like that. Obviously we ran a very high value promotion during the quarter in terms of the Bail Out promotion. At the same time, some of our new products offer lower price points for different day parts and so that's going to have a pressure on ticket.  And make no mistake about it, if the stupid incident down in North Carolina wouldn't have happened, we'd be here reporting significant traffic uptick and whatever happened with the ticket would not have been enough to offset another positive quarter when everybody else is reporting some pretty significant negatives. So all in all, we think it fits together well and we like the way we're balancing traffic and ticket right now to grow the business.
Joseph Buckley – Bank of America, Merrill Lynch: On the You Tube incident, it sounds from what you said that you're comfortable with the insurance proceeds so we shouldn't think that EPS would have been higher. We should just think that same store sales would have been higher if the incident had not occurred.
David Brandon: Certainly if we have a couple of weeks where we have significant down turn in sales, that affects royalty streams. It affects snowball sales. It's certainly going to affect the profitability of the business, but it was very short lived. I think the insurance company recognized that we had certainly experienced some negative financial impact with this. They were interested in doing a quick settlement. We agreed with that strategy because we want to move on and that's the way it happened. But a $2 million injection into the quarter, I would safely say covers any of the negatives associated with that incident.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffery Bernstein – Barclays Capital.
Jeffery Bernstein – Barclays Capital: A question on the U.S. comp again. Excluding the You Tube, it sounds like you said you would have been system wide comp maybe up 1% or so, but then you did mention obviously that the macros presumably got tougher with my take. I'm just wondering if you remove the You Tube then going into the second quarter you are cautiously optimistic. Would you say that trends got worse because of the macros or actually you were pleased with the sequential improvement throughout the quarter after the incident? 
David Brandon: We keep a quarterly score card in terms of our reporting to you and if it weren't for the incident we'd be reporting a 1% to 2% positive domestic same store sales performance and we've already had one of our major national competitors report their results and we sure feel good about how we fare against that one, and there's another one yet to come and we don't know what they're going to report. But we think it was a strong quarter for Dominoes Pizza considering all the factors.  We don't get into month to month sales reporting and we're not going to because there's too many things that can influence it, but I would tell you my take overall of the economy is that there is a very jittery consumer out there that is behaving in a very difficult way to predict. So you're going to have periods of time where you feel like it's getting better and you're going to have periods of time where it clearly feels like it's gone the other way. It's going to be very choppy. That's what we've experienced over the last year, and I don't see that changing for at least the next couple of quarters. So I wish I was smart enough to tell you there was some kind of a pattern that had developed that would afford more predictability in terms of sales, but I just don't think it's the case.
Jeffery Bernstein – Barclays Capital: It seems like the second quarter we saw additional debt pay down for a nice discount and then again in the third quarter. I'm just wondering if at this point, I know you said it's more opportunistic, but could it accelerate in terms of more meaningful pay down on your longer term debt or is it really just short term smaller buckets but not likely to change the longer term.
David Brandon: We think it's in everybody's best interest to keep our cards pretty close to our vest in terms of what we might do and what we can do and what options are available to us. As it stands today, we have not done any capital raising event. What we've done is simply take all this terrific free cash flow, while also maintaining very, very adequate, I would say beyond adequate, and I would describe them as conservative cash balances, and then we take some of this free cash flow and we go out and opportunistically claw back some of this debt, and we feel like we've done it in a very smart way and a very efficient, attractive way in terms of price. Who knows what the future holds, but depending on how much debt is available, what the price is, how our business continues to perform, there's all kinds of options available to us as we move forward to continue to deleverage the company and do it in a way that's very accretive to our shareholders and we'll continue to explore that. 
Jeffery Bernstein – Barclays Capital: You mentioned the commodity basket and you mentioned cheese was down 7%, but the rest of the basket was up modestly. I'm just wondering as you look out to the back half of the year, I think you said the basket as a whole would be down single digits. Obviously with the benefit of cheese, and I'm just wondering what the outlook is now for the back half and the full year in terms of cheese and the combined baskets and whether based on that we can assume we would see some meaningful margin expansion in a way that's sustainable in the different margins that you report where you could see that benefit in the back half.
Wendy Beck: First off I would want to remind you that we're rolling over in the third quarter the highest prices that we saw in 2008. So year over year you're definitely going to see improvement in third quarter. It went as high as $2.21, the cheese block in the third quarter, so we will see that. As far as trying to understand where we think commodities are going to go for the later part of the year, there's lots of speculation that cheese can't stay at the same prices that they are. We do think over all we will see some deflation and then again, we'll run better numbers comparatively to the prior year.
Jeffery Bernstein – Barclays Capital: But it will be down single digit basket. Is that a reasonable number for the combined basket?
David Brandon: We are really reluctant to forecast the future as it relates to commodities because we've already proven how bad we can be at that. I would say if current trends continue, we should have a better year against year comparison than maybe even the high single digits. But I say that very reluctantly because those things can change very quickly. But for right now, based on where cheese is, and as Wendy indicated we're going into a really, really favorable comparison, the third quarter could be a really good period for us as it relates to cost comparison and the potential for margin expansion. I'll tell you more about that in about three months.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steve Steve Reese – J.P. Morgan .
Steve Reese – J.P. Morgan: One of the things we worry about when cheese prices are at record lows and we're seeing the consumer chasing value like perhaps never before and as the competition starts to get aggressive and ratchet promotion. Have you seen this yet and how do you think the brand is positioned with value if things start to get more aggressive on the price points?
David Brandon: It's a great question and it's an important question. I would tell you based on how everybody's unit economic model is performing when their top line is contracting, and thankfully ours isn't contracting as much as others, but in this environment where sales are hard to come by, I really believe that the pressure on operators is such that nobody's interested in just giving away the product to somehow make themselves feel better. I think you can see it in the promotional price points, in the overall strategies that people are employing out there. Other than the really, really cheap pizza guys, and I would characterize them as the guys that don't deliver and kind of the carry out cheap product, cheap price that's their niche in the market, other than segment that's always been there and will always be there, I see probably more price discipline right now than we've seen in a long, long time with cheese prices being as low as they are only because I think there are factors that are creating other pressure that are precluding people from feeling like happy days are here again, let's see how low we can drive price so we can gain some share. It just doesn’t seem to be happening.
Steve Reese – J.P. Morgan: On the international side, we really haven't talked about that yet. Still solid but a little softer on the both the one end to your base, so maybe you could talk about if there were any markets that softened that impacted the overall comp or any comment on the international side would be helpful.
David Brandon: You get a pretty good look at how some of our really largest international businesses are performing because our Mexican partner is public as is our U.K. and Ireland partner and our Australian partner which includes both Australia and parts of Europe, specifically France, The Netherlands and Belgium. I think generally speaking, we're in a situation where we have not incurred the same kind of global slowdown that I've heard so many of my peers talk about. We seem to persevere pretty well in terms of our same store sales gains, continuing to open up stores, continuing to open up new markets. So all in all, we still feel very, very positive about the way this business is performing. Now we're watching it very carefully because we hear everybody around us talking about global recessions and slow downs in the global economy, and we don't think we're bullet proof in terms of experiencing that. So we watch it period to period and quarter to quarter, but as it stands right now, we feel pretty good about the numbers the way they're coming in.
Steve for John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: I think in the past, last year you embarked on an intense operational focus for your franchise system, reallocating stores to stronger franchisees. So maybe you can update us on where you stand today with respect to sub par franchisees versus where you were a year ago and what you're doing to address this if anything still.
David Brandon: For several quarters, as we got into the A, B and F classifying of our franchisees, and we were in the thick of that program, we actually reported that on a quarterly basis in terms of how that pie chart moved and how many F's had exited the system and all those things. We basically indicated a call or two ago that we were going to kind of get out of that business, because as you can appreciate for us internally for the CEO to get on a public announcement and talk about how many kids we kicked out of class yesterday is probably not the most positive energy thing I could be doing. I'm just here to report to you that we have raised the bar substantially in terms of what it takes to maintain your position as a franchisee at Dominoes Pizza. We continue to rank them and communicate where they rank. We continue to move more B's to A's which is great, and more F's to B's and we continue to put significant pressure on franchisees that are not making the grade and either get them to change quickly or move them out. That process is one that's ongoing and it will likely never stop, at least under my watch because we're going to continue to hold that bar really, really, high. But beyond that, I'd really like to get out of the specifics of that simply because it's kind of family business and I'm not sure it serves a useful purpose to keep parading those numbers out there other than to say we feel very good about where we are.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Wolleben - Sidoti & Company.
Michael Wolleben - Sidoti & Company: With the positive traffic here in the past two quarters, how much of that is attributable to the extended hours that you've put in place domestically?
David Brandon: It's difficult because extended hours were connected with menu changes so is it sandwiches? Is it extended hours in the lunch day part? Is it some of the extended hours that we've done late night? Is it Bread Bowl pasta?  We really put a lot out there in terms of changes so I don't think this in a one trick pony in terms of what's created the positive traffic. I think it's the combination of several things that we've done well. Certainly getting our stores open earlier and keeping some of them open later is part of that, but I don't think that in and of itself has been the real factor. I think it's a lot of what we're feeding people. We're feeding them better food than we've ever offered and more variety than we've ever offered.
Michael Wolleben - Sidoti & Company: With that as well on the new products, sandwiches and the Bread Bowl pastas, can you comment on how that traction has held up after the initial sales levels?
David Brandon: We really don't disclose a lot about mix and those kinds of things because I sure wish I knew that about some of our competitors. I would just tell you that all of those overachieved in the national roll outs versus what we had experienced in test. The mix ramped up as high or higher than what we would have expected or hoped for which means we got terrific trial. The repurchase on them has been terrific and we're glad we're in every one of those categories. There's not one of those platforms that are even on the watch list in terms of are they earning their way, are they making sense, are they making money for our operators and are they being really well received by our customers. Every one of them is a winner as they currently stand as part of the menu, and you'll be seeing that we'll invest further in those platforms in terms of line extensions and more variety.
Michael Wolleben - Sidoti & Company:   On the debt repurchases, the debt that was done here subsequent to the close of the quarter looks like it was done at a more expensive price, still at a discount, but is that a sign of the market in general changing. If we saw further debt repurchases in the future, would you expect them to be closer to those levels? Can you just comment on that?
David Brandon: Not only will I not comment on the future of the cheese market, I have no idea where the debt markets are going other than to say really early in the game we were able to buy some tranches to bonds that were phenomenally priced, when you start talking about $0.50 or below cost on the dollar. We didn't run any model that would continue over any sustained period of time.  As our results continue to improve and as we continue to assume the leadership position that we've always held in the category and as people understand our balance sheet better and they see less risk and more opportunity, we have always believed that we would be repurchasing debt at a higher rate than $0.50 on the dollar. So the models that we run are at substantially higher levels than that, and that's just what we believe is going to happen. However, markets swing and we're going to be opportunistic and we're in a position where we can be pretty selective and when we decide to do a transaction and when we don’t, and we'll kind of look at each one of those on their own merit. Beyond that, I can't really predict where that price will be going. There's not an easy way to assess it because there's not a daily public market out there. It's really very anecdotal in terms of if you've got a willing seller and we can come with a price that fits within our model, then we may be a willing buyer.
Michael Wolleben - Sidoti & Company: We're still seeing some domestic closures on the franchisee side. Can you comment on the financial health of the franchise system here domestically?
David Brandon: We're still putting as I indicated earlier, we're still putting some pressure on some people that are not all in, and that's creating some closings. We hope some of those will be temporary closings as we continue building a pipeline of new franchise candidates. I would tell you based on our original assumption of how many stores we thought were going to close during the economic environment of 2009 with some of the pressure that we're putting on some of our lower end performers; we would have actually forecasted that we would have closed more stores by now. So we're feeling like the economic model is improving. Our solid franchisees are feeling better about their financial results. We don't see a lot of financial closures out there as a result of the high commodities, depressed margins, and good operators that want to close down stores because they don't feel they're viable. That's now what we're dealing with now. We're just dealing with the clean up of some marginal operators and some marginal stores. So we're not going to adjust, earlier in the year we gave you our outlook of what we thought was going to happen with the stores, we're not going to adjust that right now other than if anything, the trend seems to be a little bit positive. By the way, we're opening up new stores which we think is really significant and tells you about the unit economic model and the prospects for the future because nobody knows this business better than the franchisee community and they're out there building new stores and investing in the future in the environment and that says a lot.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tom Forte - Telsey Forte Group.
Tom Forte - Telsey Forte Group: I wanted to know if you could give, the subject has been kind of discussed but I wanted to know on the capital of your franchise operators have. Do they have access to capital? Do your better performing franchise operators, is the bank answering their call now and giving them an opportunity to buy some of the under performers or is that environment as difficult as it's been recently. Maybe if you don't want to comment so much on mix or on days of week as far as what sales are like Monday to Thursday versus weekends, when you think about just the general state of the consumer and using some of those as guideposts, are there mix of purchases or weekdays versus weekends would you say that the consumer is significantly weaker now than they were earlier this year or about the same?
David Brandon: I'll handle the second part of it first. The pattern that we were slugging through last year, particularly in the back half of last year, was that we were actually feeling pretty good about our sales Monday through Thursday and then we got into that kind of weekend period where people typically spent some extra money and partied a little bit more and where we would have expected to see our bigger volume, and that's where we were having same store comparison problems because it seemed like people were really kind of nesting on the weekends, holding back and not spending like they were during better times. I don't know how much of what has happened is a result of the change in consumer behavior or how much of it has been driven by talented people in our marketing department, but we've been doing a lot to address that issue with some of our local promotion activities, some of the things we've done with our internet marketing.  We've really worked hard to try to bolster the buzz around our brand and the opportunities associated with accessing our brand during those important weekend time periods and we've seen a much more level performance and we feel better. Now whether we're just getting that right or whether the consumer is acting a little differently than they were I'm not sure other than I feel better about where we are. The lunch day part has helped us for sure, but we're also selling a lot of sandwiches and Bread Bowl pasta at dinner time, so we also know that we've helped our dinner business because we've provided more variety. We've probably lifted the pizza veto a little bit with families who wanted more selection and we can now offer. So again, I can't point to any one magic bullet here. It seems to be a combination of a number of smaller bullets. Your first question was?
Tom Forte - Telsey Forte Group: The ability of your franchise operators to have access to capital, especially the better performers to buy some of the weaker players, has that improved or same as it was before?
David Brandon: My sense of it which is pretty anecdotal, and that is are we seeing some deals getting done and are we seeing some people building some stores and are we seeing some sign that there is some capital available. I would say it's slightly better than it was the last time I was asked this question. It's certainly not worse and it's probably modestly better, but we're still in a situation where the banks are inclined to lend money to the businesses that don't need it, and they're reluctant to lend money to the businesses that really do, so that conservatism out there in terms of the credit committees and the lending practices of the banks, appreciably have not changed. If it's better, it's only better a little bit.
Operator: Your next question comes from Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: Can you give us your opinion about competition outside the channel, especially the grocery channel and just how you see that and how that figures into a broader context of long range strategy for pizza delivery companies?
David Brandon: We've studied that hard in the recent past because we always look at it with one eye, but we decided to really dig in to find out whether it was a material change and what was going on in the whole take and bake area with some of the chains, some of the grocery stores, the Wal Marts of the world who have gotten in the pizza business, certainly looking at the frozen category.  Their products have certainly improved in terms of quality and are they making inroads. Our general assessment is that they're experiencing a lot of the same pressures that we are, that this is really not about anybody benefiting from anybody else's demise in the category. We just think there's overall pressure in spending and from everything that we can tell the frozen guys and the take and bake guys are experiencing the same kinds of pressures. We don't believe there's a big winner in this. The only quasi big winner is in this is if you've got your brand position as standing for quality is not important, service is not important, competitive advantages are proprietary, positioning is not important, just cheap is important. If you've got a business model that affords you ability to just sell cheap, there is a segment, there's always been a segment out there, but there's a bigger segment today of people who will opt into that at least temporarily because they're just looking for the best deal in town. So if there's any beneficiary, it's a brand that stands for that kind of positioning. Other than that, I think we're all basically in the same situation.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: Where are you with awareness around your online ordering platform and might the different levels of media, might there be more of a message devoted to the technology platform?
David Brandon: We monitor on a monthly basis. We're improving but it's got to get better and we need it to get better. As you can see we're tagging all of our commercials. It's in all of our print. In some cases, we're creating incentives where there's two tier pricing; one if you order from us through regular channels and a better price if you order online. I believe that you will continue to see more investment and more activity from Dominoes driving people to that online activity. The ticket is better. In many instances the experience is better. It accesses tracker and some of the other amenities that we found that our consumers really appreciate. So we're pleased with our progress but we have a lot of improvement that's still out there and we're very, very focused on it.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: Is the improvement in awareness or is it more in use?
David Brandon: Both. We need to continue to let people know that that experience is available to them and how easy it can be and as that awareness grows, we get more people who give a trial and our view is that the more people that try it, the more people get hooked on it.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: Where in the evolution of the chicken business and how would you frame that for us generally.
David Brandon: We have two products right now that I would call them both very successful, very meaningful in terms of their combined mix, in terms of the number of orders that go out of a Dominoes Pizza store with chicken being one of the products. Our bone in chicken is we think the superior product in the entire industry and we've stood for that for a long, long time. I challenge anybody to go out and buy an order of wings from all the players in the industry and line them up; ours are going to be the highest quality without question, particularly of all the deliver guys, but even the sit down guys. We are just really proud of that product and it does a great job. Our boneless product, our kickers is a smaller product line for us, but it's definitely held it's own over the years and people really enjoy it. We've experimented, and we've had tests and we continue testing ways that we could potentially build upon that platform. It hasn't a high emphasis area for us, but it's certainly not one we're ignoring. We watch very carefully what other people are doing in managing the wing business, so it's not something we have a deaf ear to, but as it stands today, we like where we are. We see some opportunity there but a lot more work needs to be done before we're ready to talk about it.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: I was just looking back on the 2009 possibilities and units, is it more the middle or the bare case that you laid out at the beginning of the year, as we're half way through the year.
Wendy Beck: As far as the outlook for the year?
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: The 2009 possibilities. I know you don't give guidance, but during the analyst day we talked about a bull case, a middle case and a bare case and those had different unit counts associated with them. I was wondering now that we're halfway through the year if one of those looks more probable than the others.
David Brandon: We're probably closer to the middle than either one of the other examples, although I would tell you that when we put that together, which was last fall, I would describe the overall economic condition and pressures being more severe than we would have anticipated. But having said that, I think we're doing a better job than we would have anticipated in terms of how we're hanging in there and where our closing and openings are falling and certainly how we're holding our own in terms of sales.
Operator: There are no further audio questions.
David Brandon: I want to thank you all for being on the call. As we've tried to communicate honestly, it continues to be tough out there. There's nothing easy in this environment and that's not news to any of you. But I'm really proud of my team and the accomplishments that we've achieved in the recent past. We're regaining our rightful position as the leader in our industry and our franchisees are engaged in improving and performing. They've got a lot of passion and a lot of excitement for what can be and there's been a bit of a reigniting of that passion in the recent past and we're very excited about that. We're upbeat about our results in the first half. When traffic is growing in the retail industry, good things happen and the fact that we're getting more customers into our stores opens up a whole new realm for us in terms of opportunity. We look forward to updating you on the results of our third quarter and hopefully if we continue to execute really well and we can get a little bit of help from the consumer and the overall spending environment out there, we will continue to be as upbeat as we are today. So thank you participating in the call and we look forward to talking with you soon.

===== 2008 Q4  (2009-02-25 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Lynn M. Liddle – Executive Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations Wendy A. Beck – Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer David A. Brandon – Chief Executive Officer
Analysts: John Glass – Morgan Stanley Jeffrey Bernstein – Barclays Capital Joseph Buckley – Banc of America John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan [Unidentified Analyst] - Citi Tom Forte – Telsey Advisory Group Michael Wolleben - Sidoti & Co. Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company 
Operator: Welcome everyone to the 2008 fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Lynn Liddle, Executive Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. 
Lynn M. Liddle: Thanks, Amber, and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and year-end 2008 earnings call. As Amber outlined, we are going to open today with comments from our Chief Financial Officer, Wendy Beck, followed by comments from our Chief Executive Officer, David Brandon. We will be commenting a little bit on our 2009 outlook today, so I will refer you to our safe harbor statement which is in the 8-K and the 10-K for you to look at, and I would also ask that the media be in a listen-only mode this morning. To start out this morning, I’d like to introduce Wendy Beck, our Chief Financial Officer.
Wendy A. Beck: As you will note from our filings this morning, we once again experienced challenges this quarter in our domestic environment while continuing our strong growth trends in our international division. Let’s start with the top line. We ask you to remember that revenues alone do not necessarily give you the complete picture of our top-line growth and instead consider global retail sales as a clearer gauge of overall sales and store growth performance. Our global retail sales increased 2.7% during the fourth quarter on a constant dollar basis. This was driven primarily by same-store sales growth in our international business and an increase in worldwide store counts of 47 net units during the fourth quarter and 149 net units over year-end 2007. Our international division has grown to comprise over 40% of our global retail sales.  Looking at same-store sales, domestically our same-store sales decreased 3% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2007. Company-owned stores decreased 2.2%, while franchise same-store sales decreased 3.1%. International same-store sales increased 4.5% marking the 60th consecutive quarter or 15 years of international same-store sales growth. As a result, our total revenues for the fourth quarter were $428.2 million, a $17.8 million or 4% decrease from prior year. Breaking down the decrease, our company-owned store revenues declined $15.1 million or 12.9%, the majority of which was due to a $13.5 million reduction of revenues from store divestitures in the quarter with the remainder of the decrease attributable to lower same-store sales. Domestic franchise revenues declined approximately $600,000 or 1.2% primarily due to lower same-store sales. International revenues declined $2.3 million or 5.2% due to the negative impact from foreign currency translations.  As mentioned on our third quarter call, we anticipated a negative impact from foreign currency translation in the fourth quarter. This did negatively impact our royalty revenues by approximately $3.6 million in the fourth quarter and $1.9 million year to date. It also impacted our international supply chain revenues by $3.5 million in the fourth quarter with minimal impact year to date. This decline in international revenues was offset in part by higher same store sales and increased store counts. Domestic supply chain revenues were essentially flat in the fourth quarter. Lower supply chain volumes and a decrease in cheese prices were partially offset by increases in non-cheese commodities during the fourth quarter. However, there is an approximate 3-week lag between the change in the block price of cheese and our pricing to our stores. Therefore, we will see more of a benefit in 2009 from the recent reductions in price of cheese.
 : Additionally, a decrease in cheese prices also had a positive impact on the percent margin. Cheese prices are a pass-through commodity cost and therefore do not impact dollar margins, but do have an impact on percent margin. The average cheese block price in the fourth quarter was $1.79 per pound versus $2.01 last year or a 10.9% decrease. Additionally the supply chain percent margin benefited from reduced delivery frequency. Higher non-cheese commodities such as meat, chicken, and boxes in lower volumes offset the margin increases.  Second, our company owned store operating margin declined 2.3% from the prior year period, which resulted in a six-tenths percent decline on our consolidated operating margins. Food and delivery costs accounted for a majority of the decline. Food cost as a percent of revenues were higher because of non-cheese commodity costs and a lower average ticket, partly due to our new sandwich platform and also more aggressive pricing. We are happy to accept the lower average ticket in return for the increased traffic we have received from our oven-baked sandwiches and other traffic building initiative. We have seen a recent softening in both cheese and fuel costs, and we will see more of the benefit of this on our company-owned store margins going forward. Now turning to our G&A expenses, G&A increased $1 million or 1.8% in the quarter versus the prior year. There were two items that affected comparability this prior quarter. A $1.8 million increase resulting from a gain recognized in 2007 on the sale of a corporate aircraft offset in part by $1.3 million of nonrecurring gains related to the sale of 22 stores primarily in Washington and California. Including the 22 stores sold during the fourth quarter, we have now sold 82 stores year to date. The details of these two items are also outlined in the items affecting comparability table in the earnings release.  Excluding these items that affected comparability, G&A increased $500,000 versus the prior year quarter due primarily to a $2.5 million increase in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter. While we did experience higher than historical levels of bad debt expense in ’08, the company continued to collect over 99% of domestic franchise royalty and domestic supply chain receivables in fiscal 2008. We collected nearly 100% of our international royalty and supply chain receivables. Additionally, given the two years of salary freezes and no bonus payments, Dave graciously requested that the board approve an additional paycheck for all eligible team members excluding himself that was paid in the fourth quarter. As a result, this impacted G&A expense in the quarter by approximately $1.8 million. Offsetting these increases in the quarter were lower advertising, depreciation, and amortization expenses due to the store divestitures. Now, let’s look at our leverage. We have $1.7 billion in total debt, and given the uncertainty of today’s debt markets, we are very pleased to have our debt facility in place with a blended fixed cash interest rate of 6.06% through 2012 with two possible one-year extensions.  As for our tax rates, our effective tax rate was 31.8% in the fourth quarter and 34.9% year to date as we continue to have tax reserve reversal. However, as previously indicated, we currently anticipate approximately a 40% normalized rate in the foreseeable future. Now, let’s look at bottomline earnings. Our fourth quarter diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.19 and remained at $0.19 when adjusted for items affecting comparability. The $0.19 as adjusted EPS figure is a $0.02 decrease from $0.21 in 2007. Our operating results negatively impacted us by $0.04 for the quarter including the negative impact of foreign currency. Our EPS benefited $0.01 from the lower share count primarily due to our share repurchases and also benefited $0.01 from the tax reserve reversals in the quarter versus 2007.  As stated in our earnings release, we repurchased $136,600 shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program for $1.8 million during the quarter. Additionally on a year to date basis, we have returned $42.9 million to our shareholders and $97.3 million life to date under our share repurchase program. We have now completed 49% of our repurchase authorization. During the fourth quarter, we purposely built our cash reserve during these unprecedented economic times. Now, let’s look at our liquidity. As of the fourth quarter, we had $45.4 million of unrestricted cash. We believe that our current unrestricted cash balance and our expected ongoing free cash flow generation are more than sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. In addition, we had total borrowings available under the revolver of $60 million of which $37 million was committed under letters of credit resulting in $23 million readily available for borrowing, and we had no borrowings under the revolver. The company has historically not needed or used the revolver for working capital requirements. In closing, 2008 was a year filled with many challenges that negatively impacted our operating results. However, despite a challenging year, we continued to generate positive free cash flow $55.8 million for fiscal 2008 or over $1 million per week which highlights our continued ability to generate cash. We are very pleased with the continued growth in our international division with both strong sales and store growth. We have a proven business model that is resilient even during the challenging times. In addition, we are taking actions to ensure we are well positioned for growth when the domestic environment stabilizes. This concludes our financial updates. I’d now like to turn it over to Dave.
David A. Brandon:  Good morning everyone. I’m going to try to make my opening remarks as brief as possible to allow time for questions. Clearly, there’s a lot happening in our economy and in our industry and certainly here at Dominos Pizza. The year 2008 can best be described as a rebuilding year at our company. We continued to benefit from the growth and success being achieved by our international division; however, our domestic business was plagued with continued softness in traffic and sales while at the same time being hit with unprecedented costs increases in virtually every area of our business. Now weak teams kind of go into the bunker when adversity strikes and they wait and hope for things to change; my belief is that great teams respond to adversity in difficulties with energy and purpose and they do what needs to be done to fix their problems. I lead a great team here at Dominos and I’m convinced that we’re doing all of the necessary things to get our domestic business growing and going again. These initiatives that we have been working on for the past 18 months are starting to produce the results that we were expecting and we’re excited about that. In 2008, the financial markets imploded and we went from being a company that was being rewarded for our progressive and creative approach to managing and maximizing our capital structure to a company that was regularly being questioned about whether we were over-leveraged. We continue to believe that our capital structure is not only appropriate for our business model but it is optimal given the current situation in the capital markets generally. The more investors understand about our business model and the flexibility of our current debt structure, the more they recognize the significant upside in our company as a long-term investment. We have struggled in our domestic business for the past couple of years as has many in our industry and it has been a short-term negative impact on our growth and success as a company. However, the good news is that we continue to produce significant free cash flow as Wendy covered with you during this entire period, and we really demonstrated the resiliency of our business during what we considered to have been the worst of times. However, what is more important to focus on are the changes that we have made to make our business stronger and make our business better for the longer term, and they include a number of different aggressive initiatives that we have undertaken. As you all know, we changed our advertising agencies early last year, and in fact, have continued to develop a stronger and better partnership with Crispin Porter and Bogusky. We are extremely pleased with our new talent at Chief Marketing Officer, Russell Weiner. Prior to joining us, he headed up marketing for the Pepsi brand at Pepsi Co. He is a talented executive and is making a significant difference in our business already. We’ve launched two very important product platforms, Oven Baked Sandwiches and our Dominos American Legends pizzas and we’re excited about both of those new product platforms and the results that we’re achieving. We’re attacking new day parts. We now have all of our stores open at the lunch hour, and we’re working very hard to be a bigger player in the late night business, particularly with some of our new products. We have gone to a lot of work to strengthen our existing franchise system. Thus far, we have either removed or upgraded approximately 125 of the F rated franchisees that we started with a year ago when this imitative began, and they are more to come. We have also balanced that with recruiting new franchisees. We brought in 93 new franchisees in 2008 alone and that process continues. I’m extremely pleased with the leadership that is being provided with Asi Sheikh, our new Executive Vice President of Team USA. Asi has conducted a major housecleaning of market-based leadership in Team USA. He has reconstituted a team that is generating significant improvements in their results, and I have high expectations and confidence in what Team USA can achieve. We are fixing our share of voice weakness that we’ve discussed in the past by adding to our marketing spend through shifting more dollars back into national marketing, and we’ve also developed some strong relationships with strategic partners that have in fact added to the resources we have available for our national television spend. We’re undertaking new pricing initiatives to make better pricing decisions at both the market and the store level, and we’re already starting to see benefits from that initiative. We’ve implemented a stronger store audit program with a full dedicated auditing team which will force a higher level of operational accountability across all of our domestic stores, and we know this is going to give us terrific advantages in the months and years ahead. We’re also launching a new franchise re-certification process which we call a high-performance franchisee training and development program that is going to reach 99% or more of our domestic franchise base in 2009. We’re putting a tremendous amount of emphasis on making sure that we’ve got the right franchises and they are trained and ready to go out and execute in the environment in which we work. We have implemented a number of cost efficiency programs in both the purchasing side of our business as well as the execution and operational side of our supply chain division, and we have a number of other exciting initiatives that I am not prepared to discuss publicly yet, but you’ll be hearing more about as the year unfolds. Now, based on the uncertain economic times in which we live and the times in which we are operating our business, I want to share with you everything I possibly can regarding what we know and believe about 2009. Doing a budget forecast for 2009 was more difficult than any time I can remember. Anyone who claims to know what is going to happen in the domestic economy in 2009 is someone to avoid. However, our approach in preparing our 2009 was simply this; to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. We have never given earnings guidance on a quarterly or annual basis, and we’re not going to start now. Instead, however, we have always given what we characterize as long-range expectations for our business, which many of you have heard multiple times, but for those of you who haven’t, they’ve always been to grow our domestic same-store sales between 1% and 3%, to grow our international same-store sales between 3% and 5%, and to have net store growth across the global system of between 200 and 250 stores. As we built the plan for 2009, given the economic uncertainty and the conservative approach that I have already discussed, we’ve made the following assumptions. We assume that we will have a flat domestic same-store sales picture for the year; we are assuming that as it relates to the global economy that the range of positive same-store sales we will achieve in our international business is between 2% and 4%, and we’re assuming that we will have a net store growth this year of between 175 and 225 stores. Additionally, we are assuming that the lower commodity costs we are currently enjoying will continue to benefit us throughout the year. We are assuming that Team USA will have a much stronger year of EBITDA production. We assume that the negative impact on foreign exchange will negate most of the gains that we will generate in our international business, and we assume that we will have another year of Cap-Ex spending that will be at the low end of our stated annual range of between $20 million and $30 million. We have put a larger contingency in our budget plan than ever before to reflect the uncertainty and difficulties we may encounter as a result of the current economic environment. Now, it’s way too early in the year to even comment on the kind of EBITDA production we believe we can achieve for the year; however, we’re going to manage our business with a mind set that says our EBITDA production will be less than what we produced in 2008; and we believe that this conservative approach to how we approach the year and construct our 2009 plan is appropriate given the uncertainty of the current external environment. This will require us to be very conservative with our spending and cost management. The only two areas of significant new G&A investment in 2009 will be the implementation of our new field audit and franchise training process, and the investments we will be making in our people. After going nearly 2 years without salary increases for most of our team members, we have included a salary program for 2009 that will take effect during the second quarter of this year, and we will also budget as we always do, a team achievement bonus program, and we have had two consecutive years of no bonus for the majority of our team members, which has been appropriate based on the results; however, our Board Of Directors has once again set targets that will provide us an opportunity to earn a bonus for achieving our budget plan. The plan will have two potential payout periods; one for the first half of the year and one for the back half of the year. If EBITDA target thresholds are not met for either one of the half year periods, there of course will be no payout. Partial payments will be made for performance above threshold but less than target, and a 100% payout will be made for achieving the actual target itself. Now, in past years, our team achievement bonus program allowed for participants to earn more than 100% payout if the budget target plan was exceeded. This has been appropriately modified in this particular year to cap the payout at 100% in recognition of the difficulties associated with forecasting EBITDA targets during this volatile and unpredictable business cycle. The bonus program has always been an important component of our company’s compensation and retention program, and we’ll be working to reactivate it in 2009 by hitting our numbers. Finally, a comment on our cash management strategy; we plan to generate as much cash as possible, deploy it opportunistically and wisely, and strengthen our balance sheet. We have a clear long-range goal, and that is to meet the debt service coverage ratio required in 2012 to extend our current ABS financing and take advantage of the additional 2 years of interest only payment schedule that will be available to us. We have mapped out a plan to get us there, and I’m confident we will do so. So, to summarize, we’re preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. Despite some recent positive signs in our business, we continue to run the business as our worst time lie ahead. We’re fixing our domestic business, and although I really like our recent trends, the past few weeks have been among the best I have seen in quite some time. We intend to continue our efforts to grow our market share, outpace our competition, and regain our domestic sales momentum. Third, we are investing in our people. We have a great team here and I want to retain them. I want to motivate them to drive the kind of results that we are capable of achieving. And lastly, I want to continue to generate that all important free cash, deploy it wisely, and take full advantage of our current attractive financing by working to extend it as far into the future as possible. With that, Wendy and I would like to now pause and take any questions that you may have.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley:  I guess two questions on the top-line, Dave; first of all you mentioned clearly a couple of times being very pleased with recent top-line trends; I just want to clarify that, if you’re talking about kind of first quarter trends if you want to amplify at all, if you don’t I understand, but if you can amplify, can you at least talk about what you experienced in the fourth quarter as it relates to the incrementality of the Sub sandwiches, and I think there’s been some confusion, are they adding to sales or has it been a substitute for pizza orders, or may be as you settled out and have seen now those trends have established themselves, are you building traffic because of the Subs or are you growing comps, and may be if you could quantify how much the benefit really has been from that product.
David A. Brandon:  The strategy with oven-baked sandwiches was multi-faceted; first and importantly, we wanted to ensure that we got all of our stores open for lunch to open up in the day part. We’ve successfully achieved that, and obviously, sandwiches have put us in the lunch business in a material way and that’s been great. The second thing that we wanted to accomplish with sandwiches was to create something that could provide us the ability to attract new customers and generate traffic activity in our stores.  After literally two years of declining traffic accounts which have been the fundamental issue that we’ve had in terms of getting back in a growth trajectory in our domestic business, the thing that I’m pleased to report is sandwiches has driven a significant improvement in our traffic trends which has gotten the phones ringing and affords us the ability to have more customers going through our stores, and that’s a good thing because when the phones are ringing, we can up-sell, we can substantially improve and increase that order and the profitability that goes along with it, and we can re-market to those customers once we identify them and get them on-board.  The last thing that’s important about sandwiches is that it’s a great addition to our menu as we continue to expand and appeal to more people with the menu. We like the ratio of the number of sandwiches that are being purchased along with the pizza; in fact, I would tell you that that number although we really don’t want to disclose it publicly is bigger than what we anticipated and better than what we experienced in our test market. So, we’re seeing a number of people who are ordering pizza and sandwiches together which tells us that our menu is appealing to more family members, appealing to more people who are looking for more diversity in our menu, and we think that’s a positive thing. So, we love the impact that sandwiches have had and continue to have on our business. The next message that I will give you as it relates to the fourth quarter without getting into a level, the detail that we can’t go and don’t go, I will tell you that the trend that we experienced in the fourth quarter that is the most important for you to focus on is the closing of the gap between our franchise system and Team USA. If you recall, for the better part of the last 3 years, our corporate stores have led our franchise system by as many as 3% and 4% in terms of sales growth, and that’s a problem when you’re 93% franchised, and we’ve said all the way along that we can’t be successful unless our franchisees lead our success, and I think the thing that’s very noteworthy that started happening particularly in the latter part of the fourth quarter, and again I can’t comment specifically on what’s been going on in the first quarter, but the thing that I am thrilled about is that our franchise system is starting to gain momentum closing that gap, and that’s a very important thing for us as it relates to measuring how we get our momentum back in our domestic business.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley:  Just to clarify on the company side, down 2.2% in the fourth quarter, were your transaction accounts actually positive and you’re losing some on ticket because of the Subs, how does that dynamic work?
David A. Brandon:  Yes, you got it right. Our traffic accounts were positive; we’re going to give up as we enter the lunch business and come out with a $4.99 sandwich platform, obviously it’s going to have a certain amount of down pressure on our average ticket, but our traffic was positive, and believe me, that is a significant event based on trends over the last 2 or 3 years as mentioned.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley:  And are you willing to go as far to talk about what the swing has been in traffic from the third to the fourth quarter?
David A. Brandon:  We really have never split out traffic, and if we start to attribute that, I think we get into an area that we’re not comfortable with and one that we’re not particularly interested in feeding to our competition.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley:  And then, just one last question, on currency Wendy, you talked about currency impacting ’09 results, is there any way we can look at a relationship between your 2 or 3 major currencies and how it impacts your earnings per share, is there some sort of framework, 10% move or whatever it is and how much of that impacts your earnings?
Wendy A. Beck:  Specifically, John, we have told you in the past who our largest markets are, and it’s actually page 9 in the 10-K, just if you want to take a look at that, so you can kind of track that, we lay out the number of stores in each of our top 10 markets and you could probably track that, but then Dave also stated that if we anticipate any growth on the international side is going to be negated by our negative FX this year.
David A. Brandon:  That’s the assumption and one of the many difficulties of forecasting 2009 is to kind of know where the dollar is going and it’s relationship with these other currencies, but we’ve built a plan around the fact that the majority of the growth that we will achieve as a result of store openings and positive same-store sales in international, the majority of that will be offset by FX; we’re hoping we’re wrong, but that’s what we’re assuming.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffery Bernstein with Barclays Capital.
Jeffery Bernstein - Barclays Capital: First on the re-franchising efforts and the expediting of unit sales to franchisees, Dave, I think you mentioned 125 F-rated franchisees that are now out; I think you’d originally targeted 250. Just wondering if you could the outlook for the remainder, whether you’re seeing it slow down obviously due to the current credit environment, whether you’re willing to extend more financing to those franchisees, and perhaps, how you’re measuring, now that those 125 are gone, how do you measure the benefit to comp or profits from those closures?
David A. Brandon: I would tell you that the 125 that I referred to, a majority of those have left the system, but some of them have been turned around, and I only say that because there’s really two approaches that we have to this problem; one is to identify those F franchisees who want to and are capable of and are willing to get themselves turned around to the point where they can be reclassified, and thankfully, we’ve had a number of franchisees that fall into that category, and hopefully we will have more, but at the same token we’ve got other franchisees that can’t or won’t or aren’t willing to do what needs to be done and those are the ones that we’re changing, and we’ve shown a track record that proves that we’re willing and able to do that. That process will continue until I can report to that we no longer have any F franchisees, and we still do, but it’s a much smaller number and we continue to improve upon that as time goes forward. As it relates to how we dispose off those stores, obviously our first objective is to get them re-franchised with another stronger A or B ranked franchisee and that’s what we try to do. As our business improves that becomes easier because the margins at the store level are better, the cash flows are stronger, and frankly the optimism in the system improves to the point where many of our A and B franchisees are more accepting of the transaction and are more interested in growth, and so we believe that as we continue to build momentum and improve the business, it will be easier to get those transactions done.  In the meantime, we are not taking significant investment decisions. We would rather, if we need to, take temporary closes and you should see the numbers we’ve shown a willingness to do that last year. We will continue to take temporary closes or permanent closes if need be as we reconfigure the portfolio of franchisees as we look at what’s best for the profitability of our franchise system and what’s best for the overall brand, and we manage that on a day-to-day basis, and we have a great team working on it every day in partnership with our franchisees to come up with the best solutions considering all those factors.
Jeffery Bernstein - Barclays Capital: One or two follow-ups on the Analysts Day from October ’08: I know you laid out the goal and bare-case scenarios, not an official guidance, but just ranges. It looks like you’re now giving guidance for ’09 that comes near the lower end of those ranges; units happy to see near the higher end, and you gave some color on course. With that all said, I think you said you were projecting EBITDA to be down year over year. Just wondering where the FX rate is right now. Is there even a broad range for earnings when you’re talking about up or down? With all those parameters in place, how do you view earnings for ’09?
David A. Brandon: I think if you refer back to what we talked about in terms of those three cases, our belief is based on what happened since October of last year in the world and in the economy, we would suggest that you build a model and base a budget on the bull case is probably an irresponsible act. I’m not going to tell you that anything’s impossible at this point, but we have tended to build our current assumptions and run the business as if we’re going to operate somewhere between the middle case and the bear case.
Jeffery Bernstein - Barclays Capital: Is it correct to assume that you’re forecasting EBITDA down year over year; is that your best guesstimate with foreign exchange where it is right now?
David A. Brandon: With foreign exchange where it is right now the plan as I mentioned, we’re going to run the business as if that were a possibility, but it’s way to early in the year and there are way too many things moving around for me to give you a crisp answer to that question.
Jeffery Bernstein - Barclays Capital: Okay, and then lastly, a followup question on the prior question on foreign exchange. If rates were to remain where they are right now, I think you’d guided the fourth quarter saying it would have been like a $0.02 hit to the fourth quarter back then. If rates are where they are right now, what would you see is the impact in calendar ’09 earnings?
David A. Brandon: I don’t have that number immediately available. Basically when we put the budget plan together, our assumption was based on some forward projections that we receive in terms of what the best thinking was as it relates to where the dollar was going to be against the major currencies that we’re involved with. So, the hypothetical scenario of this is that if the year played out the way the world is today and currencies the way today, I don’t specifically know what the number is, and I’m looking at Wendy and I don’t think she knows either.
Wendy A. Beck: The other item that I would guide you with is that the top ten markets account for 80% of our international stores. So if you follow those currencies for those markets, I think it would help.
Jeffery Bernstein - Barclays Capital: Okay, and then one last thing; the ’09 use of cash, I think, you had said at this point you’ve been building your cash position. Is it safe to assume that’s the plan going forward or whether you’d return to share purchase, or you’ve mentioned concerning return to dividend; it sounds like you’re not really lending much to franchisees, but use of cash, is it still the stock-pile mode at this point?
David A. Brandon: We have stock piled a significant amount of cash. We’ve done that purposely as we indicated we would when last we were on the phone together and we felt that during this time period it’s the responsible thing to do. I think we have never telegraphed our intentions as it relates to what we’re going to do with our cash. I don’t think that’s in anybody’s best interest, but we’re going to do the same thing that we’ve done in the past and that is to consider what’s in the best interest of our shareholders.  I would comment that one of the driving desires that we have is to take advantage of this wonderful financing that we have in place, with a slightly over 6% fixed rate with no traditional covenants or anything like that. It’s a very flexible piece of financing that we want to take advantage of for as long as possible and we know where we need to get to in the year 2012 to get those last two years to extend it. And we think that’s in the best interest of our shareholders and we think it’s a very responsible position for us to take in terms of managing our capital structure, and so one of the things that we’ll be doing is managing the business to achieve that objective.  There are two ways to do that and likely we’ll take advantage of both. One of them is certainly to continue to grow our EBITDA and get back on a trajectory that affords us the ability to meet that debt service coverage ratio through our EBITDA production. The other way to improve our ratio is to buy back debt and reduce the denominator, if you will, of that calculation. So that’s certainly something that we’ll look at probably more carefully than we have in the past, but we’ll continue to consider all the alternatives in terms of the best use of our cash.
Operator: Your next question is from Joseph Buckley with Bank of America.
Joseph Buckley - Bank of America: Just a followup on the possibility for the one-year extension. I know you talked a little bit about this back in October, but have you shared with or can you share with us the debt service coverage ratios critical to getting those extensions and where do you stand right now versus them?
David A. Brandon: It’s a tricky thing because if we started releasing what the ratios are the next question is going to be how do we get to the ratios and at best we can lay it out for you that would require about a day and half conference call for us to get that right. And so, we really have never gotten to the point where we share with you specific ratios and what all goes into the calculation of those ratios. So, suffice to say Joe, what we know is where we need to be in terms of EBITDA and that’s the numerator in that calculation.  We clearly understand the benefits of deploying some of our cash against buying back debt which improves the denominator of that calculation, and that’s how we’ve planned it out in terms of looking as part of our 5-year plan. Going further than that in terms of what the ratios are and then how those ratios are arrived at is just something that we don’t feel is going to be anybody’s best interest and it’s going to be real open to confusion.
Joseph Buckley - Bank of America: Just a followup on that numerator and the denominator; given the fundamental performance ratios, how far uptrack are you on the EBITDA that you were thinking when this went into place?
David A. Brandon: We were obviously a bit off because instead of growing EBITDA as we’ve expected we flattened out, but what I think a lot of people either get wrong or they purposely try to twist because they’re in the short-selling game is they try to position this as a less than flexible piece of financing and try to put it in the same basket as traditional bank borrowing where there are covenants and there are potential tripwires that are going to hurt the company and be damaging.  The reality is as we’ve said over and over again is that one of the beautiful things about this financing is its flexibility and what it offers us in terms of room to have a year where we don’t grow as fast or even two years where we don’t grow as far and still give us plenty of room to meet our obligation.  We’ve said many times that our EBITDA performance would have to drop by a huge amount, a multiple of any of the disappointments that we’ve achieved over the couple of years before we would even get to the first point that the financing would change and the only thing that would change about it is the amount of cash that would be trapped as part of the ABS would slightly increase and not to a level that would have any impact on our operations or our investment.  I think we’ve framed that up and indicated that our EBITDA performance would have to drop by between $65 million and $75 million from the point in time that we put this in place before we would even get to the point where the first trigger would even be a factor. And so, it’s flexible, we don’t have covenant issues at all, what we’re talking about is opportunistically extending this very very attractive financing, and we know what we need to get there and that’s a very viable plan for us, something that we think is very achievable.
Joseph Buckley - Bank of America: Okay, the buyback debt; does the debt trade publicly or would this be negotiated with holders?
David A. Brandon: It doesn’t trade publicly but there are holders out there in today’s environment that we think probably have an interest in selling the debt, and from time to time we hear of opportunities in that regard, and that’s certainly something that we’ll consider.
Joseph Buckley - Bank of America: Okay, and then why don’t we visit also the comment about managing as if EBITDA will be down preparing for the worst, hoping for the best; I want to clarify, the guidelines that you’ve given us for ’09, the ’09 outlook section of your release; if those things come in where you’re expecting them to come in, is EBITDA down year over year in ’09? I’m trying to see if that EBITDA down comment is part of your guidance or just a comment about how you’re managing the company in this environment.
David A. Brandon: It’s a comment on how we’re managing the company. We don’t give guidance, we’re not going to give guidance, and part of the reason for that is I don’t have a clue in terms of where EBITDA is going to come in at. Obviously, we’re through the first two periods and so I have a little bit of a sense for the start that we’re off to, but I’m just not in a position right now to tell you one way or another whether EBITDA is going to grow, shrink, or be about the same.  As we get further into the year, we’ll try to make more comment as it relates to that, but the whole purpose of sharing with you the assumptions of our budget plan is to show that we’re managing the business as though it’s going to be a very difficult environment in reflecting our spending and we’re making decisions based on those set of assumptions.
Joseph Buckley - Bank of America: Okay, just wanted to make sure that wasn’t a guidance; so to speak. On the company versus franchise spread narrowing, you have a sequential improvement on the franchise side, which is much more significant than the company side in the fourth quarter, and I understand your about that being good, but I guess I’m curious what happened on the company side that it didn’t seem like the company side got as big a lift from the sandwiches perhaps as the franchise side?
David A. Brandon: As you know we changed leadership and as I mentioned in my comments we drew the initiatives of our new leader and a whole different approach to Team USA. As you know we sold stores in a couple of markets, actually three markets, in the last year. So we reconfigured the portfolio. We took that opportunity to take a hard look at the management change and we changed out a significant amount of our market-based leadership, and I think there was probably some churn, and some negatives, that were a result of that reset.  Having said what’s more important and more relevant is the reason that that differential between Team USA and the franchisees got down to about 1 point with a growing trend throughout the quarter and that is momentum in our franchise business, and I’m convinced that Asi and his team will do a great job in Team USA and I’ve already indicated I think they’re going to have a much better stronger year and we’re assuming that is part of our plan, but I also believe based on everything I’ve seen, that our franchise system is gaining momentum and is going to close that gap and have a much stronger year than we’ve seen in the recent past.
Joseph Buckley - Bank of America: Okay, and in terms of using your cash. You are alluding to some of the things you might consider, but are there are any reinvestment needs for the business that is under consideration. I know you got your CapEx to be towards the low end of the range, and I know that you related to that question, but that was with restricted cash. Is there some point where the restricted cash in the balance sheet is freed up?
David A. Brandon: I’ll talk about CapEx and I’ll let Wendy talk about restricted cash. As it relates to CapEx, we think in the times in which we live free cash flow is the most important thing we can manage and CapEx projects are being put under an even greater scrutiny to make sure that we’re covering the needs of the business, but that we’re not involved in projects that have a long payout or projects that are viewed as anywhere as near the word discretionary and so we really bolted that down.  I would tell you that the CapEx budget for this year is less than it was last year and would be significantly less than what it was last year if it weren’t for one particular project. That’s around $4 million that I’ll more about later when I can, but it’s a project that we feel is going to have a very short payback and a very accretive nature as it relates to its impact on the business.  I can’t go into the project right now because of a variety of confidentiality reasons, but if it weren’t for that one timer that’s got a very short payback, our CapEx disciplines this year are probably as conservative as they’ve been in my tenure here, and we think that’s appropriate.
Wendy A. Beck: On your restricted cash question; of the $78.9 million in total restricted cash, the vast majority of that is actually accruing for our next interest payment, but there is a portion that is held in a reserve account, that’s required by the trustee that we do have the opportunity to have a portion released as our debt service coverage ratio increases, and that’s roughly about $17 million in the future that we could look to have released.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: Just a couple of real quick ones from me at this point. Could you elaborate a little bit more on the bad debt expense though I understand that that was non-payment of franchise royalties?
David A. Brandon: That would be a combination of, to a large degree that would be a byproduct of some of the closures that we incurred, some of the housecleaning that we did as it relates to our franchise base.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: Okay. I do understand or I have understood in the past that franchise royalties are actually extremely high and in preference even to the extent that there is an issue with the unit including bankruptcy. Is that the case?
David A. Brandon: Clearly, if we have a franchisee turn in the keys and they owe our supply chain revenues that they’re behind and they owe royalties and in some cases advertising requirements, in some cases if we have a franchisee that turns in the keys we’re in a situation where we’re going to incur the brunt of whatever those obligations are that will obviously not be fulfilled.  We try very hard in any kind of transactional mode to make sure we get rights on any proceeds that would go from a buyer to a seller to attach those proceeds in such a way that we get reimbursed for those obligations, but in the case of closures and when you’ve got an acceleration in the number of closures you’re going to have more exposure there.
John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan: Okay, understood. And secondly, on the distribution business and even factoring out some of the extra expense of the fourth quarter of 2007 from an operating income perspective it looked better from the release relative to my expectations; you’ve given less franchise stores and given negative comps. Was there anything else that happened in the distribution business in the fourth quarter that could have helped margins on reported operating income that was unique to the fourth quarter or in fact may even occur into 2009 as we think about modeling that specific segment for next year?
Wendy A. Beck: One of the items that we received the benefit of was the reduced frequency of delivery. We are running our trucks less on the road. They’re making 2 or 3 deliveries a week which is down from the prior years, so that’s part of the benefit that you’re seeing.
David A. Brandon : We made some formulation changes that afforded us the ability to adjust our delivery scheduled and to a large degree take many of our stores off a 3-delivery per week schedule to a 2-delivery per week schedule, which had a significant impact on our transportation costs.  We’ve done some other things to try to leverage transportation to create efficiencies. I think our team in supply chain has done a wonderful job in creating those efficiencies when diesel fuel got up to the level it did. It really kind of forced us to rethink that whole model and how we could take miles out of the system, and we were able to do that, and when diesel fuel costs and transportation costs came down at the end of the year, that became a significant pickup, and it’s one that we continue to enjoy. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citi.
Unidentified Analyst - Citi: This is (inaudible) actually talking on behalf of Greg. David, a quick question for you, of the F franchisees that have recommitted to the brand, can you talk a little bit about the type of progress you are seeing from them, and then where would you say most of the low-hanging fruit is? Is it in pricing efficiencies? Is it in better local marketing strategies?
Dave Brandon : First of all, as it relates to the F franchisees, since we put them in their own category, we measure them every six ways to Sunday. We are looking at them from the standpoint of how are their same-store sales performing versus the rest of the system, how are their OER audits performing versus the rest of the system. We are managing their P&Ls very carefully, because we are talking to them regularly to see what’s going on in terms of their margin trends. We are putting extra attention in those stores to make sure that the product and the service and the image standards that we are hold dear are being executed.  We are kind of all over them, so when I tell you that someone has rehabilitated themselves and gotten off the F list and onto the A or the B list, you should know that is not a subjective evaluation on our part. It is based on a very set list of objective criteria. As it relates to where is the low-hanging fruit, if it was any one thing we would have done it already. It’s a combination of a number of things, but here is the real deal, and the real deal is in our world, once we start to see traffic moving positively, great things can happen, because when the phones are ringing, there is a lot we can do to create momentum in this business, and make that order more profitable, and re-market to that customer, and all those things that we do very well.  When the phones are silent, it is really hard to get yourself out of the tailspin, and the most important thing I have said today is the fact that particularly in the latter part of the fourth quarter, momentum began to build in terms of traffic. We started comping positively in terms of our traffic growth. I’ve indicated we feel very good and optimistic about what we have seen in the recent past, without getting into details, and all of that is the result of more customers getting involved in the brand, our stores having more customers at their disposal to work with, and that spells good things.
Unidentified Analyst - Citi: Back in October you had mentioned that the financing markets for even A and B franchisees were essentially shut down. Has that changed at all since October or even January or February?
Dave Brandon: Yes. This is an answer based more anecdotally than anything specific, because it is very situational specific in terms of what deals we have gotten done, and where the financing has come from. I would say generally speaking the environment is slightly better, but still very tough. We’ve seen some transactions occur with some financing partners stepping up, probably more than I could talk about when we visited this issue in October, but I think it is still a very tough market in terms of main street having financing available for those small business owners who are looking for financing.  The one thing that has happened though, as the business trends have started to improve and there is more optimism across our system, the larger players who can get some financing or in some cases can self-finance are really taking advantage of the opportunistic buys that are available from some of these F franchisees who are exiting the system. I could give examples of three or four markets where we’ve had strong operators with strong balance sheets come in and take over stores at prices that are ridiculously low and within a very short period of time create improvements where the cash-on-cash returns of that investment are going to be astronomical. We are starting to see that activity, and that is a very good thing, and it bodes well for the future.
Operator: The next question is from Tom Forte from Telsey Advisory Group.
Tom Forte - Telsey Advisory Group : To what extent do you think the decrease in commodity prices, both diesel and cheese, is giving your franchisees a greater ability to be more aggressive on price? And then number two, how do you assess the consumer's appetite for a premium product in this environment, to the extent that you are rolling out the American Legends pizzas right now?
Dave Brandon : Commodity pricing is helping a lot, but I wouldn't say that commodity prices have changed the pricing structure at all. I think delivery charges are staying where they have been. I think menu prices have stayed where they have been. In fact, promotional price points, if you look at our current TV, we’re promoting at a higher price point than we have on TV in quite sometime with our Legends line of pizzas. And so I don't think we are seeing any kind of diminution on price, based on the roads that our franchisees have traveled over the last year, and not only our franchisees but everybody's franchisees.  I think pricing discipline is probably higher than it has been in a long time, and consequently the reduction in commodities has improved margins, which is what is required, and so that is a good thing. The thesis that commodity prices are down and prices are going to fall at least to this point we haven't seen it, and I don't anticipate that in the near future.  As it relates to the premium priced products, I think as we have discussed over and over again, our barbell strategy, we recognize that there are people out there that are looking for value price points and are looking for that value menu concept because that’s all they can afford, and we’ve talked a lot about what we are doing to address that. And there will be more to come on that, but value is a very important part of the equation.  However, there are still a number of consumers out there who just want a great-tasting product and they are willing to pay a little bit more for something that is at a medium level where they still perceive a lot of value, but it’s value at a slightly higher price, and I am not in a position to comment on the experience that we are having currently with our Legends line, other than to tell you I am really glad that we are getting into that end of the business, because what we’ve seen has proven to us that there are customers out there that have looked at us for that from our brand and they are pleased to have it. 
Operator: Your next question is from Michael Wolleben with Sidoti & Company.
Michael Wolleben - Sidoti & Co.: I was wondering if you can address with the falling commodity costs is this relieving any pressures from franchisees that were on the cusp of closure or how is that really affecting their businesses?
Dave Brandon : If we can execute a year where commodity prices are anywhere as near reasonable, versus where they were a year ago, where commodity prices behave themselves, and I would say at current levels that is a fair characterization, if we can sustain these kind of levels throughout the year, and concurrently we can build some positive sales momentum, particularly in our franchise business, the combination of those two factors will accomplish two very important things.  It will improve margins and will take some of our bottom 20% operators who have been living hand to mouth and have been working on margins that are so skinny that they question whether they can sustain themselves. Many of those operators will be benefited by improved margins and will continue to stay in the business and build their business.  The concurrent issue though is that some of those low-margin smaller players who still feel as though the economics aren't working in their favor, the benefit of having a stronger margin, stronger cash-producing business model will give our larger players the confidence and the resources they need to buy up some of those stores, which oftentimes is an even more favorable outcome. Either one of those scenarios is positive for the brand. Either one of those scenarios would relieve pressure on closings, but if we can execute and get a more reasonable commodity market to work in our favor this year, those are likely outcomes.
Michael Wolleben - Sidoti & Co.: Just looking at the openings in the quarter and back to the franchisee credit issue and the net closures that you guys expect here in 2009, 50 stores opened here in the fourth quarter. To get to that net closure number, can you give a breakdown on what you are expecting for openings and closings? Are closings going to be more than they were in '08, or would you expect that number to start to decline?
Dave Brandon : That is one of those really tough numbers, and I try not to throw numbers out there unless I have a fair level of confidence. I will have a better handle on that maybe mid year because I will see what’s going on with commodities and how things are going in terms of sales trends.  We put a plan together, as I mentioned to you, that has net growth for our overall system of between 175 and 225 stores. The assumption is that we are going to rely heavily again on the international growth to carry the day. It assumes that we would have some net closings domestically, but whether it is as many as we did last year or more favorable than last year is just something at this early stage of the year is hard for me to peg for you, so that is a question you can ask me after the second quarter results, and I’ll have a better handle on how I really think the year is going to shape out.
Michael Wolleben - Sidoti & Co. : I know you guys have usually stated the EBITDA cushion for the first cash relief trigger was 65 to 75 when you put that in place. What is that cushion at now, given 2008 EBITDA?
Dave Brandon : It is basically the same. It’s still in that range.
Wendy Beck : Exactly. It’s still in that range.
Dave Brandon : It’s still in that range based on the assumptions that we negotiated as part of the ABS at the beginning.
Operator: Your final question from Colin Guheen with Cowen and Company.
Colin Guheen - Cowen and Co. : Getting back to 20% margins on the company side, given a less cyclical environment, is there anything structurally different in the category right now in the way the business is managed that may prevent to you get back to that 20% margin level in a more normal environment over time?
Dave Brandon : I don't think there is anything structurally going on. It is still a huge category. There are still stores being built. It is very relevant that we opened a bunch of new stores in 2008. It is like building a boat in the middle of a hurricane. There are still entrepreneurs out there who see a very large category called pizza where there is a lot of money to be made and margins and cash-on-cash returns can be as good or better than any other place in the QSR industry, and that is still there. There are still people who are willing to invest in that and build stores even in the worst of times.  I think what is happening in our category right now is all positive. I think the fact that we are all working hard to expand our menu and appeal to more people and more day parts, with more price points, and more variety, the fact that we are all out there trying to stimulate traffic and interest in the category is a very positive thing. I believe the fact that we are all out there in our own way approaching this whole barbell strategy of trying to appeal to the lower end of the spectrum in terms of price expectations, at the same time, we are lifting quality and providing premium products to people who see value in those. I think what we are doing generally as a category is all positive and bodes well for the future.  So the people out that are spewing negatives about whether people are going to keep eating pizza and whether this is a category that continues to be huge and provide a lot of potential for those of us who are competing in it, I think anybody who is out there trying to diminish those opportunities doesn't understand the business. But we are going through a period where there is a bit of a renewal and a reenergizing as it relates to the menu and the activity and the price points, and that’s going to be healthy, and I think means good things for the future for our franchisees as well as our brand.
Colin Guheen - Cowen and Co. : Given your specific strategies, you believe that 20% company store margins are achievable in the future. There is not something in product mix or the way that new innovation has come around that can inhibit that?
Dave Brandon : Whenever you put a percentage to the future, I have a whole bunch of people that look at me and say we don't provide future guidance as it relates to percentages and expectations. I will just tell that you I think the business has the same kinds of profit opportunities in the next five years as we’ve seen in the past. There is nothing systemically or structurally that I see that precludes us from getting back into a level of cash flow production that we have enjoyed for many years, notwithstanding the disappointments of the last couple of years.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would like to turn the call back over to Dave Brandon.
Dave Brandon : Well, we ran a little longer with Q&A than we normally do, but I think that is appropriate and I appreciate all of your good questions. We’ve tried to give you more information than we have in the past, in terms of what our thinking is going into 2009. We believe that the uncertainty of the times make that appropriate, and your job has got to be just as tough as ours as it relates to modeling and making investment decisions based on projections and forecasts, but hopefully we have provided you information that will assist you and be beneficial today.  I can close by saying that I want to assure you that the Domino's team will be working with a lot of passion to build a stronger business for the future. We are excited about we have seen in the recent past and we hope to build on that, and I believe that I speak on behalf of our hundreds of franchisees in the domestic system that they are prepared to lead the way and we are prepared to partner with them to do that. We look forward to reporting on our first quarter results, and in the meantime, best wishes to all of you and thanks for joining us today.
Operator: This concludes today's 2008 fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2008 Q3  (2008-10-14 11:00:00) =====
Executives: Lynn M. Liddle – Executive Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations Wendy A. Beck – Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer David A. Brandon – Chief Executive Officer
Analysts: John Glass – Morgan Stanley Jeffrey Bernstein – Barclays Capital Joseph Buckley – Banc of America Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company Tom Forte – Telsey Advisory Group
Operator: Welcome everyone to the 2008 third quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Lynn Liddle, Executive Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. 
Lynn M. Liddle: With me here today are Dave Brandon, our Chief Executive Officer, and Wendy Beck, our Chief Financial Officer.  We have some prepared remarks and then we’re going to follow that with Q&A. We are going to end on or before Noon, but before we begin I have a couple of brief comments. One is to have you refer to our safe harbour statement in our press release and our 10Q so that in the event we make any forward-looking statements that you can take a look at that. And then also I would ask the media to be in a listen-only mode. With that I’d like to start with Wendy Beck, Chief Financial Officer.
Wendy A. Beck: As you all know from our filings this morning, we once again experienced challenges this quarter in our domestic environment while continuing to generate strong international growth. Starting with the top line, please remember that revenues are low and do not necessarily give you the complete picture of our top-line growth and instead consider global retail sales as a clearer gauge of overall sales and store growth performance. Our global retails sales increased 2.4% during the third quarter. This was driven primarily by same-store sales growth in our international business and an increase in world-wide store counts of 55 net units during the third quarter and 216 net units over the trailing four quarters. Our international division now operates in 60 markets, including recently opened stores in Indonesia and Qatar.  Same-store sales. Domestically our sales decreased 6.1% for the quarter compared with a negative 1.6% comp in the third quarter of 2007. Company-owned stores decreased 3.4%, rolling over a positive 0.8% in the third quarter of 2007. While franchise same-store sales decreased 6.4% rolling over a negative 2% in the third quarter of 2007. International same-store sales, however, increased 5.4% over last year’s comp of a very strong positive 8.3%. This marks the 59th consecutive quarter of international same-store sales growth. As a result, our total revenues for the third quarter were $323.6 million, a $13.7 million or 4.1% decrease from prior year. Company-owned store revenues declined $11.5 million or 12.8% primarily due to a lower store count from store divestitures earlier this year, as well as lower same-store sales. The loss of sales from the store divestitures was approximately $9.4 million. Domestic franchise revenues declined $1.1 million or 3.2% due to lower same-store sales and domestic supply chain revenues declined $5.9 million or 3.2% due to lower volume. This was offset in part by higher revenues due to higher pass through commodity costs.  Offsetting these declines was a $4.7 million or 16.5% increase in international revenue due to higher same-store sales and increased store counts.  Moving on to our operating margin. Our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 0.6% in the third quarter versus the prior year period.  [Break in Recording] There were essentially three main operating margin variances. First, our company-owned store operating margin declined 4.6% from the prior year period which accounted for 1.2% of the consolidated operating margin decline. Food, labour, and delivery costs accounted for over 60% of the decline with occupancy costs accounting for most of the remainder.  Second, our supply chain margin declined 0.2% from the prior year quarter which had a minimal impact on our consolidated operating margin. The supply chain margin decline was due primarily to the increase in pass through costs on other non-cheese commodities such as wheat, meats, and sauces. This had no impact on dollar margins. Dollar margin was negatively impacted due to reduced volume from lower same-store sales and traffic declines, as well as increased costs for fuel.  Third, a change in the blend of our revenue had a positive impact on our margin this quarter. We had a greater percent of our revenue from our international franchise business this year, which has a 100% gross margin, and a lower percent of our revenue from our company-owned stores. This change in blend improved our consolidated margin by 0.6%.  Now let’s look at our G&A expenses. G&A decreased $1.7 million or 4.2% in the quarter versus the prior year; $1.8 million of the decrease is non-recurring relating to the gain on the sale of three stores sold in California as part of our previously announced California store divestiture plan. Including the three stores sold during the third quarter we have sold 59 stores year to date. These details are also outlined in the items affecting comparability table in our earnings release. Excluding this non-recurring activity G&A would have been essentially flat.  While we did experience lower advertising expense due to the store divestitures and lower variable labour expense, our bad debt expense did increase in 2008. Having said that, the company continued to collect over 99% of domestic franchise royalty and domestic supply chain receivables during the third quarter and year to date. Believe me, we are all over aggressively managing our G&A in this challenging environment. Now let’s look at our leverage. I’m thrilled to report that this quarter marks the first quarter that we do not have comparability issues with our debt structure. Given the uncertainty in today’s debt markets, we are very pleased to have a debt facility in place with a blended fixed cash interest rate of 6.06% through 2012 with two possible one-year extensions.  As for our tax rates, our effective rate was 30.7% in the third quarter. We recorded approximately $1.6 million of tax reserve reversals related to certain state income tax matters. This reduced our effective rate for the quarter and is also outlined in the items affecting comparability table in the earnings release. However, as previously indicated, we currently anticipate approximately a 40% normalized rate in the foreseeable future. Now let’s look at bottom line earnings. Our third quarter diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.17 or $0.13 when adjusted for items affecting comparability. The $0.13 of adjusted EPS figure is a $0.04 decrease from the $0.17 in 2007. Our operating results negatively impacted us by $0.05 for the quarter. This was all driven by the lower domestic sales that we’ve experienced. Our EPS benefited $0.01 from the lower share count in the quarter versus 2007, primarily resulting from our share repurchases. Please note, our 2007 recap did not impact the comparison during the quarter.  As stated in our earnings release, we repurchased approximately $1.1 million shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program for $12.8 million during the quarter or $12 per share. Additionally, on a year-to-date basis, we have returned $41.1 million to our share holders and $95.5 million life-to-date under our share repurchase program. We have now completed 48% of our repurchase authorization. Due to the anticipated impact of recent events in the credit markets which we’ll discuss in a minute, we plan to build our cash reserves and will continue to evaluate the share repurchase program.  Now let’s look at our liquidity. As of the third quarter we had $20.1 million of unrestricted cash. Subsequent to the third quarter, Lehman Brothers, our primary provider of our revolver, declared bankruptcy. As a result, our ability to draw upon the $150 million revolver has likely been reduced, but we are actively monitoring the bankruptcy proceedings. Lehman’s share of the $150 million revolver was $90 million. If we cannot borrow under this agreement and we are unable to secure replacement financing from other parties for the $90 million our availability will be reduced to $60 million, of which approximately $38.3 million is already committed under letters of credit giving us a net availability of approximately $21.7 million. The company has historically not needed or used the revolver for working capital requirements. We believe that our current unrestricted cash balance, our expected ongoing free cash flow generation, and our estimated $21.7 million availability under the revolver is more than sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. However, as I mentioned earlier, we plan to build our cash reserves during these unprecedented times and we’ll be conservative and prudent with our cash. In closing, despite a challenging year we continue to generate positive free cash flow of $25.8 million year to date and continue to grow our global system as we have great momentum within our international division with both strong sales and store growth. We have a proven business model that is resilient, even during these challenging times. We also have a long-term fixed rate favourably priced debt structure that has a [inaudible]. In addition, we are taking action to ensure we are well positioned for growth when the domestic environment stabilizes.  This concludes our financial update. I’d now like to turn it over to Dave.
David A. Brandon: We entered the third quarter knowing it was going to be a difficult quarter for us. We had virtually no sales momentum going into the quarter. We had fewer national weeks on TV than we had a year ago by nearly 50% and this was at the same time it became very apparent to us that our national competitors were stepping up their spending considerably. Our main national topic was a movie property and something I would describe as more of a gimmick-limited, time-only pizza product for our national promotion. We had committed to that a year earlier and it clearly wasn’t a great fit for the sales environment that we face. We experienced a peak in cheese costs. We incurred another increase in federal minimum wage. We saw tremendous volatility and spikes in fuel costs. And we knew the benefit we would get from our introduction of oven-baked sandwiches wasn’t going to begin until the fourth quarter. So it was a lousy quarter. In fact, it was a quarter that I can best describe as one of those that if it could go wrong it did go wrong. And I take full responsibility for it. Now let me share with you what we’re doing to improve our outcomes in the fourth quarter. First off, I’d like to start with our new product platform introduction: oven-baked sandwiches. This is a big new product introduction for us and one of the quickest products to go from concept to test to national rollout in the history of our company.  While sandwiches are not a panacea for all of the problems that we face, they are a huge launch for our brand that has our franchisees national wide more excited about a new product line than they’ve been in years. And they’re doing a great job of really working this product hard with local store marketing, sampling programs, and a keen eye on operations. Our team members are very eager to sell these products because they’re great. And so far this launch has given us promising indications that we’re on the right track with this exciting new line of permanent products on the Domino’s menu. In the first seven weeks of our rollout, when we had no national TV and we were still just ramping up to have the product available in all of our domestic stores, we sold nearly 5 million sandwiches. That’s already about $25 million in sandwich sales before we really got started. That was without any benefit of national TV support. We will likely sell a million sandwiches a week during our national promotion, and that’s in addition to the pizzas, chicken wings, and breadsticks we will also be selling. Significantly, sandwiches have increased our store traffic, which has been on a decline along with most of the rest of the industry, for a long period of time. Plus, we’ve expanded our lunch opportunity. Every Domino’s Pizza store in the US is now open for lunch, which is becoming an increasing valuable day part. The dinner day part has been suffering from recent consumer economic malaise, but the lunch day part has held up better. Sandwiches are a huge part of our lunch and, interestingly, our dinner sales as well. We’ll take all the incremental sales we can get at this particular time.  All that said, I would like to caution you to remember that there are no silver bullets in this business. As I stated at the outset, sandwiches are not a panacea to solve every ill of our current domestic environment. We have only been on national TV for two weeks and it’s still in its early days. But sandwiches, and it’s important for you to remember that sandwiches are a lower ticket item which will make it tough for them alone to drive enough business to overcome a string of negative comps. We have lots of work to do to get back to positive domestic sales comps and sandwiches are just one of the levers we’re using in that effort, but I want to emphasize it’s an important lever. Not the only lever, but a very important one.  So in addition to sandwiches our team is also filling our product pipeline with more new products than I’ve seen in years. These are not one-time, limited-time only type products that they’re developing and testing. These are products designed to become permanent menu layers that will improve our product variety, our brand quality, and our consumer brand impressions. We’re also developing and testing more value oriented promotions and products than we’ve ever had in our pipeline. And considering the current economic environment, we’re convinced this is the right path to follow.  To ensure that we have the ability to shout very loudly about upcoming product and promotion news we plan to have a much more significant presence on national TV in 2009. We plan to have a much greater share of voice in our category at the national level and we are going to launch our menu expansion with more weeks of television than we had in 2008. We know our franchisees agree that more television exposure, particularly for our new products and promotions, will be a good thing. Particularly in a year where we will likely be facing a continued difficult consumer environment. We’re also continuing to develop our technological edge with on-line ordering now making up over 20% of our Team USA orders and with franchise stores not far behind. We expect this percentage to continue to grow, which is positive for our business. My team and I believe that one of the most important tasks we’re undertaking is to revitalize our brands and refresh our franchise system, placing a strong focus on making sure our franchise base is where we need it to be for success going forward and that we have the right franchise partners in place, particularly in our domestic business.  Admittedly, a shakeout is happening right now and it’s a bit painful at the moment. Exiting ex-franchisees from the system is hard on everyone and with the credit markets where they are right now, getting stores turned over to new franchisees has become even more difficult. It’s paramount that we work hard with lenders to get credit lines opened up so that this turnover of the store base continues to move along at the rate and pace we need. It’s important that we recognize that all store operators, regardless of grade, are under pressure in today’s environment.  Being lower EBIDTA margins as franchise P&L gets squeezed by a touch sales environment and higher commodity and labour costs. We know from a recent rollup of the 2007 self reported franchise P&L that EBIDTA margins were down from traditional levels, putting additional strain on unit economics. Plugging in some projections for 2008, we expect this year will be worse. It’s hard on our operators out there right now, and we expect that and we’re doing everything we can to address the issue.  We’re working hard to assist ex-franchisees who want to stay in the system and improve to an A or a B. Our former interim CFO Bill Kapp, who is a very respected leader and a 20-year veteran of our company, is leading this most important project. He’s in the trenches working with banks and other lending institutions to get the sale of stores executed and to create workout plans so that those with marginal stores who need bank support to turn their stores around have the capital to do it. I’ve promised you an update on a quarterly basis as to where we stand relative to those A, B, and F franchisees and here’s where we are as of the moment. Of the 247 original F rated franchisees we’re happy to report that 111 of them have recommitted to the brand and are doing everything they can do to earn their way back into the system as a permanent member, and many of them are making substantial progress. Right now 75 franchisees are in the process of selling their stores. Fourteen are still working out their options. We have removed 47 of those F franchisees from the system. Twenty-two of them left during the third quarter. The F franchisees who committed to stay are performing better overall, both operationally as well as their sales trends. We’re continuing our efforts to keep them moving along to a more positive outcome. Our goal is to not allow marginal stores to be operated at sub-standard levels. Most of them are owned by F franchisees, but some are not. Even our strong franchisees are feeling the pressure of marginal stores. As we work through the tough market for selling stores it makes it difficult to project what our total number of US store closures will be this year. In Q2 we said that the US could be down by 50 to 75 net stores domestically. From where I sit today I hesitate to try to update that range except to say I expect it will be higher than that. We do expect to open approximately 100 new domestic stores during this year. However, market conditions will dictate what the final net domestic store growth number will be at year end. All of that notwithstanding, we still expect our worldwide net store growth numbers to be very positive thanks to the continued strong store growth in our international markets. Unfortunately, our final net store growth for 2008 will be less than the 200 to 250 range we have established as normal annual net store growth for our system. Speaking of our international business, I continue to not only be impressed by the growth and drive of this division, but what I see on the ground when I visit these countries. I recently travelled in five countries from Turkey to France to the UK, Ireland, and Mexico, touring many stores and meeting with many franchisees. The most impressive thing that I observed was the energy in the stores. I saw franchisees and team members proudly growing their business by providing great products and services to their customers. I saw aggressive marketing both at the local level and the national level. I saw well located stores with strong brand imaging and strong operations. That’s the basic formula. It’s no wonder we’ve been enjoying consistent growth from our international division because in my opinion they are operating at a very high level. Another strength of our international business model is what we truly refer to as our portfolio of countries. We tend to discuss international as if it’s one unified market. It’s not. It’s 60 different markets with 60 different market conditions. That means when one market is weak typically we can figure out a way to get another market to grow faster and offset it with strength.  We’ve been asked lately if we’re seeing a slowdown in our global business and the current answer to that question is best found in the outstanding results our international business achieved in the third quarter. However, we’ll continue to stay focused as we know global markets are being impacted more and more by the unstable financial markets, a higher commodity cost pressures, and in many cases reduced consumer confidence.  One thing that may work against us in many countries in the weeks or months ahead is the recent strengthening of the US dollar, which could impact our reported earnings going forward as we have benefited from a weaker dollar in past years. Despite whatever challenges we may need to confront in our international business we still expect robust sales and store growth going forward. Before I go to questions I just want to say that despite the fact that commodities are high, consumers are scared, stores are battling tough trends, Domino’s Pizza is still producing ample free cash flow. Right now, as Wendy mentioned, I believe hanging on to that cash is the prudent decision. We will be building our cash reserves over the next several weeks until we feel the markets are more stable and the debt markets are becoming more receptive to the needs of our franchisees. It will never be my preference to provide financing to our franchisees. We would rather keep our relationship with them focused on being the franchisor rather than their bank. However, we are wading through uncharted waters and we are not going to let our A and B franchisees fail if there are ways we can be helpful with some short-term financial support and solutions. We will be monitoring this situation carefully in the weeks ahead and invest capital, as always, that are in the best ways in the long-term interest of our shareholders. And finally, an important reminder to you all. We’re working on some of our weaker franchisees. We’re working on some franchisees that are not operating at the level or the standard required in the environment that we’re in. I want to be sure to put on the record that we still have a talented, experienced core group of domestic franchisees and they have not only the talent but the experience and the passion to get their businesses turned around. And we’re working well together with them to make that happen. With that, I’d like to open up the call for questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Glass – Morgan Stanley.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: David, first, can you just maybe provide a little colour on how bad the franchise financing environment is? Is it an absolute lack of access to capital or is it just an interest rate issue? And you put a comment in there about now letting your franchisees fail. I mean, franchisees typically don’t need the capital to operate, I presume, it’s just getting the Fs out of the system or is there some working capital access to capital needs?
David A. Brandon: I think it’s this issue we’ve got with access to capital right now is the transactional activities. For the most part, because our franchise is based in small business operators, they have not gotten particularly leveraged in their balance sheet. It’s not a function of typically, and there’s exceptions to every rule, but typically we’re not dealing with a situation where people need necessarily short term borrowing. Often times what we’re running into problems with is we have an A or B operator that wants to buy stores, distressed stores from some of our F operators and right now it’s not an interest rate issue, there just doesn’t seem to be any capital availability to finance those transactions. So the ones that are happening are the ones that are financed from people who have cash flow substantial enough to fund it out of their own cash, but the bank credit market has been very touch and that’s gotten exceedingly worse during the third quarter and I would say right now has fundamentally shut down. 
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: Okay. And Dave, you mentioned ad spending. There’s a national advertising presence in 2009 versus 2008. So are you spending more, are you increasing the percentage of advertising spend or is it just another year shifting from local to national? 
David A. Brandon: It’s going to be a combination of both. The truth of the matter is it’s one of our problems thus far this year is we’re getting killed in terms of sheer voice. We’re not out there at a competitive level with our national competitors and what’s happened, and again this is one of those kind of timing is working against us, as you recall we went into 2008 with a plan to shift more of our dollars into the local level, less dollars at the national level, and what fundamentally has happened is with the inflationary pressures and with the margin squeeze some of those dollars that we hoped would be spent on marketing at the local level are not being spent. In essence what we’ve done is we’ve really trimmed back our voice as it relates to our overall marketing message. At the same time we’re teeing up a lot of new products and things that are going to require more education, more communication to the consumer. So as we go into 2009 we’ve already put the plan together. We will be on national TV a substantial number of weeks more than we had as part of our planned calendar for this year. That funding will come from a variety of sources, including a shift back to a higher percent funding at the national advertising fund level because that’s just an imperative as we launch these new product platforms to have the marketing bullets we need to get them communicated.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: Are you preparing to talk about how much, though, and are you asking for incremental contributions in aggregate to that fund?
David A. Brandon: I really don’t want to go into exactly how much that’s going to be because I think that’s very proprietary. But I’m happy to share with you the fact that we are putting together a much more aggressive national advertising plan for next year that will put us on TV at substantially higher levels.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: Just one last question. Maybe for Wendy. Cash from operations this quarter appeared to be negative. In other words, you actually used cash in operations and it had to do with some of the other assets and liabilities in the current section. Is that bad debt? What was that? Is that recurring and is that related to bad debts in any way?
Wendy A. Beck: That’s a great question. It’s primarily two items. There’s an $11.7 million tax payment. Purely the timing that it fell into our third quarter, but it really was more for catch up of first and second quarter. And then $5 million was the legal settlement for California that’s now been paid.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: Gotcha. So if you reverse those out you get, I don’t have the numbers in front of me, but how much would you have if you reversed those out would you get?
Wendy A. Beck: Right. You need to add back the $18 million to the $25.8 million. Those would be non-recurring.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: Gotcha. Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein – Barclays Capital.
Jeffrey Bernstein – Barclays Capital: Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. First is on the follow up on the slowing credit implications. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your share repurchase, perhaps, intentions for 2009 and whether that might be pared back as you look to kind of conserve cash. And if you could also give us an update in terms of the turnover of the existing franchisees that you’re trying to move through the system. I know you said perhaps the rate and pace of the turnover has slowed. If you could just talk about perhaps where they are in the turnover versus where you perhaps were internally targeting them to be when we spoke about it a couple of quarters ago. And then I have a follow up.
David A. Brandon: Yes, I’ll handle the second part of that question first. The way that’s best for the brand and best for the system for us to remove F franchisees from our system is transactional. It’s not to close those stores either temporarily or permanently. It is to get those stores in the hands of quality operators who love buying those stores at distressed levels, they bring in their strong operational expertise, they execute a high level of the cash-on-cash returns from those investments can be very substantial. That’s the plan that we had and the plan that we have to kind of remove those F franchisees from the system and yet keep those stores open.  The difficulty we’ve run into is simply a function of the fact that many of our franchisees have had 20-year relationships with their local bank that has typically been available to them to extend credit to fund those kind of transactions and in the recent past those banks have not wanted to make commitments simply because they’re trying to figure out what’s going on in their industry. I think their credit committees have gotten very conservative as the overall banking industry has gone through their own form of hell.  So it has put a lot of our F franchisees in a situation where they want to transact their way out of the business, they don’t want to just close the store and not get any value, but transactions have been slow as a result of the credit markets. We’re hoping that situation relieves itself, but that’s a tough one to predict. As it relates to our stock repurchase program, we just had a board meeting last week. It was a topic of considerable conversation. I can tell you that certainly where we were sitting last week looking at what was going on in the equity markets, looking at what was happening in the credit markets and the bank failures, our point of view was for the time being we were going to sit on the side lines, we were going to pile up more cash than we normally would think about piling up, until this situation sorted itself out. Once we knew where the credit markets were, where our revolver was, as we saw more trends develop in terms of what’s happening with the health and vitality of our franchise system, that we would make a better decisions as it relates to stock repurchases at some point in the future.  So right now we’re just going to carry a larger cash balance and we’re going to see how this all sorts out. Based on what’s happened in the last couple days we feel better than we did last week, but I think that’s an indication of how volatile the situation is and we’re going to watch it carefully and be patient.
Jeffrey Bernstein – Barclays Capital: Great. And then more on the operations side of the business. I know you’ve mentioned commodity cost pressures through the third quarter, and I guess your third quarter ended in early September, but I’m just wondering if you could give us an update in terms of the most recent using we’ve seen. It seems like cheese and wheat would be flat to favourable if you were kind of locked minimal over a quarterly basis. Maybe we’d see some favourability going forward. I’m just wondering what you see from here in terms of your kind of core commodities as you look out into the rest of this year and into next.
David A. Brandon: Yes, that’s a great question and again one that we spent a lot of time on last week. I can tell you in the third quarter we took a serious hit in terms of cost of our overall food basket. Cheese actually peaked at a higher level than it’s been in terms of the cheese factor in the third quarter. Our average cost was higher. It was a difficult quarter for us with cheese. But the reality is if there’s any good in what appears to be happening in the economy right now most of the smart people I talk to expect that we’re going to see some relief as it relates to some of these commodity pressures that we’ve been under. Fuel coming down helps us a lot. We’ve seen some relief in some of the meats and other areas of the food basket. Some of them are still very high. We continue to monitor them closely. The one that’s most important, as you know, to us is cheese. Cheese actually came down a little bit at the very end of the quarter and we thought that maybe we were going to get some significant relief. It frankly has gone back up to the point where I think it closed yesterday at $1.89. The cheese block, which is still very, very high. So we have not seen yet the cheese block come down at the rate and pace that we’d like to see and that we expect to see. Hopefully, as we get into 2009, sadly because of a lot of economic reasons that will be negative, but hopefully what we’re going to see is some relief on the commodities side. 
Jeffrey Bernstein – Barclays Capital: If I could just throw in one last question, I guess for Wendy. You mentioned the FX head winds, which have been a favourable tailwind for a while, but it looks like beginning 4Q should we expect a headwind? I’m just wondering whether or not you have any hedging in place or if the dollar were to stay at these levels what you’d expect your 2009 hit to earnings per share to be or perhaps what it was in 2008, just to kind of get some perspective.
Wendy A. Beck: Sure. Well, we can’t foretell the future. Right now we are braced for a hit for $1 million in the fourth quarter. Again, we would have no way of knowing if in fact that happens. 
Jeffrey Bernstein – Barclays Capital: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Buckley – Banc of America.
Joseph Buckley – Banc of America: Thank you. Couple questions. First on the oven-baked sandwiches. Thanks for sharing as much insight into it as you did. And I know you said this was the product to move very quickly from test markets to roll out, but I’m curious in the test markets how incremental those product sales proved to be versus cannibalizing your pizza sales. 
David A. Brandon: Well, Joe, what we’ve learned thus far about the sandwich business is, first of all, it’s brought in some new customers. That’s always great. It’s accelerated our traffic appreciably. It’s been the biggest traffic mover we’ve seen in my 10 years. So we’re getting velocity out of it. Some of it’s from new customers, but the other thing that we’re learning about the sandwich business is that the repeat customers is really a phenomenal number, unlike pizza where we’re used to people kind of cycling. The heavy user might buy pizza once a week and the typical user might be every three weeks. We’re in a situation with sandwiches where we have evidence that people are buying multiple sandwich orders from us per week. So one of the things we’re learning and we like about sandwiches is that we’re getting a more loyal, repeat order customer, which is having a significant impact on our traffic.  So we saw that in our test markets. We’ve seen a continuation of that as we’ve gotten into the initial stages of our rollout. Obviously it’s far from the mature product platform for us, so we’re still learning and we’re still just a couple weeks into national TV. So we’re still educating people. But right now we’re excited about what it’s doing for our traffic. It’s making the phones ring, it’s getting us more engaged at different parts of the day, and we’re excited about it.
Joseph Buckley – Banc of America: And how do you deal with the price point? Is there a minimum check that’s required to deliver the product? Is that one of the issues with a lower ticketed product?
David A. Brandon: It is one of the issues. We leave that up to the local operator. You see a little bit of everything out there. Some of them will require a minimum of two sandwiches, some will have a minimum total dollar amount for the order, you know, $8 or greater. Other people it’s part of the trial experience. They’re willing to take the hit and they’ll deliver whatever you want to order to get the trial. We really leave that up to the local operator and we’re all still learning as to what’s kind of the best answer. But right now I would say we’re being very aggressive. I’m very proud of my franchisees. They’ve really embraced this. This is teach an old dog new tricks in terms of a whole new platform operationally in the store. But also the marketing. This is a product that sets itself up very well for sampling and our franchisees have done a phenomenal job of getting out there and getting people to get this product in their mouths and when they do they buy it. 
Joseph Buckley – Banc of America: I’d really like to [inaudible] for a moment. Are the implications of the revolver, are there any day-to-day implications of the revolver being so modest? How concerning is the situation or is it just something that prudence would suggest you need to raise cash and find some replacement for that $90 million of short term credit?
David A. Brandon: Joe, I’m going to soon be celebrating my 10th anniversary at this company and, as you know, from day one we’ve been a levered balance sheet because we should be. In my 10 years we have never used the revolver for anything material. The only time we’ve accessed it is to either put LCs against it or, in very odd circumstances, we’ve accessed it because we’ve gone out and done a big block trade or we bought some additional incremental shares since we’ve become a public company. I think the most we ever got into it was $15 million. So we are losing no sleep, have no concern about our liquidity, we have significant cash balances. We still have two components of the original revolver that are in place and available to us if we need them. We don’t plan to use it but it’s there if we need it. The only disappointment of the $90 million Lehman piece is that when the stock market does what the stock market does and drives our stock down to irrationally low levels, you know, that big revolver was there and we always had the opportunity of thinking about accessing it to a more material degree to take advantage of buying opportunities. In the case of those large block trades and big open market share repurchase plans we’re going to have to be a little bit more conservative than we otherwise would have been because we lost $90 million of our capacity. But from a day-to-day operations perspective I think that event means nothing. 
Joseph Buckley – Banc of America: Okay. And then the conditions under which you would extend credit to your franchisees are you indicating would only be to facilitate transactions of A and B franchisees buying F rated stores?
David A. Brandon: I think the situation that we’re in right now is it’s a very one-off consideration. Bill Kapp and his team are looking at these things very carefully. If we can help facilitate a transaction that we know is going to be a winner and we can provide some very non-material level of bridge financing, we will consider that. If we’ve got a franchisee who’s moving into a bunch of new stores and is going to be in a turnaround mode and it’s sensible for us to provide some deferrals of costs, deferrals of royalties, deferrals of other payments, we will look at that simply as a way to work with that franchisee and help facilitate something that’s overall good for the brand and the system. So we’re going to be creative and we’re not opposed to helping out our best franchisees become bigger and better, but it’s going to be done in a very careful, I would say targeted way, with limited exposure to our shareholders because, frankly, I don’t want to be a bank. It’s never been our plan or our interest. So whatever we do, in my opinion, will be done at a very low level and will not be material to our financials. 
Joseph Buckley – Banc of America: Okay. And the domestic store closures we’re seeing, are they related to the F program, for lack of a better term?
David A. Brandon: Absolutely. They’re related to two factors. Actually, three factors. One is, we’re putting enormous pressure on people who are not operating stores at acceptable levels. We’re putting a lot of pressure on them. We’re making their life miserable because they’re hurting the whole system. They’re not just hurting us at the corporate level; they’re hurting our entire system of franchisees. So we’re putting a lot of pressure.  The second thing that we’re doing is, as we’re putting that pressure on them, if you’re a weak operator with low volumes and you’re not doing a great job, in this environment you’re margins are going to disappear. This is a time and place where operators have to be great to be successful. And by definition, if you’re an F franchisee and you’re not getting the job done your bank and your income statement every period is encouraging you to consider getting out of the business. And then the third component is, whereas normally we would have big appetites around the system to buy up these stores, as I mentioned earlier, the credit markets being what they are and just the overall fear factor that exists in small business today is such that we’ve seen people that would traditionally be stepping up and wanting to buy these stores being far more hesitant until there’s a little bit more stability in the financial markets and the overall business conditions.
Joseph Buckley – Banc of America: Okay. And then the last question, when do you telegraph the possible effects impacting the fourth quarter? What’s been the positive EPS impact from foreign exchange in the first three quarters?
David A. Brandon: Yes, let us look that up. We’ll get it to you, Joe.
Joseph Buckley – Banc of America: Okay. Very good then. That’s all I have. Thank you.
David A. Brandon: Yes. Thank you. If we get it before the end of the call we’ll shout it out here.
Joseph Buckley – Banc of America: Sounds good.
Wendy A. Beck: Yes, the total effect was $1.7 million positive, $0.9 million in Q1, $0.6 million in Q2, and then $200,000 in this quarter. 
David A. Brandon: Did you get that, Joe?
Wendy A. Beck: Hello?
Operator: Your next question comes from Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: Hi, there. Just a couple of questions that haven’t been asked. I just been focusing back into the company store margins talking a little bit about food. What about labour during the quarter? What is some of the variability in the comp or the declining comps ended up in some inefficient labouring schedule that might be better planned in the fourth quarter. Maybe parse out that other 60% of a margin decline. 
David A. Brandon: Yes, I would say Team USA had a very poor quarter. We did not manage labour well. We got hit particularly hard with the next tranche of the minimum wage increase, which puts pressure on labour. I think we had the right intentions. In many cases we were bringing on incremental labour to go out and do door hanging and try to do more local store marketing. We were trying to improve our service. But at the same time we were bringing on all that labour our sales were dramatically less than what we’ve grown to expect from Team USA. So lower sales and higher investment in labour and higher fundamental minimum wage labour costs, you know, the combination of those factors created a very lousy outcome in terms of Team USA’s performance. We’ve addressed those issues in a number of ways and, again, we don’t do go forward things, but I can tell you that trend is moving the other direction and that’s a good thing in terms of our tight management of labour costs at Team USA.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: And then just, we’ve talked a lot about providing some small financing of the franchisees. What about buying franchise stores? Is that on the table at all or is that something that left kind of to the A franchisees?
David A. Brandon: It’s always on the table, but what we’re committed to is being very, very disciplined about where we buy stores. Meaning, if we have infrastructure in place and we have a good team and a solid business and a market and there are stores that are contiguous to that that we can buy at levels we think are attractive, that will always be an option that we’ll look at and certainly carefully consider. What we’re not going to do is become kind of the port of last resort for three stores here and four stores there that will cost us more to supervise and integrate into our system than we’ll ever hope to make. Those are the stores and frankly that’s more of the situation that we’re dealing with today with these F franchisees sprinkled around the country. We really need our A and B franchisees to step up and take over ownership of those stores. It’s hard for us to step in those shoes.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: Okay. And there’s no material change in the $25 million of CapEx expected as kind of a run rate number? 
David A. Brandon: No, other than as we look at a world where business is tough and we’re still in the process of getting things turned around we will be even more conservative and careful in the way that we allocate and spend that capital. So $25 million is still a very good number to use, but under there’s flexibility in that number if things continue to stay very tight we’ll see if we can reduce it.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: And assuming you are going out and looking to extend the revolver back to the $150 million if that would be available. What’s kind of the process given the bankruptcy?
David A. Brandon: Yes, that would take about an hour and half. There’s ongoing discussions with Lehman and certainly this involves now Barclays and how they want to manage their client relationships and how they want to pick up the pieces with some of their existing clients. So there’s conversations going on on that end. There’s other relationships we have that are very close and very important and those people may have an opportunity to step up and fill that void. We’re having those conversations. Obviously everybody’s playing their cards very close to the vest, particularly in the last week or two weeks. It was kind of hard to get people to answer their phone in light of what was going on, but we’re having good conversations with people that we have good relationships with and certainly we’ll put that $90 million back in place if there’s a way for us to do that on an economic basis that’s attractive and consistent with what our needs are. 
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from Tom Forte – Telsey Advisory Group.
Tom Forte – Telsey Advisory Group: Great. Hi. I wanted to talk about the quarter and my first question was, when you look back and think about some of the activities, the Olympics, some of the other good television, what if any was the benefit to sales from those activities? 
David A. Brandon: Very little from the standpoint of the fact that we weren’t really involved in the Olympics in terms of any kind of advertising or brand presence. The Olympics does put people in front of TVs, admittedly, but based on the time differences and other factors we didn’t feel any kind of material impact from the Olympics, nor do we normally see that as a big business boon opportunity for us. The key thing for us was that our competitors, and God love them, they’ve fired a lot of media bullets during the quarter, launching platforms and supporting them with high levels of TV and we got caught in a quarter where we had a major reduction. So I think it was really more a share of voice issue than it was anything else in terms of what was going on in the marketplace. 
Tom Forte – Telsey Advisory Group: And then in that regard, can you talk about some of the promotions that you’ve talked about. You said you’ve had more promotion in the pipeline than you’ve ever had. Is there something, lower price points, what sort of considerations do you have?
David A. Brandon: Yes. And listen, I hate talking about this because I don’t like to make it easy for anybody to figure out what we’re up to, but I can tell you that first of all we’re excited about Russell Weiner, our new chief marketing officer, who is now on board in the saddle. A very talented marketing executive that is going to bring a fresh perspective and new energy and we’re excited about having Russell on board. I’m excited about the fact that we’re working hard to get a greater share of voice and get out there and really be able to shout from the roof tops on some of our new platforms. We have test markets that are out and going that have a new pizza product that I think are the best food that we’ve ever made in terms of pizza products. We’re testing pasta products because obviously that’s a category that’s generated some interest and we want to participate. We’ve got an approach to that that we’re very excited about with some initial good results. We’ve got some pricing and value promotions that I won’t go into specifics on only because I think that would damage our competitive situation. We’re looking at a value menu, opportunity value offering that we think will balance out what we’re doing at the premium end with some of our new line of pizzas that we’re very excited about. We think commodities are going to be coming our way and we’ll see some relief in that regard. We’ve already seen some in some areas. We hope to see more.  So the combination of all those factors put us in a position where we’re optimistic about the way we’re going to be moving into 2009 and the kind of momentum that we can create. We’re disappointed with the fact that we’ve created a low base for ourselves with the problems that we’ve weighted throughout the last couple of years, but we’re optimistic about where we think we can go and there’s a lot of energy throughout the company and the system in that regard.
Tom Forte – Telsey Advisory Group: Great. Thank you very much.
David A. Brandon: You’re welcome.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dave Brandon. 
David A. Brandon: Listen, very briefly I just want to point out the obvious, and that is that there is no doubt we’re living through unprecedented times. We’ve seen shakeouts in a number of industries of late and we’re likely to see shakeouts in our industry as well. I’m just here to assure you that Domino’s Pizza will not only be one of the survivors, but we’re going to be one the brands and companies that will be stronger as a result of the challenges that we’re working through today. We appreciate your patience, we appreciate your commitment, and I look forward to reporting to you on our fourth quarter results in a few months. Thank you.

===== 2008 Q2  (2008-09-08 11:00:00) =====
Executives:  Lynn M. Liddle - Executive Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations David A. Brandon - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Wendy Beck - Chief Financial Officer William E. Kapp - Interim Chief Financial Officer 
Analysts:  Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers John Glass - Morgan Stanley John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan 
Operator:  Welcome to the 2008 second quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Lynn Liddle, Executive Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations. 
Lynn M. Liddle:  With me today I have David Brandon, our Chairman and CEO, and Wendy Beck, our Chief Financial Officer. Dave and Wendy, you have some prepared remarks and, as Julie said, we’ll follow up with a Q&A.  Before that, a couple of housekeeping issues. We generally do not make forward-looking statements in these conference calls, but to the extent that that does occur during the call, I would have you reference our Safe Harbor statement that is in our press and 8-K. And then also, the media that is on the line, if you would today remain in a listen-only mode, we would appreciate that. So with that, I’d like to turn it over to Dave Brandon, CEO.
David A. Brandon: Before we begin today I’d like to take the opportunity to introduce our new Chief Financial Officer, Wendy Beck, who started with us in mid-May. Wendy is a restaurant industry veteran, joining us from Whataburger, a leading regional hamburger chain with 700 outlets located in Texas and 10 other states. Wendy served as CFO and before that Chief Accounting Officer of Whataburger since 2001. Prior to that experience, Wendy was Chief Financial Officer, Vice President and Treasurer of Checkers Drive-In Restaurants, which also includes Rally’s Hamburgers, a chain with over 800 units in 28 states.  Now, as most of you know, we conducted a patient, and I want to underscore the word patient, exhaustive, national search for just the right candidate, and we’re thrilled with Wendy’s finance and strategic capabilities, her industry and public company experience, and most importantly, her great cultural fit. I’d say welcome, but she’s actually already had a full and active role on our leadership council. But I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank Bill Kapp, who’s joining us here today, for the terrific job he did as our interim Chief Financial Officer over the past several months. He performed his duties well and did a great job on behalf of our company and our shareholders.  So with that, I’ll turn the call over to Wendy for a brief recap of the quarter’s financials, then I’ll follow up with a more extensive report on our progress versus the initiatives we have under way to help turn around the negative sales trend in our domestic business. 
Wendy Beck: I am thrilled to be a part of Domino’s and look forward to discussing our financial results with you this quarter as well as future quarters. As you will note from our earnings release, we have several items that affected the comparability of our results to those of the second quarter prior year. I’ll cover those shortly, but first let’s start with the top line. We again ask you to remember that revenues alone do not necessarily give you the complete picture and instead consider global retail sales as a clear gauge of top-line performance.  Our global retail sales increased 4.7% during the second quarter. This was driven primarily by same-store sales growth in our international business and an increase in worldwide store counts of 30 net units during the second quarter and 222 units over the trailing 4 quarters. Same-store sales. Domestically, our sales decreased 5.4% for the quarter compared with a positive 2.1% comp in the second quarter of 2007, which was our strongest quarter in the prior year. Company owned stores decreased 1.1%, rolling over a positive 4.4% in Q2 2007, while franchised same-store sales decreased 5.9%, rolling over a positive 1.8% in Q2 2007. International same-store sales, however, increased a healthy 7% over last year’s comp of a positive 3.9%. As a result of our global retail sales, our total revenues for the second quarter were $334.3 million or a $6 million, 1.7% decrease from prior year. Company owned stores and domestic franchise revenues declined due to lower same-store sales and domestic supply chain revenues declined due to lower volume, which was offset in part by higher revenues due to higher pass-through commodity costs. Our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenue decreased 0.8% in the second quarter versus the prior year period.  I will now cover operating margins for each of our three operating divisions. First, our international franchise business, which has no cost of sales, grew as a percentage of total revenue, thus improving our overall consolidated margin in the quarter. Second, our company owned store operating margin declined 3.9% from the prior year period. This cost accounted for about three-quarters of the decline, with labor and delivery costs accounting for the remainder. Third, our supply chain margins declined 0.1% from the prior year quarter.  Higher cheese prices in 2008 caused a 0.4% decline in the margins. This decline was offset in part by lower variable labor and operating efficiencies. Dollar margin was negatively impacted due to reduced volume from lower same-store sales and traffic declines. Turning to G&A expenses, G&A decreased $14.4 million or 29.6% in the quarter versus the prior year. $14.3 million of the decrease is nonrecurring, consisting of $6.9 million of gain on the sale of 27 stores sold, which I will discuss in a moment, a $5 million legal reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2007, and $2.4 million of recap expenses incurred during the second quarter of 2007. These details are also outlined in the items affecting comparability tables in the earnings release. G&A would have been flat in total dollars excluding these nonrecurring activities. We continue to aggressively manage G&A in this challenging environment.  As we have previously announced, we are in the process of selling approximately 60 company owned stores in California and Georgia. We sold 27 during second quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 56 stores. We recognized a net pre-tax gain of approximately $6.9 million as I just mentioned in the second quarter related to those store sales. The divestiture of these stores will not have a material impact on ongoing net income. Next, we’ll cover bottom line earnings. Our diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.32 or $0.22 when adjusted for items affecting comparability in the second quarter. These items affecting comparability are found in detail in the earnings release. This is a $0.06 decrease from the as-adjusted amount of $0.28 in 2007.  Our operating results negatively impacted us by $0.04 for the quarter. This is all driven by the lower domestic sales and traffic that we have experienced. Our share repurchase program benefited us by $0.02. Our recapitalization impacted the comparison by $0.03 due to increased interest expense. The recap was completed during the second quarter of 2007, making this the last quarter we will have comparability differences due to our debt structure. Our effective tax rate was 34.6% in the second quarter. We recorded approximately $1.7 million of tax reserve reversals related to certain state income tax matters. This reduced our effective rate for the quarter. However, as previously indicated, we do anticipate approximately a 40% normalized rate in the foreseeable future.  As stated in our earnings release, we repurchased approximately 753,000 shares of our common stock under the share repurchase program for $9.8 million during the quarter or $13.06 per share. Additionally, we repurchased 750,000 shares subsequent to the quarter on June 24 in a block trade for $11.50 per share or $8.6 million.  We will continue to be opportunistic buyers in the market as we believe the current traded prices are clearly below the long-term value of our stock. Including the most recent block trade, we have now completed 46% of our repurchase authorization.  Turning to our leverage, this quarter marks the one-year anniversary of our new capital structure. We have reviewed our capital structure in light of the current market conditions and the provisions outlined in the debt facilities, and we continue to be very comfortable with our debt level, which remains fixed for another four years and provides for two, one-year extension options. Given the uncertainty of today’s debt markets, we are likely to take advantage of the full six years this credit facility still affords us unless the debt markets change dramatically over the next several years. Now let’s look at our liquidity. As of the second quarter we had $37 million of unrestricted cash. In addition, we have a $150 million revolver, of which 35.6 is pledged in letters of credit against the revolver. This gives us $151.4 million of readily available cash.  In closing, despite a challenging year we have generated $36.6 million in free cash flow year-to-date. This clearly shows the resiliency of our business model. We have proven that we will utilize this in a manner that is most beneficial to our company and shareholders. I want to reiterate my commitment and enthusiasm with joining Domino’s. While this isn’t the most pleasant first financial update, I stand firm with the leadership team in our commitment to turn around the domestic side of our business and drive shareholder value. This concludes our financial update. I’d now like to turn it back over to Dave.
David A. Brandon:  We knew going into the second quarter that our domestic sales comparison would be more difficult than any other quarter in 2008 as this was the quarter where we had a strong positive sales result in 2007. Generally, in a top-line fashion during the quarter we experienced the following: First of all, continued economic pressure and weak sales on the domestic front - that’s pretty clear - the benefit of continued success internationally, which mitigated some of the domestic shortfall and provided strong growth, and last but not least, significant free cash flow generation, which has become a hallmark of our business model, which we use primarily for share repurchases during and subsequent to the quarter. Let me review some of the things that are happening relative to our domestic growth initiatives. Last quarter I spent considerable time sharing the specific details of the plans and initiatives we have underway to get our domestic business back into a more traditional growth mode. Rather than making excuses for our sales shortfall by whining about economic woes affecting the broader restaurant industry and high commodity costs, we just continue to work hard at everything we can control and we are making progress against these initiatives. First in the whole area of franchise store growth management, as you recall we divided our franchisees into three categories: The As and the Bs, which is the vast majority of our system who are feeling the pinch of today’s economic reality, are primarily strong operators who continue to run good viable, profitable businesses. And then we have the Fs, the bottom 14% who are dragging the system down through either bad operations, economic failure or both.  Now we’ve been taking corrective action with the Fs to either remove them from the system or get them back into acceptable shape. Of these 247 F franchisees, 114 of them have committed to fixing their stores, and we’re watching that process and managing that process carefully. Ninety-three are currently in the process of selling their stores and 40 of those have already been terminated or otherwise removed from the system.  Now for those who are committed to the future, we have accelerated our management store visits, we’ve put specific training programs in place, and we have taken very aggressive approaches to driving local marketing and local promotional event participation and execution. Additionally, we launched a national program in May addressing brand image, the physical appearance of our stores, and our overall retail presence and image.  We have made some improvements with the committed Fs, who we consider to be the Bs and As of tomorrow, by narrowing the gap between the Fs and the As and Bs both in terms of sales comps and service. Specifically, the sales gap has narrowed slightly in the last two months and service times have improved versus the full year 2007 among that group of franchisees. So we’re making progress.  As it relates to those we’ve dubbed exits, we’re working hard to create an extensive list of qualified high potential franchisees to take over those stores. We’re offering turnaround programs and incentives for A and B franchisees to buy those stores. A and B franchisees have purchased 88 of those stores, representing 32 F franchisees who have exited the system to date.  Now in the area of store growth, certainly it’s tough to drive robust domestic store growth during a time when we are attempting to improve our system by selling weaker stores to stronger owners. Many of our As and Bs are buying more than they are building right now and we believe that’s important for the long term. Even many of our strong operators are running negative sales comps in today’s difficult consumer environment so, needless to say, they are preserving capital and are being somewhat conservative and they’re less apt to take risks in this environment. That said, we’re still opening stores in what I consider to be a very lousy environment. In fact, we’ve opened 139 domestic stores in the last 12 months. Now, it’s likely we’ll end the year with a negative domestic store count versus last year and we think that looks like the possibility on the downside of somewhere between a net negative 50 to 70 stores and they would be our weaker stores, obviously, that would close. We’ve seen a recent slowing of store closures over the past few weeks which may indicate the rate of closures are slowing. Now we still expect to achieve our stated range of worldwide store growth of between 200 and 250 net new stores in 2008, so we’re still going to stay on track but obviously that mix will be much higher skewed in the international side of the business. Next I want to talk about our marketing initiatives, at least to the degree I’m prepared in this public setting. We continue to work on our pricing. We’ve implemented the barbell approach that we discussed with you at our last call last quarter. We’ve introduced the value platform with the $4 $4 $4 promotion, which as you recall is a ten-inch pizza at $4. We’re working on testing a line of premium pizzas that we’re excited about. We’re using our vast consumer database to test different price points and promotional packages, and we’re working to encourage more rational pricing practices throughout our franchise system.  I want to point out in this whole area of pricing we’re taking a very considered approach to this initiative and making sure that our moves here are strategic as opposed to knee-jerk because there’s a lot of sensational reports in the news about consumer behavior and cost inflation and we want to make sure that we’re being very, very strategic in the way we approach pricing. I want to talk about day part expansion. We’re putting more emphasis on our day part expansion strategy as we build our capability at the lunch hour. Over 85% of our stores are now open for lunch and we recently made this a standard for all of our U.S. stores.  As I mentioned earlier, we now have our ten-inch pizza offering which lends itself well to lunch both in terms of pricing and portion and we’re in test right now with a line of oven baked sandwiches and we’ll have more specific news to report on that initiative as we learn more. In the advertising area we continue to be confident in our choice of Crispin Porter and Bogusky as our agency of record. They’ve earned their reputation as one of the hottest agencies in the business today and we believe their talent and creativity is beyond repair and it’s a great fit and a great partnership as we work on the issues of the day. We’re continuing to learn from each other and develop our ad campaign using our core “You Got 30” messaging along with strong retail and product seams. I want to talk a minute about the new product pipeline. We’ve had a lot of activity happening in this area of our business. We understand that those in our broader competitive set who have grown domestic sales during the recent past have done so by offering new choices for consumers, both in terms of menu variety and day part. If we want those same customers to turn to us more often and create positive traffic in our stores again, we’ve got to do more in the area of menu variety and news. We are committed to our tradition of keeping our operations as simple as possible, to facilitate customer service performance that will reinforce our earned reputation as the Pizza Delivery Experts and we are being strategic about new products rather than creating a “product of the club month”. In addition to those things I’ve already mentioned, we have other pizza and non-pizza choices in various levels of test and could potentially make the main stage in the near future and we’ll be talking about more of that in greater detail later. Lastly in the area of marketing as it relates to our chief marketing officer search, we have an aggressive search underway for our new CMO and we’re happy to say that the Domino’s brand attracts some very strong candidates. We have those candidates in various stages of the interviewing and selection process and we’ll update you on this search as we find just the right fit. In the meantime, Patrick Doyle continues to lead our marketing efforts and initiatives and he’s doing a great job. In the area of technology I want to comment on Domino’s Pulse. We have a single point of sale in general management computer tool installed in the vast majority of our domestic stores. As we sit here today about 4,300 stores are equipped with this technology platform. It’s given us a great online ordering tool. It’s given us theft prevention, labor scheduling, operations tracking and training. It’s given us the opportunity to improve our service, have tighter inventory controls in our stores and provide a higher level of consumer and business intelligence for our marketing decisions and our business decisions.  Now that we’ve officially passed the mandated deadline for installation, we expect any of our franchisees who still don’t have Domino’s Pulse installed to quickly jump onboard and take advantage of this important technology advancement. We’re pleased that the vast majority of our franchisees have embraced the Pulse system and that we’re so close to full compliance by our deadline. We’ve recently received an important legal decision confirming our ability to mandate technology upgrades for our franchisees, validating our belief and the belief that we’ve had all along that one technology solution for all of our stores is a reasonable business requirement. We now just need to complete the installation of a few hundred stores who are not yet converted and then we will get the full benefit of this important competitive advantage for all of our stores. Let’s turn to international. As we mentioned in our press release our international division hit an important milestone this quarter as we celebrated their 25th year in business. Now with over 40% of our global retail sales and over 25% of our total operating income, our international division is larger than our second largest competitor. That would be Papa John’s. It’s larger than their entire business, both in terms of total stores and total global retail sales. It’s a big business. It started out in Canada and Australia back in 1983 and we now do business in 60 markets around the world with a strong track record of robust sales and store growth.  In fact, we’re continuing our quarterly same-store sales record by marking our 58th consecutive quarter positive same-store sales comp in 2008 Q2. Although I would characterize our international division as being positive in almost every country in which we do business, I’d like to call out a few of the particular success stories. We’ve recently signed a new master franchise agreement for Indonesia with a leading Indonesian company that has extensive retailing and marketing experience. They also have the Burger King and Starbucks brands in Indonesia and have a great track record. Their first store in Jakarta is going to open in August and several more could open this year. We’re excited about this new growth opportunity in Asia. We continue to do well in Europe, especially in France where we’re seeing double digit sales increases and exceptional store growth. The market has finally gotten to the critical mass necessary to advertise on television and that has really helped promote the brand. Although sales in France were doing great even before they went on TV, they will only get better with the visibility and awareness that is created by national advertising. Another strong performer continues to be India where we’ve already opened 22 stores year-to-date and expect to open over 50 for the full year. They should also hit the 200 store milestone mark in 2008. Their sales have been in the double digits due to the solid marketing efforts and exceptional operating strength of our master franchisee in that market.  I just want to talk for a minute about our recapitalization, our capital structure as Wendy mentioned earlier. We rolled over the first anniversary of our new capital structure at the beginning of the quarter and although we constantly evaluate various uses of free cash flow, this milestone caused us to take an even deeper dive into our balance sheet. Essentially the exercise simply reinforced for us that what we’ve always believed, our business models characteristics of strong and steady free cash flow even in the worst of times, I might add, once again indicates that a more leverage balanced sheet yields the best potential returns for our shareholders.  We’ve always said that our first use of cash would be to invest in the growth of our business and should a creative opportunity arise we would always have an open mind to it. However, our business only requires $20 million to $30 million in normalized CAPEX spending so it doesn’t take a large amount of our cash flow to service the ongoing growth needs of this business. We took a detailed look at share repurchases versus debt repayment and we continue to believe that, particularly in the low stock price levels where our stock is currently trading, share repurchase should remain a primary use of our cash.  Our continued buy backs in Q2 coupled with a large block trade, which Wendy referenced, which happened right after the end of the quarter, indicate our continued commitments to this program which is now nearly 50% completed through it’s $200 million authorization limit. Wendy also discussed our debt, and as you can see we continue to feel very comfortable with the amount of leverage our company has and our ability to work within the terms and covenants of our debt structure. In ending on the appropriate note that our investment profile is truly all about free cash flow, I’ll open it up for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joe Buckley – Bank of America.
Joseph Buckley – Bank of America: Are there advantages to having Pulse system wide? Is that an important [flexion] plan as you get there over the next couple of weeks or months or however long it will take?
David A. Brandon: Well, ultimately in terms of just the maintenance of one system, the training of one system and having 100% of our stores taking full advantage of one system, that’s all important, Joe, and we’re going to keep the pedal to the metal until the last store is wired. Having said that, once a store comes online they immediately get all that benefit so the vast majority of our system is getting full benefit from Pulse today and it will just get better as we wire the rest of the stores.
Joseph Buckley – Bank of America:  A question on the company store performance, company operated performance versus the franchise performance; again you’re markedly different markedly better at the company stores. Are there two or three or however many identifiable factors you can point to behind the performance of the company stores versus the franchise and then if there are, what’s being done to converge the two?
David A. Brandon:  Yes, it’s a great question and it’s the primary focus of this team and this company right now because, as you point out, our second quarter Team USA results was a 1.1%, but they were comping up against a positive 4.4% a year ago. The franchise system had a weaker comp a year ago and obviously struggled more during this period and that GAAP which is typically flipped the other way is the primary focus of our team. If I were to boil it down to, you know, three topics one would be just operations execution. We have not as a Team USA unit cut labor and tried to cut costs to the point where we have hurt the growth prospects of the business. We’re continuing to invest in marketing. We’re continuing to invest in labor which ultimately translates to a better service for our customers. Those fundamentals need to continue to be stressed and I, as I’ve said before I think many of our small operators when they got into this very kind of difficult circumstance to a large degree unchartered waters in terms of cost inflation, we took some short term measures that created difficulties in terms of customer count sales. The second thing I would point to is pricing. I don’t think there’s any question about the fact that centrally we’ve managed the pricing decisions in this environment in a highly centralized sophisticated fashion better than many of our independent operators have managed it at the local level and as you know we’ve put tools in place and we’re rolling out tools to address that to further try to bring rational pricing to our franchisees in some cases where the good news is they’ve maintained the margin they would like to have, the bad news is they’ve priced the product beyond where the customer’s willing to pay. And so pricing and that whole issue of making sure we have the right price out there would be the second thing that I would point to. And then the last thing is the power of technology and Team USA has the longest experience with Pulse. We’ve implemented it. It’s become, you know, the fabric of the operations of the store. It’s helped us in many areas not just order entry but reducing theft. It’s helped us tremendously in terms of speeding up our operations and providing better customer service. It’s helped us manage our labor more efficiently through the labor scheduler component and online ordering continues to be a very important growing segment of how customers want to order and we’ve been positioned to do that at a higher level and have outpaced the franchisees in that area because of our early adoption of Pulse. I could talk more about differences but I think those are three of the big ones and the ones we’re most focused on.
Operator:  Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers.
Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers:  First is on the commodities we saw briefly and further significant domestic COG pressure seems like an acceleration from 1Q yet it seems like sales trends stabilized from a comp perspective. Just wondering if you could talk about your outlook going forward for cheese and wheat and whatnot, wondering whether we could see a significant reduction [inaudible] in coming quarters. It seems like costs have moderated to a certain degree in terms of the public market. 
David A. Brandon:  Well from the last time that I spoke with you, we keep a ten year chart called the Domino’s Commodity Index which is a weighting of all the commodities that we buy to operate our business that translates to the store level and our ten year commodity index has continued to increase from the last time I whined about it and it’s been on a pretty steady trend so we’re in a situation where costs fundamentally continue to be significant. You know cheese during the recent past has gone back up to historically high levels. We have continued to have a lot of inflation pressure and here’s the way we’re approaching it. We’re approaching it from the standpoint that it’s never going to get better.  Our attitude is as opposed to sitting back and waiting for commodity prices to come down which we all fundamentally believe they will but when and how that happens is not something that we can necessarily get a lot of productive results from. What we’re going to do is focus on the cost structure that we have today, where do we need to go with our traffic and order counts and pricing strategies to make the kind of returns that we need to make at the store level to keep our franchisees happy and our corporate unit happy and that’s our focus. So it’s tough and everybody knows it’s tough and I’m sure everybody in my line of work is talking about how tough it is but we’re operating on the basis it’s going to be there for awhile and we’ve got to figure it out.
Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers:  If we were to assume at least cheese and wheat prices remain stable here would you not start to see [inaudible] to turning more favorable over the next quarter or two and see that index [inaudible] come down or?
David A. Brandon:  Yes, again I mean speculating on commodities which is a dangerous line of work for me to enter if commodity markets react and behave the way they should and the way they have historically, and I’m talking about for tens of years, at some point in time with the margin levels that for instance exist in wheat farmers are going to start planting a lot of wheat and you should see correction and my understanding is that some of the crop forecasts look that they’re may be some relief in sight in that particular area. Same thing with dairy and milk and the cheese commodity, we believe that there’s probably some relief out there but we’re not going to sit around wait for it.
Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers: Then just kind of on a different front, the industry revenue and cost pressures that you’ve talked about I believe in the past you’ve mentioned you’ve seen some independent store closures and I just wondered if you could talk about that and perhaps more just the rational versus irrational promotional environment by both your national peers and your independents.
David A. Brandon: Yes I wish I could be more crisp with an answer here. I can’t. We’re just going to have to let some time pass because the only monitor we really have is the share tracking that’s done by third parties in this industry and they’re directional at best. When you have an industry that’s comprised of nearly 70,000 retail outlets and the vast majority of them are private and small it’s very difficult to come up with some kind of a tracking that would be more of a CPG kind of a tracking where you have more specific numbers and you can identify trends quicker.  Our belief and it’s more anecdotal than it is statistical is that the pressure that’s happening out there is clearly creating closures. I mean we’re seeing a few of them and we’re stronger and we can buy cheaper and we’ve got a better brand and a 47 year track record. You know we’re in a position where we feel the pressure with our weaker operators. We can only conclude and we’re witnessing that same pressure translating in an even bigger way to a number of the smaller operators out there. But it’ll take a couple of quarters for that to show up in some of the data that we can share with you and certainly when it’s available we’ll be talking about it.
Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers: Lastly the ability to transfer ownership to these stronger franchisees that you’ve spoken about. Any impact from the credit markets or any trouble from the franchisee perspective or it seems to be going smoothly?
David A. Brandon: Well listen the credit markets are very, very tough. There’s no question about it. It’s not as easy to go out and obtain capital financing as it once was for all the reasons that we understand but having said that when you identify particularly our A franchisees and many of our B franchisees these are, to a large degree, franchisees who own their businesses, their stores are paid for. They are credit worthy. They have businesses that are generating cash and they’re also very smart business people and when they find somebody who’s in trouble that’s got a store that hasn’t been operated properly and they can buy that asset for $0.20, $0.30, $0.40 on the dollar in terms of replacement cost they’ll come up with a way to finance it. They’ll turn that store around and very quickly it’ll become a credo to their income statement.  So we’re seeing a lot of activity out there as I’ve already given you in very specific terms about how our franchisees are reacting and we continue to believe that good operators will find the capital they need to continue to build their business and we’re helping them in every way we can.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Glass – Morgan Stanley.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: David, you had mentioned there were roughly 247 of these F franchisees out there which I think is the same number you quoted last time so what’s the feasible time frame to get them to graduate from F’s to higher grades or is it 247 but the composition is different, some have come down and others have gone up?
David A. Brandon: Yes and we’re trying to keep this simple enough that people can understand it. It’s a little more of a dynamic process but what I will tell you is that the F franchisees that we’ve identified that were operating in an unacceptable fashion who have committed to us that they’re prepared to turn that around, they’re on a short leash. We are inspecting them regularly. We are micromanaging the operations of those stores. We’re going to protect the brand and we’re going to walk the talk and so we’re getting immediate feedback on whether these guys and gals are in fact stepping up their game as they promised they would and to the extent we determine that’s not the case we’ll have a different conversation. So it is a daily activity here.  Our area leaders and the folks that we have out in the marketplace are responsible for monitoring those situations carefully. We’ve seen some significant success stories, people who have turned it around and really have regained momentum and we’re pleased about that. We obviously need more of them but I like where we are today.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: In the closures this quarter you reported 43 closures I guess is similar to last quarter. Were those the terminations that you referenced and if that’s the case should we expect another 90 or so to come in the balance of the year or are these closures maybe voluntary closures?
David A. Brandon: First of all, it would be all of the above, the people that have basically been invited to leave and have chosen to leave. Certainly some of those stores that have not yet been re-sold reopened would be in that category. Those would also be people who have just financially failed in that territory that they had would now become available for us to re-franchise so that is the number.  If you look historically, we’re always going to have more closures in the first half of the year than we do the second half of the year. That certainly is the normal trend and although we’re not in normal times I would tell you that our sense of things as I mentioned earlier closures are somewhat on the decline. I think there’s more hope and optimism in our system right now with a variety of the initiatives we have under way and the traction that we’re starting to see from those and so I think the energy level is up a little bit and people are hanging in there in terms of wanting to participate in the next wave of growth that we all believe is out there waiting to happen for us.  I’m not one to give a lot of projections going forward but what I did mention is on a net basis, this is opens minus closes I believe the downside for calendar year 2008 is somewhere between a negative 50 to 70 stores domestically so to me that’s as bad as it gets. If we continue to slug it out in a really tough environment we could see on a net store basis domestically a negative 50 to 70 stores which as you know across the population of nearly 5,000 stores doesn’t make me happy but since those are our lowest volume and most troubled stores I also don’t look at that as a situation that’s intolerable. I also want to point out that we are ramping up our activity and doing a great job international and that’s why I feel confident saying we’re going to be able to hit that 200 to 250 net number even in light of the fact that we’ve got some struggles domestically.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: Wendy, you had mentioned that the distribution margin had improved and there was some pressure from cheese but you mentioned something else you had done related to labor. Is there something new this quarter, something program in place improved margins that they should stay above 10% from here on in?
Wendy Beck: We have gained some operating efficiencies on the transportation side and also labor as a percentage is lower due to the higher prices.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley:  And that took effect this quarter as it relates to transportation or is that something that’s been ongoing?
David A. Brandon: We’re basically ramping up that initiative. Frankly, we’re taking a look at some of our stores in terms of the number of deliveries that was required to service those stores appropriately. We’ve also played around and tested some formulations with our dough products, which is primarily the driver of the windows of use for our products and we’ve come up with some formulas that give us a little more room so we’ve done a good job. David Mounts and his team have done a very good job of coming up with some cost savings initiatives in supply chain particularly as it relates to transportation. There are other things they’re doing, but that’s one of the primary things and we feel comfortable that kind of the margins that we’re maintaining today are something that potentially we can sustain. 
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan
John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: As we are able to calculate G&A by segment those numbers actually look like they’re staying a little bit higher than I would have thought in the second quarter given some of your cost savings initiatives. Was that the case and maybe as you would be pulling back in other areas you’re investing in others, you know, to keep the G&A spending relatively healthy in the company?
David A. Brandon: We’re all looking at one another a little puzzled, John, so maybe that’s something we should talk about offline. 
John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: For example, even in domestic stores we kind of back into a G&A number by the way that you report your costs of goods sold and you report your DNA and you report operating and comp and that’s fine we can talk about that offline. Let me maybe with that same line of question how do you comment in terms of what your spending is at the field level, I mean for example on corporate stores if that’s something that we should see a noticeable decline in as you know are beginning to sell those 60 stores for example over the first half and also on the corporate side as well.
David A. Brandon: Well, advertising is obviously a big component of G&A so maybe when we have our conversation that’s going to be something that we’ll talk about. Selling those stores in California, you know, fundamentally what we’ve done is we’ve taken a market that we were performing pretty well in. We’ve franchised those stores. We will be collecting 5.5% royalty as opposed to the EBITDA that was being generated by those stores and the most significant issue for us financially over time is really not how that’s going to impact the income statement. It’s just going to be several dozen less stores for us to have to invest capital in because now that capital requirement will shift over to the franchisee. But also the marketing spend at the local level will shift with those stores. So that will create some noise in our financials that we’ll be talking about over the next few quarters because we’ve obviously reduced the size of that corporate store portfolio.
John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: I know and certainly I do remember last year there was some market-to-market accounting that actually helped your company’s store margins in the second quarter last year. I guess the cheese prices rose relative to where your hedges were and I think you did mention that as a [lap] that you were facing versus the first half in 2007. Is there a way to quantify what that meant to margins and how that may have contributed to some of the margin decline for company stores?
David A. Brandon:  Since Bill was in the saddle during that period I’m going to let him comment on that.
William E. Kapp: Yes, the number we reported the number it’s a $1.6 million benefit one year ago in Team USA or in corporate margins so the benefits of food costs, John, a year ago was the $1.6 million.
John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: Okay, and so that’s okay I mean that’s pretty big I mean it’s something like 170 basis points or so.
William E. Kapp: Yes, it’s a big number. Correct. Yes.
John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: Was that just a benefit I mean was there any benefits in the third quarters and the fourth quarters that we should be sensitive to?
William E. Kapp:  There was a small benefit in Q1 and a but the biggest mark-to-market occurred in Q2. So everything else no there’s no margin impact. There’s some nickels and dimes in Q3, but no margin impact there. So will return to normal run levels. Yes.
John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: Thank you and David Brandon you mentioned being very strategic on pricing and I just want to see if I can you know understand that now. Obviously you don’t want to take pricing to the extent that you run customers away but inflation expectations are clearly going up at the consumer level and one of your largest competitors was talking about taking pricing as well so I mean, could you kind of allow us to give us a little more color in terms of what you think the future direction of pricing would be at U.S. stores?
David A. Brandon:   First though everyone has to take pricing up. You know, I’ve been saying that for a year and everybody’s been taking pricing up if you look at all the data ticket ramp in this category has gone up significantly for all the reasons we understand. So that has happened and frankly will continue to happen if we continue to see the kind of cost pressures both in terms of minimum wage increases and their impact, gasoline prices at the pump and then all the commodities that drive our stores.  So we’re in a situation where we have a lot of cost pressure and so how do we react to it? When you have a category that’s driven by 85% deal pricing as we’ve discussed in the past that means that somebody in those local independent businesses is waking up every morning, every week, every month and deciding what they want to do with their pricing strategies. So we entered this, and this is a big learning for us and shame on us, I wish we could’ve gotten ahead of this curve, but what happened is our operators started getting pounded with these cost pressures coming at them at once in virtually every segment of their cost structure and it was a totally uncharacteristic environment for them.  It was unprecedented and so they began freelancing in terms of what do we do with our pricing to reflect the realities of today’s cost. And what we’ve done is we’ve gone back and looked at what they did and in many instances it was just irresponsibly done. Not that it was irresponsible to raise prices, but how we did it, where we did it, when we did it in many cases had a very debilitating impact on consumer reaction and ultimately in traffic in our stores. The best evidence of that, and we don’t share specifics in terms of traffic versus ticket trends in our business because we think it’s proprietary but I will tell you this, over the last two years what Team USA has done is fundamentally increase prices higher than the franchise system while at the same time experiencing a lower rate of traffic decline. And to me that means we’ve done a better job of increasing pricing where we can, how we can without it being at the expense as much as the expense of traffic whereas our franchisees, and I hate to use the world reckless because that’s pejorative and I’m not being pejorative. In many instances they’re just getting hit with cost increases everywhere and probably to a degree hitting the panic button. We start making these highly de-centralized pricing decisions and before you know it, we’ve taken value out of the product and out of the experience for our customers and our traffic goes away.  And so we’re going back and we’re fixing that and it’s all about promotional price points, bundling, menu pricing, it’s a lot of different moving parts but it’s an important initiative and it’s one that, as we get it right, we’re going to feel it in a better improved traffic performance among our franchise system.
John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: Okay, and it sounds like you’re even further along today than you were three months ago for example, and moving that along.
David A. Brandon: Absolutely.
John Ivankoe – J.P. Morgan: Is that something that would be noticeable at the store level? I mean are there franchisee, in other words at the franchisee level I mean, are they saying “Wow. We’re really pricing differently now than we were six months ago”, for example?
David A. Brandon: I think you’ve seen among our bigger operators the answer would be absolutely “yes” because they were the first ones to kind of get to this issue and they’re the first ones we go to. You know, we put tools together and we’ve got test markets in place with all kinds of pricing ideas in mind in terms of how we can approach different markets in different situations cause remember, you know, it’s not one size fits all out there and some markets were the clear market leader and pricing leader and other markets were weaker and those circumstances require a different set of strategies.  So I don’t want to go a lot deeper here because, frankly, there’s nothing more proprietary than our pricing strategies and what we have planned. I’ll just tell you this is a high area of intensity for us and there’s a lot of opportunity when we get it right.
Operator:  Your next question is a follow-up question from Joe Buckley – Bank of America.
Joseph Buckley – Bank of America:  I had a question on the marketing front. First I know you’re sponsoring the Batman movie and I guess I’m curious if you could talk a little bit about that and maybe past experiences with movies if you’ve done this before and then looking forward with the Olympics around the corner anything as much as you’re willing to discuss, any marking plans around the Olympics, you know, something there is high TV viewer ship.
David A. Brandon: First of all, the release of Batman. In my ten years here, if we did another movie I don’t remember it or if we did it was at a much smaller scale. We have not particularly been active in that space because it’s pretty risky. You have to make the commitment long before you know whether the movie’s any good or whether it’s going to sell any tickets, so we waited until the movie came along that we knew was going to be the biggest box-office hit of all time and then we decided to tie in with that.  No, actually we’re very lucky with Batman. We thought it was a good property and our friends at Crispin and our other promotional agency partners identified this as an opportunity and we felt good about the movie. Obviously it’s turned out to be something far more sensational than we could have ever predicted. We’re happy to be tying in with it. We have a really creative online opportunity for those zealots who love this movie and love the story and go online. You really need to visit The Vault and see kind of how we’ve translated our tie in with the movie to something that we think creates a lot of buzz in that community. We’ve got a commercial on the air with a special product and a special package. We’ve done, I think, a very nice job. I’m very proud of our marketing team for putting together a turnkey promotion with a consumer overlay in the form of a sweepstakes. A lot of PR buzz. Great online presence and something that works really well on TV and oh, by the way, we were really helped by the fact that the movie’s a big sensational hit. Having said all that, you’ll have to find out later how sales are going cause I can’t talk about that. As it relates to the Olympics, any time people are sitting in front of a television set, glued to things that are happening that’s good for our business. It’s good for pizza delivery and it’s good for Domino’s so as it relates to the Olympics without going any further in terms of any of our plans and programs during that timeframe, I can tell you we’re looking forward to it because usually that’s a great opportunity for us.
Joseph Buckley – Bank of America: Thank you. Will you have something, I mean not to throw it around necessarily, but will you be stepping up your promotional activities during that timeframe, is it fair to say?
David A. Brandon: We have a lot of news around the corner, Joe. That’s all I’m going to say.
Operator: There are no further questions, I would now like to send the conference back over to David A. Brandon.
David A. Brandon:  Listen, I just want to thank you for your time, all of you. I’m sure it’s tough listening to some of the recurring issues in our domestic business that we continue to work on. We’d always like these turnarounds to be faster than they are. It’s been tough for us, too, but if nothing else, I want you to know I’ve got a committed team here of passionate folks who are highly incentivized to work with me and work with our franchisees to get things turned around and add all of our domestic success that’s around the corner to what’s happening in our international business, fix what’s broken and be successful.  So we’re fast at work, hard at work and I’m going to look forward to talking to you at the end of the third quarter to give you an update on these initiatives and some of the other things that will be happening in our business. Thank you all for your attention today.

===== 2008 Q1  (2008-05-02 11:00:00) =====
Executives:  Lynn M. Liddle - Executive Vice President, Communications & Investor Relations David A. Brandon - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer & Domino’s Pizza LLC William E. Kapp - Interim Chief Financial Officer
Analysts: John Glass – Morgan Stanley Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns John Ivankoe – JP Morgan Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company Chris Sipple – Blue Lion Capital  
Operator:  Welcome everyone to the 2008 first quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Lynn Liddle, Executive Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. 
Lynn M. Liddle: Wed like to take a few extra minutes today to review some franchise statistics that we think are going to be helpful in understanding our current environment. I’d like to note though that these are taken from a large sample of P&L’s that are reported to us by our franchisees. They’re not included in our DPZ financials that were published in the 10-Q and released this morning.  As always I’m going to reference our Safe Harbor statement in our release in the event that any forward-looking statements are made and of course my last bit of housekeeping I ask that the media remain in a listen only mode.  With that I’ll turn it over to Domino’s Chairman and CEO, David Brandon.
David A. Brandon: My objective for this particular quarterly conference call is to give you our assessment of the current state of our domestic business and most important plans and initiatives we have under way to get this part of our business turned around a growing again. Normally I offer brief remarks as it relates to the bigger picture and then I turn things over to Bill Kapp, our Interim CFO, for a more detailed presentation of the financials.  For today, I’m going to switch things up and ask Bill to briefly take you through the key financial measures for this first quarter and then following his remarks I will do my best to achieve my objective for the call. And following my comments obviously we’ll be prepared to take your questions. So I’m going to introduce Bill Kapp, our Interim CFO.
William E. Kapp: As you will note from our earnings release we had several items that affected the comparability of our results to those of the first quarter last year. I’ll cover those shortly but first let’s start with the top line. We again ask that you remember revenues alone do not necessarily give you a complete picture and instead consider global retail sales as a clearer gauge of top line performance. Our global retail sales increased 5.6% for the first quarter driven primarily by same store sales growth in our international business and an increase in worldwide store counts of 247 units over the trailing four quarters. Same store sales, domestically our sales decreased 5.2% for the quarter. Company owned stores decreased 2.4% versus a +0.006 in Q1 2007 while franchise same store sales decreased 5.5% versus a – 3.4 in Q1 07.  International same store sales however increased 8.8% over last year’s +3.8%. As a result of our global retail sales our total revenues for the first quarter were $339 million a $300,000 decrease from last year. Domestic supply chain revenues declined due to lower volumes offset in part by higher revenues due to higher pass through commodity costs. Our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenues decreased 0.008 in the first quarter versus the prior year period 26% in Q1 08 versus 26.8 in Q1 ‘07. I’ll now cover our three operating divisions. First, our international franchise business which has no cost of sales grew as a percent of revenues thus improving our overall consolidated margin in the quarter. Second, our company store operating margin declined 2% from the prior year period. Food costs accounted for about one third of the decline, labor costs accounted for another third of the decline and the loss of fixed cost leverage accounted for the final portion.  Third, our supply chain margins declined 1.5%. 0.007 of that decline was due to higher cheese prices in 2008 and had no impact on dollar margins. The other 0.008 of margin decline was due to pass through costs of other non-cheese commodities such as wheat, boxes and fuel. This also had no impact on dollar margins. The entire dollar margin decline was due to reduced volume from lower same store sales and traffic declines.  Turning to G&A, G&A expenses decreased $1.7 million in the quarter versus the prior year. G&A benefited by a net $2.8 million due to the gain recognized on the sale of 29 stores offset in part by the separation expenses from our restructuring plan. G&A would have been up $1.2 million excluding those non-recurring activities. We are continuing to aggressively manage G&A in this challenging environment. As we had previously announced we are planning to sell a total of approximately 60 company owned stores by the end of the second quarter. These sales will not have a material impact on ongoing net income. Next, bottom line earnings, our diluted EPS as reported on a GAAP basis was $0.23 or $0.21 as adjusted for the first quarter. This is a $0.17 decrease from the as adjusted amount of $0.38 in 2007. Our recapitalization impacted the comparison by $0.14 due to increased interest expense. Our share repurchase program benefited us by $0.01. Our 40% tax rate hurt us by nearly $0.01 during the quarter. As previously indicated we anticipate a 39 to 40% rate in the foreseeable future. Our operating results impacted us by $0.04 for the quarter. This was all driven by lower domestic sales and traffic that we have experienced.  As stated in our earnings release we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of our common stock under our OMR program for $18.4 million during the quarter. Our OMR program was implemented during the second quarter of 2007 and we will continue to be opportunistic buyers in the market. We have now completed 36% of our repurchase authorization. Turning to leverage, during the quarter we repaid $15 million on our revolver and currently have no outstanding revolver borrowings. We continue to be very comfortable with our debt level which remains fixed for another four years.  This concludes the financial update. I’d now like to turn it over to Dave.
David A. Brandon: I want to thank Bill not only for that update but for his service as our Interim Chief Financial Officer over the past few months, post our decision to move David Mounts, our previous CFO into the position of Executive Vice President of our Supply Chain business and Bill has done a wonderful job.  I bring that up only to reinforce the fact that you will be hearing today an announcement that’s being made of the appointment of our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and that individual’s name is Wendy Beck. Wendy is a 15 year veteran of the food service business. Her most recent position was that of Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President and Treasurer of Whataburger Restaurants located in Corpus Christi, Texas.  Wendy comes to us a result of a very, very careful and deliberate national search that has been under way for the past several months and I couldn’t be more pleased to announce her appointment. The Leadership Council and I here at Domino’s Pizza are thrilled to have Wendy be joining us. She’ll be starting officially on the 19 of May and we look forward to her and her family relocating here to Ann Arbor, joining the team and adding a lot of value to our growth and our future. There’ll be more details as it relates to Wendy’s background in the press announcement that is going out virtually as we speak. What I’d like to do now is to provide a fairly detailed update as I promised I would on the state of our business and I really want to break that down into three key components. One is an assessment of our current views of economics of the domestic franchise stores and the overall financial strength of our system.  We get a lot of questions as it relates to how do the stores perform in the environment that we’re in and what is the financial stability of the system and I want to address that very specifically. Second is our domestic traffic problem and the aggressive plans we have in place to drive more traffic into our stores. That’s clearly our big issue right now and it’s one I want to address very specifically.  And then the third area I want to talk about is really a progress report on our efforts to upgrade our franchise system by identifying poor operators and facilitating their exit from the system and this is a topic that I brought up at our last call and I want to continue that conversation today. Let me summarize the situation regarding each of these areas of our business and provide you with some of the things we’re going to do to change the game for Domino’s Pizza. First, an assessment of the current economics of our domestic franchise stores and the financial strength of the system. We have gone through a process where we’ve rated our franchise system according to several factors including operational execution, local store marketing performance, the store image, sales results and the franchisee’s specific leadership and involvement in the business.  In evaluating our 2007 year end P&L that we receive from our franchisees we have learned that our A franchisees, and these are the franchisees that we have identified as being the 143 best operators in our system and they happen to represent 21% of our stores. They reported for 2007 average store level EBITDA margins of approximately 11%.  Now based on their average sales per store, these franchisees are receiving cash-on-cash returns of approximately 40% on the average cost of a new Domino’s pizza store and clearly for those who purchase the store below the new build cost and turned it around, their cash-on-cash returns are even greater than the 40%. This group of franchisees prove the strength of the Domino’s unit economic model even during difficult times. Clearly these franchisees wish the economics were even better as they could be but their businesses are very viable and very profitable. Our next segment of franchisees we call our B franchisees and this represents 830 good franchisees that represent 65% of our system and they’re working to get better. They reported store level EBITDA margins of approximately 9% in 2007. Now based on their average sales per store these franchisees reported receiving cash-on-cash returns of over 25% of the cost of the new store and like many of the A franchisees many of them paid less for a previously owned under performing store that they were able to turn around and the returns on those stores are clearly much higher.  Our B stores can greatly improve their returns by driving higher buying levels in their stores and we’re working with them to help make it happen. However, the cash-on-cash returns they are receiving are certainly strong enough to keep their businesses viable and keep them focused on getting better. Now we have identified 246 franchisees in our system that represent about 14% of our stores that we categorize them as F franchisees. They are currently failing themselves and our brand and our system. Their average reported store level EBITDA margins in 2007 were approximately 6%. Based on their average reported sales per store this group of franchisees are still receiving over 15% cash-n-cash returns.  Now understanding these numbers are averages of those franchisees I can tell you that there are some franchisees in this category who are failing financially, there’s no question about that. But as I will cover in greater detail in a few minutes we believe that approximately 50% of these F franchisees are interested in recommitting to fixing their businesses and remaining Dominos franchisees and we intend to give them that opportunity. The other 50% will be attempting to sell their stores and they will be exiting the system, and again I’ll get into that in a little bit more detail later. I think another area that’s important to focus on as it relates to the viability and the strength of our system even during these tough times is the area of store growth. As you all know in 2007 we were not able to drive strong domestic store growth as a result of the weaker returns across our system and the economic pressure that was a result of weak sales in a high cost environment. However it’s also important to consider the fact that we grew, and I want to underscore that, we grew our domestic system by a net of 12 stores during the year. In other words, despite the difficult times we opened a few more stores than were closed during the year. Now in the first quarter of 2008 our domestic unit economic model continues to be under pressure, there’s no question about that. Our costs are actually higher than they were a year ago. However I believe the specific numbers I’ve shared with you today will bring comfort to anyone concerned about the viability of our franchise system or our franchising model and whether we have any material risk of a vast number of store closures in the current environment. We believe we do not. I plan to discuss the aggressive activities we have underway to address the F franchisees in our system. Suffice to say there will be some shirring over the next couple years as we facilitate changes in ownership of many stores and we have invite franchisees that are not doing an appropriate job of representing our brand to leave the system. Let me shift over to the next point and that is our domestic traffic problem. We have a distinct advantage over other food retailers because we have a record of who our customers are. We know them by name, by address and their phone number. I recently appointed a cross functional team here at Dominos and tasked them with the duty of attempting to learn as much as we could about the traffic declines we’ve experienced over the past couple of years, not only just at our company but in the category overall.  We’ve also leveraged the experience and input of many of our A franchisees. We have consulted with important leaders from our franchise organization including those who sever on the advisory boards that we utilize to provide input and direction when we made decisions impacting the system overall. And we have a very important summit coming up in a couple of weeks as we will host a combined session of all of our advisory boards to further gain franchisee knowledge and input and although there have been no filter bullets coming out of any of the work we’ve done so far, nor did we expect any, we have confirmed some important factors and trends that will guide us as we continue to address the traffic problems facing our category and company. We increased our delivery prices by nearly 10% in 2007. This dramatic price increase had the most detrimental impact on the purchasing habits of our single pie, low ticket delivery customers. We have chased many of them away and we need to get them back. We believe a value platform is now a requirement in our category and we will utilize our new 10 inch pizza product that’s currently being launched nationally with our $4 $4 $4 promotion that hopefully you have all seen on television to provide our value customers an alternative. We also need to expand our growth into the lunch and late night day parts. We are not taking advantage of growth trends in these day parts and we need to do so if we want to grow sales in the current environment. We will be testing new products, new packaging and new price points to better position ourselves to pursue these opportunities. We will also be requiring all of our operators to adhere to expanded store hours to ensure that all of our stores are open for lunch and we will adjust the closing hours of stores where necessary to compete for customers interested in both delivery and carryout during these important parts of the day. We also want to offer a value platform as I mentioned before but we also know that we have many customers who will pay for who enjoy a more premium priced pizza product so we’ll be exploring the possibility of launching a specialty line of higher end pizzas to complement our menu in the month ahead. Team USA has out performed our franchise system over the past two years for a number of reasons. However one of the major reasons that we’ve identified has been their more disciplined approach to pricing our products. Our analysis team found many instances of franchisees offering prices to customers that were inconsistent including some selling policies that had the net effect of down selling and other pricing policies that severely penalized customers for paying menu prices for our products. We have developed a pricing model we will be sharing with our franchisees which is designed to help guide them to more rational sensible pricing that will maximize sales margin and overall customer satisfaction. Finally we know that our A franchisees experienced positive same store sales growth in 2007. We know that our B franchisees experienced negative same store sales but their average unit sales were still high enough to create very acceptable financial returns. Our F franchisees reported their sales in 2007 as $4,300 lower per week than our A franchisees. As their same store sales were nearly 6% negative which is over three times more negative than the average of our entire domestic system in 2007. This demonstrates the opportunity for us to create a stronger organization and better results through better operators and better operations. As we transition stores from F franchisees to A and B operators we expect to see positive change. We’ve launched an aggressive franchisee recruiting program designed to help us carefully select both internal and external franchise candidates. We’re hosting what we call Discovery Days every month here in Ann Arbor and we plan to create a strong pipeline of franchise candidates to help us replace some of those F’s with candidates who will bring new energy, new investment and new commitment to our brand and system. The third area I want to touch upon as it relates to our domestic business is a progress report on our effort to upgrade our franchise system and I plan to be very specific. As I indicated earlier we have identified 246 F categorized franchisees in our system. We have had very direct discussions with all of these franchisees and we’ve reached agreements with 127 of them to sell their stores and leave the system.  We are currently engaged in this process and we’ve already removed 22 of our F rated franchisees from our domestic system. This number will continuously grow as we move through the second half of 2008 and into 2009. The rest of the franchisees currently rated F have recommitted themselves both personally and financially to their business and we plan to watch them closely.  We hope many will move into the B level or better in the near future and those who can’t or won’t, will be added to the list of franchisees leaving our system. We will be compassionate with those who demonstrate a sincere desire to fix what is broken quickly and pull them out of the F category. We will not be patient with any of those who don’t make immediate improvements in their store operations. I want to point out that our 830 B franchisees are a source of great opportunity. The more of them we can develop into A performers the stronger our system will be and the better we can withstand the economic pressures we are currently facing. We will be offering more training and development programs to this group than we ever have in an effort to better support them and help them perform at a higher level. Before I end my remarks regarding the status of our domestic business, and I apologize this is taking longer than I normally do, but I think these points are very important, I want to make a couple of things very clear. With the advantage of 20/20 hindsight I want to openly admit to some mistakes that we have made that have contributed to the difficulties we have had during this period of surging costs, rising prices and consumers’ reluctance to spend particularly at the dinner day part. First, we were slow to recognize the impact of our continuously increasing average ticket prices and the impact they were having on our traffic. We lost a lot of momentum in 2006 while we were still trying to push higher ticket growth when we should have been doing more to address the traffic issue. This caused us to enter the severe economic downturn in 2007 with no sales momentum and it made us even more vulnerable to continued traffic losses.  Second, as the value entry in the pizza delivery category we should not have pushed our prices as high and as fast as we did during 2007 and early 2008. We’re known for value and convenience and we lost many customers who felt we forgot them as we were adding delivery charges, menu price increases and higher promotional prices during a time when our customers were really being frustrated by higher gasoline and food prices.  Third, we allowed some of our franchisees to get complacent. After 12 consecutive years without a negative same store sales year we did not recognize and react as quickly as we should have to the number of franchisees who decided to put their businesses on auto pilot both in terms of their effort and their investment  Fourth, our company and truthfully the pizza category overall has in the recent past viewed menu innovations as primarily offering different topping combinations and catchy names on special pizzas but not really truly innovating. We need to take innovation to a higher level. We need product innovation that will broaden our menu, create more choices, penetrate more day parts and leverage technology in a way that is far more than just accepting orders online. You will see a vast number of new innovative products and initiatives from Dominos Pizza in the months and quarters ahead all intended to take a category that has been sleepy and wake it up. Now I’ve given you a fairly in depth view of the domestic business. I want to just briefly switch gears and highlight our international business which continues to do an extraordinarily fine job. Retail sales in our international division has been growing overall at a 17% compound annual growth rate for the past four years. Our top 10 markets have grown at a rate almost equal to the overall with a 16% kegger during that time while our middle tier markets have seen growth of 27% during the same period. So while we still have significant growth left in our top 10 markets we have vast growth potential in those middle markets as demonstrated by our recent results.  The top 10 markets include those we’ve spoken a lot about in the past, the UK, Mexico and Australia but also include India, France and recently Turkey who has now made the top 10. The second tier markets include up and comers such as The Netherlands, Brazil, the Middle East and Malaysia markets we haven’t highlighted much but that have shown tremendous potential for the future of our business. Meanwhile we still have approximately 2,400 stores to build in just our top 10 markets alone with room to double or triple the store count potential in a number of those markets. Store counts in international has grown at roughly an 8% compound growth rate over the past four years and same store sales have grown at a rate of 6% during the same period of time. The international division was only 18% of Dominos operating profits four years ago and by 2007 it was nearly 30% of our operating profit. Based on their continued growth trends the contribution of our international growth engine to our overall business results will continue to increase and we’re very pleased and proud with the work that they’re doing. And a reminder our model of growing through master franchise agreements enables us to attain great geographic expansion with very little investment again driving our pre-cash flow business model. I’ve given you a lot of facts and figures to digest here and I understand that, but I hope it’s been helpful and what I’d like to do now is open up the call and take questions from any of you who may want to ask them.
Operator:  (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Glass - Morgan Stanley.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: David, first question is how do you facilitate the transition of the F stores to new ownership? Does the company need to be an intermediary or can you do that directly? I may have missed this but how many F stores are there? I think you said how many F franchisees there were but I didn’t catch how many actual stores this represents?
David A. Brandon: 600 stores are total F’s, the F’s represent, as I recall, 14%. We’ll look that up to make sure we give you the right number. The situation is really the facilitating of the sale. Our franchise agreement affords the company the ability to have the first right of refusal on the sale of any store so we’re actively involved in those transactions, from the moment the operator decides to sell and until ultimately we decide whether we want to purchase the store. And we also have the right to approve whoever does purchase the store.  So we’re in the middle of those transactions and we can make sure that we’re facilitating the ownership of that store to the appropriate new owner who will hopefully take it and operate it at a higher level. The number of F franchisees that we have is 246, we indicated that that’s 14% of our stores which is 633 stores. About half of those F franchisees we’ve identified as people that we truly believe can get things turned around. The other half are the ones that will be exiting.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: Just to clarify does facilitate mean you buy and resell or are you a broker?
David A. Brandon: It is not our intention to purchase these stores, it is our intention to broker these to A and B franchisees and any of our new external franchisee candidates that we feel are capable of taking those stores over and investing in them appropriately and operating them appropriately.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: One more, in you’re talking about value, can you provide some context about what has happened to your average check over the last couple of years and you said the delivery costs, but could you run that and how have you worked up the average check over the last few years? When you think about value are you going to do a high-low approach to hope to keep the average check about steady but provide a value alternative or are you actually thinking that you need to lower your average check?
David A. Brandon: In the delivery customer which is our most important customer obviously 15 to 20% of our business is carry out and it’s a little bit of a different scenario but as we focus on our delivery customer the ticket increased approximately 10% in 2007. If you were to go back and include 2006 and before the advent of delivery charges and some increased inflationary pressure you would see that over the past two to three years that ticket has probably gone up more to the tune of 15 to 20% and that’s including the delivery charge as part of what’s happened in our business.  We believe that the barbell strategy is an appropriate one for us. The launching of the 10 inch pizza, if you will, the $4 pizza which is currently being launched as the $4 $4 $4 promotion affords us the ability to truly provide alternatives to those customers much like you’ve seen in other categories who are looking for a much smaller ticket opportunity to participate in the brands. And we also believe as I indicated that parallel with that to continue to be out there developing a more premium line, premium price pizza line is a good strategy for us because we know based on our analysis there are many of our customers who enjoy that product and they’re certainly not as price sensitive.
John Glass – Morgan Stanley: But you’re doing the value promotion now and I presume it will take some time to develop those premium products? Or are they closer in?
David A. Brandon: That’s exactly right. We have two or three of those product platforms already built as a result of limited time only promotions that we’ve had that have done very well and so you may see some of those resurrected as part of the premium platform line but we also have others that will be going into test that will round out that line. When and how that all evolves it’s to be determined but we’re pretty excited about the prospects.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns.
Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns: You ran through the cash-on-cash returns that franchisees are getting but how leveraged are the franchisees? What coverage ratios are those groups of stores showing?
David A. Brandon: Joe, when you understand the composition of our franchise system is that the average operator owns three to three and a half stores. That’s the average and we only have a handful of franchisees that own over 50 stores as opposed to having major corporations who are going out and doing refinancing deals with high levels of leverage we’re dealing with a lot of owners who own their businesses outright, many of whom have long since paid for their stores. So we do not believe that we are in a situation where we have a lot of exposure to highly leveraged franchisees.  The diversification of our portfolio of franchisees, if you will, really reduces that risk. Do we have certain franchisees out there that have run up their borrowings and they’re more at risk? Certainly we do in this environment but not to a material degree.
Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns: A number of this season’s conference calls people have talked about how hard it is to sell restaurants and get financing for restaurant deals, are you helping the buyers of some of those F stores in any way to raise cash for the deals?
David A. Brandon: We have relationships that are long standing with financing organizations that we certainly enjoy working with and have the ability to facilitate their involvement in some of these transactions. We don’t like to be the bank in these transactions so it’s rare for us to get involved in any a financing way but we’re certainly helpful in helping put the transaction together to bring financing to the table.  Joe, you’re absolutely right in today’s environment, it’s tougher than it’s been in a long, long time so we have to work a little harder and in some cases there’s probably more of a premium paid for some of the financing. But one of the advantages that we have versus a lot of people you’re talking to is that the average new store build for us is $175,000. When some of these failing stores are sold in a failing mode, the price tags for these stores can be less than $100,000.  So the financing challenge is very different than if you’re out there talking about a burger concept or something where the original store cost is $1.5 million and there’s big real estate and big leverage on the property.
Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns: Just one more, the extended hour opportunity, how significant is that? Can you give us some sense of what percent of the system might not be open for lunch currently or maybe the late night opportunity?
David A. Brandon: I can tell you that we have been a concept that for a long time has really been focused on the dinner day part almost obsessively and up until the not too recent past we’ve had a significant number of stores that weren’t even open until the middle of the afternoon. We’ve worked on that hard. We’re to a point now where about 85% of the domestic system is open for lunch but I will tell you that in some cases that’s a relatively recent development. We still have many stores to get open for lunch.  We also have the same issue with the late night. We’re traditionally known as a food alternative that stays open really late on the weekends but in many cases we’re been closing down too early during the week. We know that 40% of America is working less than what would be considered to be traditional hours and so we see that in all of the different concepts where for instance the burger guys who are staying open for 24 hours a day, people who are extending their hours, there’s benefit from that because there are people who want to eat at those times that previously were considered fringe, now they’re becoming more mainstream.  We want to get in that game both in terms of hours of operation and in terms of menu and price point and packaging because those are all related and that’s a big commitment that we’re making and it’s something that the system will be getting benefit from in the months and years ahead.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe - JP Morgan.
John Ivankoe – JP Morgan: One thing that I noticed in the release was that company store margins were actually higher than I expected given the comp and the higher cheese prices and distribution revenue was actually a lot lower. Was any of that a function of the cheese hedges that you had in place or perhaps had in place in the first quarter?
David A. Brandon: No. No. There was no cheese hedge year-over-year in place at all.
John Ivankoe – JP Morgan: Moving on from that and again given the distribution revenue, was there any forgiveness or perhaps price control that was given to the franchisees in the distribution segment that was unusual in the first quarter relative to previous quarters?
David A. Brandon: No. The revenue declines in distribution were simply volume offset by higher commodity pricing. The cheese contract that we put in mid-year, John, mitigated a little bit of that cheese difference, $1.33 block a year ago versus a $1.93 block this year. We didn’t see that entire amount due to the new pricing on the cheese but there was nothing going on. Our distribution model stayed true to what it has always been.
John Ivankoe – JP Morgan: Am I right that this is the quarter, the first quarter that you passed on the higher wheat prices, the flour prices, to the franchisees through the distribution segment?
David A. Brandon: Yes, we did and we stepped that up actually. We took a significant jump right at the beginning of the year and then we stepped it up during the quarter again. We blended that increase so that it didn’t happen all at once. But yes, this is the quarter where we basically passed on the impact of the wheat increases on our dough prices.
John Ivankoe – JP Morgan: Continuing on this line of questioning, obviously company store economics are challenged, franchise store economics are challenged. Of course I understand that half of the distribution segment profit is given back to the franchisees in terms of the rebate, but are franchisees really calling for more at this point? Are they calling for better pricing terms in 2008 and 2009 and if so is that something that you would consider?
David A. Brandon: No. We’re constantly through our distribution advisory board and our general communications with our franchisees, we’re constantly benchmarking our distribution prices against the other concepts out there. It’s not hard for us to find out what the other people in the pizza delivery business are charging their franchisees and operators at the store level.  So we’re benchmarking against that and we have specific objectives in terms of the competitiveness of our pricing and the fact that we have the profit sharing agreements that affords our operators to participate in the efficiencies and success of those organizations is helping us a great deal because as we’ve looked at things about product engineering, as we’ve looked at delivery frequency, some of the efficiency initiatives that David Mounts has put in place with our supply chain business our franchises have been very receptive because obviously it helps their economics and it makes their profit sharing checks larger.
John Ivankoe – JP Morgan: One thing that you’ve identified in terms of call it the difference between the A, B and the F franchisees is pricing, its menu pricing and how they have managed their menu in terms of what’s being offered to customers at what price. Is there anything else, any specific or even very few factors that you can point to that can say if the F franchisee can, whether it’s delivery times or answering the phones or it’s cleanliness of the restaurant, what have you.  Are there a few factors that you can focus on or that you can identify that can make an F franchisee perform in line with the average or is it just an overall things need to be better across the board effort?
David A. Brandon: I think you’ve highlighted a lot of the key factors, John. It’s really a situation of whether you’re in the game or not and frankly we have some franchisees who are a victim of their own success. Over the past many years they’ve done very well, they’ve very good money, good returns, they become more distanced from their business and one thing I can tell you is we’re in an environment right now where if you want to be successful you have to work harder and operate better and bring more leadership focus to your business than ever before.  There is nothing about the business right now that comes easy either on the sales side or the cost management side and if you delegate to people who you either cannot trust or people who are not prepared for the challenge of that, you’re going to pay the price. Generally speaking if you want to come up with one characterization of our F franchisees, they’re not engaged in their business at the level they need to be to afford those stores the ability to be successful.  It manifests itself in stores that are below image standards, that are operating and providing poor service to customers, that are providing inconsistent products, all the things that are detrimental to your business and it shows up in their sales results, it shows up in their margins and it shows up in their cash-on-cash returns.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers.
Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers: Just a follow up on the day part expansion, I know you said late night and lunch. I’m just curious whether this is focused on the traditional pizza product or can you give any type of more qualitative color in terms of other products that might be tested during either of those day parts?
David A. Brandon: We think that our pizza product works really well in both day parts particularly when we start coming up with a smaller portion size at a lower price point. We plan on selling a lot of pizza at lunch and we plan on selling a lot of pizza at late night day parts. I will also tell you that we have test platforms in place for other products other than pizza which we think will complement pizza and afford us the ability to be offering more choice in both of those day parts to customers who are looking for choice.
Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers: In the stores that have done this expanded hours, the stores in test, can you give some color in terms of the incremental traffic or some of the benefits that they’re seeing?
David A. Brandon: I think the best illustration is Team USA. They got on the lunch bandwagon quicker and faster than we were able to coax our franchisees in many cases and one of the reasons that we would attribute their out-performance of the franchise system would be their commitment to lunch. It’s one of those day parts where when you haven’t been in lunch in many cases for years and years when you first put that Open sign out, you’re not going to get an avalanche of business because it takes a while to create awareness that you’re in that day part and that you’re open.  What we found is if you have the perseverance to stick in there and market hard and commit to lunch and make sure your customers know you’re committed to lunch, then over time we can build a very, very significant business. That’s what we’ve done with Team USA and that’s what we plan on leading with the rest of the system.
Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers: You mentioned more the value focus, I know you have the three pies for $4 each, just wondering in terms of profitability if some of these promotions and targeting that lower end consumer, obviously you’ve increased delivery charges and prices to offset margin pressures at least in this high cost environment the profitability at the expense of driving higher traffic and comps?
David A. Brandon: Without question the food costs of an offer like a $4 $4 $4 is higher than other promotional offers we may have launched in the recent past, it’s still within an acceptable range. Our operators still enjoy selling that three 10 inch pizza, one toppings because it provides us great opportunity to up sell. Every topping that we can add to one of those pizzas becomes an up sell opportunity. There’s a lot of other things that we can do to try to take that core $12 ticket and move it up.  It’s a platform that works well for us and frankly our focus right now is and has to be traffic. I suppose in an ideal world we’d have one customer a week or one customer a year that we’d sell a $1 million pizza to but the reality is we need to get into the business of driving traffic, creating trial and getting momentum in our store and to the extent the value platform will help us do that we think overall that’s going to be to the benefit of our operators both in terms of traffic and sales but also in terms of profitability.
Jeffrey Bernstein – Lehman Brothers: I believe I’ve heard you make comment or perhaps it was last quarter in terms of strategies on leverage and why you don’t think it’s a near term concern in terms of the interest only payments, you would potentially willing to pay down some debt earlier if the opportunity presented itself. I’m just wondering if you can give an update on that? Is that something you are perhaps pursuing?
David A. Brandon: We continue to evaluate our capital structure and the capital markets and we continue to look at our stock price and we continue to look at the free cash that’s coming out of the business and the Board of Directors and those of us in leadership roles at the company will continue to watch that very carefully and make prudent decisions for the betterment of our shareholders.  As it stands today based on the 6% fixed debt that we have and the runway that we have ahead and the amount of cash that the business is still generating obviously we still believe the best deployment of that capital is in the form of stock repurchase and we’re pleased to do that. If we get to a point where we feel differently we obviously have the flexibility of making that shift. For right now we think that’s the best value in town. We’re going to continue to use our free cash in that way.
Operator: Your next question comes from Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: My first question is given an outlook where you’re rebuilding perception around value but also building awareness around the specialty products and extended hours of operation, what’s the forward marketing strategy going to look like?
David A. Brandon: The core marketing strategy?
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: The forward marketing strategy it seems to be that you’d be changing some of the way you market to your customers and who you market to.
David A. Brandon: I think that you’ll see a lot of news being generated as a result of the things that I’m talking about, new product platforms, new things on the menu that will not only add value to some of the day part expansion but will also be exciting to some of our regular customers at dinnertime. I think to launch a value platform concurrently with the fact that we’re working on a premium pizza line affords us a lot of news generation and in the low traffic world that we’re in right now news is important.  Anything that cuts through and allows the customer to reconsider you as an alternative, I think is a positive thing. So our marketing calendar will be busy with news, new topics, new products and a lot of things that we hope will generate some excitement not only for the brand, but for the category.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: So we can expect to see some of the specialty platform integrate into the marketing strategy sooner than later?
David A. Brandon: Yes. We have a lot of test markets that are under way and obviously we’ll be setting priorities for national windows based on the results of those tests. But we have a lot of things in the hopper right now that I think you‘re going to be seeing a lot of in our commercials as we go into the latter part of this year and certainly into 2009.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: Will you look to offset value messages with specialty product messages or rotate them or how do you envision that working?
David A. Brandon: We think the people who have done this the best are out there with concurrent messages that are really appealing to a broader section of customers. We don’t want to just be the value pizza, we also want to take care of those customers who are less price sensitive and more into premium products. To do that you’re going to have to balance that spend and that marketing message both with your television and your print and your menus to communicate to both those customer segments that we’ve got something that’s attractive to them.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: And when from an hours of operation standpoint do you think you’ll be able to start marketing system wide late night and lunch?
David A. Brandon: Our hope would be that if a couple of the test platforms that we’ve got under way right now work out as well as preliminarily they seem to be working we’ll be able to put a major marketing push behind lunch, and I don’t want to tip our hand here but, in the fairly near future.  We think one of the ways to get all of our stores open and to really get a lot of energy behind that is not only the introduction of our 10 inch pizza product which is a really nice platform for lunch, but also to launch that concurrent with other entrees and products that will create even more excitement around that day part. I really don’t want to go any further other than that to let you know that’s one of those things that we’re working on long and fast.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: Just one other financial question, the $8.2 million that showed up on the cash flow statement, was that the total proceeds from the company owned store sales?
William E. Kapp: A portion of it was that and a portion of it was due to selling of pulse systems during the first quarter as well.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: Can you give us the number that was actually the proceeds from the sale of the stores?
William E. Kapp: $6.4 million were the cash proceeds from the sale of the stores in Q1.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: From 29 stores?
William E. Kapp: Yes.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: That’s the total amount that you’re going to receive for the sale of those stores or is there some deferred payment or something?
William E. Kapp: That’s pretty much all of it.
Operator: Your last question comes from Chris Sipple – Blue Lion Capital.
Chris Sipple – Blue Lion Capital: Can you talk about the 41 franchise stores that close din the quarter and were those part of the F group or were they parts of other groups?
David A. Brandon: The 41 stores that closed a high percentage of those would have been F operators, some of those stores will be permanently closed but some of those stores will likely be re-opened by other operators.
Chris Sipple – Blue Lion Capital: In the future as you cull the F portion of the herd, if you want to use those terms, how many stores will be closed versus successfully sold to better operators?
David A. Brandon: That’s a really tough number to give you specifically. I would tell you that last year we began this process although not as vigorously as we are currently engaged and as I already reported to you we were able to open a few more stores than we closed. I think in the environment we’re operating in in 2008 if we were to get to the end of the year and be anywhere near close to break even in terms of having the number of closures equal the number of opens I would view that in the current environment as a pretty successful outcome.  There’s always a chance that we could end up with 20 or 30 net closes in an environment that we’re in. We could always catch a break depending on sales trends and activity in the second half where maybe we could get a more robust growth plan put together so I want to give myself some wiggle room there but we do not see any material impact in terms of store closures in 2008 versus what you’ve grown to expect from us.
Chris Sipple – Blue Lion Capital: What was the foreign exchange gain in the quarter?
William E. Kapp: The foreign exchange gain for the quarter for royalty income was about $850,000.
Chris Sipple – Blue Lion Capital: And there was none for the company owned stores internationally?
David A. Brandon: We don’t have any company owned stores internationally.
Chris Sipple – Blue Lion Capital: They’re all franchise?
David A. Brandon: Correct.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. 
David A. Brandon: I just want to quickly summarize I hope today has been able to demonstrate to you the strength of our franchise model particularly during times of challenge and duress, but we know full well the real proof is in the free cash flow that this business continues to generate. Despite the tough times as you all know we generated nearly $17 million of free cash flow during the quarter.  We deployed it continuously into our share repurchase program. We’re at about 36% of our open market authorization that we’ve received from our Board and we continue to operate against that authorization. I like the things that are happening in our business in terms of change. We continue to operate in a pretty ugly environment but nevertheless we continue to keep our feet moving and I’ll look forward to telling you more about how we’re progressing in a few months. Thank you all for your time and attention today.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Carmen and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter and year end earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Miss Lynn Liddle, Executive Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.
Lynn M. Liddle: Thank you everybody for joining us today. We’ll spend just about an hour on the call and we’ll open up with some general comments about the quarter and the year and then we will open it up for Q&A. A couple of housekeeping reminders, we generally don’t make a lot of forward-looking statements but to the extent that we do, I will refer you to the Safe Harbor statement that’s in our press release and then I would also ask the members of the media to be in a listen-only mode. With that I would first like to introduce our CEO, David Brandon who will have a few comments followed by Bill Kapp, our Interim CFO.
David A. Brandon: Good morning everyone and thank you for participating in our fourth quarter and year end 2007 earnings call. I’m not going to take much time this morning to review the macro economic environment in our domestic market. I don’t think I could add anything new or different to what is already being widely reported. The US economy looks weak and consumers are clearly reining in their spending and as you’ve heard from me and others food costs, particularly the commodities that we rely on in the pizza business continue to be extraordinarily high. All of this is real and we continue to navigate our way through it along with many other retailers and restaurant companies. So instead of focusing on those things we can’t control and/or certainly making excuses based on these external factors, I’m going to briefly discuss those things we’re doing to positively impact the things we can control and steps that can make a significant difference in our overall performance. Our focus is primarily on improving our domestic franchisee sales and returning them to our historic run rate of growing 1 to 3% annually. Two years of negative domestic franchisee comps isn’t acceptable to and it isn’t acceptable to most of the franchisees in our system and the fact that our Team USA stores have done a significantly better job is of little consolation. Franchisee performance drives the performance of our entire domestic system and the interests of our shareholders, our franchisees and our team members are closely aligned. Nobody wins until we get our domestic franchisee sales moving in a positive, consistent direction. A couple of points to build on that, first of all after adjusting for our $13.50 dividend, the special dividend that we paid to our shareholders middle of 2007 our share price at the year end 2007 was down about 4.5% from where it ended 2006. We believe our domestic franchisees’ weak comps during 2007 have contributed to this loss of positive momentum in our stock price and we know that our shareholders need and expect to do better than that. Our domestic franchisees cannot increase their profits in the current high cost environment particularly without achieving positive same store sales. Most of our franchisees will have experienced a profit decline in 2007 and certainly our franchises need and expect to do better than that. Finally my team and I cannot gain benefit from any of our incentive plans without achieving positive sales growth in our domestic system. Based on the shortfalls we experienced in our 2007 domestic franchisees’ same store sales and store growth and the resulting loss of volume through our supply chain business no bonus checks were distributed under our TAD annual incentive plan and like our shareholders, we too suffered from a pull back in our stock price and our stock option values. 2007 will be the first year we have all been shut out form participating in the growth and success of our company during my nine year tenure at Domino’s and I can assure you of this, my team and I need and expect to do better than that. So for all of these reasons job number one is for us to get our domestic franchisee sales growing again and we are taking bold action on many fronts to achieve this important objective. First, the majority of our domestic franchisee system is comprised of dedicated, passionate operators who are excellent business owners living and working in their local communities. We respect them, we appreciate them and we admire them. However we are a large franchise system who has been around for over 40 years and we’ve got some disengaged operators who are not performing at an acceptable level and they are hurting the brand and the overall performance of our domestic system. In 2008 we’re going to challenge these under-performing franchisees much more aggressively than we have in the past. We will either get them to engage in their business and improve their performance or help them transition their stores into the hands of operators who are prepared to do what it takes to succeed in today’s highly competitive pizza delivery market. Re-franchising will be an emphasis for Domino’s Pizza in 2008 and beyond. Second we will be encouraging our very best franchisees to build more stores or to buy distressed stores as turnaround projects which oftentimes have considerable financial upside or, in some cases, we will encourage our very best franchisees to buy corporate stores as a way to expand the scope of their businesses. To summarize an important point we need to get our domestic franchisees fired up about competing to win and move out those who can’t or don’t want to engage in what it takes to succeed. Third we need to obsessively focus on the consistency of our products, our customer service and the image of our stores and team members because that is at the core of the customer experience. I am excited and encouraged by several things that are happening. First the new organizational leadership that we’ve announced over the past few months are important and very relevant to the turnaround that we’re attempting to achieve with our franchise organization in the US. I like my team. Under Patrick Doyle’s leadership, Jim Stansik, Scott Hinshaw and Asi Sheikh are waking up every morning and focusing the issues we need to address to get stronger marketing, more momentum in our domestic franchise system and certainly making sure we’ve got the right group of franchisees out there working every day to build their businesses.  I’m pleased with the evolving work of our new advertising agency. We learned a lot from our first effort with our new agency in January of this year and we will only get better with more time to work together and continue our partnership. I’m very pleased with our new brand message, You’ve Got 30 Minutes. You’ve Got 30 Minutes really strikes at the heritage of our brand and it has really become an internal call to action that has created positive change in the operational execution of our stores. The expansion of our Pulse Point Of Sale technology throughout our system is a significant positive event for Domino’s Pizza. It drives more online orders and it provides other technology innovations that we think are real and important to our customers. Things like Pizza Tracker which has received a lot of press of late as it affords our customers the ability to literally track online their order from the moment the order is placed until it comes out of the oven, on its way and delivered to the consumer. It’s a great way for customers to feel connected with that order once they place it with their local store. Pulse incorporates labor scheduling technology which affords us the ability to more efficiently manage our labor. It has a functionality called Ticker which gives our stores the ability to compete with surrounding stores in terms of their in-store performance, operational and service times. It creates a competitive energy that we’ve found to be very, very positive in the way our crews behave at the retail level. It has a [SEPS] detection capability which affords the ability to identify where internal theft is occurring and address those issues very early on. It affords us the ability to have alternative ordering methods and so many other technology breakthroughs that we think will be a part of the pizza category particularly for those of us who can play at the national level and develop these kinds of technologies and put significant pressure on the smaller, weaker players who really don’t have these capabilities. The fourth thing I want to mention is we’re working very hard to create excitement in our category with marketing that makes the phones ring and drives traffic. We know we’re not the only retailer dinner concept with traffic problems right now but we want to help lead the pizza dinner segment out of the traffic doldrums. We are working to get our value positioning right by implementing pricing that takes the cost environment into consideration but also drives traffic and sales. We clearly need to speak to and attract those consumers who are fearful of recession and just continuing to increase our prices isn’t going to make us the safe haven that we want to be for families who are looking for a place to order dinner during a time of economic worry. Getting back some level of traffic growth is first and foremost for Domino’s Pizza in 2008 and we will be taking some bold actions to hopefully make that happen. My final comment on our domestic business is that you’ll notice from our year end numbers that most of our net store growth during 2007, which was well within the range that we’ve kind of given people the expectation of, it came to us primarily from our international division. Clearly we struggle to increase our net domestic store growth when we are not growing sales and, in some cases, our stronger operators are buying stores from failing franchisees rather than building new ones. We obviously hope to get this situation turned around as we gain some additional momentum in our domestic franchise business. Our international business was the star of 2007 with same stores sales up 6.7% over 2006 positive 4% annual sales increase. I’m very proud of our international team and while I purposely started off my remarks today focusing on the domestic business which needs much attention, I can tell you that our international business needs no fixing. It’s going gang busters. The international business has definitely reached critical mass, it’s now 40% of our global retail sales and nearly 30% of our profits. Just a few examples to illustrate this, our UK master franchisee just reported a 33% increase in the 2007 profits. Our Australian based franchisee who bought the rights to France, The Netherlands and Belgium last year recently announced that their same store sales in those countries are up 15%. Our business in India had revenue growth of 54% last year and they are the market leader in that country. I want to point out that the momentum in our international business isn’t due to a magic bullet, it’s not occurring just in one country or with just one great promotion, the commonality is that we have operators who are completely engaged in the business and have created and sustained their sales momentum. This is exactly the kind of passion and focus we are working to recreate in the hearts and minds of our domestic franchisees. Now despite our overly intense internal focus on our domestic sales issues, particularly as it relates to franchisee sales, we continue to keep our shareholders top of mind. Once we got our open market share repurchase program up and running this year we used it to aggressively repurchase shares particularly in the fourth quarter. By the end of the year we had gone through over a quarter of our authorization and we intend to continue to be aggressive with repurchases. This is an easy decision for us with our stock trading at current levels. In conclusion I just want to say things are clearly tough out there, the end of the fourth quarter saw some very challenging soft weeks for us and I think everybody and regaining traffic growth in our category continues to be a difficult task but we are moving fast on all of the actions I’ve outlined plus others you’ll hear about in the coming weeks and months, all focused squarely on turning domestic franchise sales around and prudently managing our costs during this difficult environment. We know it’ll take time to gain the benefits of some of the initiatives I’ve outlined for you today but our track record for growth and success is there for the world to see and I remain very confident in our ability to get our domestic franchisee partners’ sales back on the track in terms of their overall performance. Now with that I’d like to turn things over to our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Bill Kapp and he’ll run you through some numbers.
William E. Kapp: Good morning everyone. As you’ll note from our earnings release we had several items that affected the comparability of our results to those of the fourth quarter last year. I’ll cover those shortly but first I’ll start with the top line. We ask you to keep in mind that revenues alone do not necessarily give you the complete picture and instead consider global retail sales as a clearer gauge of top line performance. Our global retail sales increased 7.4% during the quarter driven primarily by same store sales growth in our international business and an increase in worldwide store counts of 258 units over year end 2006. Moving to same store sales domestically our sales decreased 3.5% for the quarter. Company-owned stores decreased 1.1% versus a negative 1% in Q4 2006 while franchise same stores sales decreased 3.9% versus a negative 4.9% in Q4 2006. Full year comps however were slightly better with company-owned stores up 1% and franchise down 2.1. Internationally same store sales increased 9.5% over last year’s positive 3.9 in Q4. Full year comps were up a very strong 6.7%. This also marked the 56th consecutive quarter of international same store sales growth. Moving on to the income statement our total revenues for the quarter were $445 million up $10.7 million or 2.5% from last year. This was drive by higher revenues from our international stores. Also we had higher domestic supply chain revenues. We formerly called that distribution caused by elevated food prices mostly cheese. Our consolidated operation margin as a percent of revenue decreased 1.5% in the quarter versus prior year 25.1 versus 26.6 a year ago. I’ll now cover each of the three operating divisions. First our international franchise business which has no cost of sales grew as a percent of revenue thus improving our overall consolidated margin for the quarter. Second our company-owned store margins were negatively impacted by higher food costs primarily cheese and also higher labor and ordering costs. Third our supply chain margins were down primarily due to two factors. Cheese prices accounted from 1.2% of the 1.5% decrease in the consolidated margins. Remember that cheese prices are a pass through and will impact the percentages but have no impact on the dollars earned. The average cheese block for the quarter was $2.01 per pound versus $1.30 last year a 55% increase. The second supply chain factor was the impact of the wheat market. The higher wheat costs decreased the margin percentage by approximately 0.08% but also impacted the dollar margin unlike cheese. We had previously committed to our franchisees a full year of constant store pricing for dough which had been our customary practice when wheat prices were much more consistent. Therefore we did not pass on the significant wheat cost increases experienced in 2007. We have already adjusted our store pricing for Q1 2008 and will adjust quarterly moving forward thus our supply chain margins should return to more normal levels. Given the volatile market conditions that we experienced in 2007 we decided to lock in the cost of our 2008 flour during the fourth quarter of last year. While this price lock was a significant increase over historic cost it is below current market levels. Next bottom line earnings, our diluted EPS on a GAAP basis was $0.26 or $0.21 as adjusted for the quarter. This is a $0.23 decline from the prior year quarter. We benefited almost $0.06 from non-recurring events, a $3.5 million after tax impact from certain state tax reserve reversals and a $1.1 million after tax gain on the sale of our corporate aircraft. Our recapitalization had a significant impact on interest expense which produced a decrease of $0.02 year-over-year in the quarter. Our total interest expense for the quarter was $34.6 million. An additional $0.09 decrease was driven by our operating results. We experienced a decrease in our domestic supply chain profits due to the lower domestic sales volumes and the increased wheat cost. We also had lower corporate store margin. Our G&A expenses increased primarily due to an investment in our domestic store development team and increases in health insurance. These decreases were offset in part by the continued strong performance in our international operation. Additionally our effective tax rate 24.8% in the quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2007, and as I discussed previously, we reversed reserves related to certain ongoing state tax matters. We anticipate a more normalized 39 to 40% over the foreseeable future. As mentioned earlier we sold our corporate aircraft for a gain during the quarter. The proceeds from that sale are reflected in the cash flow statement in the proceeds from sale line while the investment in a replacement was included in the capital expenditures line. We continue to expect that our recurring capital needs will be between $20 and $30 million annually. As stated in our earnings release the company repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares of its common stock under our share repurchase program for $36.4 million during the quarter. We funded $15 million of this by borrowing on our revolver and still have over $100 million in capacity available. We will continue to be opportunistic buyers in the market. Turning to our leverage we continue to be very comfortable with our debt level and we have seen no economic effects on our current financing or our capital structure due to the recent turbulence in the credit market. Since our rates and terms are fixed we can expect the same conditions during the balance of our five year term. Our Q4 debt service coverage ratio was not high enough this quarter to allow us to release approximately $17 million in restricted cash. We’ve had some questions about our covenants under the new ABS debt. The primary covenant on the debt is a debt service coverage ratio that cannot be calculated using publicly released numbers. However, basically the numerator in the calculation is closest to our segment income, not exact but a rough estimation. The denominator in the calculation is senior interest expense. The exact formula can be found on page 55 of the Base Indenture Definitions and was attached to our Q1 2007 10-Q. Since the denominator is fixed, we estimate that our numerator or segment income would need to drop by $60 to $70 million annually before our first pay back trigger is reached. This significant cushion and our strong cash flows should help to explain why we are comfortable with our debt level. This concludes our financial update. Once again we’d like to thank you for your time today.  We appreciate your support and would like to answer your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Lehman Brothers.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: Couple of questions, first, David, you mentioned some disengaged franchisees. Just wondering if you can give a little bit more color in terms of whether this is really something very new that you’re seeing or perhaps something you’ve seen for a while, perhaps how you assess what makes somebody a disengaged franchisee in terms of key metrics, maybe how many there are. Just trying to get some more color in terms of what you view as disengaged.
David A. Brandon: We don’t have a problem in the world right now but clipping our negative 1.7 domestic same store sales number to a positive one or two which is kind of where we’ve been able to operate with our Team USA business. That is the essence of our issue and as we have pushed hard to get our franchise community to get more aggressive in the environment that we’re in and understand that the game has changed and that we need to be sharper in the way we approach pricing and our local marketing we have a number of our franchisees who are proving to us that they can fall into line with a lot of the same things that we’ve done effectively in our corporate stores and achieve terrific results. But that bottom 10% frankly is dragging us down and in many instances as we’ve pushed harder and delved deeper into what’s going on with their businesses, we feel some of them are simply just not engaged at the level they need to be engaged to operate in the environment that we’re in. So our job as a franchisor for the good of the whole system is to either fix those problems or change the ownership of those stores in such a way that we can improve our overall results. So the whole concept of re-franchising which is not something that we’ve really focused on I think is as a result of a certain level of impatience and a certain level of frustration over the fact that we just need to operate better at the local level with some of our franchisees. I definitely want to make sure we don’t paint the world with a big brush here because we stand on the strength of our franchisees and we have some of the best in the world and we’re very proud of them and they’re leading in a lot of different ways. Having said all of that though we think it’s time for us to be more aggressive in terms of transforming the composition of our franchise system to a higher performing group.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: Are you able to broad brush kind of quantify give or take that bottom 10% what they’re delivering in terms of whether it’s sales profitability versus the clear majority of your system?
David A. Brandon: I would just tell you that we’re focused on the bottom 10% and the bottom 10%, when you look at their store level economics, their sales short fall over the last two years and our ability to get them to step up and arrest those trends and fix them, that’s the area that we’re focused on and we think there’s a significant amount of value to either getting those folks to step up or, if we can’t, getting those stores under the ownership of operators who in fact will quickly lift them to a better level.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: The other question, obviously international businesses looks like it’s doing extremely well, just wondering, you said it’s growing gang busters and it’s making up the majority of the unit growth, what’s the likelihood or the possibility that you can accelerate the international unit growth or can you talk about the barriers to faster growth in that market since it is doing so well and there seems to be a lot of room for it?
David A. Brandon: The business feeds on itself, so as you see these countries that are putting these significant sales growth levels together and some of them are getting to the scope and scale where they can go on television and that even creates greater brand awareness which allows for faster growth, we believe there is an acceleration growth opportunity in many of our international markets. We’re also looking at the possibility of opening up some new markets. We’re in nearly 60 countries around the world and obviously there is places we’re not currently competing where we think we have viable opportunities today. So, yeah we think there’s acceleration opportunities going forward but managing the rate and pace of growth in any country is one of the most important things you do and we’re not going to get in the business to see how fast we can open stores, we’re going to be in the business of seeing how fast we can open stores that operate at a high level. And for that reason we’re going to have controlled growth as opposed to just trying to go out there and see how many stores we can throw up in any given year. It’s not the right way to build the business to last.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers: And then lastly, you mentioned potential for more aggressive share repo, just wondering perhaps what metric you use to determine what the appropriate amount is, obviously we saw a big ramp up in the fourth quarter, just trying to come up with an estimate going forward in terms of how you look at it.
David A. Brandon: I don’t think we’re in a position right now to offer you a whole bunch of details as it relates to how we think about that other than my general comment that we think at these share price levels our stock is a great buy and we’ll continue to deploy capital against those opportunities.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.
Diana Campbell – JP Morgan: This is Diana Campbell here on behalf of John. I have some questions for you, the first one was you said that you had some softer weeks at the end of the fourth quarter. Do you have any update on the momentum continuing into the first quarter?
David A. Brandon: We don’t comment on existing market conditions or we don’t give statements or are not in a position to give reports on what’s happened so far this quarter. I would just emphasize the point that when you look at the overall results of our fourth quarter, a significant part of that was skewed by the last few weeks which we experienced a significant softness in terms of traffic and basic consumer spending.
Diana Campbell – JP Morgan: My second question, could you update us on what sort of effect your cheese hedges could have on 08 results?
David A. Brandon: We don’t have any cheese hedges as we’ve reported previous. We have a purchase agreement with our cheese supplier that we don’t go into great specifics that certainly collars some of the volatility in cheese and so our operators are blessed in this environment to not be paying at the top of the market or at the current market price as a result of that collar, but we do not have hedges in place that afford us any significant economic benefit in the current environment.
Diana Campbell – JP Morgan: And then, you guys were mentioning your G&A spend and how you made an investment in your domestic system, was that like a one time thing that we should expense for the fourth quarter or something that should be ongoing into 08 and could you give us any color on what that investment was?
David A. Brandon: I think we spoke about this last year, but as part of this whole recruiting new franchisees, refreshing the system and putting a focused development activity in place both franchise recruitment development in addition to store development, we made an investment that really became more apparent and showed up in a bigger way in our financials during the fourth quarter. That investment will continue, however as we move through 2008 we’re making other compensating management decisions as it relates to our G&A and again, going forward I’m not in a position to comment on that but that’s the specific investment that Bill was alluding to when he talked about G&A.
Diana Campbell – JP Morgan: You can’t give us an update as to whether we should expect G&A to go up or down like on a margin basis?
David A. Brandon: The only thing I will tell you is that we’re going to be very, very prudent in the environment that we’re operating in with our G&A spending and we will be taking some actions to make sure that our spending flexes with the revenue realities that we’re dealing with.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Glen Petraglia with City Investment Research.
Glen Petraglia – City Investment Research: Dave, I was hoping maybe you could comment on the bottom 10%, presumably those are the franchisees that are struggling most from a financial perspective, do you think that they’re at a significant risk of closing, hence you’re being more aggressive to try to make sure that you don’t necessarily see net unit closures, but you’re trying to manage the process appropriately?
David A. Brandon: I think that’s exactly right. We’re willing in this environment, if there’s a terrific operator out there who’s thinking about building a new store but he’s got an operator next door who’s failing and isn’t being aggressive on their pricing tactics and isn’t driving traffic and is financially in trouble, we’d rather direct that franchisee to buy those two failing stores next door and turn around and fix them even if it’s the expense of that new store that they were contemplating because under the circumstances that we’re operating in right now, we think that that re-franchising opportunity will ultimately yield greater benefit.
Glen Petraglia – City Investment Research: Is there a reluctance within the system of franchisees who are doing better to make the investment in growth at this point because of the commodity environment, because of the consumer environment and real estate costs, etcetera?
David A. Brandon: You’ll note we opened up a number of new stores in the US last year, so we still have people who are growing and building stores and there’s plans in place and there’s stores opening as we speak, but the reality is as long as the commodity pressures are extraordinarily high and as long as sales are soft and with many of our good operators and one of their stores coming on the market in adjacent areas that are very opportunistic in terms of their price, we will likely see a diminished performance in terms of our new store activity until that correction kind of works its way through the system.
Glen Petraglia – City Investment Research: And when you say re-franchising, that’s not necessarily reducing the percentage of the system that’s run by company-owned but it’s more keeping it roughly the same general levels, just to clarify?
David A. Brandon: Actually our objective at the end of this year would be to have a lower number of franchisees and a higher ratio of stores to franchisees on the domestic system. We are trying to focus more on our better operators and weed out, if you will, some of our weaker operators. And I would also tell you that we will likely be more aggressive as it relates to taking a look at our corporate store portfolio and if there are franchisees that we feel can operate at a higher level, we’ll be sellers and we’ll allow them to grow in that way as well.
Glen Petraglia – City Investment Research: In terms of the weakness in the same store sales in the US, is there any way to break it out? Maybe if you could just speak on general competitive dynamics. Do you think that competition has stepped up, do you feel like some of the initiatives over at your largest competitor are having a negative impact on you? Maybe you can talk about that.
David A. Brandon: I think what’s happened to us as a category – and well know that people in the cutback mode they’re in, they’re doing less at the dinner day part – everybody in the dinner day part is being hit with this and certainly we’re a dinner focused product and so we’re caught up in that probably to a greater degree than we have in the past. In the past we actually would have, in these market conditions, seen people who were reluctant to spend $50, $60, $70 at a sit down, fast casual restaurant or whatever. We see them kind of retreat to us as a value choice. And I’m sure some of that has happened and some of that will continue to happen but what’s unusual about this situation is that our category at the same time the consumer is crying for value, we’ve been out there raising prices substantially. If you look at the average ticket in this category, in the independent research that we purchased, shows that the average ticket in this category has gone up several dollars over the last few years and against a relatively small base, it’s created a real value problem where consumers typically saw this as a category they could retreat to and get great value on price, the combination of the industry in the last few years getting very focused on delivery charges which is just another tax on the ticket, at the same time being hit with these extraordinary foot cost inflation has really put the category and our operators in a situation where price comes first and we keep pushing up the average ticket of the bundle of food that we’re selling. I believe that the people who are doing the best job of navigating in this period come up with value platforms that still provide appeal to those consumers who are looking for value in this environment. And as I look back, as we’ve been dancing on the head of the pin trying to get our prices aligned with costs, at the same time we’re trying to get our traffic moving, I believe this is an area where we haven’t been as aggressive as we need to be. The people who have been more aggressive with low price point value menu approaches I think have performed better so I don’t telegraph our plans and I don’t want to tip off our competition other than to say we believe in this environment for us to get our traffic moving we’re going to have a stronger value message to our customer and we’re working hard on that.
Glen Petraglia – City Investment Research: And then just lastly, David Mounts has been overrunning the distribution or supply chain business now for the last, I don’t know, four or five months. Anything that’s changed, any areas of potential efficiency pick up, etcetera that maybe you’d be willing to share?
David A. Branson: I don’t want to be real specific other than I can tell you that having a new set of eyes on that business has been productive. We’ve made organizational changes that we’ve already seen some benefit from. Clearly whether it was David or anybody else, we’re in a very different marketplace right now in terms of how we procure the commodities that we need to buy and we’re putting aggressive collars and protections in place as best we can to kind of take some of this volatility out. Wheat is a classic example, that’s a commodity that least year we were fundamentally naked in the wind and eating all those increases that were coming by almost the day and the hour, whereas now we’ve got forward contracts in place with our supplier that protect us and all of these increases that have occurred even thus far in 2008, our operators are not going to have to incur because we did a longer, better job of locking in our wheat prices through our supplier and those are all initiatives that are a sign of the times. It’s also a sign of the fact that David’s over there challenging the status quo and looking at ways that we can be more efficient and I think they’re all adding value. So I’m very comfortable with what’s going on there and I think we’ve already experienced some savings that will be a result of our activity and our focus there and we’ll see as the year unfolds how big that number can be.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bear Stearns.
Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns: I wanted to go back to the re-franchising for a moment. Originally what I thought what you were talking about was sort of brokering the under-performing franchise stores into better hands, better franchisees, it sounds though like you’re looking to buy the stores and fold them into the company next. Is that the game plan?
David A. Brandon: No. If you heard me say that I was clumsy in my communication. That is not what we’re saying. What we are saying is that we are going to doing re-franchising, which means we’ll either be bringing in new franchisees, new blood into the system or we’ll be selecting carefully some of our existing high performing franchisees and we will try to move under-performing stores into their hands and control. What I also said is that we may see situations where we’ll take those same high performing franchisees and the will be buyers and the corporate stores will be sellers to facilitate opportunities for those excellent franchisees to gain bigger business opportunities as a result of taking over some corporate stores. We do not intend to invest significant amounts of capital in growing our corporate store unit. 
Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns: Okay, I understand then. Do you have the means to force the under-performing franchisees to sell? What has to take place to start making transactions occur?
David A. Brandon: Our franchise agreement enforces the ability to hold our franchisees accountable to certain standards as it relates to their operational execution, the way that they protect and portray the image of the brand. There are certain financial metrics that need to be upheld. We can’t unilaterally go just throw somebody out of the system nor do we want to do that. But what we can have is serious conversations with people in terms of expectations and their responsibilities and obligations to the system and to the extent those operators are not responsive, we do have the ability and we certainly have ways of trying to facilitate changes in ownership. We have not been particularly aggressive in that mode over the last several years because obviously our performance has been such that frankly we haven’t had to. I think where we are today with the nature of the business and what it takes to be successful, this is an area that we just need to put greater focus.
Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns: Then question on the traffic for the category, where do think it’s going? What are people doing in lieu of ordering home delivery pizza?
David A. Brandon: I think the Mia experiment that Pizza Hut came out with was very creative, they architected a cheap down product and put a very low price point on it and fundamentally I view that as their value entry and I think that’s the way they’re positioning that is that they, if you want to think about a value menu in the pizza business much like we’ve learned to understand value menus in the burger business I think they’re positioning themselves in that way. The Little Caesars of the world and the take and bake players, the people out there who can afford a very, very low price point for their dinner options I think are doing the best in this environment because of the nature of the consumers’ interests and the consumers’ attitude. We can, as I said in my opening remarks, we can continue to go out there and kind of beat the fact that we deserve to have higher prices because food inflation is so significant and so impactful, the reality is I think the people who win are going to be the ones who capture the imagination of customers in this environment as being a very, very aggressive value option for them. I would also tell you that as we look at the world out there, a lot of the dollars that used to spent at dinner are still being spent, in some cases they’re being spent at different day parts. So we think the lunch day part and the snack day part, which are day parts that we should be well positioned to pursue have opportunities associated with them because, again if we can come up with the right platform of products and price points, we can compete for some of those lower ticket spenders in those day parts and extend our business. As we look in benchmarking against people who have grown in this difficult environment, those are some of the tactics that they’ve employed and we’re going to steal a page from their playbook.
Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns: Then a question on the commodities, Bill, I think you mentioned the cheese costs of $2.01 per pound, under the new contract were you paying significantly less than that in the fourth quarter? If you can, share what you did pay?
William E. Kapp: I don’t think the word significant is the word to use. We were paying less as a result of this collar so the way our arrangement works with our provider is [inaudible 00:04:43] we’re going to tell you less than the top of the market, when the market is high and we’ll pay a little bit more than the market, when the market is low. But that is not a number that’s measured in quarters, it’s a number that’s measured in nickels and dimes. And I think I need to leave it at that.
Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns: And then locking in the flour costs for 08, just talk about the implications for that, I guess you’ve got to price quarterly. Does that become less relevant because you’ve locked in the flour for 08?
David A. Branson: What we did last fall, late last year, because we were just getting killed by this commodity, we went to our suppliers and worked out an arrangement where we took go forward contracts at that particular time which really took care of our purchasing needs as forecasted for the entire calendar year 2008. And at the time the numbers we were looking at for flour seemed astronomical but based on the irrational behavior and the volatility of the commodity we just decided to lock it in and put ourselves in a position where we had protection. In this particular case we were brilliant, we didn’t know how brilliant at the time because from the time we locked those in flour continued to go up through year end 2007 and it has gone up dramatically higher thus far in 2008. So we’re pleased that we’ve got that protection and it will afford our operators to be dealing at a flour price that’s measurably higher than it was a year ago at this time and certainly higher than historical norms but substantially lower than what current market pricing would create.
Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns: For the full year 08 do you think flour costs will be up?
David A. Brandon: Flour costs will be up 08 versus 07 for sure. However, keep in mind that we had a policy last year of not imposing those flour increases on the system because we hadn’t historically done that. We’ve clearly changed the pricing of flour through our distribution business and our dough ball pricing starting at the beginning of the year. So even though at the store level they’ll be paying higher, corporately we’re in a much stronger position in 2008 as a result of that price increase that we put in place.
Joseph Buckley – Bear Stearns: And then last question, just on the cap ex, obviously the plane replacement I guess is what drove the cap ex so high for 07, is there anything looking ahead that is going to goose up cap ex over the next couple years of will we see it fall back to that $20 to $30 million?
David A. Brandon: As Bill said $20 to $30 million is the regular run rate and the situation with the sale of the plane which shows up in one category and the replacement which shows up in the cap ex is a one timer and we’re well positioned and we don’t know of any one timers that are looming out there that are certainly part of any of our plan. That $20 to $30 million range should be a very, very good one to use.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Colin Guheen with Cowen and Company.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: I guess one more question on the wheat contract, how much effective pricing for 2008 would the franchisees need to take to offset the inflation in wheat from the distribution channel?
David A. Brandon: We don’t share our cost per dough ball information and frankly a lot of that has to do with a lot of moving parts including the fact that as you know our distribution business is on a profit sharing basis so the larger operator you are and the higher percent you control of whatever distribution center you purchase from and the profitability of that distribution center creates rebates. To try and answer your question directly would require so many moving parts I’d probably confuse you more than I would help you. Suffice to say that the biggest cost factor in a pizza continues to be cheese. It’s 35 to 40% of the cost of a pizza. Flour is an important ingredient and we saw last year how important it had become but it’s still a much smaller percentage of the cost of that product. If you gave me a choice right now with the flour market weakening or the cheese market weakening, I could tell you I would choose cheese in a minute.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: And then on the technology front, how many number of franchise stores are basically compliant with the expanded ordering capabilities and the POS system and does that roll out kind of get wrapped up in the next three to six months, does it look on track to you?
David A. Brandon: Yes. The mandatory requirement is to have that installed by the middle of this year. We typically, whenever we have one of these mandatory dates, we have stragglers based on stores under construction and stores being relocated and some cases stores being bought and sold and so we will give some relief. But we’re to the point now where I think we have somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,500 stores that are fully installed and operational with Pulse and we’re adding more virtually every day.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: On the company, just one more question on the company franchise mix, over the next three to five years I think if I take your comments it could start dipping below that 10% company-owned mix that you guys have maintained for a long time now I guess. Is that correct?
David A. Brandon: Yeah, we don’t tip our hand in terms of where we’re buyers and where we’re sellers and when we’re buyers and when we’re sellers because obviously we’re out there making a market. But I would tell you that my general sense is that we will be in a situation where there are certain markets where we may invite some of our better operating franchisees to have bigger businesses and we would be sellers. If we buy corporate stores they will be very opportunistic and they will be adjacent to existing markets where we have infrastructure and I would not anticipate that our percent control of the system by virtue of corporate store ownership would go up. If anything I would predict it would go down.
Colin Guheen – Cowen and Company: And then just one model question, the gain, did that show up from a P&L perspective in the G&A line? Is that correct?
David A. Brandon: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mitch [Pfeiser] with Halsey Advisory.
Mitch [Pfeiser] - Halsey Advisory: Couple questions, first on a US distribution, I did check in your 10-K I believe for the full year US distribution income from operations was down 14%, in the fourth quarter down 31%. Just trying to get a sense as we look out to 08 given these new contracts you have in place and just say a positive 1% comp, should that US distribution income from ops be flat or so on a year-over-year basis?
William E. Kapp: I think that the first is the fourth quarter and the margins were definitely impacted by not passing along the wheat and secondly, but more importantly, on the big picture number is the getting traffic turned around and getting traffic in our domestic operations was a bigger impact than the wheat number. The wheat affected the margin number but the overall dollars were just driven in the soft traffic for the current year.
David A. Brandon: And I mentioned this in my remarks, but I’ll emphasize it because it’s very important, one of the many reasons why getting traffic back is important is if we continue to see ticket go up and traffic go down, which has been kind of the problem that we’ve been confronting for the last 18 months, from a distribution company perspective we lose a lot of efficiency. We’re selling a lot less dough balls, we’re leveraging that infrastructure to a much lesser degree and so one of the ways our business model is going to operate the best is to get that plus 1, plus 2% growth and have some of that come from traffic because that accelerates the efficiencies of our dough making activities as well as the efficiencies of the supply chain. So that’s far more a bigger issue for us in terms of the benefit that comes from that than any of the commodity issues.
Mitch [Pfeiser] - Halsey Advisory: And moving along, was there any foreign exchange benefit to earnings per share this quarter?
William E. Kapp: Our FX rates for the quarter, our sales benefited by about $50 million in FX, the sales number.
Mitch [Pfeiser] - Halsey Advisory: And we could translate that into EPS through the international margins or if you can give us some guidance on that.
William E. Kapp: Our international royalty rates are less than our domestic royalty rates. They’re different by country but they average somewhere in the 3% range.
David A. Brandon: If you take that $50 million and you use, call it a 3.5% average royalty rate, and there’ll be some noise in that calculation because it depends on where the FX came from, but that would get you close.
Mitch [Pfeiser] - Halsey Advisory: And just lastly, and David, you’ve talked about this in previous quarters, but it seems like you want to do less unnecessary discounting yet you do have to provide a value message. So I guess as we look to 08, do you expect there to be net pricing increases through that mix? I guess the question is how do you balance it?
David A. Brandon: Believe me, this is one of the says easy, does hard, but it is absolutely the question. You have asked the question and it’s challenging but it’s the work that needs to be done. Again if you look at Team USA, our corporate owned unit, for calendar year 2007 they increased prices higher than our franchise system. So their average ticket went up on a higher percentage basis than the franchisees, yet their traffic loss was lower. So what that says is that they did a much better job, which is a daily activity, of maximizing price where you can maximize price, at the same time driving traffic when you need to with the right kind of value-targeted promotions. Much of that is done at the local level and so what we need is to recreate that with a broader array of our franchisees where they’re continuing to manage price carefully because, hell you have to. Look at the commodity cost that everybody’s paying. You can’t be insensitive to your pricing, but you also have to balance that with very careful and, in some cases, aggressive promotional tactics that will continue to stimulate your traffic. Team USA did it better in 2007 than the rest of the system. If we can get the rest of the system to operate where Team USA is, I’d be a much happier guy right now.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark [Hussin] with Cedar Rock Capital.
Mark [Hussin] - Cedar Rock Capital: I just wanted to drill down a little bit more on the variation that you’re seeing around the country. Where you’re seeing particular weakness, is there any kind of geographic concentration of that, is it in poorer neighborhoods, is it in high volume stores, low volume stores? Is there any kind of consistency in this and does that tell you what’s going to happen next?
David A. Brandon: We’re teething through a lot of that data. I can tell you geographically in terms of any kind of macro regional factors, there’s no correlation. We’ve run it against real estate markets, we’ve run against everything, energy, gallon of gas. We’ve run it against all the different factors out there that could be affecting the consumer and we don’t the correlation. We do believe, going back to this value positioning that some of the customers that we’re losing as a result of our traffic problems over the last year and a half could very well be in some of the areas where we have consumers that are very, very value oriented and very, very price sensitive. So in some cases we may have priced some of those consumers out of the market and I just as soon not tell you where they are and who they are because I think that’s giving my competitors more than you want to me to give them. 
Mark [Hussin] - Cedar Rock Capital: Is it using less sort of attachment rate? You’ve seen that in other kinds of retailers, where people will by a TV but they won’t buy anything else to go with it. They’re not buying the ticket kickers or the cheesy bread or something.
David A. Brandon: We’re seeing price sensitivity out there on behalf of certain customers and we need to be responsive to that, although frankly our problem isn’t as much upselling and getting more on the ticket, our problem is traffic. So in some cases the problem we have is those consumers who were purchasing from us have kind of gone into stall mode and we’ve to figure out a way to attract them back.
Mark [Hussin] - Cedar Rock Capital: So they’ve just literally stopped ordering?
David A. Brandon: Yeah, we’ve just had too many customers that liked the value equation before and they don’t like it as well now. And we think this is systemic. If this was us just going off and doing something crazy I think I’d really be concerned, but the reality is we believe that based on all the crust data that we’ve seen and what we pick up from our competitors’ comments we think that this is a systemic issue that in the category we’ve lost some of our value positioning. We’ve already talked about what Pizza Hut is doing and their attempt to address it, I don’t know what Papa John’s is doing. I know what Domino’s is going to do because we really think it’s important to go after that.
Mark [Hussin] - Cedar Rock Capital: You’ve seen this film before presumably at some stages in your history and what did you do then and did it work?
David A. Brandon: You know what, this is a new film. The one thing that’s very different and even in my nine years, I’ve seen consumer confidence really low and we’ve seen moments where cheese prices were really high. We’ve been through a whole bunch of different hurdles that were thrown in front of us over the last nine years. We’re talking about 911 and Katrina and all kinds of things and energy price volatility and the like. The thing that’s particularly strange about this situation is normally when the consumer goes into retreat mode, our category is there with open arms saying here’s the best value in town. This is the first time we’ve been forced into a situation because of what’s going on with cheese and wheat and corrugated and meats and energy and minimum wage and gas prices at the pump and you name it, this is the first time we’ve been in a situation where we’re trying to increase our prices at the same time everybody else is out there causing the consumer to choke. So this is a different set of circumstances for us as a category and for us as a company and, to that extent, we’re kind of picking our way through it. We’re learning as we go and I think we’re locking in more and more on what we need to do and how we need to get there, but these are uncharted waters to a large degree.
Mark [Hussin] - Cedar Rock Capital: So this is a working class recession is what you’re saying?
David A. Brandon: Based on our experience, absolutely. Absolutely. This is a consumer, forget about what they’re doing with interest rates on capital goods. Right now we have a consumer who I think at holiday time when they started buying holiday presents, they stopped buying a lot of other things. I think they ran up their credit cards and I think we have a consumer right now who is very, very uncertain in terms of their spending patterns and I think you see that across a whole bunch of retailers and certainly we’re caught up in that to a certain degree.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan [Pearloff] with [Iridian].
Dan [Pearloff] - [Iridian]: Two questions, number one could you just talk about, since there’s still some moving pieces in interest expense, reasonable proxy for 08 somewhere in the $105 million range if you simply take the $1.7 billion times 6, or 6.1%. Is that a reasonable proxy for interest expense?
William E. Kapp: Yeah.
David A. Brandon: Yes.
Dan [Pearloff] - [Iridian]: And secondly, just so I understand the $80+ million of cash that’s now classified as restricted cash, I think you touched it on but I’m still a little bit confused what your flexibility is to use that cash in 08 for share repurchase or whether that’s truly restricted.
William E. Kapp: That $80 million is truly restricted. In there, there is $26 million that is a restricted three month interest payment that we had negotiated an opportunity to release two-thirds of that if we hit certain debt service coverage ratios. We didn’t hit that level in Q4. If we are able to hit certain covenant levels for two quarters in a row, we would have the ability to release two-thirds of that $26 million but that didn’t happen in Q4 and so it’s got to happen two quarters in a row before it would release. So the soonest it would release would be into the fall.
Dan [Pearloff] - [Iridian]: And just so I understand, does your comment that, just to paraphrase that you anticipate a healthy level of share repurchase in 08, is that in way dependent on the release of any of that restricted cash?
David A. Brandon: No.
Operator: That’s all the time we have for today’s Q&A session. Do you have any closing remarks?
David A. Brandon: I just want to say in closing that as always, I take personal accountability for this company’s performance as does every membership of my leadership team and we’re working long and hard to maximize the results we can achieve on behalf of all of our shareholders and that will continue and I’ll look forward to reviewing the first quarter numbers with you a little later in the year. Thank you all very much.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference. You may now disconnect.

Operator: At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the 2007third quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Ms.Lynn Liddle, Executive VP of Communications and Investor Relations. Ms. Liddle,you may begin your conference.
Lynn Liddle:  Thanks Jason. Thank you everyone for joining us thismorning. With us today, we have our chairman and CEO, David Brandon; ourexecutive VP of distribution and procurement, David Mounts; and as our formerCFO, David will be covering this call as he passes, for the time, onto ouracting CFO, Bill Cap, who is also with us today.  We will begin with an overview of the quarter, from DaveBrandon and follow up with David Mount, and then open for Q&A. A couple of points before we begin is, we will ask the mediato be in a listen only mode, and I’ll also refer you to our Safe HarbourStatement that is in our press release and in our queue, in the event that anyforward-looking statements are made. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to DavidBrandon.
David Brandon: Good morning everyone, and thanks for participating in ourreview of the third quarter earnings. Dave and I will likely both take a coupleminutes more than we normally would, to walk you through what we would expectto be a lot of areas of interest, based on the environment that we’re in andthe results that we are announcing today.  Our earnings per share this quarter was $0.17, which is$0.17 less than adjusted EPS for the third quarter last year, but let me makesure I quantify this gap. The vast majority of it, $0.13 of it is due to theadded interest expense from the change we made in our capital structure earlierthis year, which we have covered on previous calls. We’ve had very positiveinvestor feedback regarding our more leveraged capital structure. We actually,as we look back, believe our timing for this re-cap was very fortuitous, and weknow that our shareholders appreciate the $13.50 dividend we paid in the secondquarter.  So my focus today is going to be on the remaining $0.04 ofearnings per share decline. This is primarily due to challenges that certainlyaren’t unique to our company or inconsistent with the many topics we havediscussed back as recently as our second quarter earnings call. In fact, wehave been discussing these trends and issues with you for quite some time. Weare managing in a very challenging domestic operating environment. This is dueto continued traffic declines in our category, which are clearly a result ofcontinued softness in consumer demand. And since both of you know how ourbusiness model works, you know that decreased traffic causes a reduction in ourdistribution volume, which results in a reduction of efficiency andprofitability in this segment of our business as well. We also continue to battle the cost pressures fromcommodities and labor that I described in a fair amount of detail during ourlast call. In fact, these commodities were higher at the end of the thirdquarter than they were at the end of the second quarter. Our operators continueto absorb very large increases in food packaging and labor costs, which havepressured us during the entire year.  As I detailed during our last call, we are doing our verybest to raise prices, to reflect the impact of these historically high costpressures. At the same time, we are trying to stimulate traffic growth in ourcategory, not an easy task when consumers, and particularly highlyprice-sensitive consumers, are getting hit with food price increases at everyturn and are clearly reacting by reducing their spending across many retailcategories.  Thankfully, these challenges and shortfalls are somewhatmitigated by the stellar performance that we continue to get from ourinternational group, as evidenced by this quarter’s results. We continue tocelebrate the growth and progress our brand is making in so many regions of theworld. Now, we talked before how many segments, there are manysegments of the QSR industry that continue to experience reduced traffic, andwe see this from our third party research sources as well as our own internaldata. We really believe that consumers are reacting to their tighter financial situations.Now, while our local store marketing efforts, our national marketing topics,and our store level execution were able to able to help us buck the trafficturn last quarter, our franchise needs in the U.S.didn’t gain enough momentum to carry that into the third quarter. We feel badabout that. Our team U.S.A.unit was able to list their prices at a faster rate than our franchisees, whileat the same time doing a better job of minimizing traffic loss. Consequently,they were able to keep their overall same store sales slightly positive for thequarter. However, our franchisees were slower to raise prices and actuallyexperienced a higher reduction in traffic. So we know exactly what needs tohappen. We need to get our franchisees embracing the many initiatives that wehave launched in our corporate-owned stores that will help them close thesame-store sales gap that currently exists. We are working very hard tocommunicate these best practices and proven techniques to our franchiseesacross our domestic systems. Now, in addition to the work that we are doing with ourmarketplace organization, to try to ignite the energy and power of ourfranchise system in the U.S., I want to assure you that we are not sitting idlyby here at our world resource centre in Ann Arbor. We have worked hard to earnour reputation as a very proactive management team and we are all over thesechallenges. I have recently announced changes that I believe will help bringeven more focus and energy, as we address our domestic sales situation.  We recently announced management changes, specifically thepromotion of Patrick Doyle, the president of Dominos U.S.A., which puts aproven operator who turned around team U.S.A.stores in the right place, to positively impact our domestic franchisees andtarget our areas of weakness.  We also announced the transfer of David Mounts, to lead ourdistribution and procurement business. I believe this will be a greatopportunity for David to make a positive impact on this important aspect of ourbusiness, particularly during this time of unprecedented cost inflation.  We have teamed up with a cutting edge creative agency, CrispinPorter & Bogusky. Their experience in targeting our key customer group andtheir spot-on assessment of our brand in the agency review process; and theirknowledge of how to leverage the value of brand equity is expected to result insome dynamic changes in our advertising, which you will begin to see early inthe new year.  We also continue to leverage technology through our pulsepoint-of-sale platform, which has now been installed in approximately 60% ofour domestic stores, with new installations coming on-line every day. Duringthe third quarter, for the first time, we rolled out on-line ordering messageson our TV and print ads, resulting in steady increases in on-line orders, whichgenerally are more frequent purchasers and at a higher average ticket. This wasa distinct plus for our corporate team U.S.A.stores, since every one of those stores has pulse and offer on-line ordering inevery store. We have also added mobile phone ordering capability. Thisincreases access to our brand and targets our core customer and how they preferto order from our company. We are also making progress towards rationalizing pricing.As I said, our team U.S.A.stores have worked hard to increase prices where there were opportunities,reducing unneeded discounts while optimizing coupons, purging underperformingproducts and underperforming promotions. We have encouraged our franchisees todo the same thing.  As I said earlier, we know that prices most increase, tocope with increasing commodity costs; but we recognize that this must be donestrategically when traffic issues continue to pressure the sector. I broughtthis up the last quarter and likened it to dancing on the head of a pin. Team U.S.A.has taken a very measured stance towards this delicate balance and has seen aminimal fall-off in traffic, as a result of careful and considered pricingincreases. So far, they are doing the best job of dancing, and we need to makesure our franchisees follow their lead.  Team U.S.A.stores also continue to be very active with their local store marketing,maintaining high levels, and this has continued to pay off. We have sharedtheir results from these elevated local store marketing efforts withfranchisees, and we have encouraged them to participate in country-wide localstore marketing blitzes. There is no question about, in today’s environment, ifyou want to grow your traffic, you are going to steal share from somebody else;and that’s a war in battle that needs to be waged at the market and storelevel; and that’s what team U.S. A. is doing very effectively, and we need toget our franchisees to do better.  Our primary focus in the fourth quarter of this year will beto more effectively get our domestic franchise system to grow their sales inthe existing market conditions. We cannot be successful unless our franchiseeslead our success, and that’s certainly been the history of this system. Out of10 of the last 13 years, franchise sales have exceeded corporate sales by anaverage of a 3% gap. If they were currently beating team U.S.A.by their traditional 3% spread, our quarter results would be much improved.It’s important to note, though, that our franchise performance isn’t the samefor every store or in every market. We are discussing averages here, and I wantto make sure I send a shout out to those franchisees who have continued toout-pace team U.S.A.throughout this period.  We have some very successful operators out there who aredoing a great job. We are counting on them to help us lead the way to improvethe performance of those who are lagging. So we are bringing heavy emphasis toclose that gap and regain the historical momentum from our franchisees and ourfranchise system. I want to close my remarks by once again pointing out thatthe big winner of this quarter was our international division, which didextremely well, hosting a very strong 8.3% same-store sales comp, their highestin over 2 years. This speaks loudly about the strength of our brand world-wideand strong engine of growth that our international division provides to thiscompany. Our international operators are a great example of executing thefundamentals of our business well every day, and I want to congratulate them ona great quarter.  Now, with that, let me turn things over to David Mounts, whois going to take you through a more detailed look at our financial performance.As Lynn mentioned, although David has officially transferred to his newposition as the EVP of Distribution and Procurement, he is handling our callthis quarter, which will be his last act before we pass the baton over to BillCapa as our acting CFO; and Bill will execute the responsibilities of thisimportant function until we complete our national search process and fill thisposition permanently. David.
David Mounts:  Thanks Dave, and good morning everyone. As you will note,from our earnings release we have several items that affected the comparabilityof our results to those of the third quarter last year. I’ll cover thoseshortly but first let me start with the top line. We ask you to remember that revenues can be misleading whenanalyzing Domino’s financials, and ask you always consider global retail salesas the key gauge of our top line performance.  Our global retail sales increased 7.2% during the quarter.That was driven primarily by same store sales growth in our internationalbusiness, and an increase in worldwide store counts of 272 units over thetrailing four quarters. Same store sales domestically, our sales decreased 1.6%for the quarter. As Dave mentioned, our company owned stores increased 0.8%,that was versus a down 2.3% on the quarter three 2006, while our franchise samestore sales were a negative 2%. This was versus a negative 3.2% in the thirdquarter of 2006. International same store sales increased 8.3% over lastyear’s positive 3.0%. This was the highest growth in nearly three years andmarked the 55th consecutive quarter of international same storesales growth.  Moving on to the income statement. Our total revenuerevenues for the third quarter were $337.3 million, a $10.6 million of 3.3%increase from last year. It was driving by higher distribution levels revenuesthat were caused by the elevated food prices, mostly cheese. This benefited theDPV revenues but it contributed to lower team USAmargins, which I’ll discuss a little bit later.  Additionally, we had higher revenues from our internationalstores in the third quarter, which was driven by the increase in same storesales and the store count that I just mentioned.  Our consolidated operating margin as a percentage ofrevenues decreased only 1.4% in the third quarter versus the prior year. Wewere at 24.9% in the third quarter of 2007 versus 26.3% last year. There was areduction of 1.6%, based on the impact of increased cheese prices and itseffect on the distribution percent margins. The average cheese block price inthe third quarter was $1.95/lb versus $1.19 last year. This is a 64% increase.It’s the widest spread we have seen in cheese prices between year-over-yearquarters in three years. Remember that the dollar value of margins does notchange in our distribution business when cheese prices fluctuate.  Our international division’s operating margins improved withthe sale of our Franceand Netherlandsoperations, which was completed in the third quarter of 2006. Also, ourinternational franchise business, which has no cost of sales, gained as apercentage of total revenues. This helped improve our overall consolidatedmargin.  Our team USAmargins were negatively impacted by higher food costs and also higher laborcosts, but not as severely as some in our industry, at only 2.3%. This reducedour overall company margins by approximately 0.5%. The resilience of our modelis clear when you consider that, if you factor out the increasing cheese costimpact on distribution, our operating margin was flat to slightly positive inthis very tough cost environment.  As Dave mentioned, we are operating in an environment thatis high cost and we’re working to manage those costs down on a number offronts. As I’ve previously discussed, our team USAfood costs are net of our derivative milk contracts. These contracts had anon-material impact on our third quarter financial performance and were settledin the fourth quarter. The settled contracts will not have a material impact inthe fourth quarter.  This hedging strategy provided some benefit to our corporatestores in the rising cost environment we have seen over the past year. But thehedging is a not a practical tool for the overwhelming majority of ourfranchisees. Remember, our average domestic franchisee owns and operates threestores. So they are not inclined to want to get involved in market hedgingactivities.  However, in an effort to achieve the goal of loweringvolatility and improving our operators’ ability to plan and budget moreeffectively at the store level, we entered into a new multi-year purchasingarrangement during the third quarter, with our primary cheese supplier. Webelieve this contract will serve to more effectively smooth out our cheese costvolatility for both our company-owned and franchise stores.  Let me turn now to G&A expense. Part of our costcontainment effort is controlling G&A expenses, and we have been verydisciplined about this during the quarter. Excluding last quarter’s $5 millionlegal reserve, and expenses in connection with our recap, we saw total G&Aturning down in the third quarter compared to levels experienced during thesecond quarter. In case you are comparing to last year, last year’s GA numberincludes gains from sales of our Franceand Netherlandsoperation, and gains from the sale of our Memphisstores to a franchisee. Our bottom line earnings, our diluted EPS and report ona GAAP basis, were $0.17 in the third quarter. This is a $0.22 decline, asreported of $0.39 in the prior year period. In the third quarter of 2006 webenefited $0.04 from a $2.7 million after tax gain on the sale of thecompany-owned operations in Franceand the Netherlands. The company’s recent recap had a significant impact onongoing interest expense. As a result of the higher debt levels, this resultedin a decrease in diluted EPS of $0.13, as Dave mentioned. Our cash interestexpense for the quarter was $23.5 million at a rate of 6.06%. Our book interestexpense, related to our debt facility for the quarter, was $25.6 million or arate of 6.6%. Our total interest expense for the quarter, including letters ofcredit, capital leases and accrued interest on a Fin 48 tax liabilities is$26.5 million. This was the first quarter with the full impact of our new capitalstructure. This gives you a good picture of our ongoing interest costsfor our 12-week quarter. Keep in mind, though, that the fourth quarter has 16weeks. Including the effect of the items discussed above, the additional $0.04decrease in diluted EPS was driven by lower team USA margins, about $0.02; adecrease in distribution profits from lower volumes, that was also worth about$0.02; and again, from the 2006 sale of the eleven corporate stores in Memphis,worth about $0.01. This was all set, in part, by the continued strongperformance in our international operations, which was a plus of a little morethan $0.01.  Additionally, our effective cash rate was 39.8% in the thirdquarter. This was because, during the third quarter, we recorded a $300thousand dollar net reserve, related to ongoing state income matters. 2006 waspositively impacted by a tax benefit, associated with the sale of ourcompany-owned operations in Franceand Netherlands.We continue to anticipate that the normalized tax rate of 37% to38% is still agood target over the foreseeable future.  As discussed in our earnings release, the companyre-purchased approximately 1.1 million shares of its common stock under theopen market re-purchase program. This cost $18 million during the thirdquarter. These shares, re-purchases on their own, impacted diluted EPS lessthan $0.01 for the quarter. Our OMR program was implemented, refined and madefully operational last quarter, and we will continue to be opportunistic buyersin the market. The purchases made during the quarter, when considered on anannual basis pro forma, would impact EPS positively by about $0.02. 
 : We continue to be very comfortable with our new debt leveland we have seen no economic affects on our current financing or on our capitalstructure due to recent turbulence in the credit markets. Since our rates andterms are fixed, we expect the same conditions during the balance of our fiveyear term.  In closing, despite a challenging quarter, we continue togenerate positive free cash flow andhave proven that we will utilize this in a manner that is most beneficial toour company and shareholders. We remain focused on managing cost and creatingshareholder value during these challenging times in our domestic operation.  This concludes the financial update, and once again, we wantto thank you for your time today. We appreciate your support and would like toanswer your questions. 
Operator: Your first question comes from John Glass with CIBC WorldMarket.
David Mounts: John, is that you?
John Glass - CIBCWorld Markets : This is John Glass. Can you hear me? 
David Mounts: Yea, we can hear you now.
John Glass – CIBCWorld Markets: Wonderful. Okay. Sorry about that to John Ivankoe. Could youhelp put the quarter in context of the industry in the U.S.Did you feel like you outperformed the pizza category, underperformed it, or isthis sort of what everyone else has been doing as well?
David Mounts: It’s the obvious question. We, you know, we subscribe to theCREF data and it’s the best data that we have, and it’s certainly, you know, Ithink it’s good directional date. Our sense is that the category was totallynegative as it relates to traffic growth. Everybody was trying to inch ticketup in light of it, cost situation, but we can’t see anything in the data thatleads us to believe that there has been anything other than a significantreduction in consumer spending in the category, and the traffic is down acrossthe board. 
David Glass – CIBCWorld Markets:  Okay. You talked about getting franchisees traffic better.You talked about that last quarter. Is there anything different in what you’veseen them doing this quarter versus last quarter, or is there anything new ordifferent in how you’re going to help them going forward, drive their trafficstronger?
David Mounts: Well, listen, the status quo isn’t working. I think some ofthe things we are doing with leadership changes, and some of the internalprograms that we have launched and trying to excite the franchise body withsome new brand positioning, and the new energy that’s going to come fromadvertising agency; all those things, in their own way, are a function oftrying to shake things up a little bit and create some backpressure on ourfranchise group.  These are unprecedented times for us, both in terms of costinflation and the fact that we’re having a hard time growing our sales. As youknow, for many many years, it wasn’t a function of whether we were in positivesales, it was a function of how positive they were going to be. And one of thethings we’re really trying to coach this system through is how do you react tothis adversity and not do things that are detrimental to the growth of thebusiness.  It’s not a time to be cutting back on marketing activitiesor cutting back on marketing spend, or cutting back on technology spend. Thisis the time you have to invest because it’s war out there, and whoever getsahead of the curve is going to be the one that’s going to get the benefit. So,again, as I’ve said in my kind of prepared remarks, we’ve got a lot offranchisees who are getting it right. They’re growing their sales in thisperiod and they’re doing well. We just don’t have enough of them; and that gapthat exists between the franchisees and team USA right now is the elephant inthe room, and we’re going about the business in every way we know how ofgetting that fixed. 
David Glass – CIBCWorld Market: I see. Now just one last question, David Mounts, you hadmentioned a cheese contract. Can you talk about any details? Is it an absoluteprice or is it a collar? You know, how much volatility should we still expectin cheese prices with this contract in place?
David Mount: Yea, we think the volatility, the only way I can reallyanswer that because the nature of that contract is that it’s confidential,John; but I can give you a sense for volatility. We think the volatility wouldbe down about a third. 
David Glass – CIBCWorld Markets:  Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Ivankoe.
David Mount:  John, can you hear us?
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan :
 :
David Mount: Well you know, I’ve got 1,275 answers to that question.
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan : Okay.
David Mount: Again, there are people who have done it well; there arepeople who have done it better than team USA,but we have a lot of smaller operators out there who, you know, have kind of ahistorical reflex and have been in a pattern of behavior. And what we’refinding is, in these highly unprecedented times, it’s more difficult than Ithought it was going to be to get them to understand that they have to reallysignificantly change the direction of how they’re marketing in their localmarket area. 
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan : Okay.
David Mount: And so it’s taken longer than I thought it was going totake. It’s a bigger challenge than I thought it was going to be, and truthfullythe target keeps moving because it seems like, ah, you know, the cost pressurescontinue to spiral in a upward direction. Frankly, at the end of the secondquarter I didn’t believe it could get any worse. 
David Mount: Yea.
David Mount: When I look at the commodity charts, and it’s gotten worse.  [TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES] -- was increased from $3.00 to $3.50 a bushel at $9.00; andit happened remarkably fast in a period of a short number of months. Now I’llturn things over to David and he can tell you what the implications of thathave been to our distribution centers and, in fact, our operators. 
David Brandon: Yes. John, we, you know, we have been on a cycle where wehave set pricing on our wheat on an annual basis historically, because ithasn’t, there hasn’t been much variability, and it’s worked out well foreverybody. We buy about 5.5 million bushels of wheat a year; so every time theprice changes a dollar on a bushel, you know, we’re gonna feel a $5.5 millionimpact, both us and our franchisees in our distribution system the way itworks, because of the profit share. So, you know, when you start to comparethose price changes, you see a larger impact.  One of the things that we will have to implement next yearis we will have to go to more frequent pricing during the year. We think thatquarterly pricing makes the most sense at this stage but we’re going tocontinue to evaluate all our options. For sure, we will not be going withannual pricing and distribution, so we won’t be in a situation where we werethis year, where we had pricing in place for the year.  We made the decision, you know, given all the other pricechanges that are impacting our franchisees, not to go in and amend pricesmid-year, because our franchisees have built their budgets and their plansbased on what we told them pricing was going to be on dough balls for the year.So we’re taking, especially in this last quarter, we’re taking an impact herethat, you know, we didn’t anticipate and wasn’t planned; and, of course, someof that impact is also absorbed by our franchisees in their rebate payments.But, you know, we clearly have to get, you know, in an environment like this wehave to get to a more frequent adjustment of pricing and let these costs moreflow through, like we do with our other commodities. 
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan: Okay. I definitely did notice, the distribution income wasabsolutely lower than what we thought it was going to be. What was the primarycontributors to that?
David Mount: Wheat was the primary contributor to that.
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan: Okay.
David Mount:
 :
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan: It’s kind of a bigger question but again, we talk aboutdough balls and cheese, I mean, the franchisees really are feeling a lot ofpressure. I mean, have they really begun to push back on you, saying hey, yourknow what; we know we share in half of the distributions profitability, youknow, we think that number is, you know, should be greater? In other words, arethe franchisees trying to take from the corporate now, you know, versus, youknow, trying to make money from the customers, if that’s a good question?
David Mount: John, that’s the end of the case. We, you know, we have, ourdistribution business is managed and the structure is set up where there isabsolute alignment between us and thefranchisees. We have franchisees that serve on our distribution advisory board,they are involved in and they understand the realities of the business and howthey’re affecting us, and they are part of that decision making process. And ithas been historically, and will continue to be, a very collaborative process,you know, with both sides incentivized to try to grow distribution EBITDA inways that manage the supply chain more efficiently. 
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan:  Okay, very good. And a final unrelated question from me. Youknow, the cash balance is, from my opinion, high, given what your free cashflow yield. I mean, could you explain why that is, I mean, what that for ourcredit agreements and, you know, is it possible to assume that all of your freecash flow in the future will be used to buy back stock, or is there a necessityto put aside more funds for the debt holders. 
David Mount: No, you’re certainly seeing, you’re seeing an abnormallyhigh, it’s a very good question John. We’re sitting with $115 million in cash.The way that breaks down, about $100 million of it is tied just into the ABS interms of reserves and, really, timing of the interest payment. Let me walk youthrough a breakdown of the core of that $115 million. $15 million had to be setaside as a capitalized, in the new franchisor entity, to quality for theuniform franchise exemption; so, in other words, that we can continue tofranchise throughout the country as a well-capitalized franchisor. So that is aone time increase in capital and in cash that is, at this point, appears to bepermanent; but we’re going to evaluate that over time and see if other assetsalso could qualify for that exemption.  But right now we think it’s mostly cash. We have $55.2million that’s set aside right now for our interest payment that we’re going tomake on October 25. Remember that the ABS interest payments are quarterly,based on a calendar basis; and, as you know, we have, you know, 12, 12 and 16 in terms of our quarters. So you endup with a little bit of a time difference; and on October 25 we’re going towrite a $55.2 million cheque to our note holders for all the interest that wasdue them for the pro-rated second quarter and all of the first quarter. We alsohave $26.9 million that is set aside in interest reserve, basically theequivalent of a little more than one-quarter’s payment, to the note holders;and that was really kind of a cushion set-up in the structure that was to beevaluated after the first two quarters of interest payments. 
 : So those are the two main things, and then this newfranchise unit. So, when you take those into account, you’ve really only gotabout a little over $15 million left, which is probably more typical; and youshould expect to see us use that cash when it becomes available, from thereserve mechanism, and you should expect to see us continue to use cash flow topay down our, and to buy back our stock, rather. 
John Ivankoe – JPMorgan: Okay. All right, that’s a great answer. Thank you so muchfor that. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein
Jeffrey Bernstein -Lehman Brothers :
David Mount: Jeff, are you there?
Jeffrey Bernstein -Lehman Brothers : Yes, can you hear me?
David Mount: We can. Go ahead. 
Jeffrey Bernstein -Lehman Brothers : Yes. Just first, the, kind of a bigger picture industryquestion. You mentioned CREF data and the impact on consumer spending. I wasjust wondering how you believe that the pizza category’s position relative tosome of your other QSR peers; and they had mentioned that, and of course thepizza category, and in another comment you said, you know, it’s more across theboard including more traditional QSR peers. I feel like, I have the feelingthat that pizza category is tracking more with casual dining whereas some ofyour quick service peers are performing better. Just wondering kind of how youthink about pizza versus the more traditional fast food in this environment?
David Mount:
 : When you look across total QSR, which includes the lunch daypart, the breakfast day part, sandwich guys, people who seem to be operating inthe party check mode of $6, $7, $8, which is kind of the overall average forQSR, the ones that are at the low end of that average check range seem to bedoing better; the lunch guys, the burger guys, the breakfast folks; and thoseof us who are operating at the $16, $17, $18 average checkout, we seem to behaving the most difficulty in this environment, and that’s pretty intuitivewhen you consider kind of how the consumer is behaving and what their grocerybill is now when they’re going off and buying groceries in the grocery store,and the situation with their variable rate loans, and all the other things thatwe’re reading about.  You know, those folks who are operating at the higher end ofthe ticket range are probably going to be more impacted than the guys who areoffering value menus at lunch at very low ticket. 
Jeffrey Bernstein -Lehman Brothers : I think it’s pretty obvious that I get for $16 to $18feeding a few people, whereas $6 to $8 is probably feeding one, whether there’sa way to somehow kind of reposition in a tough environment, focus more onindividual servings or whatever best works, kind of bring someone in that mightnot be looking to feed three or four but rather just one. 
David Mount: Well, listen. Value, we still have a great value message.You know, let’s face it, for less than $20 you can feed a family of five oftentimes,with some of our bundled deals. It’s still a great value message and, you know,we typically do reasonably well during these times. But in the past, when we’vehad these times of traffic slowdowns, one of the tools that we reach to veryquickly is to stimulate consumption, stimulate trial by going out and shoutingvalue in a very very bold way. That’s difficult to do when virtually everycommodity that you’re buying is at a ten year historical high.  And so part one of the tough conundrums that we have rightnow is that the easiest level for us to pull is a difficult one for many of ouroperators to pull the stimulae traffic, because we are in a very very unusualunprecedented cost environment. So the dancing on the head of a pin part of it,how do we shout value and how do we get the attention that stimulates anactivity in terms of traffic in an environment where we’re getting, you know,bombarded with cost increases. This too will pass. You know, I don’t think thatthere’s any element of this that we can’t work our way through and that we’renot working our way through. But it’s a tricky set of issues. 
Jeffrey Bernstein -Lehman Brothers :
 : 
David Mount: Yes, without getting into details and violating kind of ouragreements with our supplier, I would just tell you that the whole objective ofthat was to put ourselves in a position when cheese prices spike high, asthey’ve shown a propensity to do in the most recent past, we’re not going toexperience as high a rise. And then when cheese prices settle back, which theywill because they always do, you know, obviously at that point we’ll be payinga premium to what we did in the past; but we’ve eliminated about a third ofthat roller coaster ride that could be very difficult for our operators to planaround. 
Jeffrey Bernstein -Lehman Brothers : You eliminated a third or you got it down to a third?
David Mount: It’s eliminated a third. 
Jeffrey Bernstein -Lehman Brothers : Got it.
David Mount: There will still be volatility. There’s no way to avoidthat.
Jeffrey Bernstein -Lehman Brothers : Yep. Okay. And then just, actually one other thing. Youmentioned the franchise disparity. I’m just wondering what the commonalitiesare, if any, in terms of why some are performing better than others. Is there,do you see an overwhelming geographic strength or weakness in any areas, or isit it’s working for some but isn’t working for others?
David Mount: We really don’t and we’ve looked at all of thosecorrelations. It’s not geographic, it’s not urban versus rural, it’s not largeoperator versus small operator. It’s all based on, frankly, the passion and theexecution at the store level. And our job, and we understand it, it’s been ourjob for 45 years, is to get our franchisees all on the same page with the toolsin their hand that allow them to be successful and keep them passionatelymoving in the direction of growing their business.  It’s not enough just to give them a store concept and, youknow, list of operating guidelines and a brand and some advertising support.We’ve got to get them waking up every morning and going to the stores that theyown and putting the teams in place and engaging with their customers andexecuting against the business model at a level that supersedes what theircompetitors do in that market. It’s hand-to-hand combat, particularly in thisenvironment; and our job is to make that happen. And obviously, in theenvironment we’re in, that’s one of those “says easy” “does hard” kind ofthings; but it’s something that we’re good at, we’ve shown the ability to do inthe past, and we’ll get it fixed. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - LehmanBrothers : I know you had mentioned, I guess, the new ad agency andwhether you gave you an early diagnostic to say this is direction might take itin that’s different from what you have been doing, or..?
David Mount: Yes, you’re going to see a remarkable change in our brandfocus starting the beginning of the year; and, you know, obviously we’re notgoing to telegraph that at this particular time it’s still a work in process.But I can tell you that if you really sit back and look at kind of where thecategory has been operating, we’ve all been launching our limited time onlyoffers and putting spends behind the, you know, kind of, this product and pricefocus. If you really look at how that’s performing, and certainly theenvironment we’re in right now, nobody is using that to really drive trafficand sustain any growth.  So we’re looking at something that we can own and executeagainst and sustain at a higher level, than just in-and-out items kind of habitthat everybody’s developed; and we’re kind of anxious to get that moving andmore to come early next year. 
Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers : Great, thanks very much. 
Operator: Your next question comes from Glen Petraglia – Citigroup
David Mount: Glen, go ahead.
Glen Petraglia –Citigroup: Dave, I was hoping you could, and I know this is a questionthat’s come up on past calls; but, you know, clearly your franchisees have, youknow, scaled back their local market initiative; and I’m wondering if you needto change the break-out of the ad dollars in terms of how much are allocatedfor local versus national market?
David Mount: Well, we have. I don’t know when we last talked about thisbut, as you recall, you know, we got into, I think we got into a bit of a trapwhere we believed the more money we had in Ann Arbor to spend at the nationallevel, the better that was going to be. We found that there’s probably, likeeverything else, a point where, you know, too much is too much; and I thinkwhat we did is we began to bring too much of the accountability and too much ofthe marketing focus in a centralized environment in Ann Arbor, and that’s notgood.  So, as we go into 2008, there is going to be more balance inthe marketing budgets and there will be more dollars available at the localmarket level, to give resources to the franchisees around their local market,to be able to engage in things that they think will be more applicable to theirbusiness and their competitive set; and I actually think that’s a positivething. So, 2008, the media calendar will still be filled with many many weeksof national television and national offers; and in support of some of thethings that Crispin is working at, but Crispin will also be developing toolsthat will be administered at the local level in a marketing way, to allow ourfranchisees to do things that they think will work in their business, andthat’s a good thing. 
Glen Petraglia –Citigroup: Okay, and David Mount, in terms of your new role, given yourbackground at UPS and knowing that everybody there has quite an operationsfocus, you know, what sort of efficiencies do you think you can bring or thatyou’ve seen thus far, that would enable you to squeeze this zone a little bitmore?
David Mount: Yea, you know, it’s a great question and it’s one that I’mlooking forward to getting in and digging in and finding opportunities. As youprobably appreciate, I’ve kind of got one foot, as we wrap up this quarter infinance, and one foot into my new job. My focus right now is on leading my teamand understanding the challenges that they have and where I can be helpful tothem; and I haven’t come to any conclusions, you know, at this point, butreally doing a lot of listening and learning. And I think that will be thefocus for the while. As we find opportunities, you know, we’ll communicatethose to you, and Dave will communicate those to you on subsequent discussions.
Glen Petraglia –Citigroup: Okay. And just lastly, most of my other questions have beenanswered already. What sort of, what percentage of your orders are comingon-line now and how have you seen that change over the course of the lastcouple months, since you’ve begun to comment on on-line ordering opportunities?
David Mount: Yea, I want to be responsive without giving anybody the keysto the kingdom. I would just tell you that if the stores that have had on-lineordering the longest are showing a propensity or getting that mix into thedouble digits, which we think is, you know, meaningful and important, and thereis a fair amount of variability, depending on the demographics of that store’slocation; but what we see is that this is a material channel for many of ourcustomers who enjoy ordering that way.  If and when we get to that double digit mix mode, it doesvery good things for our business. Team USAbeing further down that track, certainly some of the benefits that we’re seeingin terms of their execution and their sales growth, we believe is attributableto that.  We also have seen that in some cases there are tactics wecan use to drive that number, and we’re doing some interesting testing andgetting some interesting results from that as well. But beyond that, we just donot talk about what we’re doing there because some of it we’re pretty excitedabout and none of it we want to share with our competitors. 
Glen Petraglia –Citigroup: Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ashley Woodruff with FriedmanBillings Ramsey.
David Mount : Go ahead Ashley.
Ashley Woodruff -Friedman Billings Ramsey: Hi, can you hear me?
David Mount:  Yep.
Ashley Woodruff -Friedman Billings Ramsey: Okay. Could you talk about, you know, I guess the transitionyou’ve seen throughout the year where you, you know, kind of entered the firstquarter with positive traffic, the second quarter, you know, positive, and thenobviously things dramatically slowed down in the third quarter.  Can you tie that, I mean, did it really trend kind ofexactly with what the overall pizza, or fast food data that you have for CREFshowed, or did you see a real change based on, you know, what your currentpromotion was. They have a follow-up on that. Can you talk about how you feelabout the pipeline and really, how you feel about how the promotional pipelinehas been over the past, you know, 12 to 18 months in general?
David Mount:  Yea. First of all, we did not have positive traffic in thefirst quarter this year. We had negative sales. Domestic was negative 2.9 andit was negative traffic in the environment for us. In the second quarter we hadpositive sales of primarily ticket. Just a little bit of traffic but mostlyticket. And then, you obviously know the situation in the third quarter. The CREFdata would lead us to believe that if you go back to basically the middle partof 2005, that the vast majority of the growth that has occurred in the categoryhas been ticket.  In fact, CREF would tell you there has only been twoquarters since the middle of 2005 where there has been traffic growth. One was1% growth and one was 2% growth. Now, again, CREF can only do what CREF can do.This is a big category. We have some 59,000 pizza shops and CREF is not in a position to be able to be able toreally have their finger on the pulse of exactly what’s going on. Butdirectionally, I think it’s good guidance and it tells me that the wholetraffic growth situation has been one that has been somewhat structural in therecent past in the category, and everybody has been kind of living off ticket.So when you keep moving the ticket up on your customer and then your customerstarts cutting back in their spending as a result of some of these most recentfactors, and you’ve got cost pressures, which make it difficult to go morevalue than you’re already at, you kind of see the world that we’re navigatingthrough.  CREF would show that the party check average, if you go backand you take a look at really the last five years, that the guest check averagein the pizza category has increased about $2.5. And if you back and you lookedat the, you know, that’s the implementation of delivery charges and that’sgrowing the business through check and opposed to traffic. And I think what’shappening is the consumer has to catch up with these new price points. Pricepoints will continue to move but we’ve got to be creative enough in the contextof all that, to figure out a way to continue to generate some new interest inthe brand and some traffic in our store; and probably, in the currentenvironment, as I said earlier, that’s going to come from taking share fromsomebody else and winning the battle at the local level, than it is anythingthat’s going to dramatically change the current status of the category.
Ashley Woodruff -Friedman Billings Ramsey: In the promotions that you’ve done, have you seen a similarkind of mix in terms of order incidents to what you saw, say a couple yearsago, in, you know, some of your stronger promotions or..?
David Mount:  Yea, interestingly enough, the limited time only promotionsthat we’ve put out there this year have, for the most part, achieved mixedlevels that were very typical with objective, very typical with test marketexperience; and so we don’t think the products were bad or poorly accepted ordidn’t have good re-purchase. In fact, they did exactly what they did in tests,in terms of achieving mix. So people saw the commercials, they reacted to them,they tried the products, they re-purchased the products. All that is fine butwhat isn’t fine is it isn’t driving traffic, it isn’t bringing people into thecategory that weren’t there before. And that’s the remarkable change, I think,over the last year, year and a half, with a lot of the limited time only’s; andwhen I see what the folks are doing at Pizza Hut and Papa John’s, I get theimpression that they’re in the same situation. We’re all inventing the latesttwist on pizza toppings or the latest brand name to put a limited time onlyoffer; but it sure doesn’t seem to be driving category growth for any of us. 
Ashley Woodruff -Friedman Billings Ramsey: Okay. And then shifting to the franchisees, I think you usedto say, maybe this goes back a couple of years, that the average EBITDA marginsfor a franchisee is, after royalties, right around 10% to 11%. Where is thattrending on average now, given all the, you know, cost pressures that we’reseeing this year. 
David Mount: Well, we rolled up all the P&Ls from 2006 because,obviously, we won’t know this year’s results until we roll them all up, youknow, several months, into next year. But, as we looked at the impact of 2006and the fact that it was a negative sales year for us, the first one in 13years, the average franchise store incurred 0.5 point EBITDA margin hit. Sothat’s negative, that’s bad, that’s inconsistent with our objectives but itstill puts our operators in a cash-on-cash return mode that, you know, explainswhy people are still out there building stores and why people are stillcommitted to the business. It’s still a great business, it’s still a greatbusiness model; but, you know, obviously we want margins to expand, we don’twant them to contract, and the way to do that is to get more traffic and salesthrough the front door. 
Ashley Woodruff -Friedman Billings Ramsey: Okay, and then just one last question on, you know, use ofcash for shares purchase versus debt paydown, I think, you know, yourinclination originally was to buy stock, at least in the first couple years atthis new facility. But, given the market, I think, pretty significant sentimentshift, against companies with a significant amount of debt. Has that changed atall your thoughts in terms of the timing of paying down your debt. 
David Mount: No, no, we’re very comfortable with our capital structure,extremely comfortable; and we purposely left room and got an authorization torepurchase stock; and we’ve said all along we’re going to be opportunistic; andbased on what I’m seeing on my screen today there is plenty of opportunity totake advantage of people who don’t get the long term view. 
Ashley Woodruff -Friedman Billings Ramsey: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley with Bear Stearns.
Joe Buckley - BearStearns : Could you quantify the pricing you’ve taken at the companystores and maybe talk about how much you have taken versus what you think thefranchisees have done so far?
David Mount:  Yea, Joe. As you know, we have been very reluctant and Ithink for a good reason, to not get into specifics about ticket versus trafficand what those numbers are; because, frankly, I’d love to have that for mycompetitors and follow those trends. I would just tell you that, kind of thephenomenon that we’re dealing with, which is just inconsistent with historicalnorms, is that in the third quarter team USAtook prices up higher than our franchisees and had a lower reduction of trafficgrowth. Now, make no mistake about it, team USAhad negative traffic, as did our franchisees, but to a lesser degree; and theirability to raise increases faster than the amount of negative traffic theyexperienced was what allowed them to be positive for the quarter. Ourfranchisees did not take as ambitious and as aggressive, and as what I wouldconsider to be strategic and tactical approach for raising prices. And, infact, their traffic fell further.  Now, that gives us a great story to tell when we go out toour franchisees and say, let us show you how we got more price in the business,which is exactly what this current situation calls for. At the same time itdoesn’t have to be detrimental to your traffic. And so that’s what we’re fastat work doing. You know, Patrick Doyle is on the road right now, meeting withfranchisees, sharing that information. So, we feel like, you know, there is away to get there and we’ve demonstrated that; we’ve got to communicate it;we’ve got to implement it and execute against it. But again, we do this as ashort term challenge that we’re working our way through, that will have a goodlong term result.
Joe Buckley - BearStearns : Okay. The question on the global retail sales number, howmuch was that influenced by currency during the quarter?
David Mount:  Yea, for the total company it’s about 2% overall. There isabout a $25 million FX in terms of the currency. 
Joe Buckley - BearStearns : Okay. Then, lastly, this may be kind of a moot question withthe new cheese contract but will you be hedging again in the future or will thenew cheese contract kind of negate the need to do that?
David Mount:  Yea, the lower volatility, you know, in the new contract,will negate a lot of the need to do it. I wouldn’t say we would never hedgeagain. You know, we always like to keep a tool box open and put all the toolsin there we can; but clearly, with this new structure, there is a lot less needfor that. 
Joe Buckley - BearStearns : Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: At this time there are no further questions. Are there anyclosing remarks?
David Mount: Well, my only closing remarks are to make sure I emphasizeduring these challenging times that I want to emphasize the strength of ourbusiness model. If Lynn would havelet me, I would have put a headline on our press release that said, you know,takes a beating and keeps on ticking, because we continue to generate cash andwe continue to do very well in a very very difficult environment; and I thinkit does speak to the strength of the business model.  Our total operating margins remained relatively stable atabout $85 million, which is only down 2% from last year’s level; and in theenvironment we’re in, we just think it speaks very very hard and fast to thestrength of our model and, in fact, why this business has prevailed andsucceeded over such a long period of time.  So we continue to be very committed to fix what’s broken andget momentum back in our domestic sales and get our franchise business ignited,and I’ll look forward to giving you an update at the end of our fourth quarter. Thank you all for your time and interest in Domino’s Pizza.
Operator: Ladies and gentleman, this does conclude today’s conferencecall. You may now disconnect.
