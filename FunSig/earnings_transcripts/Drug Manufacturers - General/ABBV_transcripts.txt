===== 2025 Q1  (2025-04-25 21:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Ms. Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer and Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Michael: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. AbbVie is off to an excellent start to the year with first quarter results exceeding expectations across several of our therapeutic areas. We also continued to advance our promising internal pipeline and add external opportunities to further strengthen our business and long term outlook. Turning to our first quarter performance, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.46 which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were more than $13.3 billion nearly $550 million ahead of our expectations. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our ex-Humira platform, which delivered robust sales growth of more than 21%. Immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and anesthetics are all performing at or above our expectations. And we are well positioned to exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second full year following the US Humira LOE. Based on this strong performance, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 and now expect adjusted EPS between $12.09 and $12.29. As you are aware, there is speculation that sectoral tariffs could be forthcoming. Any related impact from these tariffs as well as other potential new or reciprocal tariffs have not been contemplated in our guidance. To the extent there is an impact, we believe it would be in line with our peers, given that AbbVie has an extensive manufacturing presence in the United States, including API, biologics, toxins and small molecules. And over the next decade, we anticipate investing more than $10 billion of capital in the US to support our volume growth and our expansion into new areas such as obesity. Turning back to our performance, I'm very pleased with the excellent progress we are making with several pipeline programs that have the potential to be meaningful sources of growth. These include Lutikizumab across several immunology indications, 383 in multiple myeloma and our next generation ADCs, including TmAb A for several solid tumor types and 706 for small cell lung cancer. We also continue to add depth to our pipeline with strategic transactions that can help drive growth in the next decade. This includes the recent acquisition of Nimble Therapeutics to expand our immunology portfolio with oral peptides as well as the license agreement with Gubra to develop an amylin analog for the treatment of obesity. Obesity represents a significant global health concern with high unmet need. This market will continue to evolve with improved offerings, and we believe our program with Gubra has the potential to deliver a differentiated asset. Going forward, we plan to invest further in obesity along with other opportunities across our existing five key growth areas. In summary, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we are well positioned for the long term. AbbVie has a clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, including a high single digit revenue CAGR through 2029. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.2 billion exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well, contributing $5.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 65%. I'm especially encouraged with our portfolio performance across IBD, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to capture significant share given their efficacy, safety and dosing profiles. In Crohn's disease, which is roughly two thirds of the overall IBD market, these two treatments together are capturing roughly one out of every two in play patients in the US and total prescription share is now in the mid-teens. Internationally, our Crohn's portfolio has achieved in-play leadership in nearly a dozen key countries. In ulcerative colitis, Skyrizi has already achieved the leading in-play share in the US following the launch in the second half of last year. Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are now capturing one out of every three in-play UC patients, a very strong leadership position for AbbVie. We are also seeing strong momentum across indications in dermatology and rheumatology as well. For Skyrizi, we continue to gain share in psoriatic disease, where we have achieved the leading in-play share of new and switching patients in nearly 30 countries and see substantial room for total share growth. For Rinvoq, we are seeing increasing prescription demand globally across each of the room indications as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis, the fastest growing immunology market, where we have two compelling head to head studies versus Dupixent. We are also preparing for the global launch of giant cell arteritis, another new source of growth for Rinvoq. We received European approval earlier this month and expect FDA approval soon. The addition of this indication further rounds out Rinvoq's rheumatology label and gives patients with GCA access to a new compelling oral therapeutic option. Overall, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive results across all of their approved indications, and we will be raising our full year sales guidance for both products. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion down 49.5% on an operational basis, below our expectations, primarily due to faster share erosion from biosimilar competition as well as further molecule compression in the US. As a result, we will be lowering our full year sales guidance for US Humira. Moving to Oncology, where total revenues were $1.6 billion exceeding our expectations. Imbruvica global sales were $738 million down 11.9%, reflecting competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global revenues were $665 million up 12.3% on an operational basis. This strong performance reflects continued momentum in CLL as well as shared leadership in frontline AML among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. We also have an emerging commercial portfolio in solid tumors. This includes Elahere, our leading ADC for ovarian cancer with global sales of $179 million as well as Teliso-V, a potential new medicine for late line non-small cell lung cancer patients with US Regulatory approval and commercialization expected in the next couple of months. Teliso-V will be supported by a dedicated sales force and medical affairs team, which will target academic and community cancer treatment centers to reinforce the importance of c-Met as a biomarker and build relationships that support our emerging solid tumor franchise. Turning now to aesthetics, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion down 10.2% on an operational basis. This was in line with our expectations. BOTOX Cosmetic global revenues were $556 million down 10.7% on an operational basis and Juvederm sales were $231 million down 20% on an operational basis. As we have seen over the last several quarters, economic headwinds have continued to impact market conditions. Based on the trends we are seeing, including a decline in recent consumer sentiment, we are moderating our assumptions for category growth globally and adjusting our full year sales guidance for aesthetics accordingly. While near term aesthetics market conditions remain challenging, the long term prospects for the category remain attractive, given high consumer interest and low penetration rates for facial injectables. I'm particularly excited about BoNT/E, our fast acting, short duration toxin, which we recently submitted for US Regulatory review. This first in class toxin represents a distinctive innovation for the treatment of glabellar lines and has the potential to be an important catalyst for new patient activation into the facial aesthetics category. We anticipate commercialization next year. Moving now to neuroscience, where total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion up 17% on an operational basis, with all key products exceeding our expectations. VRAYLAR global sales were $765 million up 10.3%, reflecting share capture in both Bipolar I disorder and adjunctive major depression. We continue to get very positive feedback on VRAYLAR's profile in terms of dosing flexibility, low sedation and the ability to treat a full spectrum of symptoms. We are very competitively positioned with our migraine portfolio, where all three of our therapies continue to deliver double digit operational growth. BOTOX Therapeutic global revenues were $866 million, up 17%. UBRELVY global sales were $240 million up 18%. And QLIPTA global revenues were $193 million, up 48.3%. And in Parkinson's disease, VYALEV global sales were $63 million reflecting continued strong uptake in Japan and Europe. We are also pleased with the early launch feedback in the US, where revenues are expected to ramp gradually over the next couple of quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination. Lastly, we are making excellent progress with the development of Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease. This first in class D1D5 selective dopamine agonist has a favorable benefit risk profile and the potential to differentiate in several areas, such as sedation and impulse control. Tavapadon could potentially be used as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease as well as an adjunctive therapy to levodopa for more advanced patients, which would be a complementary addition to our existing PD portfolio with VYALEV and DUOPA. We expect to submit Tavapadon for regulatory review later this year with commercialization expected in 2026. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the execution and strong momentum across our commercial portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights.
Roopal Thakkar: Thank you, Jeff. I will start with immunology. We received European approval for Rinvoq in GCA and expect FDA approval soon. We remain on track for several important data readouts this year as well including Phase III data for Rinvoq in alopecia areata and vitiligo and data from Skyrizi's head to head study in psoriasis versus SOTIQ2 [ph]. Our early and mid-stage immunology pipeline continues to advance. Recent initiations include a Phase II study evaluating Skyrizi in combination with Lutikizumab in psoriatic arthritis and a Phase I study for our next generation TL1A antibody, which is designed to have less frequent dosing compared to other TL1As in development and will be evaluated in combination with Skyrizi in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This summer, we will start a Phase II study evaluating a combination of Lutikizumab and our anti CD40 Ravagalimab in rheumatoid arthritis. Moving to our ADCs and oncology, we anticipate accelerated approval in the second quarter for Teliso-V as a monotherapy in previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with high c-Met expression. This is a segment of lung cancer with high unmet need and when approved, Teliso-V will be the first c-Met directed ADC for these patients. We're also making good progress with tmAb A, our next generation c-Met ADC, a Phase 2 dose optimization study evaluating tmAb A with a PD-1 inhibitor as a frontline combination therapy in EGFR wild type non-small cell lung cancer was recently initiated. In the EGFR mutant segment, we plan to initiate studies for tmAb A as a monotherapy in the second line setting and in combination with Osimertinib in the first line setting. Preliminary Phase 1 results will be presented at the upcoming ASCO meeting. This year, Phase 2 data from our CRC study evaluating tmAb A in combination with Bevacizumab will be available, which could enable a Phase 3 study in an all comers population. Progress also continues with ABBV-706 in small cell lung cancer. Recall, this ADC utilizes the same topo warhead and linker technology as tmAb A, but with an antibody that targets SEZ6. In the Phase 1 study, 706 was efficacious across doses with an objective response rate of approximately 60% in patients with relapsed or refractory small cell lung cancer. Based on maturing duration of response and progression free survival data, we plan to advance 706 into a trial in a relapsed refractory population and a dose optimization study in combination with a PD-L1 in the frontline with the goal of establishing a chemo sparing regimen as a new standard of care. In the area of hematologic oncology, the data readout remains on track for the Phase 3 VENCLEXTA MDS trial. And if positive, our regulatory submissions would follow later in the year. A regulatory submission for PIVEC in BPDCN is also planned for this year. We continue to make good progress with our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma. Recruitment is going well in the Phase 3 monotherapy study in later lines, and we are on track to be fully enrolled by early next year. Additionally, we continue to evaluate 383 in various combinations, including with Pomalyst, Revlimid, DARZALEX and Iverdemine [ph]. We'll begin seeing data from these combinations next year, which could enable Phase 3 lines of therapy. Now moving to neuroscience. Interim data from the long term TEMPO-4 Phase 3 study continued to support Tavapadon’s favorable benefit risk profile. Efficacy in both early and advanced Parkinson's patients was maintained beyond a year and the safety profile was consistent with that observed in the previous Phase III studies with no new safety concerns identified. Rates of adverse events of special interest remained low with impulse control disorder and peripheral edema less than 1%, dyskinesia approximately 2% and sedation less than 5%. These results underscored Tavapadon's potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with Parkinson's disease. Our regulatory application is planned for later in the year. Moving to other areas of our pipeline. In aesthetics, the regulatory application for our rapid onset short acting toxin BoNT/E was recently submitted. We also began the clinical program to evaluate co administration of BoNT/E and BOTOX, which has the potential to be co-formulated as a novel product, offering the combined benefits of rapid onset and Botox like duration. In obesity, our partner, Gubra recently announced positive interim results from the first part of a multiple ascending dose study for our long acting amylin analog ABBV-295. This initial phase of the study tested one and two milligrams dosed once weekly for six weeks in healthy, lean and overweight patients. The study showed 295 performed well, demonstrating a dose dependent mean weight loss compared to placebo and a tolerability profile consistent with the results from the single ascending dose study. Mean weight loss in the two milligram cohort, which had a mean BMI of 24 was 7.8% compared to a weight gain of 2% in the placebo arm on day 43. The second phase of this study is ongoing and is evaluating higher doses in overweight and obese patients with 12 week dosing. Titration and longer dosing intervals will also be assessed. Full data from this part of the study are expected next year. To summarize, significant progress continues with our pipeline and we look forward to important data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Reents: Starting with our first quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46 which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.13 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were more than $13.3 billion reflecting robust growth of 9.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was 84.1% of sales. Adjusted R&D expense was 15.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 24.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.3% of sales, which includes a 1.9% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $627 million. The adjusted tax rate was 14.2%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.09 and $12.29. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $59.7 billion an increase of $700 million. This reflects an estimated 0.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth. This updated revenue forecast includes the following approximate assumptions for several of our key products. We now expect Skyrizi global revenues of $16.5 billion an increase of $600 million reflecting share gains in psoriasis and IBD. Rinvoq global sales of $8.2 billion, an increase of $300 million reflecting momentum across all approved indications. US Humira revenues of $3.5 billion a decrease of $500 million reflecting higher erosion from biosimilar competition as well as further molecule compression. BOTOX Therapeutic global sales of $3.6 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting growth in chronic migraine and other indications. Total oral CGRP revenues of $2.2 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting strong prescription demand. Imbruvica global revenues of $2.8 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting lower erosion. Venclexta global sales of $2.7 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting continued uptake in both CLL and AML across our key countries. And for aesthetics, we now expect global sales of $5.1 billion as we are moderating our assumptions for market growth globally. As a result, total sales guidance for BOTOX and Juvederm will each be lower by roughly $100 million. Moving to the P&L for 2025, we continue to forecast full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.2 billion. We now expect adjusted R&D expense of approximately $8.9 billion reflecting additional investment in our robust pipeline for long term growth. We also now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales, in line with our previous expectations after including the 0.4% unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the first quarter. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15 billion. This reflects an estimated 0.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 49.5%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.26 and $3.30 This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Our guidance is based on current trade rules and does not reflect the impact of any additional trade policy shifts, including pharmaceutical sector tariffs. While it's difficult to quantify in the absence of actual policy details, it's worth noting any related unfavorability in 2025 would reflect a partial year given the timeline for 232 investigation. We are actively preparing for a number of potential scenarios and would expect to put into place mitigation strategies as we have more information. Relative to these dynamics, I would also highlight that AbbVie has a significant US manufacturing presence that spans 11 sites with plans to add four new manufacturing plants to our network, expanding our production for API, drug product, peptides and devices in the United States. As we continue to invest and grow our US operational footprint, we believe a more competitive tax policy building on what was accomplished through 2017 tax reform will encourage a sustainable shift towards US Manufacturing over the long term. In closing, I'm very pleased with the excellent start to the year. We are demonstrating strong momentum across the portfolio and continue to be well positioned to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two.
Operator: For our first question, we'll go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Great. Thanks for the question and congrats on the results.
Chris Schott: Just two for me. Maybe first on Skyrizi and Rinvoq, obviously some big step up in the guidance here. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on which of the indications are most attributable to the upside we're seeing right now? And maybe just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, maybe particularly Tremfya more broadly launching in IBD and how you're thinking about that dynamic? And then just my second question was on second immunology on Humira. Can you talk a bit more about how you're thinking about the tail for Humira in light of some of the erosion that you're seeing this year?
Scott Reents: Chris, this is Scott. I'll start with kind of where we saw the increase attribute to for the various indications and I'll turn to Jeff for your other questions. So we raised Skyrizi by $600 million to $16.5 billion and that split between $200 million in psoriatic and $400 million in IBD indications. And then with respect to Rinvoq, we raised that $300 million and that's across all of the approved indications. So you can attribute that to $100 million for rheumatology, $100 million for derm and the remaining $100 million for IBD.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thanks, Chris. It's Jeff. And maybe I'll give some sense. We're obviously very, very pleased with the performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq in immunology as you've seen from the report. Maybe to give some perspective, it's not uncommon to start to see in class competition. We've seen that in psoriasis. We've seen that across the board. And maybe I'll just give a little bit of perspective over sort of the historical dynamics that we've seen with the IL-23 category. So for example, if you go back to like 2018, 2019 when the IL-23s were starting to come in psoriasis, the total patient share at that time in the early days was about 7% of the IL-23 class. Now it's over 60%. And if we look at where IBD is, obviously, we launched first with Skyrizi and Crohn's and everything's recently launching here in UC, it's about 7% of the total patient share in IBD. So you can imagine as we start to watch what this category is going to mean to transform IBD, we remain very confident. It's not a zero sum game. We feel very confident in our profile and what we're able to deliver if we look across UC, if we look across our head to head data versus sequence versus the other trials. And so net net, we see very, very strong momentum across the board, regardless of competitors that may come in. And then my thoughts on the Humira tail. Again, as I highlighted and Scott highlighted in his remarks, we are seeing a bit of faster erosions as the biosimilar start to play out. And this is, of course, the third year of the biosimilar event. So it's really not too surprising. We also do continue to see the molecule continue to erode. So as we look and we don't have full visibility and we'll be monitoring the 26 access as we go throughout the year. We do expect it to step down again. Just makes sense. That will be the fourth full year. So we'll have deeper visibility of that tail sometime over the course of the year. But as we said before, the real impact of the tail is when Humira does not have a meaningful headwind to our overall growth as a corporation. So we expect that to start to develop over that ’26 time period. Okay.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Terence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much. Congrats on the quarter. And maybe two questions for me as well. You alluded to some of the mitigation strategies you're taking with respect to tariffs potentially. Could you just elaborate a little bit more there in terms of what that means for maybe inventory and then any contemplation on any changes to IP domiciling? And the second question I had is on the amylin program there. I know you talked a little bit about next steps, but was just wondering if you can elaborate in terms of how much higher you're going on doses, what you'd expect that to translate to in efficacy and maybe the size of those cohorts, like how many more patients will we get in this next update?
Rob Michael: This is Rob. So Scott and I will handle your first question and Roopal will handle your second question. So just to, I think, back up and maybe talk about AbbVie's manufacturing network and then I can mention how we're thinking about potential mitigation. I think it's important to know that we have a broad footprint that allows us to assure supply for our patients around the world. And that's really why you've been able to see us avoid supply disruptions during events like the COVID pandemic. I mean and today, we have a robust US manufacturing network with more than 6,000 American workers across 11 sites. As I mentioned in my remarks, that includes manufacturing of API, biologics, toxins and small molecules. For example, our largest product Skyrizi is made in the US for the domestic market. And given our expected volume growth and our expansion into areas like obesity, as I mentioned, we'll continue increasing our US footprint with over $10 billion in planned capital investment during the next decade. In terms of potential mitigation, in the near term, we could take inventory management actions or secure alternate sources of API. We could also look at cost efficiencies and productivity initiatives as a source of mitigation, which we always do. I think what's more challenging is trying to pass the tariff impacts to our customers, especially with penalties in the government channel and with existing contracts in the commercial setting. So I don't see that as a viable source for mitigation. Longer term, we will add more US manufacturing capacity, which is part of the planned capital investment of over $10 billion. So specific to 2025, we would look to mitigate the impact as much as possible with a combination of supply chain actions, cost efficiencies and any additional overperformance from our growth platform. But in the meantime, we have enough confidence in the momentum of our business to raise our guidance this year, which should be viewed as a positive.
Scott Reents: David, with respect to IP, IP has been looked at, I think, when people try to assess the impact of potential tariffs on our sector. IP has been looked at as kind of a proxy as to what that impact might be. And certainly directionally, think that is something that would be somewhat telling. That said, when we look at our profile overall, Rob mentioned the strong US presence that we have, but we don't see our profile suggesting any sort of outsized impact for us as a company. The tax rate is something that you can look at, which is essentially when you think of the bookends of the minimum tax for earnings outside the US for tax earned in or income earned in the US that really kind of aligns with where that IP is structured. And that blending of your income kind of produces generally directionally your tax rate. You see us being relatively in line with our peers. And so that suggests that we have a similar IP profile from an overall perspective. I'd also just quickly point out that sometimes with Allergan, as that was a company that we redomiciled back to the US, it was a foreign headquarter company. Recall that Allergan was a series of several companies that were put together over a few years. And those companies all have a significant US presence as well. So Allergan's profile is not dissimilar from ours as a whole either. So I think when you think about that IP profile, it's important from a tariff perspective. It's also very important from a tax reform perspective. There was a lot of progress made in leveling the playing field for US companies in 2017 tax reform that did a lot of good things and really helped invest in the US as well as can create a competitive environment for our companies. We see it as an important piece of building upon that tax reform to encourage further and long term, as I mentioned in my remarks, sustainable investment. So I see a tax reform initiative building on 2017 coupled with tariffs as something that will encourage US manufacturing over the long term, we feel very good about our profile right now.
Roopal Thakkar: Hi, it's Roopal and I'll answer the 295 question regarding the multiple ascending dose study. Currently, what the data you've seen were at 1 mg and 2 mg and we have the opportunity here in this study to go several fold higher than the 2 milligrams. And we also have the opportunity to go beyond six weeks, namely around 12 weeks before we get into formal Phase 2b, which I would say around next year, we would go quite a bit longer. The sample size, what you've seen here maybe a little bit larger because of the multiple ascending dose format here. We'll see larger sample sizes once we get into the formal Phase 2b. The other opportunities here are also to look at titration at the 1 milligram or maybe even lower. We don't see any adverse events beyond suppression of appetite. So there's an opportunity to be able to start low and start titrating up to doses quite a bit higher than 2 milligrams, but we're open to watch this study and be flexible. The other important findings would be around muscle and bone. So those would be other things that will be evaluated as well as looking at dosing. The half-life is around 270 hours. So that could give us an opportunity to go twice a month and even potentially monthly. So all that will be captured in this data set. We expect to see some data next year and then that will allow us to best design a more formal Phase 2b study.
Operator: We'll go to the line of Carter Gould from Cantor. Please go ahead.
Carter Gould: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Obviously, there's been a lot of discussion around drug pricing kind of resurfacing and some rumblings around most favored nation kind of bubbling back to the surface. Wanted to get a sense understanding of your expectations and flexibility, if need be to take actions outside the US? And then maybe more of a commercial question, as we think about the potential co administration of BoNT/E and BOTOX, can you kind of help frame how you think that would impact the market? Is this something that could just grow the overall pie, move share, etc.? Any thoughts on that front would be appreciated.
Rob Michael: Thank you. Hey, Carter, it's Rob. I'll take your first question and Jeff will take the second question. I think as we've studied the environment, I mean, we are very supportive of a balanced approach that addresses affordability while also encouraging innovation. And you've seen many of our peers reinforcing the importance for the EU to properly value innovation, which we echo and would support any policies that encourage that outcome. That said, we hope the administration contemplates the harm that international reference pricing could have on US healthcare industry and future innovation. I think anything like price controls, cost increases or higher taxes just leaves less investment available across the industry to advance new innovative medicines. That said, I'm very encouraged by the administration's willingness to address the pill penalty in the IRA and is fixing that would support long term innovation in our industry. And so as we look at the push, I think, for the EU to more properly value the innovation is an absolute appropriate push. We're encouraged by some of the policies that really support innovation. And Scott also talked about tax reform. And I think that's an important lever as well as we think about what are the things that will drive investment in the US and drive more innovation. And I think if you just look at AbbVie as an example, we've invested over $5 billion of capital since tax reform in 2017. I mean that includes a new oncology research center in South San Francisco that includes Skyrizi manufacturing capabilities in the US, eye care capacity expansion in Waco, Texas and technology infrastructure upgrades across our footprint, just to name a few. And importantly, as Scott mentioned, tax reform allowed us to acquire Allergan, an Irish domiciled company that we then redomiciled into the US. I mean that transaction enabled AbbVie to continue increasing our R&D investment through the Humira LOE, which is unprecedented. That will ultimately help us really lead to more innovation in our pipeline and ultimately impact patients of the future. So when we think about policy, we think tax reform has provided the right incentives to invest more in the US and more in innovation. And that's what we would encourage.
Jeff Stewart: Let me give a quick update on the BoNT/E and the combination approach in terms of how we're starting to think about it. Obviously, we're super pleased with the recent filing on BoNT/E. And as we've highlighted before, the short acting toxin will operate on two different levels for us. First, it will stimulate the funnel. It will basically be a market stimulator because we know there's lots of considerors in the marketplace that are just worried about going to a full strength toxin because it lasts for three to four months. So the approachability of a short acting toxin that works in about 8.5 hours and is gone in 2.5 weeks makes the market much more approachable for the people in the consideration phase. So we think it's going to work on the market and our share, because obviously we've done studies with BOTOX after BoNT/E. Now in the combination use, Carter, it's very interesting. This is more of a pure sort of share play. When we talk to the consumers, many of the consumers are using a lot of BOTOX and you start saying, can you imagine a BOTOX that works almost immediately, so an immediate acting BOTOX. That gives us the potential and we'll have to see how those trials and those studies play out to actually restate the whole market. Because what's remarkable about BoNT/E is that we can see a two grade change in the glabellar lines in 8.5 hours. So nothing has ever worked even close to that fast. So we could even have a premium toxin that sits alongside BOTOX one day or a replacement product for just simply a better BOTOX, an immediate acting BOTOX. So it gives us a lot of flexibility and it's certainly very exciting as Roopal has highlighted the program that will begin here for the combination.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Courtney Breen: I wanted to look back to kind of part of the inventory and tariff conversation. We've been able to get some explicit answers from some of the peer companies. So just wanted to see if you were able to give us context as to whether you have enough inventory in the US to support products like Rinvoq, Botox, Vraylar or Humira for the rest of this year? And what about '26 and '27? And then the second question is just on the back of the BoNT/E question. Can you give us a little bit of context as to the pricing strategy for that kind of tester market? Because arguably kind of with a shorter directing time horizon, you have kind of less value. And so I'd love to see understand a little bit more about how you're thinking about placing these products together.
Rob Michael: Thank you. This is Rob. I'll take your first question and Jeff will take the second. Look, absent policy details, we're not going to get into speculating on the impact. I think you've known us to be a company that once we have a full understanding, we're very transparent and detailed. If you think about how we approach the Part D benefit redesign, as soon as we understood that impact, we were well in advance of the implementation of that discussing the impact on the company. But with tariffs, we don't have the policy details for the sectoral tariffs. So it's premature to speculate on the impact. And once we have that information, we'll communicate at the appropriate time.
Jeff Stewart: And regarding the pricing, obviously, it's since we just had the filing, it's premature. We go through a very rigorous pricing analysis as we would get closer to launch. And some of the considerations that we would look for, which is, obviously, I mentioned, the rotation of even more patients into the aesthetic practices brings a lot of value to those practices. And if you think about it, the lifetime value of those new patients is very meaningful. So that could play into dynamics ultimately how we price the BoNT/E once we ultimately make that decision sometime next year. Obviously, it does work shorter. So that might imply a different or lower price point to start the trial. But those are all considerations commercially that we will go through as we go through our launch readiness process over the course of the year to really optimize the impact of that product as we bring it to the market.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I would like to understand a little bit more about your thought process around Gubra? And there have been couple of strategies. So of course, Novo is trying to combine GLP-1, but then there is a strategy or thought process that amylin could be a good agent as a standalone agent. So how are you thinking about this, especially with the longer acting version? Do you think there's a strategy to just use this as a single agent, especially among patients who cannot tolerate GLP-1? We'd love to get your thoughts there.
Roopal Thakkar: You. Mohit, it's Roopal. I'll take that. So thanks for highlighting some of the potential here. And I think we're thinking about it quite broadly. So as you stated, there's an opportunity here as a monotherapy. I think the way we think about it is tolerability is key. We see a number of dropouts, upwards of 30% even after a month of starting with the current set of assets. And then when we look over the course of the year, 60% to 70% of the patients will drop. Now there's a variety of factors that drive that discontinuation, but a key component is tolerability. So to have a monotherapy that's tolerable, that provides meaningful weight loss and potentially has other potential benefits. We've seen pre clinically preservation of muscle. We'll have to see if that plays out. But that could be another benefit in the long term. When this launches, we do anticipate many of the patients will have already been on assays that are available today. So it could serve as a nice follow on for folks that couldn't tolerate or came off for other reasons and want to go somewhere else. Now in terms of combinations, recall, when we did this deal, one thing we liked about it, was also the neutral pH of the formulation. So that could enable combinations with a variety of mechanisms. And as Rob stated, we continue to be interested in this space and we'll be, thinking about other potential opportunities, which could include combinations that may drive further weight loss. But key for us would be tolerability and durability of use.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Steve Scala: First of all, Bristol appears to think there's a path forward with co-benefit in adjuvant schizophrenia based on existing data. Where does AbbVie stand in its analysis of the future of emraclidine? For instance, has a path forward become more clear in the last few months? Secondly, I believe AbbVie has more plants in Ireland than any other company. Curious how you think about that as well as your overall OUS footprint. Do you cut back OUS to invest in the US? Or do you maintain the presence OUS, given the fact that in four years we could have a different administration with very different views? And related to this topic, yesterday, Roche said that their US plants are 50% utilized. I'm wondering if AbbVie would share a similar percentage.
Roopal Thakkar: I'll start with schizophrenia question. In terms of the recent data, it's difficult for us to comment. I think that will be a discussion between the company and health authorities regarding the utility of a failed study. That would be their discussion to have. How we look at emraclidine is that we do still see potential and we want to approach this in a stepwise manner. The first step would be to look to see if we can further dose escalate beyond what was previously studied. We saw variable PK levels in those patients from the pivotal studies, some were low and we think there's an opportunity to raise that. So a multiple ascending dose study will be initiated this year and that would apply to potentially monotherapy in schizophrenia as well as the adjunctive setting. So as that data rolls out and if we're able to utilize a higher dose, then we would again stepwise go forward into a Phase 2 setting to further derisk and apply our learnings in terms of trial design. And then if we see strong data there, which could be as a monotherapy, could be as an adjunct and also in neurodegeneration psychosis, then we would move into the Phase 3 setting. But I would say we still believe there's opportunity here.
Rob Michael: And then Steve, this is Rob. I'll take your question on the manufacturing footprint. As I mentioned in my remarks earlier, obviously, AbbVie, we have a very broad footprint. An important part of the strategy is to assure supply. And as I mentioned earlier, we went through a global pandemic without any supply disruptions and that strategy certainly paid off. We also have, I'd say, a very robust manufacturing network in the US I think what's been widely misunderstood is Skyrizi as an example, our largest product is made in the US and so when we look at our global footprint, we consider assurance of supply. As Scott mentioned earlier, clearly, obviously, tax has an influence on longer term, how you'd want to structure your supply chain. So certainly, I think with a more competitive tax policy, that sort of provide the appropriate incentives. We try to say we have obviously been ramping our volume considerably. You look at just the performance, just then think about biologics capacity and just the tremendous ramps we've seen for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And so we stay ahead of the curve. We ensure that we are investing appropriately so we can keep up with that demand. I'd say the commercial team puts a lot of pressure on operations because they're performing so well, but operations stays ahead of the curve and invest appropriately. And so when we look at the investment, when I mentioned the greater than 10 billion investment, that takes into account in the US, that takes into account our volume growth that we expect in addition to new areas that we will invest. For example, peptide manufacturing as an example, as we enter that space, obviously now as we enter into obesity, it makes sense to add that capability. And so that will also be part of our supply chain strategy here. So that's the way we're thinking about it.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.
Dave Risinger: Thanks very much, and congrats on the performance. So I have two questions, please. And they're both a bit high level. So the first is the industry is facing three major US Government risks, actions that are harming biopharma innovation, including actions significant FDA disruption and questioning of proven medical science, tariff threats and also the Trump administration's agenda to take prices down more than the Biden administration took down drug prices. So considering what appears to be a lack of appreciation in Washington of the benefits that the biopharmaceutical industry brings to Americans, can you please comment on how your executive team and Board are engaging differently today with Washington leadership to change the political agenda for the better? And then second, the press release mentions that guidance doesn't reflect any trade policy shifts, including pharmaceutical sector tariffs. Can you describe the potential trade policy shifts that you're considering or thinking of beyond tariffs?
Rob Michael: So we're obviously not a member of pharma today, AbbVie, but we do continue to communicate with the association really to seek alignment on the most critical issues for the industry. Now AbbVie has a large government affairs organization that engages with lawmakers and the administration on our top policy priorities. And that includes tax reform. We've talked about that quite a bit today IRA, 340B and patient affordability in Medicare. And we have actually seen some positive results from that engagement. I mean, just this week, Congress released a report on 340B, included a recommendation that changed the law to more clearly define a patient, which should help address the abuse that is occurring with this program. I would also view the 340B policies in the latest executive order as a positive. I also previously mentioned that seeking to eliminate the pill penalty is a positive for innovation. So we will continue to work with lawmakers as we always have on policies that support a healthy US biopharma industry, continued innovation and patient affordability.
Roopal Thakkar: Regarding FDA interactions, I would say our teams have been in active discussions with the FDA on multiple programs across therapeutic areas, sometimes daily interactions and no signals of a slowdown. We are monitoring the situation closely. However, thus far, we haven't experienced any delays to our timelines.
Scott Reents: Just with respect to your question on my initial comments, it's just the trade policy shift we're talking about here is the potential pharmaceutical sector tariffs. It's not any additional things that we were contemplating. Certainly, the environment has some uncertainty out there, but specific to that comment we were speaking of the pharmaceutical sector tariffs.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.
Vamil Divan: Congrats on the quarter. One on the tariff discussion, I was curious about the aesthetic side. I know that pharmaceutical products are excluded from the current tariffs, but I thought products like your breast implants and Juvederm may be included right now. So curious if that's the case or not? And if it is, then why wouldn't there be some accounting for that in your new guidance? Maybe you just absorb it within your guidance? Any impact there? And then secondly, just on the aesthetics side, appreciate macro issues and all the macroeconomic pressures. But I'm just curious if you can comment on the market share dynamics. And is there any sort of share shifts that you're seeing either in toxins or fillers that may be impacting things beyond the macro component?
Scott Reents: You are right. It's a great question regarding the current tariff rules that are in place. So in general, pharmaceutical products and our products are exempt from those similar to our peers. However, there is a couple of exceptions to that. And then specific to aesthetics, yes, there are some application of the rules to aesthetics. But we have absorbed the aesthetics impact in the guidance. And I would tell you it's modest. It's something approximately $30 million. So it's something fairly modest in the current rules and that's something that we have absorbed. So all of the guidance that I gave and reaffirmed today from the margin profiles and otherwise includes us absorbing that.
Jeff Stewart: So I'll go over your market share, give you some flavor on that. And I'll focus on our two big markets, the US and China. So as I mentioned, we were right on our guidance, right on our forecast for the first quarter. Remember, biggest impact there was the price because we reversed the Alley [ph] redesign from last year. And so when we looked at basically what happened from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, we know we took a market share hit in toxins in that fourth quarter. The good news is we've seen a complete reengagement in the basically the old Alley program with all of our accounts. So things are quite stable. And we actually had a one market share point gain back from where we were. Now we still have to gain some more share over the course of the year to come back to where we were pre the change to Alley. So we have lost year-over-year some share in toxins. In the US in filler, our share is very, very stable. We did not see a significant share impact on the filler side of the business. It's just been sort of a double digit market pressure there. Now in China, I'm quite pleased with the share performance. We've recently had a couple of significant approvals sequentially. We have the masseter approval for BOTOX, which is sort of in the lower face and jawline and also VOLUX, which is in Juvederm. So we've actually seen significant positive momentum in BOTOX share in China as well as positive share in filler. So it's a little variable across the board. Our big push will be to recover that share over the course of the year in the US toxin space. Hope that helps.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Alexandria Hammond from Wolfe Research.
Alexandria Hammond: So Skyrizi and Rinvoq have consistently surpassed expectations, but we've been getting some questions on what might drive long term growth in I&I as it relates to these assets. Could you comment on when we should start seeing results from your Skyrizi and Rinvoq combination trials? And as a follow-up, what combination are you most excited about from a mechanistic perspective?
Roopal Thakkar: I'll start on the Skyrizi question and the combinations. So the studies have initiated and we would anticipate next year starting to see early data readouts. And I would say we're excited about several of these mechanisms. We've utilized quite a bit of data that we've already collected to see what could be the best combination. And ultimately clinical data will guide that path, but we use biopsy data. The team has applied machine learning, to these data sets, spatial omics, a variety of different techniques. And the ones that we like are one, the alpha-4 beta-7. We think that could be a good combination. We like Lutikizumab, which is a bispecific to anti IL-1 alpha and importantly, IL-1 beta. We see that overexpression in patients with IBD that have failed other advanced therapies. We see something similar for TREM1, which would be another potential combination. And then we as I mentioned, we also have a longer acting an agent designed to be longer acting TL1A that could also be a very good fit with IL-23 like Skyrizi. The other thing we'll be doing since I mentioned a variety of different combinations is also capturing a number of biomarkers to see if there's any potential for pretreatment segmentation in the future consistent with what we do in oncology. Thus far no real successes, would say maybe there's hints in TL1A. But we're going to generate that data as well to see if there's opportunities to be able to use biomarkers in the future to segment these patients.
Scott Reents: I might add, when we look at Skyrizi and Rinvoq, certainly we're very pleased with the strong demand in the quarter and that led to us taking a combined $900 million of increased guidance for the year. We've also given the long term guidance in 2027, which we continue to feel very confident in. And also I think it's worthwhile to think about Rinvoq will have a second wave of indications towards the end of the decade. It will add a couple of billion dollars of sales. And we really see these two products even before the combination that Roopal spoke about as having a long runway of at least for at least the next eight years and we feel very good about that from that perspective.
Rob Michael: And this is Rob. I'll just to add on to that. I think from strategically, when we look at the company and we have this clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, we can use that time and obviously we're looking to elevate the standard of care for immunology patients. We think these combination studies are a way to accomplish that. But we're going to use that time to and just as we did with Humira, we came up with Skyrizi and Rinvoq as a way to elevate the standard of care And that really launched into a second chapter of the company. Third chapter is going to be as you think about the growth beyond Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And we have the time and we're investing appropriately to identify what those drivers will be and within immunology and outside of it. I mean we have five key growth areas that we're very confident can drive growth. But obviously, you've now seen us enter the obesity space as we think about more sources of growth. We think that's also an opportunity. So we think the company is very well positioned to grow very nicely for at least the next eight years and then use that time and the investment that's available to grow beyond that.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
James Shin: I had a question on current immunology price volume dynamics. Specifically, is the low single digit headwind being realized? If so, is it somehow being blended where Humira is seeing outsized headwinds, while Skyrizi and Rinvoq are seeing tailwinds? Or is there some sort of co pay shift or is there a shift in co pay utilization year-over-year or sequentially?
Scott Reents: James, it's Scott. So I think I'll start with Skyrizi and Rinvoq. If you look at the first quarter, those were both driven by strong demand. Now we've talked about pricing being slightly negative for those two products on a full year basis. We did see a little bit of favorable price in the quarter and that's just a gating issue. So in the quarter, probably two things. One, Jess organization continues to do a very good job of focusing on co pay utilization and effectively managing that. So we saw a little bit of benefit from co pay utilization. And then in addition, we had anticipated some channel mix changes later in the year, but those actually came to fruition a little bit earlier than we thought. And so those factors, I would say, along with some gating issues combined to being price favorability, but we still anticipate negative pricing headwinds on a full year basis. With respect to Humira, we talked about in the quarter and on the full year that there is a decrease in volume associated with share erosion as well as the compression of the overall molecule. So that volume is going to continue. I think you'll see that volume a little bit more pronounced throughout the year, but there certainly continues to be some price. You've got some unwinds of accruals that cause price impacts, but you also have just the changing of the rebating dynamics as we entered into a new contract year.
Operator: Next we'll go to the line of Geoff Meacham from Citibank. Please go ahead.
Geoff Meacham: Rob, had another one on policy. Wanted to get your perspective on PBM reform, which is often mentioned as highly likely to happen this year. What would you say are the main elements that you'd want to see in reform? And the second one on BD, is there a therapeutic area that you guys feel like you still have to add to? I wasn't sure if neuro remains one of the top priorities just post emeraclidine and it does seem like multiple shots on goal in metabolic disease is kind of the approach a lot of other biopharmers are taking, but I wanted to get your perspective.
Jeff Stewart: So on PBM reform, I think we're supportive of anything that helps with patient affordability. And so to the extent that that improves the dynamic on patient affordability that that is truly realized in their pockets, that's favorable. So we are supportive of the efforts there. But it's really all about making sure that we're addressing patient affordability. As it relates to business development, we obviously really like the five key growth areas that we have today. As I mentioned, those will certainly drive very strong growth for at least the next eight years. I think sometimes there's a misconception about neuroscience for AbbVie. It's more than just psychiatry. We have a very strong migraine franchise that's performing exceptionally well. In Parkinson's, we're seeing great results. And we've been in Parkinson's for a long time with Duopa. But as you think about the ramps we're seeing with BioLev, the innovation we've brought for those patients and then Tavapadon, came from Cerevel, we could really start to see our Parkinson's franchise emerge. And so when I think about neuroscience, I would think about it really in four segments. There's psychiatry, it's an important segment. There's migraine, there's Parkinson's and there's all of the neurodegeneration. And we obviously are investing in Alzheimer's. And so you just look at the business development activity since the beginning of last year in neuroscience, extended our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter, who discovered Vraylar. We added a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh. We acquired a next generation A beta antibody that's very promising for Alzheimer's from Aliada. And we're also investing in novel approaches for migraine disease. So we are actively investing in neuroscience. We obviously added obesity because we do think of ourselves as being a company that's going be very large in the next decade. So it doesn't hurt to have another source of growth. And we have evaluated various options beyond the five and we chose to move into obesity for a number of reasons. It's obviously an extremely attractive market, has high prevalence and plenty of headroom for growth. It's a market that has ample space for multiple players and new entrants. And I think we're also uniquely positioned with our aesthetics business to access that channel in addition to therapeutics. And importantly, and it's something we always focus on is where are there high areas of unmet need. As we think about our portfolio, that's really our strategy is to drive a remarkable impact for our patients by elevating standard of care. When we look at obesity, there's plenty of opportunity, whether it's reducing GI side effects, improving body composition, more consistent weight loss across patient types, longer lasting weight loss. And so as we evaluate that opportunity, we found the amylin class to be very attractive given it's the most validated non-GLP-1 mechanism for obesity and has very encouraging early data. And we believe the amylin opportunity with Gubra has the potential to deliver a differentiated asset. So we will continue investing in obesity. We'll continue investing in our five key growth areas. And we think that gives us the right mix to drive growth for long term.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Anderson from Bank of America.
Tim Anderson: I have a question on drug advertising. So AbbVie is the number one spender on this. It's hard to turn on TV without seeing something like a ad. And that says you see a very positive ROI from that level of spending. As you know, there's some occasional talk by the administration about limiting such advertising. So my question is, do you think there's any basis in reality for that? I know you'll say it shouldn't happen, but that doesn't mean that it will potentially happen. But then on obesity, as you noted, your amylin is long acting. Doesn't that imply that a really kind of key next part of the portfolio is a long acting GLP? Or are you not interested in the GLP-1 space at all?
Jeff Stewart: And you're right. It's difficult to know if DTC reform would take place or what it might look like. I think you're right. We're very supportive of the First Amendment rights to be able to advertise. And obviously, we work with the FDA on every single claim that we make on television. And if there were to be a change, we would be able to pivot. I mean, we could shift our investment to disease awareness that could help us drive because we have such leading in-play share to continue to basically invest in the right way to consumers. We certainly could move to other channels because it's not really clear if it would just be mass media or etc. So certainly, the whole market would take a step back if that were to happen and our brands would still be very, very competitive in terms of our ability to pivot and toggle were that to happen. So difficult to predict, but we would be, of course, planning for any of those contingencies were they to take place.
Roopal Thakkar: Regarding different mechanisms. So as stated previously, we think there's opportunity as a monotherapy and also as a potential combination. Would say we haven't ruled out any particular mechanism that we would combine with. The other thing to mention, I think I already stated this, but we do have a neutral pH in the current formulation for 295. So that potentially makes it more amenable to combinations. But mechanisms that you mentioned and potentially others, would say, are on the table for us.
Operator: Next, we'll go to the line of Trung Huynh from UBS.
Trung Huynh: I've got two questions if I can. So first, just very quickly, you did touch on the pricing dynamics with Skyrizi and Rinvoq. But did the strong performance include any notable onetime contributions, inventory build or pull forward effects? And then second, similar to Vamil's aesthetics question, but China reciprocal tariffs have been enacted. Is that contemplated in your guide? And is that material to your aesthetics business? And then just I know it's early days, but are you seeing any shifts in demand there?
Scott Reents: So with respect to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I would say the one item that I would point to, again, was strong demand overall. The one thing that also helped the growth in the quarter was with respect to the retailer destocking. So in the past, we've talked about there's some retail inventory buildup as a form of price speculation in the fourth quarter. I talked about in the fourth quarter call that we didn't see a lot of that. And then that was again confirmed, we did not see there was no unwind like there has been in prior year. So there was a year-over-year benefit from the lack of destocking from the retail buildup in the first quarter. But again, that was fairly modest. When we talk about our overall growth globally, 72% operationally, the demand was really in the 60s. And so you just saw a small portion from that retail destocking. With respect to the China tariff, yes, you're right. There is some impact for aesthetics in those products in those numbers. But again, that impact is fairly modest. We've contemplated that in our guidance. And so I would say overall, the existing tariffs, you're talking about $30 million approximately globally and a decent component of that is with respect to the aesthetics business. And then maybe, I don't know if Jeff would like to comment on, I think you'd ask if there's if we've seen demand changes in China?
Jeff Stewart: No, we haven't over the last 30 days. I mean, things are things change quickly. But as I mentioned, if we at the quarter, we've been encouraged by the share growth we've seen in China based on the recent approvals for both the toxin and the filler category.
Operator: And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst: This is Connor McKay [ph] on for Evan. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on a great quarter. Vyalev and Elahere were two products that outside of your I&I business came in sort of meaningfully ahead of analyst expectations. Can you maybe walk us through what's driving the strength for each of those?
Jeff Stewart: Certainly as I mentioned in the prepared remark and Rob as well, Vyalev is emerging as a very, very important product. And we communicated certainly that it could continue to exceed expectations. So it's quite remarkable. We continue to see strong uptake in Japan, across Europe. And while we're only in the commercial market, which is about 30% of the market in the US, because we're still waiting on the full Medicare reimbursement, the market feedback is exceptional. I mean this is a really amazing product to help patients sleep through the night, control the movement disorders. It's unlike Duopa, it lasts for 24 hours. It's a more simple subcu injection versus surgery that you might get. So it's playing out exactly as we had hoped. And so you're just seeing some strength of that in the quarter. And that's also why we remarked that we're excited to bring Tavapadon, which is also showing some very nice data here and we're getting ready for the file to start to really build out a more meaningful Parkinson's category. And then Elahere, we continue to see nice uptake, very unique product. Obviously, it's got a 30% approval in overall survival. It's well tolerated non-chemo. So the US business continues to perform very well. And we are starting to see the international launches. We've pulled forward significant international launches from the time that we had done the deal with ImmunoGen, and we're going to start to see those international launches ramp here over the next several quarters. So that gives some sense over that brand as well.
Rob Michael: I'm glad you asked a question about Elahere because oncology doesn't get enough attention for the company. Elahere came to us through the ImmunoGen acquisition. It was a very successful acquisition. It basically combined their ADC capabilities with ours. And now you're starting to see the AbbVie internally discovered ADCs emerge. We've talked about Teliso-V. We're very excited about tmAb A-706. You think about long term growth drivers for AbbVie, oncology with that emerging pipeline and Roopal and I both mentioned 383, the bispecific for multiple myeloma. We have, I think, a very exciting emerging oncology pipeline that could be an important growth driver for the company. So I appreciate the specific question about Elahere.
Liz Shea: And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you all for joining the AbbVie first quarter 2025 earnings conference call. That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time, and we hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-01-31 03:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Liz Shea: Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research & Development, Chief Scientific Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie, and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Michael: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter performance closes out another excellent year for AbbVie, and I'm very pleased with the significant progress we made in 2024. We executed on our top commercial priorities, advanced our pipeline with key regulatory approvals and promising data, and further strengthened our business through strategic transactions. Turning to our results, we delivered full-year adjusted earnings per share of $10.12, which is $0.49 above our initial guidance midpoint. Excluding the impact of IPR&D expense, total net revenues were $56.3 billion, exceeding our initial guidance by more than $2 billion. Our results demonstrate a rapid return to sales growth, with full-year revenue up 4.6% on an operational basis, despite $5 billion of U.S. Humira erosion in 2024. This outstanding execution is driven by our ex-Humira platform, which continues to outperform expectations, delivering full-year sales growth of more than 18% with revenue growth accelerating to 22% in the fourth quarter. As I look to 2025 and beyond, we are well-positioned with our ex-Humira platform. It will allow AbbVie to deliver robust mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2025 and exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second year following the U.S. Humira LOE. And given that we have no significant LOE events for the rest of this decade, we have a clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, including a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029. We anticipate a substantial portion of this growth will be driven by robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq to assets are expected to collectively generate nearly $24 billion of revenue in 2025, reflecting growth of more than $6 billion. Based on this strong momentum, we now expect Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed more than $31 billion of combined sales in 2027, which is $4 billion above the guidance we provided last year. We are seeing strong performance across all of their approved indications, especially in IBD. And we see several tailwinds that will support growth into the next decade, including healthy immunology market growth, strong share capture given best-in-class profiles, continued robust market access, and momentum from new indications, such as the recent launch of Skyrizi in UC, as well as the potential for five new indications for Rinvoq over the next few years. In neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, we are seeing very robust performance, with sales of $10 billion expected in 2025, reflecting growth of $1 billion across psychiatry, migraine, and Parkinson's. In oncology, I am very encouraged by our long-term growth prospects. This includes our BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta; our FRα ADC for ovarian cancer, Elahere; our two novel c-MET ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, and our BCMA-CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma 383. Lastly, while the recent performance in aesthetics has been impacted by challenging market conditions in the U.S. and China, the category remains very attractive given low penetration rates for facial injectables. When the market returns to more normalized growth, our leading commercial portfolio and forthcoming pipeline will help drive improved performance. Based on the market trends over the last few years, and our assumption for a gradual recovery in the near term, we now expect aesthetics to deliver a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029. Turning now to R&D, we have made excellent progress with our late-stage programs. These advancements include recent approvals for Skyrizi in UC, Epkinly in later lines of follicular lymphoma, Elahere for FRα-positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, Vyalev for advanced Parkinson's, and new indications for Botox and Juvéderm. In 2025, we anticipate approvals for Rinvoq in GCA, and Teliso-V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, as well as regulatory submissions for Tavapadon in Parkinson's, Venclexta in higher-risk MDS, and BoNT/E for aesthetics. We have also added depth to our pipeline by signing more than 20 early-stage deals since the beginning of 2024, including promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. We have significant capacity to continue pursuing external innovation with a focus on differentiated opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. In summary, I am very pleased with AbbVie's execution in 2024. And expect our diverse portfolio to drive strong growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7.3 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi total sales were nearly $3.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 57.9%. Rinvoq total sales were more than $1.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 47.1%. On a full-year basis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq delivered approximately $17.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of nearly $6 billion year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. These results reflect strong performance across all approved indications. I'll share some highlights in the U.S. Skyrizi total prescription share in the biologic psoriasis market is now approximately 40%, reflecting a very significant lead relative to all major competitors, with in-play capture rates remaining very strong. Over the course of 2025, we anticipate new data for Skyrizi on hard-to-treat areas of the body, including scalp and genital psoriasis. In addition, we expect the readout of our fifth head-to-head study in psoriasis comparing Skyrizi to Sotyktu, which will continue to differentiate the brand versus oral competitors. Rinvoq is now capturing more than 20% in-place share in atopic dermatitis, as our communication around our level-up study versus Dupixen continues to ramp. Recall that in level-up, we showed strong comparative results on stringent endpoints of skin resolution and itch reduction. In RA, Rinvoq is achieving the leading in-place share in the second line plus market, consistent with the brand's label. We see that U.S. physicians are increasingly utilizing only one TNF prior to initiating Rinvoq treatment in RA. In psoriatic arthritis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are capturing a leading in-place share in the room category, highlighting the effective co-positioning of both agents in this important segment. Across IBD, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also capturing substantial portfolio share, given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. In Crohn's disease, which is roughly two-thirds of the overall IBD market, these two treatments together are capturing approximately half of the in-place share with total prescription volumes ramping very rapidly. In ulcerative colitis, we are seeing a very strong inflection following the Skyrizi launch in the second-half of last year. Both Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are already capturing roughly a third of the UC in-play market, which supports robust momentum going forward for both AbbVie brands. We see similar performance internationally as well, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also achieving leadership positions across our major countries. So, I'm very pleased with this momentum and continue to see a significant opportunity for share gains across our existing indications, in addition to the typical market growth we see across room, derm, and gastro in 2025 and beyond. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of more than $1.6 billion, down 48.7% on an operational basis, primarily due to biosimilar competition, we continue to see molecule compression in the U.S. with volume moving to other novel mechanisms, which has resulted in a benefit to both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We anticipate Humira access will decrease throughout 2025 as more plans move to exclusive biosimilar contracts. It's reasonable to assume that roughly half of U.S. covered lives will continue to have parity access to Humira on a full-year basis, with select exclusionary contracts for existing patients expected to begin around the middle of the year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were approximately $1.7 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $848 million, down 6.2%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $655 million, up 13% on an operational basis, reflecting strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. Lastly, Elahere continues to demonstrate a strong launch trajectory for FR-alpha positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, with global sales of $148 million. Sales in the U.S. are annualizing at more than $600 million and commercialization is now underway in key international markets where we are accelerating regulatory and reimbursement timelines. Moving to neuroscience, where total full-year revenues were $9 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.3 billion. In the quarter, total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 19.9% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar with global sales of $924 million, Botox Therapeutic with global revenues of $873 million, Ubrelvy with global sales of $303 million, and Qulipta with global revenues of $201 million. Beyond these leading therapies for psychiatry and migraine, we are very excited for an emerging portfolio in Parkinson's disease. We recently launched Vyalev, the only subcutaneous 24-hour continuous infusion of levodopa-based therapy for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. As a less invasive, non-surgical delivery system that can provide meaningful improvements in on-time and off-time, we are seeing very high interest from both physicians and patient communities. Parkinson's experts report significant benefit from the continuous 24-hour delivery and the control of symptoms morning, day, and through the night. While sales in the U.S. are expected to ramp gradually over the next several quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination, uptake internationally is exceeding our expectations. Finally, I'm very encouraged by the data we are seeing for tavapadon for potential use as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease, as well as an adjunct to optimize oral therapy for more advanced patients. Tavapadon represents a very complimentary addition to our Parkinson's disease portfolio with Vyalev and Duopa. So, overall, I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?
Carrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Fourth quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.3 billion, reflecting an operational decrease of 4.4%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $839 million declined 5% as challenging market conditions and promotional dynamics impacted key assets. Consistent with recent quarters, the U.S. facial injectable market continues to be affected by suppressed consumer spending that is related to the cumulative impact of high inflation over several years. As a higher price procedure relative to toxins, current conditions are most notably impacting the filler market, which declined by approximately 10% in the quarter. The toxin market remains more resilient, demonstrating low single-digit% growth. Although we continue to be the clear market leader in toxins and fillers, in Q4, our facial injectable share declined by a few points. In October, we launched an updated version of our Alle consumer loyalty program, which was designed to benefit providers by increasing treatment frequency, patient retention, and cross-selling. While some providers embraced the new loyalty program, many felt the new contract was too complex to integrate into their practices, therefore negatively impacting market share and inventory levels. Based on this market reaction, we reinstated our original Alle consumer loyalty program earlier this month. This action has been met with a rapid and favorable response from our providers with encouraging early indicators for sales and market share recovery. Internationally, aesthetic sales were $459 million. This represented an operational decline of 3.2% that was primarily due to lower Juvéderm sales as Botox cosmetic sales were roughly flat on an operational basis. Our international results were impacted by our second largest global market, China, where lower consumer spending related to economic headwinds continues to affect performance. Looking to 2025, we've planned prudently with our outlook for modest aesthetic sales growth. In the U.S., this reflects a gradual improvement in market growth rates and share for both toxins and fillers. Additionally, based on our Alle loyalty program changes, we expect a one-time price adjustment to negatively impact our first quarter U.S. results. Internationally, we are focused on retaining a strong competitive position as we launch multiple new products in China while we closely monitor market conditions and consumer sentiment. In summary, while economic headwinds and key geographies have created a near-term impact on market conditions, we continue to see significant long-term growth potential, given high consumer interest and low penetration rate. Allergan Aesthetics is uniquely positioned to benefit based on our customer relationships, commercial investments, and innovative pipeline. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.
Roopal Thakkar: Thank you, Carrie. We continue to make significant progress with our R&D efforts to advance novel clinical programs across all stages of our diversified pipeline. In 2025, we expect a strong cadence of important data readouts, regulatory submissions, and new approvals, as well as many clinical trial starts for key programs. Starting with immunology, regulatory applications are under review for Rinvoq and GCA, with approval decisions anticipated in the second quarter. Data for two Phase 3 Rinvoq programs will be available this year, alopecia areata and vitiligo, and for our HS and lupus programs in 2026. Moving to Skyrizi, data from the head-to-head in psoriasis versus Sotyktu will be available this year. Also this year, to further support differentiation in IBD, a study comparing Skyrizi to Entyvio in ulcerative colitis will be initiated. Additional mid-stage monotherapy and combination studies are planned in 2025, including a Phase 2 study evaluating lutikizumab in atopic dermatitis, a Phase 2 study evaluating Skyrizi and lutikizumab in psoriatic arthritis, and advancement of our anti-TREM1 antibody, ABBV-8736 with the eventual goal to add it to the Crohn's Disease Platform Study as a monotherapy and in combination with Skyrizi. Moving to oncology, where multiple regulatory and clinical milestones as well as phase transitions for key programs are planned. One area that we are particularly excited about is our ADC pipeline, where several assets are aimed at multiple tumor types. Our regulatory application is under review for accelerated approval of Teliso-V as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The target for an approval decision is in the first-half of this year. This represents a segment of lung cancer with high unmet need where patients have limited options and tend to have a very poor prognosis. If approved, Teliso-V would be the first c-Met-directed ADC for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. We are also rapidly advancing our next-gen c-Met asset. A Phase 3 study evaluating ABBV-400, also known as Temab-A, was recently initiated in patients with c-Met overexpressed refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Temab-A, as a monotherapy, is being compared against chemotherapy plus bevacizumab. This year, data from a Phase 1 CRC study evaluating Temab-A in combination with bevacizumab could enable a Phase 3 study in an all-comers population. Temab-A is also progressing well across lung programs. A Phase 2 study in EGFR wild-type non-small cell lung cancer is being planned, where Temab-A will be evaluated with a PD-1 inhibitor as a frontline combination therapy. In the EGFR mutant segment, results from the ongoing Phase 1 study could enable Temab-A dose optimization studies as a monotherapy in the second line setting and in combination with osimertinib in the first line setting. In gastroesophageal cancer, a Phase 2 trial was recently started evaluating Temab-A in combination with chemotherapy and a PD-1 inhibitor in frontline patients. We are also excited about ABBV-706, an ADC that utilizes the same Topo warhead and linker technology as Temab-A, but with an antibody that targets SEZ6. Encouraging data in small lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, were presented at ASCO last year. And this year, dose optimization and longer term duration data will be available. This readout could lead to the initiation of a registrational study in second line and dose optimization in combination with standard of care in the frontline. Moving to FRα ADC, Elahere is now approved for platinum resistant ovarian cancer in the U.S. and Europe and is currently in Phase 3 development for the platinum sensitive ovarian cancer segment, also, a next generation ADC targeting FRα, IMGN-151 is currently in Phase 1. This year, Elahere will be tested in combination with bevacizumab and a PARP inhibitor. 151 is being advanced into dose optimization as well as in studies with standard of care agents such as bevacizumab, carboplatin and a PARP inhibitor. These mid-stage studies for Elahere and 151 will be used to inform our Phase 3 approach in various settings for ovarian cancer, including induction and maintenance in platinum sensitive patients and in combination for frontline maintenance. Another ADC from ImmunoGen known as PIVAC targets a rare hematologic malignancy called Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm. Based on positive data from the pivotal Phase 2 study, a regulatory application is planned for later this year. If approved, this would be an important new treatment option for patients with this aggressive blood cancer. Also in the area of hematologic oncology, the Phase 3 Venclexta MDS study is nearing completion with an overall survival data readout later this year. Now moving to neuroscience, following the Emraclidine EMPOWER-1 and 2 study readouts, a thorough analysis of the data was conducted to better understand the placebo effect observed in the two trials. Our findings point to a lack of uniformity of placebo effect across sites. When assessing sites beyond those with high placebo response, a clear efficacy signal was observed, albeit more modest than reported in Phase 1b. Therefore, we see a path forward as an adjunct to atypicals and schizophrenia and as a monotherapy in psychosis related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These are diseases where there is a high unmet need for safe and tolerable treatments that can provide even a modest benefit. Additionally, our intention is to explore higher doses of Emraclidine. This is based on the degree of variability observed in the PK data from the EMPOWER studies. If higher doses are found to be safe and well tolerated, there is a potential opportunity to evaluate Emraclidine as a monotherapy in schizophrenia, as higher doses may result in greater efficacy. A multiple ascending dose study will be conducted this year and data will be available in the early part of 2026. Following this dosing work, Phase 2 studies in adjunctive schizophrenia and potentially monotherapy schizophrenia will be initiated. Dose ranging in elderly patients is ongoing with Phase 2 studies planned in 2026 in patients with psychosis related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Staying on the topic of Parkinson's Disease, positive top line results from the third Phase 3 trial for Tavapadon were recently announced. In the TEMPO-2 trial, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant reduction in the severity of Parkinson's Disease symptoms compared with placebo at week 26. Key secondary endpoints were also achieved. We are very pleased with the emerging profile for Tavapadon, which shows strong efficacy as a monotherapy and as an add-on to Levo, Carbidopa. The six-month data from the Phase 3 studies show Tavapadon to be generally safe and well tolerated with low rates of adverse events of special interest, such as sedation and impulse control disorder. Longer term safety data will be available this year and regulatory submissions will then follow. Moving to aesthetics, we met with the FDA late last year regarding our BoNT/E submission for the treatment of glabellar lines. We are in the process of generating additional CMC data requested by the agency, which should be completed in the next few months. The regulatory submission will likely occur around the middle of the year. To summarize, there have been significant advancements across all stages of our pipeline. In 2025, we anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones, including many trial starts for key programs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Reents: Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.16 which is $0.08 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.88 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion reflecting robust growth of 6.1% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Our ex-Humira platform delivered reported growth of 22%, once again exceeding our expectations. Adjusted gross margin was 83.8% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 15.1% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 23.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 34.7% of sales, which includes a 10.4% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $610 million. The adjusted tax rate was 20.2%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2025, our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.12 and $12.32. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect total net revenues of approximately $59 billion reflecting robust operational growth of 5.7% despite a roughly 4% net unfavorable impact across our portfolio from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full-year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for select key products and therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $29.4 billion, including Skyrizi revenue of $15.9 billion reflecting growth of more than $4.1 billion driven by continued strong performance in psoriasis as well as robust uptake in IBD; Rinvoq sales of $7.9 billion reflecting growth of nearly $2 billion with continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications. And Humira total revenue of $5.6 billion, including U.S. sales of $4 billion as more plans exclude branded Humira around the middle of the year. This forecast includes a $600 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. In oncology, we expect global sales of $6.3 billion including IMBRUVICA revenue of $2.7 billion which reflects a $400 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign; Venclexta sales of $2.6 billion, reflecting continued strong demand, partially offset by a $100 million net unfavorable impact from Medicare Part D benefit redesign and Elahere revenue of $750 million. For Aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.3 billion reflecting gradual improvement in market conditions across global markets as well as market share recovery in the U.S. This includes Botox Cosmetic revenue of $2.8 billion and relatively flat sales for Juvéderm. For neuroscience, we expect global sales of $10 billion reflecting continued double-digit growth. This includes Vraylar revenue of $3.5 billion reflecting continued strong prescription demand, partially offset by a $200 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign; Botox Therapeutics sales of $3.5 billion, total oral CGRP revenue of $2.1 billion and Vraylar sales of $300 million. For eye care, we expect global sales of $2.2 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2025, we are forecasting full-year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately 14.5%, adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.2 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 47% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.6 billion which primarily reflects the annualized financing cost for the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.6%. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2024. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $12.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $6.1 billion including Skyrizi sales of $3.2 billion and Rinvoq revenue of $1.6 billion, we expect U.S. Humira sales of $900 million. We also anticipate oncology revenue of $1.5 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.1 billion which includes an unfavorable one-time price adjustment due to the reimplementation of the original program, neuroscience revenue of $2.1 billion and eye care sales of $550 million. We are forecasting an operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales and model a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13.8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.47 and $2.51. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was approximately $5.5 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow approaching $17 billion in 2025, which includes roughly $2.7 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments. This free cash flow will support a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we have increased by 310% since inception, as well as debt repayment, where we expect to pay down nearly $3 billion of total debt this year and remain on track to achieve a net leverage ratio of 2x by the end of 2026. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are pleased with AbbVie's results in 2024 and our financial outlook remains very strong. We have considerable momentum across our diverse portfolio and we continue to be well positioned to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please.
Operator: Our first question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Vamil Divan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe just to dive a little deeper on the Skyrizi, it is a great performance and guidance. Can you just comment a little more on pricing dynamics that you're seeing there as to how you've factored in pricing both for this year and maybe over the next several years? And then, just a quick follow-up on the comments that were given around aesthetics, especially on the share side, I think you lost a few points when maybe getting it back. Can you just give a sense of where you think the share is now for Botox and Juvéderm sort of this point in time? Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Yes, thanks, Vamil. It's Jeff. And I'll comment on Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And I think, we've been very consistent that over the near-term and over time, this is a volume-based business, so we're going to see price declines year-over-year. But I would say modest, right? We've sort of highlighted that as we negotiate the formularies, we've started to consistently see sort of these low single-digit price concessions. Now, obviously, what Scott highlighted was unique for the 25-year with the Part D redesign that he outlined. So, overall, consistent low single-digit price declines from the rebating side with a one-time Part D. And we would anticipate once we left the Part D, we would see that sort of trend going forward.
Rob Michael: And Vamil, this is Rob. I'll just add that if you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our strategy here was to elevate the standard of care for patients and ultimately would drive a rapid return to growth for the company beyond Humira. And that's exactly what we've been able to execute. That strategy has played out. You see the differentiation in the marketplace. We have nine head-to-head studies. We're launching a few more. We've upgraded our guidance now by an additional $4 billion in 2027. We've been very consistent in our language around the pricing dynamics. We said when you think about rebates, think about it as negative low single-digits going forward, but given the robust performance of these assets, it's volume that's dominating the growth, and we would expect that to continue.
Carrie Strom: And hi, this is Carrie. I'll answer your question around Botox and Juvéderm share. So, in the U.S., we remain the clear market leader for both toxins and fillers. In Q4, a few points of share erosion, bringing Botox to around the low to mid-60s, Juvéderm to around the low to mid-40s. As I said, the reversion of the loyalty program back to the original one, which we announced in December. And then, put into action January 21st, was greeted with very positive response from our customers. And encouraging signs for us to recapture that share for both Botox and Juvéderm throughout the year. And just to note that the share did not go to one competitor. Rather, it was more distributed amongst the entire competitive set.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Yes. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just a two-parter on the Skyrizi Rinvoq dynamics, maybe just first on the 2027 guidance, can you just elaborate on what were the biggest drivers of upside to those targets, as you think about the various indications for the drugs? I guess, is it fair to think most of this coming from IBD, or is it across the board? And then, probably a longer-term question on those brands, can you just elaborate a little bit more on how we should think about the growth rate beyond 2027? So basically, how mature will these franchises be by then? And what type of growth rates can we think about over time? Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Maybe -- thanks, Chris. This is Jeff. I'll start on that. So, the primary driver of the change is, in fact, share capture. So, the pricing assumptions have been consistent. We can call the markets pretty well. We see the actuals and the long-term trends there. So, it's been really share capture. And I would say that we see it across the board. Certainly, we've been super encouraged with Skyrizi in psoriasis. We continue to see very, very robust TRx share trends. And there's no question that the ramps in IBD have been very, very significant. So, that's a big piece of it. But I would say it's across the board. So, predominantly share capture. I don't know if, Scott, you have anything to add. But that's the big dynamic there on the $4 billion.
Scott Reents: Yes, Jeff. Maybe, Chris, if it would help, I can give you the breakdown by indication between the two on the 2027 guide, so, we talk about $31 billion combined in 2027. That's our new long-term guidance. That is $11 billion for Rinvoq and $20 billion for Skyrizi. Rinvoq is broken down. Rheum is about $4.8 billion; dermatology, $2.5 billion; IBD, $3.7. And then, on the Skyrizi side, $12.5 billion of that $20 billion guide is from psoriatic. And the remaining $7.5 billion is coming from IBD. So, that might help you kind of see those where the growth is coming from as well.
Rob Michael: And if we speak to it in terms of the $4 billion, just to give you a sense then, to add to what just Scott mentioned. So, Skyrizi is up $3 billion. A billion of that is psoriatic and $2 billion is IBD. We're just seeing tremendous ramps early days with IBD. And then, for Rinvoq, it's up a billion from the previous guidance. And that's a mix of roughly $300 million rheum, $200 million derm, and $500 million IBD. So, again, across the board, we're seeing tremendous performance, particularly in IBD. And then, your question on how to think about the growth, we have obviously given guidance beyond '27. But as I look at the sell side consensus, clearly the growth that's in sell side consensus beyond '27 is below our expectations. We would expect to see these markets continue to grow. We would also expect to see continued share gains, albeit as you start getting close to that in place share level, the share curve bends, but you still expect to see some level of share growth. And then, keep in mind, we will have the five, we expect the five new indications for Rinvoq, collectively adding about $2 billion in peak sales and so that will also contribute. So, as I think about the rate of growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq beyond '27, Rinvoq will likely grow faster than Skyrizi because of those new indications, but you'll still see a robust performance from both assets, at least through '32.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Geoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks so much for the question. Just had a couple, first one on Cerevel, you guys called out the partial impairment today in the press release. Just want to get your perspective as to what the drivers are for the remaining value, assuming Tavapadon is mostly it, but wasn't sure what you'd assume for Emraclidine or backup compounds? And then, just on aesthetics, with the new guidance to 2029, is it fair to say that you think '25 could be the trough or have already seen a trough in terms of the growth rate? I'm just trying to think of the longer term picture. And then, just on BoNT/E, I wanted to get your perspective about the potential success there adding new patients to the paradigm, just given the potential there. Thank you.
Rob Michael: Geoff, on your first question regarding -- this is Rob. On your first question regarding Cerevel, so keep in mind, the accounting rules do not allow you to write up an intangible. So, even though we are more optimistic about Tavapadon now than we were at the time of the deal, we can't write that value up. So, that would be the same as what we originally ascribed. We still obviously, as Roopal walked you through the development programs for Emraclidine, still see opportunity in adjunctive schizophrenia as well as neuro degenerative psychosis. And we haven't completely given up on the monotherapy opportunity either, but that's a more heavily risk adjusted opportunity now. So, when you think about the value you have to take into account, the timing, so there's some level of time delay as well as a different probability of success for monotherapy. That's all baked into because you're essentially valuing risk adjusted revenues. You have to take that into account. That said, we're still optimistic about the asset. We're pursuing it in these indications. And again, as I mentioned, we haven't completely given up on monotherapy that will depend on dose ranging. But that is the way we constructed the revaluation of the intangible. But overall, we still see a very nice opportunity particularly for Tavapadon and we still see potential for Emraclidine as well.
Jeff Stewart: Geoff, I'll take your question regarding the aesthetics trough. So, we've not specifically guided that, but the way that we have modeled it and think about it is we do see recovery. And I think the big headwind here has been over the last two years has been the economic condition. So, we do see continued improvement. Carrie spoke about some of the market growth rates that we're seeing coming back in the U.S. for both fillers and toxins. So, we would -- if you model, you would anticipate '25 to be the trough. And then, our long-term guidance is that high-single-digit compound annual growth using '25 as the base year through '29. And if you model that, that's going to put you somewhere north of $7 billion. Certainly, this is a business we continue to be excited about. We think that there are continuing to be low market penetration rates globally, frankly, and we've got some innovation to continue to drive market growth. That market has grown low-double-digits historically, but I think as we model, we're thinking a high-single-digit growth in the markets. But we do see some growth accelerators with BoNT/E, and maybe I'll let the team talk about BoNT/E.
Rob Michael: Maybe I'll just mention here just more broadly, this is Rob, on the business. I think as we reflect on the aesthetics performance and we are just going through a period of macroeconomic pressure on that business. But we do continue to see an attractive long-term setup again given low penetration rates, high consumer interest and our leading portfolio, including some exciting pipeline programs in toxins and fillers. When you think about it, as part of AbbVie, the aesthetics business has been able to continue investing despite the macroeconomic challenges and that will allow us to maximize opportunities when the market does recover. We have set up this business to be a global fully integrated unit with dedicated support from R&D and business development, and I'm confident that focused approach will pay off in the long run. It's just been difficult for us to call the market recovery, but we still have a lot of confidence in the long-term outlook.
Carrie Strom: And this is Carrie. I'll comment on BoNT/E. So, as you said, BoNT/E will be an important catalyst for new patient activation into the category. Consideration continues to be very high for aesthetics and for toxins. And like we said, it continues to be underpenetrated. And that's because there continue to be barriers for these people who are interested in the category, but not acting around cost and concerns of an unnatural look. And that's really where BoNT/E will play an important role based on its unique profile that is suited to address these concerns. It's fast-acting. It has short duration. So, it's going to be a nice option to position for these considerers to try BoNT/E. And then, our commercial strategy will be to convert them from BoNT/E to Botox. So, this is going to be an important pipeline catalyst to help us to activate that consumer market and drive more consumers into the toxin category for Botox.
Roopal Thakkar: And it's Roopal. Maybe one comment to add to Carrie's. On the R&D side, even thinking past that, this year we'll initiate a study with BoNT/E plus Botox to cover people immediately and get that long-term benefit. So, that, those studies will start this year.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned the net impact of the Part D redesign. Can you tell us what the volume impacts you guys are assuming, if any, in that calculation? And then the second question I had is, on the pipeline slide, you noted you could have some Phase 2 UC data for 113, which I believe is your oral NLRX1 agonist. Just maybe speak to conviction level there and how you think about that on the forward and if that would be something that you could move into Phase 3. Thank you.
Scott Reents: Terence and Scott, I'll take your question on the volume. So, we have guided a 4% of a net impact across the business for headwind to growth for Part D redesign. Now, when we think about that volume offset, we've not quantified that in the guidance, but that is part of the 4%. It's a, I would say, in the grand scheme, it's a fairly modest offset overall. And I think part of what you need to do when you think about that volume, recognize that when you look at the patient segments that exist, there's roughly three patient segments and they each take about a third of the business. But this is really something that will impact the standard eligible, and we're working very hard to ensure that people are electing cap and smooth. And so, we really see that volume offset coming from that one-third of the patient segment to drive that. So, that's why I think it's a little bit more of a modest offset, but we've not quantified it.
Rob Michael: And it's logical when you think about it, because the other two-thirds, I mean, you have the LIS population, which is one-third, so they don't have an out-of-pocket burden like the standard eligible do, and the other third are covered by employer plans, where, again, they don't have the same out-of-pocket burden. So, when we analyzed it, we looked at the market and saw that about a third, as Scott mentioned, of the population would benefit from the lower out-of-pocket. But keep in mind, the cost share applies to the entire book of Medicare business. That's why the volume doesn't offset the price impact.
Roopal Thakkar: And this is Roopal. I'll cover the NLRX question. This is our asset from Landos. We had observed very early data, I would say Phase 1b, in ulcerative colitis, and that looked good, but it was a very small sample size, I would say. So, this will be a robust Phase 2 with a placebo comparator, and we'll get objective data from centralized review of endoscopic data. So, it will be a good data set to look at, and if it looks good, definitely would be a Phase 3 asset for us. And the other consideration we would have, similar to what I highlighted about other biologics that we'd be combining with Skyrizi, if this looks good, this could be a combination agent with Rinvoq as well.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Yes, our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress, I have a question regarding IMI. So, I know you talked in the past about Skyrizi and Rinvoq benefiting from some of the Humira prescriptions going to these agents as well. So, taking that aside, it still seems like the volume or IRA space is growing rapidly. Can you talk a little bit about the underlying dynamics as well here, why this market continues to grow, and how should we think about longer term for the overall market growth itself? Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. So, thanks, Mohit. It's Jeff. And like we talked about before, particularly around the acute event, in this case, this was the CDF exclusion in April, we could clearly start to measure the fact that not all of the switching from Humira was going to the biosimilar. We saw about 20% of it was slipping away into new mechanisms or more advanced mechanisms like Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Now, we've continued to see the molecule compress. And it's just physicians are using just less and less sequentially Humira and the biosimilars over time. I would say it's becoming harder to measure because you're also seeing a lot of dynamics around new head-to-head trials, new indications, new other approaches. So, I would say overall, it's there, but it's relatively modest in the scheme of the volume that is basically accruing from basically the promotion and the profile of the medication. So, it should continue. The more that we see sort of disruption in the market, you'll probably continue to see the molecule on trend continue to compress. Now albeit modest, your other point's very important. These markets are still very, very buoyant and significant. And one of the dynamics that we see over time, and I think we'll begin to see it quite dramatically around the world, particularly in IBD, is that the lines of therapy start to expand. So, it used to be like primarily what was fueling the markets was primarily the new patients coming in off of older traditional medications. But now you're seeing the emergence in atopic dermatitis of the second and third line markets, which are growing quite substantially. You're going to see that significantly emerge in IBD, whereas before physicians were really, really afraid to move people along. So, they did dose intensification, they added more steroids. But now that there's drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq and other agents, you're seeing those market lines of therapy expand. And so, that should continue. And we've contemplated that in our long-term projections. But that gives you some sense of why you're observing what you're seeing.
Rob Michael: Now, as we look across, it's Rob, as we look across the specialty areas, in psoriasis and IBD we're projecting high single-digit market growth. Atopic dermatitis in the mid-teens, it's growing very -- I mean, you're seeing still fairly low penetration rates for atopic dermatitis. So, there's tremendous room for growth. So, we would anticipate mid-teens market growth there. And then, in rheumatoid arthritis, that's probably more like low to mid-single digits. But you can see across the board, very nice market growth, which then will be complemented by the market share gains.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Yes. The next question comes from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
David Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So, I have two questions, please. First, regarding ABBV-400 or Temab-A, could you please frame your long-term commercial vision for this candidate, including what some may underappreciate about how broadly it could potentially be adopted in the early 2030s? And then, second, on external transactions, emraclidine was a setback, but AbbVie's overall M&A track record has been very successful. Could you please discuss your agenda for M&A, including the potential to leverage your franchise strength in related product categories? Thanks so much.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Hi. It's Jeff. So, I will give some thoughts on that. It's a very, very attractive asset. I think it's underappreciated. And part of it is the first category it will compete in, which is colorectal cancer. I mean, if you look at the response rate that we've seen, let's say, in a smaller or mid-size cancer type, which is ovarian cancer with Elahere, it's quite striking. I mean, Elahere has been the most rapidly adopted ADC in the entire U.S. oncology market. And it's because it entered this market that was basically almost all chemo-based with unmet need where there had been no innovation. And when we look at the entry with 400 or Temab-A into colorectal cancer, it's a substantially larger tumor type, as it's quite evident. And we've already seen very, very nice monotherapy results in later lines, much, much better than we've seen with the old chemo standard of care. And really, it's whether or not they have c-Met or not. Now, the thing that will really cause a big inflection that Roopal can talk about in a moment is that it's the combinability as you go up into the lines of therapies, okay? And that's really going to make this thing inflect and become a very, very significant product for patients in colorectal cancer over time. Now, the studies will have to bear that out. And as well, we're seeing very, very significant early results in lung cancer as well. So, it is, I think it's an underappreciated asset. We'll have a chance with Teliso-V to sort of set the market around this whole c-Met, the modern c-Met area. But it's quite striking. So, first, we establish in later lines, very big cancer directly against older chemotherapy. And then, we move combination as we move forward. So, thanks for the question.
Roopal Thakkar: Hey, it's Roopal, maybe just a comment there on our strategy around ADCs. And I think 400 is a good highlight of that. So, we think about what's a good target, meaning high expression on the tumor, low expression in healthy tissue. And then, we are continuing to focus on patient selection, individualization of care, utilizing robust biomarkers, as Jeff mentioned, c-Met. That is the opportunity to optimize benefit-risk and particularly tolerability. With our Topo Warhead platform, we've seen low rates, for example, of alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, which others, I think, continue to struggle with. And safety and tolerability, as Jeff has mentioned, are critical. So, we're also very focused on proper dose optimization to get this right, so we're able to combine in earlier lines. And that's the same approach that we have with the other one I mentioned, 706 in small cell lung cancer and others in the pipeline.
Rob Michael: And then, David, this is Rob. I'll take your question on M&A. And thank you for acknowledging the strong track record we've had as a company. I would agree with that when you think about the transaction with BI that brought us Skyrizi, with Pharmacyclics that brought us Imbruvica, really gave us the critical mass to be a leader in blood cancers, and then the transaction with Allergan, which gave us three verticals that can really drive long-term growth for the company in neuroscience, aesthetics, and eye care. And then, more recently, the transaction with Immunogen, which really bolstered our ADC pipeline, as Roopal has highlighted. In terms of our go-forward strategy on BD, we continue to pursue assets that can add depth to our pipeline and really drive growth in the next decade. And we have a clear line of sight to growth for at least the next eight years within the company today. And so, my focus is really about bringing in assets that can help drive that growth in the next decade. And since the beginning of 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've signed more than 20 early-stage deals across immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. In immunology, we've added novel mechanisms that have the potential to raise standard care either as a monotherapy or in combination with Skyrizi and Rinvoq. You should expect that strategy to continue. In oncology, we've added new platforms, including multispecifics, trispecifics, T-cell engagers, and in situ CAR-T approaches. And then within neuroscience, it's not always appreciated the work we've been doing in neuroscience above and beyond cerebral. We expanded our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter, who discovered Vraylar. We also invested in a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh. And we recently acquired a next-generation A-beta antibody for Alzheimer's from Aliada. Again that is our area of focus. We have these five areas that can drive long-term growth. I mentioned neuroscientist aesthetics and eye care, and of course, immunology and oncology. I mean, these are all large markets with high unmet need. And so, our BD efforts are focused on building pipeline depth in those areas. Now, I should say if we see an opportunity for differentiation in another large market with high unmet need we would consider pursuing it, especially if it can help drive growth in the next decade. And the company has the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities as well.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Dave. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Yes. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. And your line is open.
Steve Scala: Thank you so much. I have an observation and two questions. The observation is splitting hairs, but on Part D redesign, the guidance had been a three percentage point headwind. It was just set on the call four percentage points. A year ago, it was two percentage points. If there is a change, please, can you identify that? Related to that is my first question. Are you seeing any evidence that IRA Medicare pricing is spilling over to the commercial market? And if yes, to what degree, or is there absolutely none? And then, my second question, the company has provided a lot of helpful perspective on the aesthetics market, but can you distill it to a number? The guidance for aesthetics was previously greater than $9 billion in 2030. What is that number now? Thank you.
Scott Reents: Steve, this is Scott. I'll go ahead and start with your Part D observation and question. With Part D, we really -- we saw that as something that the analysts and maybe the marketplace hadn't fully understood the impact. I think we were one of the first companies to come out and talk with any sort of specificity and granularity around what we saw that Part D impact, mechanics of how it would work, and the impact to it. So, we came out with a guidance number, and I think that has probably, as you noted, the numbers, but it's evolved a little bit over time. I would say it's evolved not necessarily from our understanding of Part D, but because really the mix of the business. So, when we talk about it in the second quarter, I believe I came out and said we saw it would see an approximately 3% headwind to growth from the Part D redesign. We've distilled that number and made a precise number of 4%, roughly 4% today. And really, when you think about when I came out with that 3%, we've seen momentum in the business, and we've seen momentum in the business in areas, immunology and oncology in particular, where we reached some guidance, where we saw have high Part D channel mix. And so, that's really been a business mix change that has led to that 4% change, and that's really kind of what it's amounted to.
Rob Michael: And Steve, I'll just add, I mean, when you think about the setup for the company, in '25, we said we would return to robust growth, and we're delivering in absolute terms in our guidance a little bit more than $2.5 billion of growth, and that's with headwinds from U.S. Humira erosion around $3 billion, the Part D benefit redesign of approximately $2 billion when you do the math on the roughly 4%, and then a $500 million headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. So, the underlying growth platform is going to drive $8 billion of growth when you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as neuroscience. So, the change you're seeing from, as Scott mentioned, is really more of a function of mix, but we're very pleased with the underlying growth that the business has allowed us to absorb these impacts and still deliver robust growth in 2025.
Jeff Stewart: Steve, it's Jeff. I'll take your second question. So, as we've negotiated across the commercial books and the Medicare books, we have not seen any spillover or slippage in our actual negotiations over the last cycles. And one thing I would add is that we have seen in '24 some more consumption on the benefit redesign, particularly in our oncology agents. So, for Imbruvica and Venclexta, we actually see lower discontinuations and some more consumption. And so, that's encouraging, because if you remember that Part D sort of had the lead in where the cap moved down to roughly $33,000, $34,000, it'll sequentially move down more to $2,000 with the smoothing next year, which is a good policy, because it's encouraging to see that the change in benefit design makes people stay on their cancer medication a bit longer. Again, the volume will be more modest than the price hit, as Rob and Scott described it. But that's the dynamics that we're seeing in the channels.
Scott Reents: And to answer your question regarding the aesthetics guidance, I'll reinforce maybe what I said earlier and Rob as well. So, when we look at that guidance, that long-term guidance is calling for high single-digit CAGR '25 through '29, so using '25 as the base here. If you do the math on that range, that is something above $7 billion, a little bit north of $7 billion, depending on where it falls within that high single-digit range. So, that's why we've specifically given the range on the high single-digit. The market growth that we've seen historically has been low double-digits, but we're seeing that market we're modeling for now, high single-digit growth during the time period that we've given this long-term guidance. And so, I think that answers your specific questions.
Steve Scala: Thank you very much.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Tim Anderson: Thank you. A couple of questions, please. On aesthetics, a question I've asked before, what are your expectations for how obesity drugs are going to impact this business? You could argue that the surge in use of products, the GRIP ones, could be either a tailwind or a headwind to the use of products like toxins and fillers. It could be a headwind if patients are having to pick and choose between which products to put their out-of-pocket dollars towards. And then, a second question unrelated to the first. PBM reform still being debated in Washington. If AbbVie had its way, what would change about the current relationship between PBMs and drug companies, and what would you argue should be left alone?
Carrie Strom: Hi, this is Carrie. I'll answer your first question around the obesity market and the aesthetics opportunity. And you're exactly right. It continues to be both a headwind and a tailwind, a headwind in terms of share of wallet as these consumers are making decisions on what they're going to spend for. We see that more for the higher-priced products like fillers. And then, also a tailwind as this gets a new group of consumers or patients interested in aesthetics, and many of our aesthetic providers are administering these products. And so, they see this as an opportunity for lead generation and bringing new patients into the category. So, we do see it as both a tailwind, a headwind in the short term, but a tailwind in the long term. And the question is not if injectables work. We know that these products work well in these patients. It's really about how we can partner with our customers to build it and integrate it into their treatment practice. And that's what we're doing with our customers now in helping them position Botox and Juvederm in our product line for these new patients that are entering their practice.
Rob Michael: And Tim, this is Rob. I'll take your question on PBM reform. Look, if there are changes to the rebate system, we don't have a strong preference between rebates or discounts. And that's because we've always competed on the attributes of our products, both the clinical benefit they provide and the value they return to health systems. So, we're confident in our ability to compete in either world. I would just point to our share performance in international markets that do not have a rebate-based system. And we see similar market shares in those countries as well. So, we can compete effectively in either system. We don't have a preference.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Chris Raymond: Yes, thanks. Just a question on atopic derm as a target indication, just from some of our work, it looks like the upside we're seeing in Rinvoq is largely in room and gastro. And I know you guys have sort of mentioned this, and it's fairly well known. But in atopic derm, at least from our data, it looks like things are starting to flatten out a little bit. And I heard your comments on the derm share of Rinvoq revenue in 2027. But that would seem to infer maybe some kind of inflection. So, maybe a two-part question here; first, talk about the current maybe atopic derm growth dynamic, and is there an inflection sort of anticipated? And then the second part of that is, should we be paying more attention maybe to lutikizumab as a contributor here? I know, Jeff, you've talked about atopic derm as a very important indication that you guys are targeting. Or is there some other sort of area, like external innovation, that you think will augment maybe your position in this indication? Thanks.
Jeff Stewart: Yes, it's a very good question. It's an important segment. And to give you some sense of what we see in terms of the inflection. So, we have seen a significant inflection in our new patient capture. And this is despite the launch of other interleukin products over the last year. So, we've ramped to the highest in-place shares that we've had. And it was largely flat in the teens for mid-teens for many, many quarters. And it's ramping up now above 20%. And a lot of that is we've been able to start to distinguish Rinvoq on these stringent endpoints. Basically, like really minimal disease activity where you're taking itch down to a very, very low level. And you're almost completely clearing the skin. And those are the endpoints where we significantly outperform DUPI. Now, having said that, DUPI's still got the vast majority there, but we are seeing, we will see that in-place shares start to build into the TRXs over time, because our TRX share is quite below 20% at that point. I think the other thing that I'd note is that in many, or if not most, of the outside the U.S. markets, our shares are much higher and building even a little bit faster. So, in several large markets, we actually are ahead of Dupixent. And some of that has to do with the way that the label worked during our initial launch, et cetera. But we're quite bullish over time in terms of Rinvoq as this is the best agent in terms of getting to the complete control. Now, having said that, we would and we will continue to look for more assets. Some are in our pipeline as described. But this is a very, very attractive space that we want to continue to invest in. I don't know, Roopal, if you've got any comments on ludi or some of the other concepts.
Roopal Thakkar: That's right. I mean, with the 5% penetration rate, there's still many patients that are untreated. So, lutikizumab will be our next one. And Jeff mentioned, there's other pipeline assets that we're working on. And key being skin clearance along with that itch. And if you can get them both and have a safe and tolerable profile, I think that'll continue to be competitive.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris.
Chris Raymond: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open.
Trung Huynh: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me, so, firstly, your sales in 4Q, did you see any notable difference in trends in stocking or gross-to-net patterns across the portfolio ahead of the changes in Part D versus previous years? Specifically, I'm interested if you had any meaningful one-offs for Skyrizi and Rinvoq for the quarter. And then, circling back on aesthetics, thanks for that updated long-term guide, can you give us a bit more color geographically how we should think about the split between ex-U.S.? China versus the U.S. as you return to growth? Is there an expectation on one coming back quicker than the other? Thanks.
Scott Reents: This is Scott. I'll talk about the stocking. So, we did not see -- in the past, we've talked about it a couple years ago in particular. But the stocking was relatively minimal from in terms of the impact. So, we did not see anything with respect to Skyrizi and Rinvoq on the stocking in the fourth quarter that'll be impacted in the first quarter.
Trung Huynh: And no real dynamics around gross to net either?
Scott Reents: No, that's right. For Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I'm sorry, no dynamics around gross to net for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And with respect to aesthetics, I don't know Carrie if you want?
Carrie Strom: Sure. For aesthetics, if we think about the long-term, we see, like we said, we're planning prudently for the economic recovery around key markets like U.S. and China, where it's been challenging for the past few years. Both those markets will continue to be important moving forward as will the rest of the world. We see Japan as posting nice growth as being an underdeveloped market that we're able to invest in. And then, the pipeline catalysts will be important in both U.S. and the rest of the world. Notably, in China, in the past year, we've had multiple new pipeline catalysts, which are going to -- which continue to help drive share for both toxins and fillers last year and this year. And we expect the international business to continue to increase as a percent of the revenue for overall global Allergan aesthetics.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Trung. Operator, we have time for one final question, please.
Operator: Sure. And our last question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chris Shibutani: Great. Thank you very much. When you think about going beyond 2030 with your strategy across the portfolio, can you comment about the potential impact of some of these combination approaches in immunology? Do you expect these to be IP extending? Will there be co-formulation based approaches, just trying to understand the potential revenue implications, noting that clearly there could be some clinical benefit that could certainly make sense. And then, just a question about a business segment that has been around that you never talk about, which is eye care, how and why does this fit going forward? I understand there's a legacy with the Allergan deal. But just trying to think about the overall portfolio in areas where you clearly have strengths, but this seems to be one which is less than 5% of revenues. But what is the role for that on the board? How are you thinking about it? Thank you.
Roopal Thakkar: Hey, Chris, it's Roopal. Maybe I'll start the ball rolling here on how we think about combos into '23 -- sorry in the 2030. So, the first thing is we have a very strong foundational asset in particularly IBD with Skyrizi. And you've heard me mention other combo studies in the psoriatic arthritis today as well. Now, that we would combine with the multiple assets that we've mentioned over time; TL1A, TREM-1, alpha 4 beta 7, IL-1 alpha beta, lutikizumab that we already have, that we would be able to look at as monotherapies and combo therapies. If they look good as monotherapies, they could also move forward by themselves. For all of these assets, we're also looking at biomarker approaches. Particularly with lutikizumab, but we would apply that same strategy to all of these assets. And as combinations, the goal would be co-formulations. So, as we enter into the clinical study, we're also doing CMC work in parallel to facilitate combination, co-formulation approaches. So, that would also be a convenience factor. And we would want to match with longer acting agents. So, for example, the TL1A we believe to be a longer acting agent. For TREM-1 we're seeing a long pharmacodynamic effect as an example. But then, the next way that we think about this, these combo strategies, is if we start seeing utility there, obviously moving forward with the co-formulation, but we are very competent in making bi-specifics. Lutikizumab is one of those. So, then in parallel we're making bi-specifics that could then also stand alone as single assets. And then, as you've heard recently with our Nimble transaction, we would also be looking at different mechanisms as an oral peptide. The lead one being IL-23, but we're also working on a TL1A. And what's unique and what we like about that platform is the potency, potentially being able to reduce the amount of peptide that's required and these assets having long half-lives. So, if that holds, then you could imagine combinations as a pill with these peptides with that type of profile that we hope to see. So, multiple steps as we think about immunology.
Rob Michael: This is Rob. Your question on eye care, I mean our focus on eye care is in glaucoma, retinal disease, and prescription dry eye. We like that business. It precipitates in a large market with high unmet need, meets that criteria. It has very much a scientific focus. It's a data-driven business. It's a very efficient business as well. And obviously, we're excited about the REGENXBIO Gene Therapy Program focused on wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. Depending on how that plays out, I think you could see that as becoming a stronger growth driver. We obviously have four of the five, as you think about, you get a lot of questions there. But we don't get as many questions on eye care, but we do believe as you start to get more visibility to this REGENXBIO Program, you'll likely spend more time focusing on it. We think of it as a potential to be a long-term growth driver for the company. And we like the fit it has for AbbVie.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Chris. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] Today’s call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics. Before we get started, I’ll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today’s conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll take your questions. So with that, I’ll turn the call over to Rob.
Robert A. Michael: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. AbbVie is performing exceptionally well, and I’m extremely pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities, including continued double-digit sales growth from our ex-Humira platform, the closing and integration of Cerevel Therapeutics and the progress we are making to build and advance a compelling pipeline of innovative medicines. Turning to our results, AbbVie’s diversified portfolio delivered sales that were $260 million above our expectations and reflect robust mid-single-digit operational sales growth. Our ex-Humira platform drove this over achievement, including growth of nearly 18%. The momentum of Skyrizi and Rinvoq is especially impressive with combined sales expected to exceed $17 billion this year, which is $1.3 billion above our initial expectations. And, we see substantial opportunity for continued strong growth well into the next decade. Several other key products also delivered double-digit sales growth, including Venclexta, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and Qulipta. This broad-based performance further demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. For the third time this year, we are raising our full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We are increasing our full-year revenue guidance by $500 million and have now raised total revenue by $1.8 billion since our initial guidance in February. We are also raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 and now expect adjusted EPS between $10.90 and $10.94. In addition to achieving strong quarterly results, we have been very focused on investing in the business to generate sustainable long-term performance in the 2030s and beyond. During the quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of Cerevel Therapeutics, strengthening our neuroscience pipeline. Cerevel enhances our ability to help patients suffering from devastating conditions such as Parkinson’s and schizophrenia. The integration has been seamless and we are excited to have the talented Cerevel team join our organization. Within the Cerevel pipeline, we are very pleased with the positive Phase 3 results and emerging profile of tavapadon in Parkinson’s. And, we remain on-track to read out both pivotal studies for emraclidine in schizophrenia in the fourth quarter. More broadly on the pipeline, we have been advancing key R&D programs across all stages of development. Some notable highlights include the U.S. approvals of Vyalev for advanced Parkinson’s and Botox for platysma bands. The U.S. regulatory submission of Teliso-V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer, and the start of our Phase 2 Crohn’s platform study, which is evaluating Skyrizi in combination with several novel biologics. In summary, AbbVie continues to demonstrate strong commercial, operational and R&D execution. The robust performance of our growth platform once again exceeded our expectations and we see numerous opportunities to drive long-term growth. Further underscoring our confidence in that growth, today we announced a 5.8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2025. Since inception, we have increased our quarterly dividend by more than 300%. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff, for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeffrey R. Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I’m extremely pleased with the continued strong momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. I’ll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $7 billion up 4.8% on an operational basis. Skyrizi global sales were $3.2 billion up 51.5% on an operational basis, exceeding our expectations. We are seeing robust prescription growth across psoriatic disease, with Skyrizi achieving in-play biologic share leadership in approximately now 30 key countries. In the U.S, we continue to capture nearly one out of every two in-play psoriatic disease patients on biologic therapy and we see substantial room for further total share growth. We believe that Skyrizi’s best-in-class profile with nearly complete skin clearance, high durability of response, easy onboarding and quarterly dosing for maintenance therapy sets a very high bar relative to other therapies on market or in development. Skyrizi has also demonstrated a compelling clinical profile in IBD, including strong endoscopic data paired with convenient dosing. This differentiated profile as well as our compelling head-to-head sequence data versus Stelara is supporting very rapid uptake in Crohn’s disease, where Skyrizi continues to gain market share globally, achieving in-play patient leadership across all lines of therapy in the U.S, Japan and Canada. Skyrizi’s U.S. in-play patient share is now approximately 32%, more than double the share of the second biologic treatment. And with Skyrizi’s total prescription share of approximately 8%, we see significant opportunity for revenue inflection in Crohn’s going forward. While we are still very early in our launch in the U.S. and Europe, we also anticipate robust uptake for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis the new indication. Initial prescription trends as well as feedback from gastroenterologists have been overwhelmingly positive. Physicians are particularly impressed with the data that has been demonstrated for naive UC patients, who have not been exposed yet to biologics, where Skyrizi achieved very high results for clinical remission and endoscopic response. We have now secured broad formulary access for Skyrizi in UC, with sales in this indication expected to ramp meaningfully over the next several quarters. So, given the momentum we are seeing across all of these indications, we will be raising our full-year sales guidance once again for Skyrizi. Turning now to Rinvoq, which is also demonstrating robust growth. Global sales were $1.6 billion up 47.4% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong prescription growth across all seven of Rinvoq’s approved indications. I’m especially pleased with our performance in IBD, where Rinvoq’s uptake is exceeding our expectations. Rinvoq is now capturing double-digit in-play patient share in the U.S. for ulcerative colitis as well as Crohn’s disease. Both indications are now available in more than 75 countries with reimbursement and share continuing to increase. I also wanted to highlight our recent performance in atopic dermatitis, where Rinvoq is seeing an acceleration of in-play share following recent positive data from our second head-to-head study versus Dupixent. As an oral option that provides rapid skin clearance and itch relief, we believe Rinvoq’s strong differentiated profile will continue to compete well in this highly underpenetrated AD market. As a result of this continued strong performance, we will also be increasing the full-year sales guidance once again for Rinvoq. Looking forward, we see substantial momentum for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq, including continued share gains across existing indications on top of the typical underlying market growth across room, derm and gastro. Additionally, we are making excellent progress with several new indications for Rinvoq across sizable markets that will have the potential to provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s. From a competitive perspective, a key element of Skyrizi and Rinvoq’s success has been their strong differentiation with compelling head-to-head data against several novel therapies. This includes Skyrizi superiority versus Humira, Cosentyx, Otezla and Stelara in psoriasis as well as Stelara in Crohn’s disease and Rinvoq superiority versus Humira and Orencia in rheumatoid arthritis as well as Dupixent in atopic dermatitis. To further support our differentiation, we have another head-to-head study ongoing for Skyrizi versus Sotyktu in psoriasis with plans also underway now for a study comparing Skyrizi versus Entyvio in ulcerative colitis. So given all of these factors, we feel very confident about the long-term growth prospects for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $2.2 billion down 36.5% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. While Humira share erosion to biosimilars in the U.S. is largely in-line with our expectations, we are now seeing more Humira molecule volume moving to other novel mechanisms than previously anticipated. So, while this has an unfavorable impact to Humira sales, we are seeing a benefit to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a very favorable dynamic for immunology portfolio now and certainly over the long-term. Moving now to Oncology, where total revenues were approximately $1.7 billion Imbruvica global revenues were $828 million down 8.8%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL, partially offset by higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta is performing extremely well. Global sales were $677 million up 18.2% on an operational basis. This reflects strong momentum in CLL, especially in Europe, where recent guideline changes recommend combination use of Venclexta Plus BTK inhibitors as a preferred fixed duration treatment versus continuous BTK treatment alone. Growth is also supported by our very strong share position in frontline AML, where Venclexta is the leading treatment for patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. We are also seeing nice sequential revenue growth from Elahere and Epkinly, which are both demonstrating strong launch trajectories. Turning now to neuroscience, where total revenues were more than $2.3 billion up 16% on an operational basis. Vraylar is demonstrating robust performance. Sales were $875 million up 16.6% on an operational basis, reflecting continued new prescription growth in both bipolar disorder and adjunctive MDD. Within migraine, our leading oral CGRP therapies contributed $445 million in combined revenue this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 22%, as we continue to see increasing prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Global Botox Therapeutic sales were $848 million reflecting strong performance in chronic migraine as well as the other approved indications. Finally, we are very excited for the recent U.S. approval of Vyalev, a transformative therapy for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease, who are uncontrolled on oral therapy alone. As a less invasive, non-surgical delivery system that can provide meaningful improvements in on-time and off-time, we believe Vyalev has the potential to significantly expand use beyond current device aided therapies. Sales in the U.S. for Vyalev are expected to ramp gradually over the next several quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination. At the same time, we are very encouraged by the interest in uptake internationally, where we have approval now in 35 countries with several thousand patients already on treatment. Longer-term, we anticipate peak sales of Vyalev to exceed $1 billion. So overall, I’m very pleased with the continued commercial execution and performance across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Carrie, for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?
Carrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Third quarter global aesthetics sales were more than $1.2 billion representing growth of 1.8% on an operational basis. In the U.S, aesthetic sales of $791 million increased by 3.9%, driven by growth from Botox Cosmetic as well as other brands across our broad portfolio. U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $414 million an increase of 6.5% versus the prior year. Favorable pricing dynamics and facial toxin market growth more than offset modest share erosion. Botox Cosmetics remains the clear market leader. U.S. Juvederm sales were $105 million. Juvederm’s market-leading share was consistent with last year and the overall filler market was roughly flat to the prior year. While the U.S. facial injectable market remains largely stable, growth is below historical rates. As a result, there is a reluctance from customers to maintain traditional toxin and filler inventory levels. Based upon the relatively higher price point of filler procedures in a still challenging U.S. economic environment, Juvederm is more impacted by this dynamic, which can be seen in third quarter results. Internationally, aesthetic sales were $448 million reflecting a decline of 1.6% on an operational basis. Within China, the economic dynamics that weighed on our results during the first half of the year have continued to impact consumer spending. This has created challenging aesthetic market conditions that have been particularly impactful to Juvederm’s performance. Primarily due to this circumstance, we are moderating our Juvederm sales outlook for the year. We are encouraged by the recently announced government stimulus in China. We will continue to monitor for any further developments and how it could positively impact consumer discretionary spending and aesthetic market growth. Although the current dynamics in China are challenging, its potential remains attractive and we are committed to bring innovation to this market that will drive long-term growth. Along those lines, in China, we recently received approval for the Botox Cosmetic indication in masseter muscle prominence, marking the first toxin in the world to have this indication. This approval enables us to market and train to this important treatment option that addresses a top aesthetic concern among many Asian patients. In the U.S., we are pleased that we received FDA approval for the use of Botox Cosmetic to treat platysma bands. This approval positions Botox as the only cosmetic toxin with four distinct indications and enables us to market and train beyond the face for the improvement of neck and jawline appearance. We also remain excited about the opportunity for BoNT/E. Based upon its rapid onset and short acting profile, BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients that are hesitant to try facial toxins, driving long-term market expansion. Looking to the future, we continue to see significant growth potential for our aesthetics portfolio based upon low market penetration rates, our commitment to introduce novel treatments, our strong customer relationships and our position as the global aesthetics leader. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Roopal.
Roopal Thakkar: Thank you, Carrie. Starting with immunology, where we recently began our Phase 2 Crohn’s disease platform study, which will evaluate Skyrizi in combination with several other novel biologics. This study will initially look at combinations of Skyrizi with our anti-IL-1α/β bispecific lutikizumab and our novel anti-α4β7 antibody ABBV-382. We are planning to include additional novel biologics in the future. Our approach in immunology has been to pursue therapies that are well differentiated and have the potential to elevate standard of care. We have clearly achieved this with Rinvoq and Skyrizi across multiple indications, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. As we think about how the IBD market will evolve, we view dual mechanism approaches as having the greatest potential to achieve levels of efficacy that are above current standard of care. We are very excited about the potential for these combination therapies in IBD and we look forward to sharing updates as the data mature. In Oncology, we continue to make very good progress across all stages of our hem and solid tumor pipeline. In the area of solid tumors, we recently submitted our application to the FDA for accelerated approval of Teliso-V as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Once approved, Teliso-V will become the first c-Met targeted ADC to enter non-small cell lung cancer, a segment with limited options and where patients tend to have a very poor prognosis, especially if their tumors express c-Met. We anticipate an approval decision in the first half of 2025. In the quarter, we also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending Elahere for the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer in patients with high expression of FRα and treated with up to three prior therapies. This decision was based on the positive Phase 3 MIRASOL trial where Elahere demonstrated an overall survival benefit and significantly reduce the risk of cancer progression. We anticipate an approval decision in Europe in the fourth quarter. At the recent ESMO Congress we presented new Phase 1 data for ABBV-400 in advanced non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. Early efficacy data from the lung cohort are promising with an objective response rate of 48% across all patients in the study and response rates ranging from 60% to 78% in patients with overexpressed c-Met. We are very pleased with the level of activity we’re seeing from our next generation c-Met ADC, which compares favorably to Teliso-V, where we’ve seen objective response rates ranging from 23% in medium c-Met expressors to 35% in patients with high c-Met expression. 400 has the potential to expand our c-Met portfolio into earlier lines of therapy and lower levels of c-Met expression in lung cancer. Similarly, in patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer, 400 demonstrated promising activity with an objective response rate of 29% across all patients. This compares well against combination and single agent chemotherapy, which are the standards of care for patients in second line and third line of therapy respectively. Based on these encouraging preliminary data, we plan to begin Phase 2 studies for 400 in both non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. Recall, we’ve also advanced 400 in late line colorectal cancer and we remain on-track to begin a Phase 3 study later this year. In the area of hematologic oncology, we received approval in Europe for Tepkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of therapy. Epcoritamab is now the only T-cell engaging bispecific approved in the U.S. and Europe to treat both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Moving to neuroscience, we recently received FDA approval for Vyalev as the first subcutaneous 24 hour infusion of levodopa based therapy for the treatment of motor fluctuations in adults with advanced Parkinson’s disease. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery offers meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development. Vyalev delivers significant improvements in on-time and off-time with a non-surgical 24 hour delivery system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by Duopa and it doesn’t require combination with oral drugs to achieve efficacy. We’re extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in the U.S. We also recently announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 TEMPO-1 trial, which evaluated fixed doses of monotherapy tavapadon in early Parkinson’s disease. In the study, both doses of tavapadon met the primary endpoint demonstrating a significant reduction in the severity of Parkinson’s disease symptoms compared with placebo at week 26, as measured by decreases in the combined scores for Parts 2 and 3 of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. Key secondary endpoints were also met in this study. We are very pleased with the emerging profile for tavapadon, which shows it is generally safe and well tolerated and it can drive strong efficacy as a monotherapy in early Parkinson’s and as an adjunctive treatment in patients with more advanced disease. Results from the two Phase 3 studies thus far look favorable compared to other dopamine agonists on the market. And, we believe tavapadon has the potential to become an important new treatment option as a monotherapy for Parkinson’s patients as well as an adjunct to oral levo/carbidopa. We expect to see results from TEMPO-2 later this year, which is our Phase 3 monotherapy study evaluating a flexible dose of tavapadon. Results from our long-term safety study, TEMPO-4 are expected next year. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to share data from the two emraclidine pivotal studies in the fourth quarter. We also continue to invest in external innovation to strengthen our neuroscience pipeline. We recently announced two deals in this area, including an expanded collaboration with Gedeon Richter to develop novel targets for neuropsychiatric conditions and the acquisition of Aliada brings an anti-pyroglutamate Aβ antibody, which uses a unique blood brain barrier crossing and amyloid aggregate clearing technology. Aliada’s lead antibody has been able to achieve encouraging levels in cerebrospinal fluid with an extended half-life and the potential to be delivered subcutaneously. This molecule could become a best-in-class treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. Aliada’s novel technologies for enabling therapeutics to access the central nervous system also have the potential to be used with other programs across our neuroscience pipeline. In aesthetics, we recently received approval for Botox in the U.S. for moderate to severe platysma bands, marking the first global approval in this indication for any neurotoxin. There is currently a lack of non-surgical treatments available to improve the appearance of prominent platysma bands. And, we believe Botox will represent an important new treatment option for patients who are looking to reduce the appearance of vertical neck bands and improve jawline definition. In our novel toxin portfolio, we remain on-track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E around the end of this year. Our rapid onset short acting toxin has a highly differentiated clinical profile and once approved will offer patients a novel option compared to currently available neurotoxins. So in summary, this has been a very productive year thus far for our R&D organization and we are pleased with the progress we’ve made advancing our broad pipeline. With that, I’ll turn the call over to, Scott.
Scott T. Reents: Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our third quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3 which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.04 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $14.5 billion reflecting robust growth of 4.9% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Our ex-Humira growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie’s total sales, delivered reported growth of nearly 18%, once again exceeding our expectations. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.7% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.4%, adjusted R&D expense of 14.2%, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.6% and adjusted SG&A expense of 23%. Net interest expense was $591 million. The adjusted tax rate was 16.2%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.15 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $10.94. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $56 billion, an increase of $500 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.7% unfavorable impact on full-year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updates to select key products and therapeutic areas. We now approximate Skyrizi global sales of $11.5 billion, an increase of $500 million due to continued strong performance across all approved indications. Rinvoq total revenue of $5.8 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting robust uptake in IBD. U.S. Humira total sales of $7.4 billion a decrease of $400 million reflecting more Humira molecule volume moving to other novel mechanisms, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Imbruvica totaled revenue of $3.3 billion an increase of $200 million reflecting higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta total sales of $2.6 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting momentum in both U.S. and international markets. Aesthetics global revenue of $5.3 billion a decrease of $200 million almost entirely due to lower Juvederm volume which continues to be impacted by challenging economic conditions in key markets. Vraylar total sales of $3.3 billion a decrease of $100 million reflecting continued strong prescription demand partially offset by modestly unfavorable channel mix. And for Botox, we now expect global revenue in the therapeutic space of $3.3 billion an increase of $100 million reflecting robust demand across all indications. Moving to the P&L for 2024. We continue to forecast a full-year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% as well as an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales, which includes a 2.1% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Turning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues approaching $14.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.94 and $2.98. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter and excludes any potential impact from the recently announced acquisition of Aliada Therapeutics. Finally, AbbVie’s robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of September was nearly $7.3 billion and we generated more than $11 billion of free cash flow, which includes approximately $1.5 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments in the first nine-months of the year. This free cash flow fully supports a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we are increasing 5.8% to $1.64 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in 2025, as well as debt repayment, where we remain on-track to pay down the roughly $7 billion of maturities this year and anticipate achieving a net leverage ratio of two times by the end of 2026. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for additional business development. We have executed more than a dozen early stage deals so far this year, and we continue to assess external innovation across all of our key growth areas. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered strong top and bottom line results. I’m very pleased with the momentum of our ex-Humira growth platform, including continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which further supports AbbVie’s long-term outlook. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. We are aware of a peer earnings call that begins at 9:00 A.M. Central, so we will do our best to wrap up our Q&A right around the top of the hour. So, in the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible, please limit yourself to just one question. Operator, first question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. You may ask your question.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the question, and congrats on the results. My question was really just centered around 2025 and just some preliminary outlook there. I guess a specific question, you mentioned Humira volumes are maybe shifting over to newer drugs. You comment at all about just in terms of where the street sits currently with Humira. I think consensus number is about $6.8 billion. Is that a reasonable forecast, or is that something you could see higher erosion given what’s happening with Humira? And, then bigger picture kind of tied to that, the mid-single-digit topline growth, it sounds like the trends you’re seeing here may be a net positive where maybe Humira volumes are declining, but that’s largely moving over to Skyrizi and Rinvoq. I just want to get some context of is that mid-single-digit target still a reasonable one to think about for AbbVie next year? Thank you.
Robert A. Michael: Thanks for the question, Chris. This is Rob. I’ll start and then I’ll have Jeff supplement. So yes, we are very confident in that robust mid-single-digit growth, both topline, bottom line for 2025. I think you’ve interpreted correctly that the trends we’re seeing are net positive and that we’re seeing over performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq more than offsetting the dynamics with Humira. And so, as we look at consensus, that’s probably not reflected. So, I think it’s fair to say, there’s a shift that’s required there, but we’re very pleased with the strong uptake for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. As I mentioned in my remarks, we have now delivered guidance increases of $1.3 billion for Skyrizi and Rinvoq in total. We’re seeing tremendous momentum, particularly with the IBD indications across really all indications, but particularly in IBD. And, we are starting to see the dynamic with the overall Humira molecule, where there is the switching that we’re seeing now to other mechanisms, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a long-term very positive benefit. So, as we look at the business, we’re very well-positioned. Essentially two years after the U.S. Humira LOE, we’ll be returning to robust top line and bottom line growth, and really performance across many parts of the business, not just Skyrizi and Rinvoq. You’ve seen us perform very nicely in oncology. We’ve obviously over performed our expectations in oncology, very pleased with the earlier returns on Elahere. Venclexta is performing exceptionally well. The guidelines changes in Europe are positive as we think about combination opportunities with BTK inhibitors. So, Venclexta is going to be strong, Epkinly is performing very nicely as well. And, then when I look across the neuroscience franchise, Vraylar is a strong grower. We’re very pleased with the migraine portfolio. Obviously, very excited about Cerevel and doing a number of deals now on the early pipeline both with Gedeon Richter and Aliada that really fortifies the long-term view for neuroscience as well. And, then with aesthetics, while it’s below our expectations for this year, obviously the economic conditions have dictated that. We still have tremendous confidence in the long-term outlook for that business. But, as we look at 2025, we’re very confident in our ability to return to that robust mid-single-digit growth.
Jeffrey R. Stewart: Yes. Thanks, Rob. And, I’ll just add a little bit more flavor. It’s Jeff. So, we saw this trend start to emerge in terms of this compression of the, let’s say, the ADAM molecule or the ADAM market, the Humira plus biosimilars, just prior to the CVS event and then it accelerated over Q2. And again, we saw it throughout Q3. So, that’s why we’ve adapted our approach here. Other than this dynamic, the biosimilar dynamics are playing out really exactly as we anticipated. And you can see this compression in the IQVIA data. So, really the shrinking of the Humira or the ADAM market is something that’s quite clear. It’s a little difficult quantify over time with full precision, but we can see that the molecule continues to decline sequentially and we continue to see strong share gains as I highlighted for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So, this incremental flow from the molecule compression, it’s clearly a contributing factor to some of the over performance that we saw in Q2 and Q3, but it’s really only one of several. We’ve also had significant incremental investments in the consumer space, the sales force approaches we’ve taken, Chris, the integration of the head-to-head data I talked about. And, certainly now we’re starting to see the impact of the UC launch. So, when we put all that together, we think that the dynamics are net-net quite positive overall. And, as Rob said, we’re still looking good for 25%.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question please.,
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal. Your line is open. You may ask your question.
Mohit Bansal: Awesome. Thank you very much for taking my question. Just wanted to touch upon the trial you are running head-to-head against Entyvio. Could you help us understand based on pre-clinical or early data, what gives you confidence there? And, are you looking at non-inferiority or potential superiority over Entyvio there? Thank you.
Roopal Thakkar: Mohit, it’s Roopal. I’ll take that one. So, when we look at the data, in particular, I think Jeff highlighted this, in ulcerative colitis with Skyrizi in this naive patient population, this is a patient population that hasn’t seen biologics or other advanced therapies like JAK inhibitors. The endoscopic improvement and this is in label was 76% in the maintenance portion of this. So, it was quite high, in fact, higher than what we’ve observed even with Rinvoq. So that gave us a good amount of confidence that we have the potential to differentiate with all other assets. You heard about the Skyrizi versus, ustekinumab head to head in Crohn’s disease, but this one gives us a unique opportunity there to go head to head with vedolizumab, especially looking at endoscopic improvement. So, for that particular endpoint, you asked about the type of endpoint. There we would think about superiority, because of it being an objective endpoint. Sometimes with symptoms like clinical remission, these could bounce around. That may be one where we consider as non-inferiority. But I would say endoscopic improvements in the field are now believed to be highly predictive of long-term outcomes. So, that would be how we’re looking at this, Mohit.
Mohit Bansal: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And this question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. You may ask your question.
Vamil Divan: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So, yes, I’ll give you just one on emraclidine. Just getting a lot of questions from investors kind of leading up to that data release. So, maybe you can just the level set expectations on what you’re hoping to see from the data, especially obviously now we have the approval from Bristol with [Coventry] (ph). Just kind of what are you thinking in terms of efficacy safety profile relative to that competitor? And also on the liver testing requirement that they had at initiation, is that something you’d expect as well based on your data? And then finally just tying to that just in terms of the data release, do you expect to get one press release or do you think you’re combining both studies? Or should we still expect the two separate releases? Thank you.
Roopal Thakkar: Yes, Vamil, it’s Roopal. I’ll take that one. So, a couple of things. Maybe starting with what we’ve observed with the approval. So, we were encouraged by the lack of a boxed warning, meaning there’s a recognition that this is a unique mechanism of action looking specifically at the muscarinic class. So, we were pleased to see that. I think what was notable for us was the GI adverse events, including how that would play out in terms of longer-term tolerability. Also anticholinergic effects, bladder retention that was something I guess we did not anticipate. You mentioned hepatic monitoring that was something that we didn’t anticipate. The other thing that was notable is along with the BID dosing, there is a food effect. So, you have to wait a certain period amount of time when you eat and after you eat when you can take the pill. So, when we think about our profile, we continue to be encouraged with emraclidine being a single agent, once a day, no food effect. We don’t see the extent of GI effects. We don’t and we have not observed in the Phase 1b data any bladder issues. And when we had looked at that 1b data, we didn’t see any hepatic issues, so we don’t anticipate any type of laboratory monitoring. We were also thinking about neurodegeneration associated psychosis and these patients are typically older and likely more sensitive to anticholinergic effects. So, we continue to see an opportunity in that patient population as well. So, we’ve stated that the data will read out here in the next couple of months in the quarter. The same team is working on wrapping up these two studies. So, depending on how far apart the data are, we’ll probably determine as you stated, is it 1 or 2 press releases. It’s a little early right now for us to tell you is it going to be 1 or 2. But if they’re going to be close together, it’s potentially going to be 1.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Vamil. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Terence Flynn : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a two part for me. Just wondering if you can I’m assuming contracting is now wrapped up, if you can comment at all on how to think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, formulary positioning and pricing just high level for 2025. Thank you.
Jeffrey R. Stewart: Yes. Hi, it’s Jeff. So yes, contracting is very, very close to wrapping up. We have a few more nuances and so typically that may take another month or so. Overall, we’re making very good progress on contracting next year. So, in terms of what we’ve highlighted in the past is we do not anticipate any material change for Skyrizi and Rinvoq in terms of the access for next year across Medicare or the commercial plans. We have quite high, very broad access and we assume that will continue. In terms of what we’ve highlighted to anticipate, we’ve said that we do have over our near-term in LRP sort of a negative pricing environment, but it’s modest. It’s nothing like we saw many quarters ago where we had seven indications. So, we said from a rebate perspective, low single digit changes is a reasonable assumption that we feel confident in despite we’re not fully complete, I think that’s a fair assessment at this point.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question. Chris Shibutani, your line is open. You may ask your question.
Chris Shibutani: Apologies, I was on mute. Thanks for the question. All the comments you’ve made about Skyrizi or Rinvoq and the molecule switching are very helpful. Just curious as we think on the forward about other potential mechanisms and modalities in particular. I think we have competitor oral data that’s coming up. Interested to hear your thoughts in terms of that modality difference as well as, how you might rank your optimism for some of the new mechanisms of action? I believe you have a TL1A as well in your pipeline though earlier stage. Thank you.
Roopal Thakkar: Hi, Chris. It’s Roopal. I’ll take that one. With respect to the oral, I’ll take us back to the Skyrizi head-to-head that occurred with apremilast, which is also an oral. The data were substantially higher from an efficacy standpoint for Skyrizi as was the tolerability along with when we asked patients what did they prefer, they actually preferred quarterly subcutaneous dosing. So, I would think about it that way as well. Now the question would be, it’s a similar mechanism, could the efficacy be better than what has been observed with a apremilast in psoriasis? Well, what we saw in the Phase 2 data, my recollection still is that Skyrizi is a full 50% higher when it comes to full skin clearance at a PASI 100. And that’s where the bar is now at PASI 90 and PASI 100. So, we still see an efficacy advantage. Also the data I’m sharing are Phase 3 Skyrizi data. The data that we saw for the oral 23 was from Phase 2. So, there is a reasonable potential that the efficacy data tend to settle down when you go to a broader patient population, especially those that have had longer standing disease or have seen other therapies like other biologics. So, we continue to feel very good and optimistic about our profile versus any emerging competition. Also, we think about our assets from a global standpoint. And when you think about majority of the countries, they are very driven by efficacy to gain access. And in the oral space, we don’t really see it across the globe. Maybe there’s a couple of countries. I think Jeff has mentioned the U.S., but that space may be referred to as a pre biologic space. So maybe more of an influence on the TIK2 or on a apremilast is how we see it. In terms of other mechanisms that we like, as I mentioned, we like anti L23 the way it’s delivered with Skyrizi, the depth of response, the high durability and the convenience with quarterly dosing. If we can couple that with other assets as part of our combination approach, we think that’s going to be extremely competitive in the future. Mechanisms like TL1a, we think are going to be important, especially from a combination approach, which we have one internally. We think the ulcerative colitis data are encouraging, but from a monotherapy standpoint, not differentiated, especially when you look at the Skyrizi data that I mentioned earlier and Rinvoq. And then in Crohn’s, something like TL1a, we think it really does need a combo. So that’ll be part of our platform along with our novel alpha 4 beta 7, we think that’s also a good combo. And then we’ve also provided very strong data in hidradenitis suppurativa with our IL-1 alpha beta lutikizumab. And we’ve seen some preclinical signals that IL-1 beta could be a driver of disease and resistance to other biologics. So, lutikizumab will also be part of the combo in our IBD platform. So, that’s just some of the mechanisms that we’re excited about. There are several others that are early in the pipeline and we will give you more information about those as the data mature.
Chris Shibutani: Thanks very helpful.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Craig. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. You may ask your question.
Trung Huynh: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the aesthetics business, in the Q&A you did mention that you still have a tremendous amount of confidence hitting that longer term guide here. I’m curious on how dependent this is on the economic environment getting better and getting better quickly. So, you’ve moderated your Juvederm outlook this year because it’s not being good. If next year is another challenging economic year, could we see that $9 billion in 2029 being moderated or even pulled? Just what’s giving you confidence? Thank you.
Robert A. Michael: Thanks for the question. This is Rob. I’ll take that one. So, as we think about the long-term guide, which is greater than $9 billion by 2029, you need to believe that you can have essentially a compound growth around 11% to get there. If we look at the historical growth of this market, it’s been, let’s say, call it low double digits, low teens. As we look at it going forward, we think probably a more prudent assumption is when we see the recovery, something more in the high single digits, right? So, you need something beyond just the market recovery to get there. And when we look at our the innovation that we’re bringing particularly with the short onset, short acting or fast onset short acting BoNT/E that we expect to launch in ‘26. That could really transform the market, because if you think about the number one barrier for patients is fear of an unnatural look. That could really unlock a part of the market that’s dormant right now, plus it could also lead to share gains. And so I think we need to see, 1, how the market recovers, I would say, 2025 and 26 and then ultimately see how the BoNT/E launch ramps in ‘26. At that point, we’ll have a better sense of the $9 billion as we sit here today. If you believe that the market will recover to high single digits and we have a lot of confidence in BoNT/E, we still believe we can get there, which is why we’re not updating that guidance. But I would expect us to reflect more on that more likely in the ‘26 timeframe than in ‘25.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Trung. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Citi. You may ask your question.
Geoff Meacham: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I had a bigger picture one for Rob. So, when I look at your therapeutic areas, eye care stands out as one that’s pretty modest contributor today and also down the road. How would you rank that business strategically? And then related when you look at BD going forward, are there other TAs that you’re looking at that could be additive, just thinking specifically maybe metabolic or cardio? Thank you.
Robert A. Michael: Thanks for the question, Geoff. So, this is Rob. So yes, I mean, our main focus is our five key growth areas, which includes eye care, includes immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. And we participate in large markets with high unmet need that have great growth potential. And within those five verticals, we’re building depth across 24 core areas that does include eye care as well. When you think about diabetic retinopathy, wet AMD, prescription dry eye medications. And so eye care does play an important role, albeit it’s not as high of a growth driver as the other four verticals, but it is part of our five. And that ultimately guides both our internal R&D investments as well as our BD efforts, which as you know, continue to be very active. So, far this year, we’ve executed 15 deals along those lines, really focused more on early stage opportunities to drive growth in the next decade. So that’s our primary focus. Now if we see an opportunity for differentiation in a large market with high unmet need like metabolics, we would consider pursuing it, especially if we can help drive growth in the next decade. But again, it would be more opportunistic. We have to see differentiation and right now it’s not our primary focus. But again, we’re open to more sources of growth for the next decade if we see differentiation that we can create value. And we certainly have the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.
James Shin: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our question. For emraclidine’s readout, I think there’s a question on how much erosion could be anticipated. I know you mentioned that the team the same team that was originally working on the Phase 1b is wrapping up studies and so forth. But there’s been some other data that has copied some of Cerevel strategies such as high baseline pans and so forth and placebo effect was still kind of surprisingly higher than it should be. Is there any insight on managing this placebo effect? Thank you.
Roopal Thakkar: Thanks, James. It’s Roopal. When we did our thorough diligence, that was a major question that we and the broader team had. So, you bring up a good point. Some things that we observed in those two studies that will be the pivotal readouts were what Cerevel was strategically doing. One thing was limiting the number of countries, limiting the number of sites, central review for eligibility criteria, training of raters, certifying those raters, recertifying raters, monitoring blinded data with respect to site activity. So, I think those are important factors that could drive placebo in either direction. So, what we observed was, we would say a good control or at least the best one could do to manage placebo responses. So, it’s hard to know what if there’s any erosion until we see the data. But the effect size that we did see in the Phase 1b was a little over 12 points. So, we think that was a strong separation. And even if that were to go down a little bit, we still feel that based on the safety profile and tolerability profile, this could still be very, very competitive even if we saw a droppage in some point on the efficacy side.
Liz Shea: Thanks, James. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open. You may ask your question.
Carter Gould: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to follow-up a little bit on the Aliada acquisition, sort of what differentiation you saw over some of the other enhanced brain delivery kind of approaches there that gave you confidence. And maybe we’ve seen AbbVie take a number of shots on goal across Alzheimer’s here, just seems pretty central to your longer term neuroscience portfolio. Can you maybe just again put that in some broader context as you think about the TA strategy longer term? Thank you.
Roopal Thakkar: Sure. It’s Roopal. I’ll take that. Yes, we’ve been investing for a number of years in the space. And in addition to the recent deal, we’ll have an option readout with Alector and TREM2 coming up. We have SV2A molecule that would look at cognition and other symptoms. Emraclidine could participate in that space from an Alzheimer’s psychosis standpoint. We have other pipeline assets that are looking at tau, intracellular and even an approach looking at extracellular tau. We did have our own A beta monotherapeutic antibody, which we did read out. It did look good, but it wasn’t fully differentiated. And moving on to the Aliada deal, what we see there is the ability to access the CSF at what we would say at this stage at higher concentrations than maybe other competitors. So, we think that’s a good thing. The other aspect that we like is an extended half-life. So that could lead to convenient dosing. And if this approach plays out than one could consider having subcutaneous dosing even getting out to monthly. And if the efficacy is high because of deeper brain penetration that could result in lower levels, faster and a better able to see cognition benefit in a year or 18 months. So, those are some of the benefits that we would see. The other benefit would be getting to the parenchymal tissue more broadly and that could have a reduction in ARIA, which is probably what is disallowing this to really take off. It’s very challenging to take an elderly family member to get multiple scans and worry about them having stroke like symptoms. So, that would be something else we believe we can address with this asset of having a strong safety profile, tolerability, ease of onboarding and high efficacy and ultimately strong benefits on cognition.
Robert A. Michael: And this is Rob. I’ll just add on here as we think about strategically about the neuroscience franchise. I mean, I think about it as having really four main segments, psychiatry, migraine, Parkinson’s and then neurodegeneration. And if you look at what we’ve done to build out the long-term growth outlook for this franchise, obviously, in psychiatry between Cereval, Gedeon Richter, we also had the early stage opportunity with Gilgamesh, really investing in longer term growth in psychiatry. We have actually a very strong franchise in migraine with the oral CGRPs as well as Botox Therapeutic. In Parkinson’s, now the launch of Vyalev, which is performing very nicely outside the U.S., and we expect will also perform nicely in the U.S. The early Phase 3 data we’ve seen so far for davapidone, the mitokinin disease modifying approach, it’s early and Parkinson’s is another investment we’ve made. And then in Alzheimer’s now with Aliada is another I’d say, long-term investment we’re making to grow the neuroscience franchise. There’s also adjacencies like ALS, MS that we’re interested in that we have some partnerships that we’ll continue to pursue. So, we see neuroscience as an important long-term growth driver for the company. We’re obviously investing heavily across a number of areas. But we think about really in those four categories, and so it’s one that we’re obviously very excited about the future prospects for.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. You may ask your question.
Steve Scala: Thank you so much. I’m a bit surprised that how Cerevel was such a focus in the prepared remarks given the pending emraclidine data, which very much will color views of the Cerevel acquisition. Should we conclude you have increased confidence and or insight into the pending data? And related to that, KOLs seem to be looking for an effect size of 0.6. But based on what was just said, that doesn’t even seem to be a possibility. So, any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you.
Robert A. Michael: This is Rob and Roopal can take the second part. I’ll take the first part of the question. So, Steve, in the prepared remarks, we were talking about the quarter. We obviously closed the Cerevel transaction in the quarter. That’s a significant event. We also did see the Phase 3 trial results for tavapadon, so that was important to comment as well. As we’ve mentioned, we expect the two pivotals from emraclidine to read out in the fourth quarter. So, I wouldn’t read too much into it other than it was an important event to highlight in the quarter.
Roopal Thakkar: Yes. And it’s Roopal. I agree. We have two positive Phase III studies with tavapadon. And in the oral space, I don’t know if we’ve seen a new mechanism that could have this type of approach in a very long time. So, it is important to discuss that because the unmet need continues to be very high and Parkinson’s is a place where we believe we can meaningfully participate in. On the effect size question, when we look at the 1b data, it was more than a 12 point differential. So we have observed sometimes a decrement and the question was around if placebo responses move up a little bit. So that being said, we still think we can maintain a very strong effect size coupled with the safety profile. Remember that the issue here in therapy isn’t just about efficacy, it’s about maintaining these patients on a drug that they can tolerate. And the majority of these patients don’t last very long and cycle through these assets and even stop these, especially atypicals without even letting their physicians know and then go on to have a flare and end up in the hospital. So, we think about this as a benefit, risk and tolerability profile and from a weight, metabolic, motor symptoms, sedation, these are major problems with atypicals. And with something like emraclidine, we feel that we can still fully differentiate. So, I don’t know if I’d read into any concerns other than maybe seeing an effect that’s slightly different than what we saw in Phase 1b. But beyond that, we think this could still be very competitive.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. You may ask your question.
Luisa Hector: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Just on Vraylar, could you expand a little on the comments of the channel mix pressure in Q3 and how that will play out as we move forward? And perhaps just a quick comment on the extension of the collaboration with Gedeon Richter and why you went down that route? Thank you.
Scott T. Reents: Luisa, this is Scott. I’ll take the question regarding Vraylar. So, essentially it was a channel mix change. It was slight. I would tell you that really kind of had accumulated over the course of the year. And that’s why we made, we decided it made sense to make the adjustment. So, as that channel mix change, we saw a little bit of negative price as a result of that. So, we took down the regular guidance by $100 million. Now, I would note in neuroscience in totality that was offset by the raise in Botox Therapeutics. So, neuroscience in our therapeutic or growth area guide is stable. So, maybe the second question will go to Roopal.
Roopal Thakkar: Yes. It’s Roopal. We expanded further. We’ve had strong partnership. They’re a terrific organization. We have a follow on to Vraylar that’s more D3 meaning that will start entering the clinic quite soon in Phase II looking at bipolar depression and MDD as well as generalized anxiety disorder. As Rob described as part of our neuroscience strategy, psychiatry is a big part of that and having a deeper relationship with Gedeon Richter will allow us to have potentially even more assets in depression, in bipolar disorder, in schizophrenia and anxiety and potentially other adjacent indications that we continue to be interested in because the unmet need continues to be very high.
Liz Shea: Well, thank you, and thanks, Shirley. That concludes our conference call today. If you’d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. And this concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation. And at this time, you may disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-07-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics. Before we get started, I’ll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today’s conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll take your questions. So, with that, I’ll turn the call over to Rob.
Rob Michael: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It’s a pleasure to speak with you today as AbbVie’s new CEO. I look forward to building on our track record of success and delivering on AbbVie’s promise to our patients, employees, shareholders and communities. As we begin this new chapter, nearly every aspect of AbbVie’s business is performing at or above our expectations. We are demonstrating a rapid return to revenue growth, with operational sales up nearly 4% through the first half of this year, including robust mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. Our ex-Humira growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie’s total sales, will outperform our initial full year sales guidance by more than $1 billion, driven by strong performance in immunology and oncology. In addition, U.S. Humira performance continues to meet our expectations, having achieved or exceeded our guidance in all six quarters with biosimilar competition. The strong performance across our diversified portfolio will drive top-tier high single-digit compound growth through the end of this decade, which will support continued investment to drive growth in the next decade. Turning to our results, I’m especially pleased with immunology, where our leading portfolio is delivering performance well above our expectations. Skyrizi continues to demonstrate strong momentum in psoriasis and Crohn’s disease, where we have substantial headroom for additional share gains and the recent approval in UC will add another source of long-term growth. Rinvoq is also delivering robust growth across all approved indications. We are making excellent progress with late-stage development in five additional indications that we anticipate will launch in the second half of this decade. In oncology, Elahere has accelerated our on-market presence in solid tumors. We also have several exciting pipeline programs, including two novel c-Met ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, as well as 383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma. In neuroscience, our leading therapies for migraine and mood disorders continue to gain share and are competitively well-positioned. The pending acquisition of Cerevel will further augment our neuroscience pipeline and we’re excited about what our two companies can achieve together to make a difference for patients with neuropsych disorders. We have certified substantial compliance to the FTC second request and anticipate the Cerevel transaction will close soon. Lastly, we’ve been very active with business development, investing in exciting opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. Through the first half of this year, we have executed nearly a dozen early-stage deals. These include promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard-of-care in immunology, oncology and neuroscience. In summary, I’m very pleased with the strong momentum of our business. AbbVie’s results once again exceed our expectations and we are raising guidance for the second time this year, underscoring our confidence in the business. The robust performance of our growth platform and the advancement of our pipeline supports AbbVie’s top-tier long-term outlook. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I’ll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7 billion. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $4.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 50% in their fifth full year on the market. These assets are approved across a broad set of indications and are collectively supported by nine compelling head-to-head studies that demonstrate clear differentiation across multiple novel therapies, which has resulted in strong share capture. For Skyrizi, we continue to advance our clear leadership position in psoriasis, where total prescription share of the U.S. biologic market has increased to approximately 38%. Share is also ramping nicely in PSA, especially in the dermatology segment, where Skyrizi has achieved roughly 15% total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market. And for Rinvoq, we are seeing increasing share across each of the rheum indications, as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis, including total prescription share of 10% in the U.S. We are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq are on pace to double their respective sales in IBD this year. The adoption in Crohn’s disease has been impressive, with Skyrizi and Rinvoq now achieving a combined in-place share in the U.S. of more than 40%. Skyrizi has achieved overall in-place share leadership in Crohn’s, with in-place share approximately now 13 points ahead of Stelara, following our compelling head-to-head sequence data published last year. This positive trial, which demonstrated Skyrizi’s high efficacy versus Stelara, including a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission has driven a significant inflection in performance and we anticipate continued share momentum. Commercialization for Skyrizi and ulcerative colitis is now underway in the U.S., with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the next several months. Early feedback from gastroenterologists has been very encouraging, with Skyrizi’s UC data viewed as impressive, particularly for naïve patients who have not been exposed to biologics. We also expect the European launch in the coming months. We also see very robust adoption of Rinvoq in UC, where the brand is now achieving a leading in-place share in the U.S. Internationally, Rinvoq UC is now approved in 75 countries, with reimbursement and share gaining momentum. Having two novel therapies that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy to treat both of these IBD conditions demonstrates our commitment to transforming the treatment landscape for physicians and patients in this area of high unmet need. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $2.8 billion, down 28.9% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. was in line with our expectations in the quarter and our guidance complicates -- contemplates the impact of additional formulary changes over the course of the year. Importantly, we continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.6 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $833 million, down 8.2, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $637 million, up 15.8 on an operational basis, with strong momentum across CLL and AML. Elahere is also performing very well, with sales of $128 million and our compelling overall survival data, recent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines and the expansion of commercial resources will continue to drive rapid uptake. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with the prescription trends for Epkinly in DLBCL. Commercialization is now underway for Epkinly’s second indication, follicular lymphoma, in the U.S., with European approval expected later this year. Neuroscience total revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar, with global sales of $774 million, Ubrelvy with total revenue of $231 million and Qulipta with global sales of $150 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well-positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $814 million, up 9.6% on an operational basis. Finally, we are pleased with the early launch trends for 951 in Japan and Europe, and look forward to bringing this innovative therapy for advanced Parkinson’s to the U.S. soon. Overall, I’m extremely pleased with the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?
Carrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Second quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, representing growth of 2.8% on an operational basis. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $863 million increased by 4.4%, driven by Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm growth of 7.1% and 10.4%, respectively. This toxin and filler performance is supported by a consistent recovery in the facial injectable market, as the number of procedures in both categories increased by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year. However, this level of market growth was lower than previously anticipated. Sales for Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm also benefited from a partial reversal of the prior quarter’s inventory destock, which was related to the timing of certain promotional activities. From a competitive perspective, our U.S. facial injectable portfolio remains the clear market leader, with strong and stable market share. Internationally, second quarter aesthetic sales were $527 million, roughly flat versus the prior year on an operational basis, as declines in China were balanced by growth in other international markets. In China, our largest international market, sales growth continued to be impacted by sustained economic headwinds, as well as a challenging comparison to the second quarter of last year, which benefited from a strong post-COVID recovery. Consistent with what we experienced in the U.S., economic challenges have impacted Juvederm sales growth more than other areas of our portfolio, based upon Juvederm’s relatively higher price point. Looking to the rest of the year, we expect our market-leading aesthetics portfolio to continue to perform well from a competitive perspective across the globe. As we evaluate market dynamics and leading economic indicators, particularly in the U.S. and China, market growth trends are below our prior expectations. Based upon this, we have moderated our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite this near-term dynamic, we remain confident in the long-term growth outlook of our aesthetics portfolio. Global market penetration rates are extremely low and we expect long-term market growth to accelerate from current levels as economic conditions improve. As the market leader, we are also committed to driving growth by activating new patients and launching innovative treatment options. For example, in China, launch activities are underway for the Botox Cosmetic masseter muscle prominence indication. And in the U.S., we will soon launch Juvederm VOLUMA XC for the treatment of temple hollowing and we expect an approval for Botox Cosmetic in the platysma prominence indication by the end of the year. Pipeline catalysts like these in the key U.S. and China markets, along with our significant investment in consumer activation, injector training and practice support, will enable us to grow the aesthetics market and maintain our clear leadership position over the long-term. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Roopal.
Roopal Thakkar: Thank you, Carrie. We continue to make very good progress advancing our pipeline with several regulatory and clinical milestones since our last earnings call. I will start with immunology. We received FDA approval for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which marks its second inflammatory bowel disease indication. Skyrizi is now the only IL-23 specific inhibitor approved for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Skyrizi has proven to be a highly effective, durable, safe and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. And this recent approval further strengthens AbbVie’s leadership position in this market. We also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending Skyrizi for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in Europe, with an approval decision anticipated soon. Earlier this month, we submitted our regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe for Rinvoq and giant cell arteritis. Our submissions are based on the previously announced Phase 3 results from our SELECT-GCA trial, where Rinvoq demonstrated superiority compared to placebo on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52 on disease flare and showed a reduction in total steroid exposure at week 52. We expect approval decisions for this indication next year. We also recently began a Phase 3 study for lutikizumab, our anti-IL-1-alpha-beta-bispecific in hidradenitis suppurativa. HS is a skin disease that can be debilitating and there are limited treatment options. In our Phase 2 study, lutikizumab demonstrated strong clinical response rates and improvement in skin pain in a very refractory patient population. Based on these results, we believe lutikizumab has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe HS. We look forward to providing updates on the Phase 3 program as the data become available. In the second quarter, we announced two additional immunology transactions as we continue to invest in external innovation to expand our pipeline. These include the acquisition of Celsius Therapeutics, which brings a Phase 2 ready anti-TREM1 antibody for IBD and a license agreement with FutureGen to develop a next-generation anti-TL1A antibody for IBD that is designed to have less frequent dosing compared to other TL1As in development and will be evaluated in combination with Skyrizi. This follows the four immunology deals we announced earlier this year, which, as a reminder, included the acquisition of Landos and their oral NLRX1 agonist in Phase 2 for UC, a partnership with OSE to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist for IBD and RA, a collaboration with Parvus to utilize their immune tolerization platform for novel IBD therapies and a collaboration with Tentarix to develop conditionally active multi-specific biologics in immunology and oncology. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make very good progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive topline results from our Phase 2 PICCOLO study evaluating Elahere as a monotherapy in ER alpha positive third-line plus platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer for those not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. Elahere met the primary and key secondary endpoints in the study, demonstrating an objective response rate of 52% and median duration of response of 8.25 month. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Following discussions with the FDA, we will be submitting to Teliso-V for accelerated approval as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild-type non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer. This submission will be reviewed under FDA’s real-time oncology review program. Teliso-V has also received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. Our submission will be based on the results of our Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study, where Teliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints, including overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival, with a tolerable safety profile. Submission is expected in the third quarter, with an approval decision anticipated in 2025. The confirmatory Phase 3 study for this potential accelerated approval is currently ongoing. We continue to see encouraging data for ABBV-400, our next generation c-Met ADC, which uses a topo payload. Recall that we’ve advanced 400 in late-line colorectal cancer based on the deep responses and prolonged durability observed as a monotherapy in our Phase 1 trial. And we remain on track to begin a Phase 3 study later this year in third-line CRC. We’re also seeing encouraging signals of activity for this next-gen ADC in the non-small-cell lung cancer cohort from our Phase 1 study. The preliminary data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. And based on the emerging Phase 1 results, we plan to begin a Phase 2 program for 400 in lung cancer. In the area of hematologic oncology, we received accelerated approval in the U.S. for Epkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of prior therapy. Epkinly is now the only T-cell engaging bispecific approved in the U.S. to treat both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We’re extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients suffering from follicular lymphoma. We also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. In the quarter, we initiated a Phase 3 monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. 383 is designed for high affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T-cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T-cell engaging BCMA-based therapies while preserving high levels of efficacy. We remain excited about this asset’s potential to become a best-in-class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS, with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. In addition to our Phase 3 monotherapy program, we have an ongoing Phase 1 study in later lines of multiple myeloma to evaluate 383 in various combinations, including with Pomalyst, Revlimid and Darzalex. Based on this work, we will begin Phase 2 combination studies in earlier lines of therapy next year. Moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter we announced that we received a complete response letter for our 951 regulatory application in the U.S. The CRL is based on observations identified during an inspection at a third-party manufacturing site that was unrelated to 951. The CRL did not identify any issues related to the safety, efficacy or labeling of 951, nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data or device-related testing. We’re working closely with the site and the FDA to get clarity on timelines and we’ll provide updates as soon as information becomes available. Moving to an update on one of our Alzheimer’s disease programs. We recently completed an interim analysis of a Phase 2 study evaluating ABBV-916, our A-beta antibody. The emerging efficacy and safety profile in this study is similar to what has been demonstrated by approved agents. However, given the evolving landscape, we do not believe 916 as a monotherapy treatment will be sufficiently differentiated from other emerging therapies. As a result, we are discontinuing further development for 916 as a standalone antibody. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction soon and we look forward to welcoming the team into our R&D organization. The emraclidine pivotal studies in schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out near the end of this year. We’ll also see data from two additional Phase 3 studies for davapidon in Parkinson’s disease later this year. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed and data are available. In aesthetics, we recently received approval for Botox in China for masseter muscle prominence, marking the first global approval in this indication for any neurotoxin. Masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. We anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication in China, which will help to further build our portfolio in the face-shaping segment. A regulatory application is under review in the U.S. for Botox and platysma prominence, which is another novel indication that will help build our position in the lower face and neck segment. We continue to expect an FDA approval decision later this year. And we remain on track to submit a regulatory application for BoNT/E near the end of this year. A rapid-onset, short-acting toxin has a highly differentiated clinical profile and once approved would offer patients a novel option compared to currently available toxins. So, in summary, we’ve made great progress across all of our therapeutic areas in the first half of the year and we look forward to additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2024. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Reents: Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our second-quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.52 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $14.5 billion, $450 million ahead of our guidance and reflecting robust growth of 5.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 18% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. Adjusted gross margin was 85.2% of sales. Adjusted R&D expense was 13.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.6% of sales, which includes a 6.5% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $506 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18.8%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 to between $10.71 and $10.91. This EPS guidance continues to contemplate approximately $0.19 of dilution for the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which is expected to close soon. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $55.5 billion, an increase of $500 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions with the entire sales increase, once again, driven by our ex-Humira growth platform, which is now on pace to deliver nearly $6 billion of sales growth in 2024. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $11 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong performance across all approved indications. Rinvoq, total revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting continued robust uptake in IBD. Venclexta total sales of approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting momentum in both U.S. and international markets. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion. Given slower-than-expected near-term market growth, particularly in the U.S. and China, as a result, our total sales guidance for Botox and Juvederm will each be lower by roughly $100 million. Moving to the P&L for 2024, we continue to forecast a full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14% and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5%. We now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales, in line with our previous expectations after including the approximately 2% impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the second quarter. And we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16.3%, also reflecting the impact of IPR&D. Turning to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.92 and $2.96. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance and I’m very pleased with the strong momentum across the portfolio heading into the second half of the year. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We’ll now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Terence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats, Rob, on the CEO position. Looking forward to the forward here. The question I had is, last quarter you guys gave some early commentary on how to think about 2025, looking at the business, obviously, momentum in immunology, some headwinds in aesthetics. So any update on how you’re thinking about the 2025 outlook, particularly, growth for revenue relative to EPS? Thanks.
Scott Reents: Thanks, Terence. This is Scott. I’ll handle the question. So, with respect to 2025, as you know, we haven’t given guidance yet and we’ll provide that at a later time. But we have communicated a few top-level, high-level items to put in context of several dynamics at play next year. We have indicated that we’ll be returning to robust revenue growth, despite the headwinds from Medicare Part D redesign and continued Humira erosion. And when you think about robust growth, we characterize robust growth to be above industry average growth, which we see in the low-single digits. So when you think about the drivers, I mentioned in my remarks that we have $6 billion of growth from the growth platform in 2024 that we’re expecting. $5 billion of that is coming from Skyrizi and Rinvoq alone, our neuros franchise is growing by more than $1 billion and aesthetics has begun to recover from the economic headwinds. In 2025, we see incremental contributions from Skyrizi UC, which was recently approved, as well as 951. All these factors demonstrate strong momentum in the business. And then when you think about the offset of Humira, that erosion that we have expected this year at $4.5 billion. Last year that erosion was $6.5 billion and we do expect another step down in absolute dollar terms in 2025 for that erosion as well. So that will be less of a headwind to growth in 2025 than it was in 2024. So we feel very, very strong about that. And I think from a Part D perspective, we’ve talked about the several points of growth headwinds that we see there. And I think when you model that, you can think about those several points as approximately a 3% headwind to growth. So, overall, very strong momentum from the business with some headwinds, but we feel very confident in our ability to return to robust growth at the topline. Regarding EPS, the bottomline, we see EPS growing in line with that revenue growth that we’ve talked about. So, EPS will benefit from operating margin expansion. We’ve talked about that operating margin expansion will be on the SG&A line as we leverage the revenue growth and drive efficiencies and we have a good history of doing that. So, that operating margin will expand. However, that expansion will be roughly offset by the fact that in 2025, we’ll have a full year of interest expense associated with the financing for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So robust growth at the topline and in-line growth from an EPS perspective.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. Maybe first on Rinvoq and Skyrizi, great results in the quarter. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the price versus volume dynamics this quarter? It seemed like results were maybe a little bit stronger than the RX trends would have implied, and I just was wondering if there was anything notable there. My second question was on the immunology portfolio, and as we think about 2025, I know we’re probably in the middle of contracting season right now, but just directionally, what are you anticipating for Humira, and should we be thinking about any incremental pressures on Rinvoq and Skyrizi just given biosimilar Humira dynamics going forward? Thanks.
Jeff Stewart: Yeah. Hi, Chris. It’s Jeff. I’ll take that question. So, as noted, we’re very, very pleased with the fundamental momentum on Rinvoq and Skyrizi. So all of the indications are really hitting their stride. So we can see the impact of, obviously, consumer investments we’ve made. We’ve adjusted some of the sales forces. We’ve started to anticipate the ulcerative colitis that’s helped us basically increase our share of voice. And I think the other dynamic in terms of some of the incremental strength has come from this dynamic that we started to see earlier in the quarter where some of the Humira switching that takes place actually starts to accrue towards Skyrizi and Rinvoq because the physicians, when there’s this disruption in the market, will sometimes bring in those patients and start to assess them, and we saw about 20% would move to other mechanisms. So while it’s a component, there are certainly multifactorial approaches why we see this very, very strong volume dynamic and share capture for both of those agents. If I move to the contracting for 2025, obviously, the contract season is in progress and it’s progressing, and the negotiations are well underway. I think it’s important, if you’ll recall, that we already have some multiyear contracts in place that cover 2025, so that’s a positive dynamic. The remaining payer negotiations, as I mentioned, are underway and we anticipate that those will close out during the normal cycle. I would say that, at a macro level, we do expect to maintain parity access next year for Humira for a meaningful portion of lives across all of the channels. Now, that said, our Humira access will certainly be lower than this year as we continue to anticipate and watch certain segments of the market move to adopt biosimilars. And we’ve understood and planned for this, obviously, as we enter that third year of the biosimilars and so we’re well aware of dynamically evaluating how this is going to work out. So, certainly, things are progressing. We already have some in place from those multiyear contracts and we’ll be in a better position to provide some more information, obviously, later in the year as those negotiations or the remaining negotiations fully close out.
Rob Michael: And Chris, this is Rob. Just to reiterate an important point that Jeff made, I mean, one trend that we are watching very closely is the switching from the Humira molecule to new mechanisms. I mean, we are starting to see an inflection that is accruing to new mechanisms like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as Jeff mentioned. And it makes sense, doctors that are reevaluating the patients in their practice are likely looking at more than just the patients that are covered by CVS. What we have factored in is the CVS impact. What we didn’t factor in necessarily is an impact beyond just the CVS-wise. And to the extent that trend continues, it would represent a downside for Humira and an upside for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which is a very good long-term tradeoff for us. That’s an important point. We want to make sure that was captured.
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. And maybe, Chris, one more point that I didn’t address was the Skyrizi and Rinvoq contracting. So we are anticipating very robust and consistent access for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And our former comments around sort of low single-digit price erosion should be quite consistent with what we said before. Obviously, the Medicare Part D is a separate dynamic. So things are stable and we’re anticipating ongoing very strong access for both of those brands.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Carter Gould: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I guess first, just a housekeeping point. I guess, one -- I guess, on the last call, you had talked about earnings growth not being quite at the rate of revenue growth and it sounds like today you see those more in line. Any, I guess, further color on kind of what’s driving that? I would assume it’s sort of the key I&I drivers, but any other color there would be appreciated. And I guess the more pertinent question, maybe on the commentary on Cerevel, should there be any expectation for divestments or other concessions as we contemplate that deal closing? Thank you.
Scott Reents: Yeah. This is Scott. I’ll take the question regarding EPS growth or earnings growth in line with the revenue growth. So when we look at this, as I mentioned, we’re looking at a couple of things. The SG&A that we’re driving some operating margin expansion, we spent a lot of time focusing on that and we do see some efficiencies that we can drive, and we do have the ability to leverage that. So there will be expansion operating margin, which you would expect to then let earnings outpace the revenue growth. However, there is this offset and we had a very successful bond offering when we set the financing in place for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So, but that will be an offset to the operating margin expansion. So you can think of those two as essentially netting one another and then driving that earnings growth in line with the topline.
Rob Michael: Hey, Carter. This is Rob. I’ll take your question on Cerevel. Look, we’ve made very good progress with the FTC and have certified substantial compliance to their second request. No divestments are expected. I would expect the transaction to close soon, potentially as early as next week. We’re obviously very excited about the potential best-in-class therapies in Cerevel’s pipeline, especially emraclidine for schizophrenia, davapidon for early Parkinson’s and their core antagonist for major depression. I mean, these assets clearly will be great additions to our neuroscience franchise.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Vamil Divan. Please go ahead.
Vamil Divan: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe one if I could just, I guess, for Rob, just around sort of your business development priorities now. You obviously did a sort of larger deal last year with Cerevel, ImmunoGen, you’ve done a number of these smaller acquisitions. And I guess I’m trying to get a sense of the kind of balance between investing for the long-term and then sort of balancing the near-term earnings growth outlook. So there’s a lot of focus on that $11 floor for a long time, obviously, with all the IPR&D. You sort of dipped a little bit below that for this year, which makes sense. But I’m just trying to think now that we’re sort of halfway through the year, how are you thinking about sort of where your priorities are and the need to kind of balance the near-term numbers versus investing for the long-term? Thanks.
Rob Michael: Yeah. Vamil, thanks for the question. So, the $11 floor, again, was on an ex-IPR&D basis, where obviously with this guidance, ex-IPR&D, I think, we’re just a little bit over $11.40 and we’re certainly positioned to return to robust growth. I mean, we’re delivering robust revenue growth this quarter. When you look at the outlook for 2025, it’s very strong and so we should be beyond the conversations on the floor at this point. As we think about the tradeoffs for the long-term and the short-term, clearly we have an on-market portfolio today that can drive the growth that we need to deliver on that high single-digit, top-tier outlook in this decade. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on early-stage assets that can drive growth in the next decade, and you’ve seen us execute nearly a dozen deals this year along those lines. These include new mechanisms in immunology that can combine with Skyrizi or Rinvoq or be pursued as model therapies. We’ve also added new platforms, including multi-specifics, that have applicability in immunology and oncology. Our deal targeting in situ CAR-T therapy is another example of a platform investment in oncology. And we added a novel mechanism for psychiatric disorders, given our focus in neuroscience. So we intend to continue adding more depth to our pipeline in our core areas, particularly think about early-stage deals, because what we’re really trying to set up for is that growth in the next decade. We have a clear line of sight to top-tier growth this decade and we want to position the company to deliver strong growth in the next decade as well.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Chris Shibutani: Thank you. Good morning. On the aesthetics business, today has been a day of reporting across the industry. There’s some commentary that aligns with what you said. However, some additional questions I have are on granularity about procedure volumes and pricing. Now, in the first quarter, you talked about promotional activities that you pushed towards a seasonally strong second quarter. One, should we think about the pricing backdrop as being a component of some of the sluggishness as opposed to purely thinking about or primarily thinking about volume of procedures? And if you could sort of respond in the neurotoxin neuromodulator versus the filler segment, that’d be helpful. Thank you.
Carrie Strom: Hi. This is Carrie. I’ll address the questions. So, first let’s talk about the market dynamics for market growth in the U.S. for facial injectables. So, late last year, we started to see a recovery and a return to growth of the toxin market and we’ve seen that market growth recovery continue this year in that mid-single-digit range. And that’s volume, that is traffic into our customers’ offices and that’s really been consistent for the past few quarters. So, the market dynamics for our business are really driven by patient demand and volume. Although, when we think about price, price is a factor that we’ll be looking for the second half of the year, which will give us some favorable pricing dynamics. We did take a price action at the beginning of the year for toxins and then we’ll have some more efficiency when it comes to our strategic shifts in our pricing promotions for the second half of the year. So, one example of that would be promotions we did last year, for example, around competitive launches that we won’t need to do this year based on the success of our competitive strategy last year. So really our performance is driven by market growth and we also had some nice stability in our market share. Anything you’d like to add?
Jeff Stewart: Maybe because it’s worth mentioning, so some of that shift in promotional activity that you mentioned, we did talk about in the first quarter that that was a destocking that occurred of inventory levels. And when Carrie made her remarks and we spoke about it last quarter, we said that would reverse over time. We did see that reversing in the second quarter on a partial basis. And when you think about the reversal of that Q1 destock, you can think about from the U.S. market that really would reduce by 50% or cut in half the growth rates we published for the actual results for both Botox and Juvederm. So we saw that partial reversal of that destocking event and then we will see that continue to unwind throughout the course of the year, especially as we have some of our larger promotional activities and the back half of the year with Botox Day and Juvederm Day, we do see typically an inventory, a stocking uplift from those activities.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the pipeline in IBD space as well. I mean, you have done a bunch of these and then there has been some movement, especially in the oral IBD drugs as well. I mean, given your expertise, I would love to understand, how do you think about a pipeline moving beyond the likes of Skyrizi, IL-17s and all, because these drugs are pretty good. But when you think about an oral, what is the ideal profile of the drug that could be a first-line drug and then when you think about combinations, I mean, what are you exactly looking for? Thank you.
Roopal Thakkar: Hey, Mohit. It’s Roopal. I can talk about that. With respect to orals, we did do this deal with Landos and this is our NX-13asset, which we’ll anticipate a readout end of this year, beginning of next year. Early data point to good outcomes in ulcerative colitis and this asset works through NF-kappa-beta, so you’ll see what we’ve observed in preclinical models is reductions in IL-6, IL-1, TNF, interferon gamma. And it’s potentially a monotherapy and one that wouldn’t have a boxed warning. So far, the safety data has looked good. But there’s also opportunities, we believe, as you mentioned, combinations, that you could still combine with Rinvoq. And as I mentioned the boxed warning and in certain geographies, Rinvoq is utilized post-anti-TNF. Even with a combo there, there’s still opportunity. The second and third line segments in IBD and across immunology continue to grow, and they’re getting larger and larger as patients cycle through biosimilar anti-TNFs. We’ll see them cycle through, for example, in IBD with IL-1223, like Stelara. So in the future, there’s multiple opportunities. And the way we think about these is do we see an asset that is novel and can address mechanisms that haven’t been addressed yet, and can they complement something like Rinvoq? So if you see a little bit less efficacy, that may be okay if it’s complementary. It may not work necessarily as a monotherapy, but we still see opportunities for a combo. And given the other assets that we’ve talked about that could be IV or sub-cue, we still see a lot of opportunity with Skyrizi. In a platform study in IBD we’ll kick off later this year, looking at various combinations, many of the assets that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, including a TL1A, including our own internal alpha-4 beta-7, could be added on to Skyrizi to drive that efficacy even higher because there’s still a bit of a ceiling effect. And I would say the unmet need in IBD in particular continues to be quite high.
Mohit Bansal: Okay. Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.
Chris Raymond: Thanks. Hey. Just another follow-up on Humira. So, Jeff and Rob, just hearing your commentary about how when patients discontinue Humira, a number of them are switching to newer biologics. I think you gave the 20% number going to newer biologics like Skyrizi and then also Rinvoq. But we saw some of this happening in the gastro space with one of the checks we did recently, but I wonder if you could provide maybe a little more color on this phenomenon. Is there a particular therapeutic silo where this is maybe happening more extensively? And can you give us a sense as to how this has been influenced or accelerated by biosimilar availability and just any more color there? Thanks.
Jeff Stewart: Yeah. Thanks for the question. It’s almost like a bimodal phenomenon. So, the 20% I highlighted, so if you just look from our data, when we just look at the CVS template, so we can see the degradation of Humira that goes down pretty steeply because, remember, it’s an exclusion. So, Humira is no longer widely available at all. So, most of it happens within the first two weeks or three weeks. And in that one segment, we see that the biosimilar doesn’t take up all the Humira loss and we can see it moving to other mechanisms, particularly Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So that’s within, let’s say, the acute biosimilar event. Now, to Rob’s point, what he highlighted is, if you take a step back and you look at the macro market, we’ve started to see in the first quarter and second quarter that the overall molecule, so that’s the adalimumab molecule, inclusive of biosimilars, has started to compress faster than it did before there was the availability of this action that was taken by CVS. So, it’s a doubling of effect, acutely in the segment that takes place with the exclusion and then the wider market. Now, we’re watching this pretty carefully because we haven’t -- obviously haven’t seen something like this before in terms of the compression of a molecule. So, that’s basically the dynamics that we’re seeing. And we do think it’s because some physicians or segments of physicians are, they realize that these biosimilars where there’s an acute interruption, they want to check how the patients are doing. And if they’re not fully in remission when they come in for their appointment, let’s say before the switch, sometimes they’re transitioned at the rates that I described. So that’s sort of the prescriber behavior. Now, where is it coming from? Like, well, we actually see that it is accruing across all of the indications, particularly Humira has quite robust, let’s say, base dynamics in the rheumatology indications. But we can see it in rheum. We can see it in derm. Derm to Skyrizi in particular, which is probably not a surprise given the position. I highlighted a 38% share and a 60% in-place share for Skyrizi and derm. And we also do see it to some degree in gastroenterology. So, to Rob’s point, we’re going to continue to monitor that. If the overall molecule would continue to compress, obviously, there would be some mitigation of some of it accruing over to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and so we’ll have to continue to see how these weeks and months play out here over the third quarter.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Gary Nachman from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Gary Nachman: All right. Great. Thanks. Can you talk more about how you’re managing the growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq in IBD across both UC and Crohn’s, which have both been really strong? And with the Skyrizi UC launch, is there any cannibalization there with Rinvoq? And I guess, generally, how do you see those products working synergistically both in terms of sales force and reimbursement, if you see any sort of issues or conflicts there? Thanks.
Jeff Stewart: Yeah. Thank you for the question. A very important question in terms of how we commercialize these. Roopal highlighted it. Obviously, you have the two big indications with two assets within those indications. And so we have constructed, not just in the U.S., but around the world, a very sophisticated approach in terms of multiple sleeves of representatives and medical experts that are representing both drugs across both indications. And it really is, let’s say, for example, in our largest market, the U.S., it’s relatively easy to execute, because what we see is that our representatives can highlight Skyrizi’s data and potential as the obvious frontline agent, which is obviously tremendous data. I mentioned the sequence data. I mentioned our core data. The naive to biologic data in UC is absolutely fantastic for the Skyrizi data. And then, really ironically, because of the label changes that took place a few years ago, Rinvoq is positioned in later lines. So, really, that sort of approach is highly synergistic in terms of we recommend that physicians consider starting with Skyrizi and the efficacy will be fantastic. But to Roopal’s point, there’s still pressure on that disease and then you have a backstop with tremendous, tremendous data on Rinvoq in later lines. And so that’s how we position it. We look and we monitor the cannibalization. It’s quite modest, and overall, when you look at the dynamic of share capture, it’s quite encouraging to see how the infield teams and the commercial teams are managing all of those assets. So, we’re very encouraged about how we’ve approached the market in terms of our execution and I think the results are speaking for themselves.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Gary. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Steve Scala: Thank you. Regarding the 2024 sales guidance, which I realize is about $55 billion, but it implies similar growth in the second half as in the first half, if not a slight deceleration. Why won’t total sales do better and what were your reservations about raising sales guidance today? It seems that across the business, strengths are exceeding challenges, so it would seem not unreasonable to have higher sights now. Second question is, I’m wondering if you can elaborate on the comment, a portion of Humira lives is a portion of Humira lives closest to a quarter, a half or three-quarters of lives. Thank you.
Scott Reents: Steve, this is Scott. I will talk regarding the revenue. So, just to clarify, we did raise the revenue guidance in total from $55 billion to $55.5 billion, a $500 million raise and that included a $300 million raise for Skyrizi, a $100 million raise for Rinvoq, a $100 million raise for Venclexta, a $200 million spread across other products and then a $200 million reduction in the guidance for aesthetics. So, we do see very strong momentum in the business and we did raise our sales guidance from $55 billion to $55.5 billion.
Rob Michael: And Steve, this is Rob. If you just look at, as I mentioned in my remarks, the first half of the year, we talked operational growth around 4%. If you -- the implied operational growth in the second half, based on our guidance, would be slightly above that and really driven by the ex-Humira growth platform, which on a reported basis, grew more than 18% this quarter. And so we’re very pleased with the performance of the business, and I think, when you look at the guidance and you do the math, you’ll see that the actual implied second half operational growth is slightly higher than the first half.
Jeff Stewart: And Steve and Jeff, so to give some sense, so we’re looking at coming up on the third year of biosimilar. So, the first way to think about it, in the first year 2023, we had very strong parity access across all the channels and we really exited the year around, I think, 97% or something like that. This year, I think, when we look at all the ins and outs, I think, the three-quarter approach is quite reasonable, and as I mentioned in my remarks to early one of the questions, it will certainly be lower next year and I would think that that range would be around that 0.5 point, but again, we’re not fully complete with all the dynamics. So, that gives you some broad spectrum over three years, maybe around the halfway point, plus or minus, as we go into 2025.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Trung Huynh from UBS. Please go ahead.
Trung Huynh: Hi, guys. Trung Huynh from UBS. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. On the aesthetic, thanks for your comments this year and you’ve also moderated your short-term guide accordingly, but you’ve noted that the long-term 2029 guide remains intact. So, with growth around 4% this year in line with that new guide, I imagine next year will be slightly higher, but then it does imply that growth is well into the double digits for 2027, 2028 and 2029 on our calculations. Just what here makes you confident about that level of growth later in the decade? And then secondly, just following up on some of your thoughts on the immunology pipeline, you noted the potential of the utility of multispecifics in immunology. You’ve got a pretty strong bispecific platform. Just what are your thoughts on the data that you’re seeing here? Is there anything in development that we should be looking at? Thank you.
Scott Reents: Trung, this is Scott. I’ll start with your question regarding the long-term guidance on aesthetics. So you’re right. We’ve guided to a long-term $9 billion in 2029 and we’re not changing that guidance. The guidance changed, as you noted, that I mentioned today is just a short-term guidance change for 2024. We remain very confident in our ability to hit that $9 billion in 2029. When you think about these markets, there’s very low penetration in the markets globally. There’s a lot of excitement in the space and we expect the market to recover and grow at historical rates. I would say when we look at the market growth, we do see that rebounding and growing well. And then you also should think about there’s additional innovation coming that will drive that. So, we have some of the additional indications in Botox that Roopal walked through, as well as the quick onset short-acting toxin BoNT/E that will also drive additional market growth. And so we continue to feel very comfortable with our ability to achieve that on a long-term basis in 2029.
Roopal Thakkar: Trung, it’s Roopal. I’ll take the next question on the pipeline. So, we continue to be excited about bispecifics, in particular lutikizumab. And it’s an IL-1 alpha, and importantly, also 1-beta. And this, we believe, distinguishes it from earlier generation assets that were singular, and let’s say, only took out IL-1 alpha. We see, I would say, very, very strong benefits in hidradenitis suppurativa and I don’t think that was observed as a pure monoclonal. And the efficacy that we’re seeing is in a 100% anti-TNF failure population and very sick, early Stage 3, 70%. It is one of the most severe, probably the most severe ever studied. So we think there continues to be potential in the bispecific space as you take out multiple cytokines. The way to address it is through engineering of the assets. The other way is combination, so we can get to that bispecific approach through combos. And then, thirdly, I would say earlier in the pipeline is the multispecific approach, which the advantage that could provide is you maintain your bispecific approach, but then a third arm, let’s say, can target specific cells and that could further enhance efficacy, and in particular, safety. And we’re looking at that approach in immunology and as well in oncology, and that was reflected in our partnership with Tentarix.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Trung. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Evan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question and it was really, really helpful to update today. So, just looking at kind of the expected growth for…
Liz Shea: Can you just -- can you speak up just a little bit? Sorry.
Evan Seigerman: All right. Can you guys hear me all right? Does that work?
Rob Michael: Yeah.
Liz Shea: It’s still faint, but we’ll do our best.
Evan Seigerman: All right. Sorry about that. I’ll speak very loudly. So when looking at expected growth for Vraylar over the next few quarters, can you comment on what type of impact you think new competitors to the MBD market might have and what you can do to help maintain a growth position going forward?
Jeff Stewart: Yeah. Hi. It’s Jeff. We’re very pleased with how both of the indications are performing and we monitor them very carefully, certainly with bipolar and aMDD. So when we look at our quarterly surveys of our target physicians and really our whole call cycle, we can see now that Vraylar is the most preferred agent overall for bipolar disease based on its indication set, its tolerability, its efficacy, et cetera. And we’ve really gone to the very top of the lead table for aMDD as well. So, if we look overall on our demand, we’re tracking above 20% in terms of the push. We continue to focus our team and where necessary add share a voice in terms of our sales force. So, we’re quite comfortable that we can continue to grow our share, which has been growing very, very nicely, particularly on the MBRX side, and certainly, face the competitive dynamics and navigate those as we go forward.
Roopal Thakkar: Jeff, maybe to add. it’s Roopal here. There is going to be competition, but what we see as a benefit clinically for Vraylar is that full spectrum coverage in bipolar and when you’re able to take mania, you don’t need an adjunctive therapy for that. So that’s a big advantage. The other thing that we continue to hear and probably reflected in our data is the really limited impact on fatigue and sedation. And so what we’re hearing is with Vraylar, patients really don’t have to sacrifice their daytime productivity in order to gain that benefit. And then the other benefit, I would say, with Vraylar is flexible, adjustable dosing. So these things together, I think, underlie what Jeff was speaking about.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Evan. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next, we’ll go to the line of James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
James Shin: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. You mentioned some of the Humira contracts going to 2025. Does that also apply to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and that’s what gives you visibility on the low single-digit price erosion? And secondly, has the introduction of co-branded Humira and now that PBMs are more intertwined with biosimilars, changed the negotiation dynamics at all? Thank you.
Rob Michael: Yeah. So, typically, again, in some cases we are able to secure multiyear contracts. And as you can imagine that we would do that for the portfolio, basically, the way that our products work. So, that does help with the visibility in terms of what our access would look like for 2025, as well as the pricing dynamics. Again, I want to clarify that the negotiating season is not fully complete, but the dynamics are progressing, as I highlighted there. So, yes, to your first question. The other dynamic in terms of Cordavis, I’m not sure that that’s actually changing the dynamics in terms of the negotiations overall. That was obviously a volume-related deal with CVS that we announced over a year ago or almost a year ago now. So it doesn’t necessarily play into other negotiations. Each of these payers and pharmacy benefit managers, they have their own ideas in terms of how they want to approach the I&I category and certainly the Humira -- the emergence of the Humira biosimilars. So it’s a CVS-unique dynamic.
Liz Shea: Thanks, James. We have time for one final question, Operator.
Operator: For our last question, we’ll go to the line of Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.
Louise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So I wanted to first ask you, do you still feel that your aesthetics business is a good strategic asset for you, and if so, where do you see the synergies within your organization? And second question I wanted to ask you is, how do you think pharma will fare under a Democratic versus a Republican presidency and how are you going to navigate through that uncertainty in the near term? Thank you.
Rob Michael: So, Louise, this is Rob. I’ll take your question. Look, we like the aesthetics business. When you think about the growth profile, the profitability, we have set it up as a fully integrated standalone unit, because it behaves differently than the therapeutics business. We think we’ve actually seen, since we announced the transaction, really strong performance. We’ve exceeded our deal model expectations since we announced the deal. So we think it’s operating very well. Obviously, we’re working through some macroeconomic headwinds. But when you look at, for example, share performance, we had the entry of DAXXIFY last year and we did not lose any share. I think a lot of investors were concerned that we’d see considerable share loss. And so I think the team has done a remarkable job of competing in this marketplace, going through a period with economic headwinds. We’re still very confident given low penetration rates, given our relationship in the field, the potential innovations that we plan to bring forward. It has a very nice fit. And you think about just from a profitability and a growth standpoint, it fits the profile we’re looking for. So I certainly feel it’s a nice fit for the company. As it relates to the election, look, it’s hard to handicap it, whether Democrat or Republican. If you think about we’ve obviously contemplated the Inflation Reduction Act. We’ve come out and said that even with modeling that impact in, that we still expect to deliver on our long-term outlook. Now, I will say our view on the IRA from a policy perspective is we’re certainly in favor of the Part D benefit redesign because it helps address patient out-of-pocket burn. But the price-setting provisions in the IRA will certainly harm long-term innovation in our industry. So, we are hopeful that if it’s a new administration or the current administration, that they’ll reassess those provisions that ultimately are harmful for long-term patient care in the U.S. I mean, it clearly takes away the incentive to launch in later lines of smaller patient populations, which is really a very unfortunate negative outcome for the legislation. So, the way I view it is addressing patient out-of-pocket burden is good policy, but taking away the incentive for innovation is not, and my hope is under either administration, that will be reconsidered.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Louise. That concludes today’s conference call. If you’d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you all for joining the AbbVie second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today’s conference. Please disconnect at this time and have a wonderful rest of your day.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics; and Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer, Global Therapeutics. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer, Global Research. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2024 with first quarter results exceeding our expectations. Before we discuss our performance in more detail, I'd like to share my perspective on the planned CEO transition that was announced earlier this year. After serving more than 11 years as AbbVie's first CEO, I have decided to retire from the role effective July 1, of this year and will continue to serve AbbVie as Executive Chairman of the Board. As you heard me say before, it is important that we choose the right time to make this critical leadership transition. The Board and I have been long planning for my eventual succession and now is the opportune time to move forward with the transition. As our business is performing very well and is in a strong position for the long-term. We are successfully navigating the Humira U.S. loss of exclusivity. We have built an outstanding company culture, an important priority and competitive advantage. And our productive R&D engine, which has yielded numerous innovative new medicines for patients will continue to fuel our robust pipeline for years to come. After a multi-year process, our board has unanimously selected Rob Michael, our current President and Chief Operating Officer as AbbVie's next CEO. I have known and worked with Rob for many, many years and he is an excellent choice as my successor. He brings the experience, the leadership and the strategic vision to build on AbbVie's past successes, advance our strategy and enhance shareholder value. Since our inception, Rob has held several important leadership positions that have collectively had a tremendous impact on AbbVie from establishing our financial planning organization to navigating the end of exclusivity for Humira in the U.S., to driving key business development opportunities that have been critical to diversify our business and support long-term growth, including the acquisitions of Allergan and ImmunoGen and the pending Cerevel transaction. Looking back, AbbVie has evolved tremendously as an independent company and our performance has truly been exceptional. Since our inception, we've grown our revenue from $18 billion to $55 billion. Our market capitalization has increased substantially from $54 billion to roughly $300 billion today. We have achieved a total shareholder return of more than 675%, which is top tier relative to our peers. And importantly, we’ve substantially increased our investments in R&D to discover and develop new medicines that have the potential to improve the lives of patients. As I look ahead, our company has never been stronger and our future has never been brighter. We are executing well across all aspects of our business and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. In summary, it has been a privilege and immensely gratifying to serve with all of my AbbVie colleagues for the past 11 years, growing AbbVie into what it is today. And I look forward to continuing to work with Rob and the leadership team to create meaningful value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. And I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our shareholders for the trust and confidence you put in me as AbbVie's CEO. With that, I will turn the call over to Rob for comments on our recent business performance. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Rick. Before I comment on our first quarter performance, I want to congratulate Rick on his exceptional leadership of AbbVie over the past 11 years. During his tenure, Rick made several strategic moves that have positioned AbbVie to have a bright future beyond Humira, consistently drove the organization to deliver very strong performance and demonstrated the genuine care for our employees, patients, shareholders and communities that has defined who we are as a company today. It has been my privilege to work closely with Rick over many years, and I look forward to working with him in his role as Executive Chairman. AbbVie's outlook is very strong and I am excited about the remarkable impact that we the remarkable impact that we will continue to have on patients' lives. Turning to first quarter performance, we're off to an excellent start to the year with strong top and bottom-line results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations. This overachievement was driven by our ex-Humira growth platform, which delivered revenue growth of more than 15% this quarter and includes continued robust sales from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, with combined growth above 50% in their fifth full year on the market, as well as double-digit revenue growth from several other key products including Venclexta, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and Qulipta. This broad based sales momentum clearly demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio with multiple growth drivers to support our long-term outlook. We are also making excellent progress with several of our near-term priorities. We recently completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, which accelerates our entry into the solid tumor market and strengthens our oncology pipeline. The integration has been seamless and we are impressed by the caliber of talent we have welcomed into AbbVie. We also remain on track with the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which we anticipate will close in the middle of the year. Cerevel's pipeline of differentiated assets will further augment our neuroscience portfolio. In addition, we continue to advance our R&D pipeline and invest for long-term growth. This progress includes the FDA's full approval of Elahere for FR alpha positive platinum resistant ovarian cancer, a meaningful first in class treatment for patients and a significant long-term growth opportunity for AbbVie in solid tumors. We also gained U.S. approval of Juvederm Voluma XC for temple hollows, further strengthening our leadership in aesthetic fillers, and we executed several business development opportunities adding novel early stage programs and partnerships in oncology and immunology. Given the strong results this quarter, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.16 and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.13 and $11.33. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie and I am extremely pleased with the momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're off to an excellent start to the year and we are well positioned to deliver a high-single-digit revenue CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $5.4 billion exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi global sales were $2 billion reflecting operational growth of 48%. We continue to see exceptional momentum across all of the approved indications. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market with a total prescription share now above 35%. That's more than double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. Share is also ramping nicely in PsA, especially in the dermatology segment, where we are now capturing one out of every four new or switching in play biologic patients. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved psoriatic in play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries. In IBD, Skyrizi is on track to add more than $1 billion of incremental sales growth this year. We are seeing tremendous performance in Crohn's disease, where our compelling head-to-head data versus Stelara is driving a meaningful inflection of patient share. As a result, we have now achieved in play share leadership in Crohn's across all lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Japan as well as other key markets around the world. And finally, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which represents another substantial long-term growth driver. We expect approval decisions in the middle of this year and anticipate rapid access in the U.S. following our launch. Given the robust frontline capture for Skyrizi in Crohn's and the exceptional bio-naive data we have generated in UC, we anticipate a strong launch. Turning now to Rinvoq with global sales of approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of 61.9%. In rheum, we continue to see strong prescription growth across each of the four approved indications, and I'm especially pleased with our performance in rheumatoid arthritis, where Rinvoq has achieved in play share leadership in nearly 20 key international markets. Atopic dermatitis is tracking in line with our expectations with continued market share momentum globally. Importantly, we recently announced positive results from LEVEL UP, our second head-to-head study in AD. LEVEL UP demonstrated Rinvoq superiority for patients starting therapy on the 15 milligram dose versus Dupixent across key efficacy parameters, including the high levels of skin clearance and itch reduction. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will support additional share capture, especially given Rinvoq label use in the U.S., which requires that initiation with a 15 milligram dose. And in IBD, Rinvoq's uptake continues to be very strong. Rinvoq is capturing high teens in play patient share in ulcerative colitis as well as mid-teens in play patient share in Crohn's disease. This performance is especially encouraging recognizing that we're still relatively early in the launch phase for both the UC and CD indications, and the lines of therapy are also expanding, with second line plus growing even faster as patients cycle to newer, higher efficacy agents like Rinvoq and IBD. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of approximately $2.3 billion, down 35.2% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. played out slightly better than our expectations in the quarter with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price. As previously communicated, the recent changes to the CVS template formularies were anticipated in our full year outlook for U.S. Humira and the volume impact is tracking in line with our expectations. Our guidance has also contemplated the impact of additional formulary changes that are expected to go into effect over the course of the year. We continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.5 billion exceeding our expectations. Imbruvica global revenues were $838 million, down 4.5%, reflecting continued competitive pressure in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $614 million, up 16.3% on an operational basis and we are seeing robust momentum internationally with strong performance for both CLL and AML. Elahere generated $64 million of sales to AbbVie, reflecting a partial quarter of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. The Elahere sales and marketing team is executing very well and I'm pleased with the smooth integration into our commercial organization. We anticipate that the recent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines for both platinum sensitive and platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients as well as the full label approval, which of course, includes the compelling overall survival data that has never been achieved before in these platinum resistant patients will continue to drive strong Elahere uptake. Lastly, the global launch of Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL is also performing well and we remain on track for the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Neuroscience total revenues were nearly $2 billion, up 16% on an operational basis, again, ahead of our expectations. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar with global sales of $694 million, Ubrelvy with total revenue of $203 million and Qulipta with global sales of $131 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $748 million, up 4.5% on an operational basis. And finally, we are very excited about 951, which will be commercialized as Vyalev in the U.S. and represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. Feedback from the launches in Japan and Europe have been very encouraging and we remain on track for commercial approval in the U.S. later this year. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?
Carrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. First quarter global aesthetic sales were over $1.2 billion, reflecting a modest decline on an operational basis. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $776 million were roughly flat versus the prior year. We continue to see sustained momentum in the facial injectable market recovery that emerged in the back half of last year. Consistent with the past few quarters, the toxin market grew by a mid-single-digit percentage. We saw similar year-over-year increases in the number of facial filler procedures, representing a return to quarterly market growth for the first time since early 2022. From a competitive perspective, our U.S. aesthetics portfolio continues to perform well. Market share for both Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm was stable in the first quarter as these assets remain the clear market leaders. While we're pleased that the market and share trends across U.S. facial injectables are aligned with our previous expectations, our first quarter results were impacted by customers holding lower than normal inventory levels at quarter end. This dynamic relates to a decision made during the quarter to shift the timing of certain promotional activities into the second quarter. We therefore expect inventory levels to normalize in the second quarter and remain on track to deliver full year aesthetics sales growth in the U.S. Internationally, first quarter aesthetic sales were $473 million reflecting an operational decline of 5.5%. Consistent with our expectations, growth in China was impacted by persistent economic headwinds as well as a challenging comparison versus the first quarter of last year, which benefited from a robust recovery post-COVID. We are monitoring the economic developments across China and continue to anticipate a recovery in the second half of this year. Our pipeline continues to generate important new assets. Uptake of our recently launched Volux and SkinVive products remain strong, underscoring the importance of innovation within aesthetics. Given this context, we are excited for the upcoming launch of Juvederm Voluma XC for the treatment of temple hollows. As the only dermal filler approved for use in the upper face, we anticipate the Voluma XC introduction will activate more consumers and support the long-term growth of our filler portfolio. And within our toxin pipeline, we continue to expect FDA approval of the platysma prominence indication for Botox near the end of this year, enhancing Botox growth potential as a noninvasive treatment to reduce the appearance of vertical neck bands and improve jawline definition. We also remain on track to submit a new drug application for our short acting toxin, BoNT/E, before the end of this year. This novel toxin has demonstrated a rapid onset of action as well as a short duration of effect, meaningfully lowering the barrier for toxin adoption across consumers who have been considering but hesitant to try Botox. Given this profile, BoNT/E has significant market expansion potential as satisfied patients would naturally convert to Botox. Overall, the underlying trends across our aesthetics portfolio align well with our previous expectations and we remain on track to deliver high-single-digit global aesthetics growth this year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.
Roopal Thakkar: Thank you, Carrie. I'll start with immunology. We recently announced positive top-line results from 2 Phase III studies for Rinvoq in dermatology and rheumatology. In the LEVEL UP study, which evaluated Rinvoq against dupilumab in atopic dermatitis, Rinvoq demonstrated superiority on the primary endpoint at week 16, which was a composite endpoint measuring skin clearance and itch reduction. Twice as many Rinvoq patients achieved this very stringent endpoint compared to dupilumab. Rinvoq also demonstrated superiority on all rank secondary endpoints in this trial. LEVEL UP was a study in which patients started on Rinvoq 15 milligrams and could escalate to 30 milligrams if they did not achieve treatment goals, which is how Rinvoq is prescribed for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. We also saw very rapid responses with Rinvoq demonstrating superiority on itch as early as week two and on skin lesions as early as week four. Rinvoq's safety profile in the LEVEL UP trial was consistent with what has been observed in previous studies. There were no serious infections in patients treated with Rinvoq and one in the dupilumab group. The rate of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms. There were no malignancies, MACE events or VTEs reported in either treatment group. Based on these data as well as results from previous Phase III studies, we remain very confident in Rinvoq's profile in atopic dermatitis, and we believe it offers meaningful advantages over other products on the market today. We also announced positive top-line results from our Phase III select giant cell arthritis trial, which evaluated Rinvoq in combination with a 26-week steroid taper regimen compared to patients receiving placebo in combination with a 52-week steroid taper. In the study, Rinvoq 15 milligrams met the primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating superiority on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52, as well as on disease flare and reduction in cumulative steroid exposure at week 52. Importantly, Rinvoq's safety profile was consistent with what has been observed in more than 15,000 patients previously studied across controlled trials. The mean age in this population was 71, which is the oldest population studied to date with Rinvoq. And the average prednisone equivalent dose at baseline was almost 35 milligram. Rates of serious adverse events and VTEs were similar across treatment groups. There were no MACE events in the Rinvoq arm, while there were two in the placebo group. Based on the results from the select GCA trial, we believe Rinvoq has the potential to be a safe and tolerable oral treatment option. We plan to submit our regulatory applications for this indication later this year. We continue to make very good progress with our inflammatory bowel disease programs. We anticipate several advancements this year, including the initiation of a Phase II study for lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis. The start of our Phase II Crohn's disease platform study, which will evaluate combinations of Skyrizi with lutikizumab and other novel biologics. And we remain on track for approval decisions for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, with the U.S. expected in the second quarter and Europe in the second half of the year. We also continue to invest in external innovation to expand our immunology pipeline, as evidenced by four deals that we announced in the first quarter. These include the acquisition of Landos Biopharma, which brings an oral NLRX1 agonist currently in Phase II for ulcerative colitis, a partnership with OSE immunotherapeutics to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist antibody for inflammatory conditions, such as IBD and RA. A collaboration with Parvus Therapeutics to utilize their immune tolerization platform to develop novel therapies for IBD, and a collaboration with Tentarix Biotherapeutics to develop conditionally active, multi-specific biologics in immunology and oncology. We are excited to partner with these companies who are all pursuing very innovative approaches to developing transformative therapies. Moving to oncology, where in the quarter, we closed the ImmunoGen transaction, which brings exciting programs in both solid and blood cancers. Last month, Elahere received full approval from the FDA for FR alpha positive platinum resistant ovarian cancer in patients treated with up to three prior therapies. This conversion to full approval was based on data from the confirmatory Phase III MIRASOL trial, where Elahere demonstrated an overall survival benefit and significantly reduced the risk of cancer progression. We expect to see results from additional ImmunoGen programs this year, including data from the Phase II PICCOLO study evaluating Elahere as a monotherapy in FR alpha positive third line plus platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients who are not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. And we expect to see data in the second half of the year from a potentially registration-enabling Phase II trial for our CD123 targeting ADC, Pivek in a rare blood cancer called blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Now moving to program updates in hematologic oncology. Based on the totality of the data from our TRANSFORM-1 trial and following recent feedback from regulators, we will not be submitting navitoclax for approval in myelofibrosis, and we will wind down the TRANSFORM-2 study, in the relapsed refractory setting. In other areas of [EMAC], we remain on track for several regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for a Epinkly in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma. The Phase III readout from the Venclexta VERONA trial, in treatment-naive, higher-risk MDS and initiation of a Phase III monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. We remain very excited about this asset's potential to become a best-in-class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS and with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. Moving to other areas of our pipeline. In aesthetics, we remain on track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E in the second half of the year. Our rapid onset short-acting toxin as a highly differentiated clinical profile compared to currently available neurotoxins. BoNT/E is designed for patients that are considering using facial toxins for the first time or for a special event and will allow them to experience results over a very short period of time. This novel toxin will complement our existing business as patients would naturally transition to BOTOX following experience with this trial toxin. And in neuroscience, we continue to make good progress with 951, where we have received regulatory approvals in 33 countries thus far and anticipate an approval decision in the U.S. in the second quarter. As Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction in the middle of this year. Cerevel recently announced positive top line results from their Phase III TEMPO-3 trial evaluating Tavapadon as adjunctive therapy to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. In study, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a 1.1 hour increase in total on time without troublesome dyskinesia compared to patients treated with levodopa and placebo. Tavapadon also met the key secondary endpoint in the trial, providing a significant reduction in off time compared to levodopa and placebo. Two additional Phase III studies for Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease are expected to read out later this year. The emracladine pivotal studies in schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out later this year as well. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Reents : Thank you, Roopal. Starting with our first quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance and reflecting a return to growth of 1.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.9% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 15% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.2% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.9%, adjusted R&D expense of 14.7%, acquired IP R&D expense of 1.3% and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.6%. Adjusted net interest expense was $429 million. The adjusted tax rate was 14.8%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $11.13 and $11.33. This increase of $0.16 at the midpoint includes $0.26 of operating overperformance partially offset by $0.10 of higher dilution due to the earlier close of ImmunoGen. As previously communicated, this earnings per share guidance includes $0.42 of dilution related to the recently closed acquisition of ImmunoGen and the pending acquisition of Cerevel. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $55 billion, an increase of $800 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions with the entire sales increase driven by our ex-Humira growth platform. We now expect Skyrizi global revenue of $10.7 billion, an increase of $200 million due to strong momentum across all approved indications. Rinvoq total sales of $5.6 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting robust uptake in IBD. Imbruvica total revenue of $3.1 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting lower erosion and Elahere total sales to AbbVie of $450 million, an increase of roughly $200 million, reflecting a partial year of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. Moving to the P&L for 2024. We continue to forecast adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5%. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.2 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Caravel transactions. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 32%, reflecting a step-up in volume erosion and with the recent CVS formulary change, partially offset by a onetime price benefit also associated with that change. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 49.5% of sales, and we are also modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, I'm very pleased with the excellent start to the year. We are demonstrating strong momentum across the portfolio and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.
Operator: First question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.
Mohit Bansal : Congrats on the progress and congrats Rob as well. So maybe let's just start with 2024. I mean so thanks for this guidance. But when we look from 2024 to '25, there are a couple of headwinds that you have highlighted in the past. So obviously, IRA Part D redesign will be there and Humira may have another leg down. And given the volume erosion here, people are a little bit concerned there. Can you help us understand that what is your current thinking on the trough, '24 versus '25? And could you give us some confidence that you can continue to grow in '25 despite these headwinds from IRA and Humira?
Robert Michael : This is Rob. I'll take that question. So if you think about ’24, ‘25. I mean, clearly, the ex-Humira growth platform is demonstrating great momentum. If you just think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq alone are growing by more than $4 billion per year. Aesthetics will recover to high single-digit growth. Our neuroscience franchise will grow by over $1 billion this year on the heels of strong momentum for Vraylar and our migraine portfolio and we will have incremental contributions from Vyalev and Elahere in '25. So we have several drivers that will offset Humira erosion next year as well as the Part D benefit redesign impact and allow us to still deliver robust revenue growth. When you think about that redesign impact, it will really spread across our business, most concentrated in immunology and oncology. And we would estimate that total revenue impact could be worth several points of growth, while we'll still deliver robust revenue growth, we will have that headwind in '25. But keep in mind, for us, the IRA impact really hits us in '25 and isn't a significant headwind in the years that follow as products that are subject to negotiation will not have that Part D cost share impact. So the way to think about it is despite that headwind in '25, we will still deliver robust growth, with that growth rate accelerating in the years that follow. And then if you think about on a margin perspective, we're going to continue to expand operating margins. So that will be a tailwind. You should be, though modeling annualization of interest expense from these transactions. And keep in mind that we essentially would have -- think of it as a roughly half year for Cereval and 10.5 months this year for ImmunoGen. So that should be something that you do model for '25. So we'll have robust revenue growth we'll have earnings growth, not quite at the rate of the revenue growth because of that annualization impact. But then when you get to ‘26 and beyond, you have even faster revenue growth and very robust earnings growth. So that's probably the best way to think about the profile of the company. But when you look at that ex-Humira growth platform, there's a lot of momentum there and we are very well positioned to deliver very robust growth.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: The next question is from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim.
Vamil Divan : So maybe I could just ask a couple on the aesthetics side. It sounds like your commentary is pretty generally in line with Liz said before, but obviously, the number was a little lighter this quarter than even to your guidance that what people are expecting so. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about that you mentioned some shift in promotional efforts to the second quarter and maybe inventory levels then as a result being lower and maybe I don't know if you can quantify that a little bit? And was this sort of planned when you gave your guidance back in February or is this something that's sort of evolved over the quarter? Maybe just kind of why the decision maybe would be helpful to give us some comfort on the outlook there?
Carrie Strom : This is Carrie. So first, I'll give a little bit of context to the fundamentals in terms of market growth and market share, which were in line with our expectations. So our market share continues to be strong and stable. For Botox Cosmetic, despite a new competitor, strong stable share at high levels. And then for our Juvederm line continued share strength, even some share pickup in in the past few quarters, as we launch our new products. So like you said, those fundamentals are in line with our expectations. As we were going through the quarter, we really realized that the aesthetics market is quite sensitive to seasonality with Q2 and Q4 typically having the highest volume. And after a few years of COVID and economic disruption, we're now anticipating a return to that typical seasonality. So we shifted investment in some of our sales and marketing efforts into Q2, which impacted customer and sales promotional timing and activities, which then resulted in lower inventory held by our customers in Q1. And we do expect that to come back in Q2 and the rest year. And I'll let Scott address the rest of that question.
Scott Reents : Sure. Thanks, Carrie. So Vamil to quantify the inventory impact in the first quarter, it was a little bit more than $50 million between Juvederm and Botox and you can think of that as being split roughly 2/3 to about and 1/3 to Juvederm. And I think as Carrie mentioned in her remarks that impact of that inventory will -- we expect that to turn in the second quarter.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.
Chris Shibutani : When we think about the 2024 upcoming contracting season, which obviously has been quite dynamic for Humira over the past year plus. Can you provide us with any insights in terms of structural aspects within your contracts that you build in that may help provide offsets. We often have limited visibility. We're looking at the prescription volume trends. And it feels as if our calculus is sometimes incomplete. But what can you reassure us in terms of the dynamics as we're seeing this year two play out and how you're approaching contracting for the forward?
Jeff Stewart : Chris, it's Jeff. So the contracting season typically starts April or May. And frankly, as we've highlighted before can run in the immunology category really through the end of the year. So we have a few philosophies that we look towards, which are -- we want to continue to basically make sure that patients if possible, based on our pricing concessions aren't disrupted because when you start to disrupt patients, they do struggle with the change. It's a change in their treatment course. And so as we look to that, we've historically highlighted that we are negotiating for parity contracts with Humira. And we do put some controls in place in some cases, but not all, we seek multi-year contracts with our payers to try to establish the relationship, the pricing, et cetera and we will think of ways to make sure that those contracts can hold. So they have some teeth in them. They can't just be willy-nilly discarded. And so it is a long-term, in some cases, partnership over a couple of years with these payers. I can't go into the details over exactly how those controls work. But suffice it to say that there's terms and timing and limits in terms of when contracts can be changed even maybe some clawbacks in some cases. So because we want these more sustained relationships because of our position in the category with these great brands, we typically use those sort of techniques and that's how we go for it. So again, it's hard to look forward too much because it is dynamic as we look to '25. But we've been quite successful in maintaining good access for our brands and certainly, Humira is tracking in line with our expectations.
Liz Shea : Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Chris Schott : Just a couple more on the Humira front. I think Humira you had mentioned that in 2024, you expected most of the impact would be price versus volume. I think the street has been concerned that we're seeing more volume erosion, particularly with the CVS book of business. I'm just interested in your latest thinking as we think about price versus volume for the remainder of this year as we consider CVS [Signa], et cetera. How should we think about that balance just so there's kind of surprises, I guess we watch these volume trends playing out? And then maybe just on a related topic, can you talk at all about the tail for Humira sales in the U.S.? I guess the part of the question, do you expect that you'll see most players or payers eventually switch out Humira like we're seeing at CVS? And if so, is it still reasonable to think about there being a kind of a decent tale of revenue, I guess, for this product in the U.S. over time?
Jeff Ryan : There's a lot in there. Let me go through it in a systematic fashion. So I think, first, to directly answer your question. We still as we look forward, believe that the significant majority of our lives will be at parity. So that means our guidance around the majority being price is still holding in our go-forward look. Let me give you some perspective. I had some in my opening remarks over what's happening with CVS. So the first is that, as I mentioned, the step down in volume was really anticipated and based on our analysis of the data, which I'll highlight, it's really right in line with our expectations. Now one of the things in my remarks, I often talk about new to brand or our in-play share capture, and that's a really good way to look at performance, particularly early in launch cycles when you're looking at capture rate or competitive dynamics. I think it's important that investors and analysts need to be very mindful when you have a dislocation or disruption or switching, you can get very, very full at looking at NRx or NBRx because it sort of overinflates what you might be looking at. So I think that's important. The other fact base that we look at is in terms of the step down is we look at other analogs and we look at the Cosentyx Taltz analog or Taltz was advantage in ESI for Cosentyx back in 2019. And we see that typically in this category, almost 90% of the erosion tracks within the first two to three weeks. And that's actually what we're starting to see, we believe with the CVS template following that similar pattern. So if you can't really look at NRx or NBRx, you really have to look at TRx in this case, Chris. And this is very interesting. And we would make sure to guide folks to look at what's happening with the TRx data in the market. And what we see is that not all of the Humira prescriptions are moving to a biosimilar. And if you look at the first two weeks, it's pretty meaningful. Over 20% of the Humira prescriptions are moving to other mechanisms of actions, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And in fact, while we haven't studied this week as much, it actually seems to have accelerated a bit from there. And that actually makes some sense because if you think it from the physician's perspective, when patients are being switched, they often take a break in a pause to say, are these patients really under control, should I consider an alternative. And that's actually what we see playing out in the market. So the pure degradation or step-down from Humira is in line with what we see, but we are seeing a fairly significant move to other mechanisms, as I mentioned, including our own Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And that could be very, very good for patients who are probably getting better care for control of their disease. Now having said that as well, if we look through the rest of '24, we have very solid contracts with our payers through 2024. And remember that these payers can add biosimilars at parity whenever they choose. We saw that last year in the middle of the year, and that's really not different now. So when we look at the structure and controls of our existing agreements, we do not see widespread exclusions for the rest of the year, as we go forward. And so I think we've been pretty consistent with that that select clients will move towards biosimilars over the course of the year. Last year, we saw that with Kaiser and Medicaid plans. We talked about the CVS exclusion for the template business. And we do see that some select plans may take another approach, which we've contemplated as the year goes on, which is they may move new patients to the biosimilar, but maintain the large existing base. And that's quite manageable because really only about 14% or 15% of the patients are new patients that cycle into Humira. So overall, that's our perspective. We're confident things are tracking in line. We're quite interested in this shift to other mechanisms, which is frankly somewhat anticipated, but maybe operating a little higher than we thought, and we still believe that a significant majority of Humira will see it at parity lives in '24. Okay. So the tail we're going to be negotiating '25. And what we've highlighted is we are going to watch exactly how the interchangeables play out. We think we've got a good understanding of that. And so it will probably become more apparent as we move through '25 where that tail may sit. And we've highlighted that it may start to emerge in '25 and probably be much more visible by '26. And that's going to ultimately depend on how over the course of '25, the price volume fully plays out in the marketplace.
Robert Michael : And Chris, this is Rob. On your question regarding the guidance for this year. I think it's important to note yes, we've said that the vast majority of the erosion is price. We've talked about that dynamic. If you think about first half, second half, we have the annualization impact given the mid-year step-up in rebates last year. So the annualization impact comes through in the first half, you'd expect price erosion to be greater in the first half or the second half. But at the same time, we did contemplate volume erosion because we were very well aware of the CVS contract. We gave you that guidance. And so we have contemplated that volume erosion, but that's more of a second half versus first half as well as the potential for we knew with an interchangeable coming in, there could be some marginal amount of volume pickup there. So we did put in volume erosion in our guidance, but the vast majority of it is price, but I don't want investors to think that we didn't put any volume into our guidance. We were very well aware of the CVS contract. And I think we made some prudent assumptions on potentially other impacts. But overall, we're still tracking in line with that guidance.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.
Terence Flynn : Congrats to Rick and best of luck to Rob in a new role. Just wondering if you could maybe frame a little bit for us the opportunity for Skyrizi in UC versus Crohn's disease. I think last time we heard from J&J, Crohn's represented about $7 billion of Stelara sales. Obviously, you guys have made decent inroads there based on your comments. But just wondering think about the dollar opportunity in ulcerative colitis. And then when you were talking through some of the latest Rinvoq data, I was just wondering if there's an opportunity down the road as you generate more clinical data, but also commercial data to potentially revisit the restrictions on line of therapy on the label at some point, or if we shouldn't think about that as a possibility.
Jeff Stewart : It's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So Crohn's is larger than you see. I mean, if you look at the overall market or revenue, I think it's 65%, 70%. So it's -- Crohn's is very, very significant. Having said that, ulcerative colitis is a multibillion-dollar opportunity for us. It's still a very, very underpenetrated and substantial indication. So it's weighted about 65 -- 35 --70-30, but still, I wouldn't underestimate what ulcerative colitis means. And I think I would add in concert with my prepared remarks, we've seen very, very significant acceleration into frontline Crohn's disease with Skyrizi. And what's remarkable, we studied a very, very difficult population in ulcerative colitis, but we still had substantial amount of naive patients. And the performance in that naive population is exceptional. I mean, it is at the very, very top of the league table terms of overall ability to get to endoscopic clearance and symptom control. And so we like that setup because, obviously, we have exactly the same representatives who are establishing the Crohn's indication in frontline, and we know that we can bring UC very fast afterwards when we get the approval this year. So it's a substantial global opportunity, not the size that we'll see over the LRP with Crohn's, but still one of our largest opportunities that we have in the category. And I'll ask Roopal based on the safety data he highlighted to comment on the second question.
Roopal Thakkar : Yes, thank you. So the data we keep generating continues to at least drive confidence for sure that the original Phase III that came out with their safety profile, and what we continue to learn even with longer-term data, even in more high-risk patients confirms what we've always seen. And that will continue to drive confidence, I think with our clinicians. Now from a health authority standpoint, I think the position there is that you have this oral surveillance study with upadacitinib, and they're going to apply those findings to the other assets in a similar class probably until there's another outcome study to sort of argue against that -- that's kind of how we see it, now that's in the U.S. I would say globally, there's still an opportunity for many jurisdictions where JAK inhibitors can be at parity. So you might start seeing some more movement there in earlier lines. But as Jeff stated in his prepared remarks, the second line and even third line of many of these indications continues to grow as people now have options where in the past, if all you had was a TNF, maybe you were cycling. But now that you know that there's other therapies you're starting to see people break sooner. So I think that second and third line is still a huge opportunity, and we'll continue to grow with this emerging data.
Jeff Stewart : And Terence, it's Jeff again. One more comment. I mentioned how we're excited about the naive position for both Skyrizi, CD and UC coming. But what's also nice is those same representatives are in the office and are able to highlight basically a one-two punch, where you use Skyrizi first in earlier lines based on this exquisite data. And then obviously, for later lines, you can use Rinvoq. And so we actually see in the marketplace that, that combination and that positioning is allowing us right now in real time, capturing almost towards 40% of all in-play share with Skyrizi first and Rinvoq second. So it's an encouraging position as we fill out that portfolio.
Liz Shea : Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.
Carter Gould : I wanted to circle back on the prior commentary around some of the TRx data. And I guess the overarching question is that, I guess, appropriately kind of capturing all the volume you're really seeing? And there's clearly with your part of your agreement with CVS and the Cordavis there, there is the potential for some Humira volume to potentially be shifting there. Is that being captured by TRx. So I guess, any commentary there on sort of the accuracy of that data that we're all seeing. And then maybe if you just go back and I wanted to circle back on the EPS commentary on '25 sort of the way you framed that growth. Is that sort of x-IPR&D? Any color there would be appreciated.
Jeff Stewart : Yes, it's a great question. So it's early, but we believe the data is accurate. I mean, if you look at the first two weeks to give you some sense, and this is inclusive of the Cordavis Humira. There was a downdraft of about 13,000 prescriptions for Humira from baseline. And the biosimilars captured about -- which was primarily the Cordavis Humira, captured about 10. So there's 3,000 prescriptions or over 20% that we can see in our data moving to other mechanisms of action, including our Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And again, it's very logical because this is just not a one-to-one type of switch like these physicians are interviewing and discussing with patients, their care path forward. And so we think that clearly, some are moving to other mechanisms, and we've seen that in other analogs as well. So we believe the data is accurate. Again, it's early. We're going to continue to monitor it. Where that ultimately lands, we'll have to see. Again, I want to reiterate the pure Humira downdraft is within line with what we assumed and we are seeing this other market behavior that's taking place.
Robert Michael : And Carter, this is Rob. Just to clarify my earlier comments. Yes, it is ex-IP R&D. We always guide to ex-IP R&D. What I was trying to highlight is you should expect robust revenue growth in '25 and that growth accelerating in 2016 and beyond given that Part D benefit redesign impact in '25. And given that operating margin will expand, you typically would expect our earnings to grow faster than our revenue. And that is generally true with 1 exception in '25 being that we will have an annualization impact from net interest expense. We'll still deliver a very solid earnings growth. But as you model it, just keep in mind that while you expect typically earnings to outpace revenue growth given expanding operating margin, you do have that dynamic in '25, that's important for your modeling.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simon Baker with Redburn Atlantic.
Simon Baker : Two quick ones, if I may. Just going back to Humira, but in a slightly broader sense. There's been a degree of political noise around the role of PBMs in blocking or rather than assisting biosimilar uptake. I just wondered if you expect that to come to anything in terms of structural changes within the market? And then secondly, on Rinvoq and the Level Up deal -- Level Up data. I wonder how you see the competitive dynamics evolving in that space? Is this about switches? Or is this about market expectation expansion. I asked because this morning Sanofi said that they welcome competition as a way of expanding the number of people treated in an area that's still relatively unpenetrated. So I just wonder how you see the opportunity commercially?
Jeff Stewart : It's Jeff again. I would say that we're not anticipating like a wholesale restructure of the PBM industry, for example. I mean, we certainly think that there's very reasonable chance of sort of transparency reform, exactly how some of the economics are working, maybe transparencies to the government or downstream to the clients, that's very possible. But a major wholesale change, we don't see that happening in the near-term. Obviously, we are continuing to monitor that and would make adjustments as we might need to. Regarding your atopic dermatitis question, I think the answer is really a bit of both. I think as we've highlighted before, the market here is exceptional in terms of the low bio penetration or oral and bio penetration. It's really only about 4% or 5%. And so I think Sanofi's comments are very well timed. I mean this marketplace is going to grow significantly as this innovation is able to be delivered to the global population with this very serious disease. But we also think this Level Up study is good for our market share penetration, and I'll give you some perspective. Our U.S. market share is lower. It's around 9%. So typically, where our countries have been able to highlight more direct comparisons. We couldn't do that because of the starting dose, I highlighted. We see that most of our international affiliates have market shares in the mid-teens in some cases in the low 20s. And so the ability to bring a comparative study that's directly linked to the U.S. label and show the physicians how you can get to higher levels of control and really patients want -- they want no disease on their skin and they really don't want itch if they can get there. And that's what we studied in Level Up. So we think it's certainly going to help with both market expansion and in particular, around the world with our ability to capture some more share. So I hope that helps.
Liz Shea : Thanks, Simon. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson : I have questions on contracting for Skyrizi in '25. How many lives do you already have locked up through your general multi-year contracting? And then do you continue to think that the availability of cheap versions of Humira, either brand or biosimilar won't lead to any increase in step edits on Skyrizi under the idea that while Skyrizi is better, something like Humira or biosimilar Stelara might be just fine. That same arrangement can be made in the statin category, for example, Crestor is the best Zocor might do just fine.
Jeff Stewart : Yes. I think we'll probably pass on the number of lives locked up. I mean we are confident, given the market position TAM of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I think, in particular around the momentum that we have across the Skyrizi indication that we're going to have very favorable access in 2025 and beyond. I think the other thing that we've highlighted is I'm very pleased with how the adoption of Skyrizi is going in IBD. I mean it's very, very clear that we're taking significant share from Stelara and the doctors are voting with their pen, or they're basically electronic prescribing because the ability to get these very sensitive patients under significant control, the world's really never seen anything like the sequence trial in terms of the ability to control the most difficult aspect of this challenging disease. So as time goes by, we think that differentiation is going to aid us significantly as we think about the formulary positions relative to not only Humira, but also to Stelara.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg.
Luisa Hector : It's on Elahere. I wonder whether you might be able to tell us the full quarter of sales. And then any commentary around penetration rate of Elahere and how much off-label use you think may be happening with the guideline inclusion?
Scott Reents : Sure. It's Scott. With respect to the Elahere full quarter of sales, we closed mid-year in February. Prior to that there were -- according to what we've seen approximately, just let me just double check here, $70 million -- I'm sorry, $110 million in the full quarter, $113 million in the full quarter.
Jeff Stewart : And it's Jeff. What we also see in the marketplace, a big catalyst that we saw in the first quarter was the movement from the accelerated approval to the full approval that Roopal highlighted with the MIRASOL data. So we were rapidly able to basically integrate that into all the material of the medical liaisons and certainly account managers and sales folks. And having that definitive table in the label and the ability to go deeper into our call plan is going to be very positive to continue the growth rates through the rest of the year. In terms of off-label, that's difficult to say. We think that the majority of the sales thus far are in that platinum-resistant population. However, the guidelines do allow for reimbursement with different levels of FRA alpha some of the updates that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So we'll continue to monitor it, but there's certainly a significant headroom in terms of the populations that are coming in terms of the ovarian cancer marketplace.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Luisa. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James.
Gary Nachman : When looking at the strong performance of the neuro franchise of Vraylar and migraine in particular, talk about the competitive dynamics there in those markets. And how did the gross connects impact you in 1Q versus what you expected? And how should that trend for the rest of the year? And then with respect to Cerevel, just your confidence that it will still close by mid-year, and how FTC is viewing the schizophrenia market and how much overlap there might be between emraclidine and Vraylar? Just the latest thinking on that based on your conversations with FTC.
Jeff Stewart : It's Jeff. I'll take the competitiveness comment in terms of what we're looking at. We're very pleased with the competitive -- our ability to gain market share in these segments. I'll start off with migraine. We continue to be the new to brand share leader in Botox for chronic migraine, and we see that Qulipta is accelerating significantly. So Qulipta is now the leading preventative agent. And what's nice is there's very little interaction with Botox because if you're an injector, you use Botox, if you're not an injector, you have access to a fantastic drug with Qulipta. So Qulipta is really clearly taking over the market leadership position among the injectable and the oral CGRPs. Ubrelvy continues to have a very meaningful and substantial lead over the main competitor, Nurtec and we are seeing some increased penetration into the larger triptan segment, which is key to our long-term growth. Vraylar continues to perform very well, ongoing market growth. And it's really because we have -- if we look at our perceptions, Gary, of our key prescribers, you're at the very, very top of the table, the league table in terms of perceptions around the efficacy around adjunctive major depression, which is our most recent indication and we have probably the best scope of indications for bipolar 1. And so both of those are allowing us to continue to gain share. So we're in a pretty good position. We also feel that the gross to net our vouchers, our co-pay, which sometimes can get a little funky in the first quarter. We have strong controls there and we're seeing a lot of stability. So overall, those businesses are performing very well
Robert Michael : Gary, I'll take your question. This is Rob. I'll take your question on the FTC. We are working closely with the agency on their additional requests I mean, keep in mind that we do not have any overlapping MOAs with Cereval and Vraylar share in schizophrenia is very low. The vast majority of Vraylar sales comes from the bipolar and AMBD indications. In the case of davapidon, it will serve the early Parkinson's segment, which Duodopa and Vyalev do not participate in. So we don't have any concerns with the merits of the transaction and continue to expect closing it in the middle of the year.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Garry. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen.
Steve Scala : And I apologize in advance for asking you to clarify on Humira. But you mentioned several times that things are playing out as planned. But in the prepared remarks, you said U.S. erosion played out slightly better than you thought in Q1. So is the conclusion that whatever was better is temporary. You also mentioned volume pressure, but price -- offset by price benefit. Can you quantify that? But when you sum it all up, it sounds like you expect volumes to underperform the expectations you set three months ago? And is that in part maybe due to the Accredo news from yesterday. So that's a big -- that's a long question, but that's only one question. And the second question is curious if the FDA has contacted at the about the potential safety issues with Emlacridine post the competitor issue with convulsions in rabbits. And have you seen this with your agent?
Jeff Stewart: Yes. So it's Jeff. So I'll try to take that. So the first part was the first quarter. I mean, it was marginally better in terms of overall performance because we didn't see -- obviously, we didn't see any volume disruption until 401. Now when you look at 401 and we look after three weeks, we look at our model in terms of the expectation around retention of Humira with the CVS template, that's largely tracking in line with what our expectations were with a bit of the surprise that some of that Humira is not going to the biosimilar, as I mentioned, is going to other mechanisms including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So overall, as we look to the balance of the -- really the first quarter, what we're seeing play out in the second quarter and look to the full year, our commentary, and I'll ask Rob to highlight if he has anything to add is very much in line with what we've guided at the beginning of the year. So no material change in what we're seeing in the marketplace.
Robert Michael: Yes, this is Rob. I'll confirm that, what Jeff is saying. I mean it's tracking in line with our expectations. We are not saying that volume is worse than we originally guided. We're saying this is tracking in line with our expectations. We try to characterize for you the price versus volume dynamics? Obviously, saying it's the price erosion is the vast majority of the decline, but there is volume, and it's tracking exactly as we anticipated. So there isn't an additional downside here. As Jeff mentioned, we did have slightly better performance in the first quarter. But again, it was -- I mean, I think, to the tune of $30 million to $40 million on this book of business, not overly material, but ahead of the initial expectation.
Roopal Thakkar : Steve, it's Roopal. I can take the next question. We did a thorough diligence. And when we look at data sets that offer clinical data, obviously, we do a deep dive there, also look at blinded data, but we also do a deep dive looking at toxicology, animal tox in particular. And we didn't observe anything that was consistent with what has been described thus far. And as I mentioned, when we look at blinded safety data either from the 1B or the current pivotals that are running, we don't see an adverse event like this that would be related. And as far as we know, no health authority has reached out to ask any further questions about this.
Robert Michael : Steve, this is Rob. I'm going to come back to your previous question and maybe I understand where the confusion could be. That one-time price benefit is a year-over-year dynamic. It was contemplated in our guidance. When you have a formulary change you essentially have those rebates go away and you recognize that. That was part of our guidance. That was not a benefit versus our guidance. That's a benefit in the year-over-year. So if you look at Scott guided to I think it was 32%.
Scott Reents : That's right.
Robert Michael : Erosion in the second quarter, which is lower than -- it was around 40% in the first quarter. So naturally, you'd wonder why would you have less erosion. Well, there's that year-over-year dynamic but that was how we planned the year. We anticipated it because we knew about the change that was coming in April 1. So I don't want to interpret that as a benefit versus our guidance, that's a benefit in the year-over-year calculation.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS.
Trung Huynh : Congratulations, Rick, on the next chapter of the life and Rob for moving AbbVie forward. Again, on biosimilar Humira. In your remarks, you mentioned post the expected CVS contract, there was a step-up in price for Humira. Is that simply because you're giving away more price to CVS at the contract at the time. And you mentioned additional contracts moving to biosimilar like CVS this year. Are there any meaningful contracts here that you can flag so we're not surprised? And is it possible we could see a actually a pricing increase by year-end because of this?
Scott Reents : Trung, this is Scott. I'll start with your question regarding the price benefit. So in my remarks, I indicated that with the formulary change in CVS and the volume step-down we saw there that there's a onetime price benefit associated with that. And you can think of this as we have the volume declines, that volume had been associated with price that we would have been paying in terms of rebate that those rebates will no longer be paid. Therefore, there's a one-time price benefit associated with that initial step down in the quarter. So that's what that relates to.
Jeff Stewart : Yes. And in terms of what we see going forward, as I highlighted, we don't see a significant exclusionary action where Humira would be removed from a formulary going forward. We did plan for, obviously, that smaller plans may make some adjustments to their formularies. That's all within the volume degradation and the pricing dynamics that we put into our guidance. And as I mentioned in one of the comments, some of the payers, not super large would maybe consider this idea of starting new patients on the biosimilars versus maintaining all the existing patients on Humira. So if you were to see that, you shouldn't be surprised about that and that would be within the contemplated approaches that we're taking as we look across '24 with our knowledge of what's happening in the marketplace.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Trung. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: And our final question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.
Evan Seigerman : On the aesthetics business, maybe talk to me about some of the dynamics you're seeing in China. I know that there's a lot of macro headwinds and this is a pretty big part of your business. And then a bit of housekeeping on Skyrizi, where the last quarter you disclosed the $1.9 billion cash payment for royalties. Can you provide us any color on what this quarter's royalty was? And I believe that was for the full year last year but maybe just for the quarter.
Carrie Strom : This is Carrie. I'll address your question on aesthetics in China. And we do expect economic headwinds that we're seeing in China to persist over the near-term with the China aesthetics market flat overall for 2024. So the way to think about it is to expect negative market until the recovery starts to begin in the second half of 2024. China does remain a very important market for our aesthetics business. And as the market there starts to recover, we will continue to invest in consumer activation, injector training and continue to launch new products in the support market.
Scott Reents : It's Scott. So you're right. With respect to the schedule relative payments. So you have to remember that these are on a bit of a lag, so they don't track each quarter sales. But the $400 million was the amount in the first quarter that we paid in cash payment.
Liz Shea: Well, thanks, Evan. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-02 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objection, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.

In addition to the news release issued this morning, we have also posted slides on our website at investors.abbvie.com that supplement some of the content we'll be covering this morning. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our performance this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie, with results well above our initial expectations. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our growth platform, the base business excluding Humira, which delivered full year sales growth of more than 8%, with revenue growth accelerating to more than 15% in the fourth quarter. The strength of our diversified growth platform has not only enabled us to successfully absorb the largest loss of exclusivity event to date across our industry, but it's also supported continued investment in our business for long term growth. These investments include: higher adjusted R&D expense, which was increased by nearly $600 million in 2023 and will be ranged substantially again in 2024 to support several promising pipeline programs like 383 in multiple myeloma. 400, our next-generation ADC for several solid tumor types and [Moodi] for HS, as well as inflammatory bowel disease. The proposed acquisition of ImmunoGen and their portfolio of ADCs accelerating our entry into the solid tumor space and strengthening our oncology pipeline, as well as the proposed acquisition of Cerevel, a unique opportunity to augment our presence in neuroscience with the pipeline of differentiated assets. We also increased our quarterly dividend which we announced in October. Since our inception, we have grown our dividend by more than 285%. In summary, our operational execution has been outstanding and we have considerable momentum heading into 2024, including an expected return to operational sales growth just one year following the US Humira loss of exclusivity, driven by our growth platform. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Rick. Today we reported another strong quarter and highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $11.11, which is $0.63 above our initial guidance midpoint, excluding the impact of IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $54.3 billion, roughly $2.3 billion ahead of our initial guidance. Most importantly, each of our five key growth areas outperformed our initial expectations. As it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we are focused on three key priorities. First, driving strong performance of our ex- Humira Growth Platform. This platform is the critical driver of our return to robust growth in 2025 and beyond. In our therapeutic portfolio, we have several key brands including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, Ubrelvy, and Qulipta, which are each expected to contribute double-digit sales growth in 2024. We also expect meaningful growth for aesthetics this year, driven by improving market trends in the US and continued execution across our international business. We are well positioned to drive strong long-term growth in this highly under-penetrated market. Second, we are focused on prioritizing investment in our pipeline, which encompasses numerous opportunities to elevate the standard of care for patients. We anticipate updates this year from several important R&D programs including approvals for Skyrizi in UC, 951 in the U.S., and potentially accelerated approval for Epkinly in third line plus follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate regulatory submissions for BoNT/E, our novel short-acting toxin, and potentially Teliso-V, an advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. And third, we are focused on closing and integrating ImmunoGen and Cerevel. These two exciting opportunities represent substantial sources of revenue growth well into the next decade. We remain on track with the anticipated closing of both deals in the middle of the year. Today, we are also reaffirming our long-term sales outlook, which includes a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single digit CAGR through the end of the decade. Included in this outlook is an updated forecast for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Based on the impressive growth of both therapies, which we expect will collectively generate approximately $16 billion of revenue in 2024, we now anticipate Skyrizi and Rinvoq will collectively exceed more than $27 billion in sales by 2027 with robust growth continuing into the next decade. This updated forecast reflects an increase of more than $6 billion in revenue compared to our prior 2027 guidance. We expect global sales for Skyrizi to reach more than $17 billion in 2027, reflecting continued share capture in psoriasis where we are the clear market leader, as well as strong uptake in IBD. And we expect Rinvoq to achieve more than $10 billion of global sales in 2027, reflecting continued market growth and share momentum across each of Rinvoq's approved indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD, and atopic dermatitis. This forecast comprehends modest contributions from several new disease areas for Rinvoq, which we anticipate will be launching in the second half of the decade. These new indications have a collective peak sales potential of several billion dollars. Our updated forecast also includes higher estimates for Ubrelvy and Qulipta. We now expect total oral CGRP peak revenue of more than $3 billion, reflecting an increase of more than $1 billion. Our previously issued long-term forecasts for aesthetics, Vraylar, and 951 remain unchanged. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio and our long-term outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.9 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi total sales were approximately $2.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of 51.6%. Rinvoq total sales were more than $1.2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 62.8%. On a full-year basis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq delivered more than $11.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of $4 billion year-over-year. And as Rob just described, we see substantial room for continued growth across each of their currently approved indications. You can get a good sense for this momentum by looking at the relationship between the current in-place share, which includes new and switching patients, and the total prescription share just today. For example, our performance in IBD has been very strong for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In Crohn’s disease, these two treatments together are already capturing roughly one out of every three in-play patients across all lines of therapy in the United States, while their combined total prescription share is only in the mid-single digits. You see a similar trend happening in ulcerative colitis for Rinvoq, and we anticipate launching Skyrizi for this indication later this year. So significant opportunity remains for revenue inflection in IBD, especially given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. Across some of the other notable indications, Skyrizi is capturing roughly half of the in-place psoriasis patients in the U.S. biologic market relative to a total prescription share, which is in the mid-30s percent. Rinvoq is capturing high teens in-play share in the atopic dermatitis market, while total share is in the high single digits. Similarly, in rheumatoid arthritis, Rinvoq is capturing mid-teens in-play share, while total share is roughly 7%. So, again, we see substantial headroom for share gains in addition to the typical robust market growth across rheum, derm, and gastro. Plus, we are planning to have up to five additional indications for Rinvoq across several sizable markets that will potentially provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of $3.3 billion, down 40.8% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the U.S. played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets continues to trend better than expected. In the U.S., we have once again secured broad formulary access for Humira in 2024. While there will be some step down in coverage year-over-year, we will still have parity access to biosimilars for the vast majority of U.S. patient lives. Turning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $903 million, down 19% reflecting continued pressure in new patient starts. Venclexta global sales were $589 million, up 13.7% on an operational basis, with strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. The early prescription trends for Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL have been encouraging with commercialization now underway in the US, Europe and Japan. We also anticipate the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Lastly, we have two new and exciting opportunities in oncology. Pending completion of the transaction, we will add Elahere to our portfolio. Elahere is a first-in-class ADC therapy approved for ovarian cancer, which is already demonstrating impressive uptake in the U.S. market. I look forward to welcoming the ImmunoGen commercial team to AbbVie. And Teliso-V, another novel ADC which has demonstrated very promising data in lung cancer. Teliso-V would further expand our scale and growth potential in solid tumors. In neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, total full year revenues were more than $7.7 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.2 billion. In the quarter, total revenues were approximately $2.1 billion, up 22.4% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $789 million were up nearly 40%. We continue to see significant momentum in new prescriptions across all indications following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder just over a year ago. And our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $348 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 40%. We anticipate continued robust demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta this year, including the expansion of Qulipta, the only once daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine into the international markets. Based on the strong momentum, we have raised the outlook for our CGRP portfolio and now expect total peak sales from Ubrelvy and Qulipta combined to exceed $3 billion. Total Botox therapeutic global sales were $776 million, up 6.7% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine, as well as other approved indications. And lastly, we recently launched 951 in both Japan and Europe, and we are pursuing commercial approval in the U.S. later this year. This treatment represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our diversified portfolio, especially the growth platform, which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?
Carrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Fourth quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, an operational increase of 6.9%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $884 million increased 5.7%, marked by accelerating market growth and strong key product performance. Fourth quarter U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $453 million, an increase of 7.3%. We continue to see sustained momentum in the recovery of the U.S. facial toxin market, which was a primary driver of growth in the fourth quarter. Botox Cosmetic remains the clear market leader with strong and stable share, despite new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $156 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 20% versus the prior year. This robust growth was driven by the strong launches of Volux and SkinVive, which continue to drive new consumers and greater penetration in the dermal filler category. Consistent with our expectations, the U.S. filler market recovery trails out of toxins, but it's continuing to show improvement as year-over-year growth was roughly flat in the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, we are pleased with the momentum of our U.S. aesthetics portfolio. We expect full year sales growth as our market leadership positions us very well from a competitive perspective, and we anticipate continued recovery in both toxin and filler markets. Internationally, fourth quarter aesthetic sales were $487 million, representing an operational increase of 9%. We experienced strong performance in most regions and growth benefited from the impact of China's COVID lockdowns in late 2022. Within China, the softening economic conditions that emerged in the third quarter continued to impact results. Consistent with what we experienced in the US, the economic slowdown has impacted fillers more than toxins, based upon their relatively higher price. We anticipate economic headwinds will continue in China over the near term, balanced against our expectations for continued strong performance in other international regions. Looking to the long-term, Aesthetics remains an area with very low market penetration. And we have demonstrated our ability to drive growth through investments in our customers, consumers, and innovation. As such, we anticipate Aesthetics will be a strong growth portfolio for years to come and remain confident in our ability to deliver more than $9 billion of sales by the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.
Roopal Thakkar: Thank you, Carrie. In 2023, we saw significant evolution of our pipeline with multiple data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals, as well as expansion of our R&D efforts with the announced ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We expect to continue this progress with numerous important clinical and regulatory milestones anticipated this year. In immunology, we recently announced positive topline results for lutikizumab our anti-IL-1 alpha beta bispecific being evaluated in hidradenitis suppurativa. In the Phase 2 study, lutikizumab demonstrated higher, high score of 50 and high score of 75 measures, as well as improvement in skin pain compared to placebo. These are very impressive results considering all patients who were inadequate responders to anti-TNF therapy. And 70% of the patients were early stage three, which is the most advanced stage of the disease. Based on these results, we plan to begin a Phase 3 program in HF later this year. We also plan to evaluate lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, given the role that IL-1 likely plays in these diseases. Patients with UC who have an IL-1 beta signature have shown resistance to anti-TNF and other biologics, providing strong rationale for a potential biomarker approach. Additionally, we believe lutikizumab has the potential to be used in combinations to provide transformational levels of efficacy in IBD. We plan to evaluate combo approaches with lutikizumab and Skyrizi, as well as with other pipeline assets in Crohn's. Our Phase 2 studies in IBD are expected to begin later this year. Our regulatory applications are under review for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis. With approval decisions expected in the US and Europe later this year. Once Skyrizi is approved in UC, along with Rinvoq, we will have two assets with different mechanisms of action in IBD, both offering very high levels of efficacy. AbbVie will be very well-positioned with an industry-leading suite of treatment options for patients suffering from moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We continued to make very good progress with the second wave of development programs for Rinvoq. With Phase 3 studies underway in five new indications, giant cell arteritis, lupus, HF, alopecia areata and vitiligo. We anticipate data readouts for these programs over the next three years, beginning with data from our GCA study this year. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make very good progress across our heme and solid tumor programs. In the area of hematologic oncology, we'll see data in the second half of this year from the Venclexta Phase 3 VERONA trial in treatment-naive higher-risk MDS patients, with regulatory submissions and approvals, anticipated in 2025. For Epkinly, we anticipate regulatory approvals in third-line or greater follicular lymphoma later this year in both the US and Europe. We also expect to begin several new Phase 3 studies in 2024, including studies in second-line DLBCL and frontline follicular lymphoma. At the recent ASH Meeting, we presented new data for our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma. 383 is engineered for high-affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells, and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T-Cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T-Cell engaging BCMA-based therapies, while preserving high levels of efficacy. We're very encouraged by the data emerging from our Phase 1b study, which show treatment with 383 is yielding deep and durable responses. With a lower incidence and severity of CRS. With this profile, we believe 383 can be a highly effective and tolerable treatment for multiple myeloma. While potentially allowing for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment. All attributes, which would make it very appealing to both patients and physicians. We remain on track to begin a Phase 3 monotherapy study in third-line multiple myeloma this year. And we plan to begin combination trials in earlier lines of therapy in 2025. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive topline results from the Teliso-V Phase 2 LUMINOSITY study in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. Teliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints, including, overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival, with a tolerable safety profile. We believe these results have the potential to support accelerated approval. And we plan to discuss the data with regulators in the coming months. Pending alignment with the FDA, our submission is planned for the second half of this year. We're also making good progress with our next-generation c-Met ADC ABBV-400, which utilizes the same c-Met blocking antibody as Teliso-V, but has a proprietary Topo-1 warhead to afford deeper and more durable responses with an improved therapeutic index. We remain on track to see data this year from the non-small cell lung cancer and gastroesophageal cohorts from our Phase 1 study. And based on the progress we're making in our colorectal program, we plan to begin a Phase 3 study later this year in third-line CRC. We also continue to make very good progress with our anti-GARP antibody ABBV-151. Our Phase 2 study in second-line hepatocellular carcinoma is underway, and we plan to begin several additional Phase 2 studies this year, including frontline HCC, frontline lung cancer and metastatic urothelial cancer. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving to Neuroscience where we recently announced the European launch of ABBV-951 for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We also recently provided our complete response submission to the FDA for 951 with an approval decision anticipated in the second quarter. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery system has the potential to offer meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development. 951 delivers significant improvements in off-time and on-time with a less invasive non-surgical system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by DUOPA. And it doesn't require combination with oral drugs to achieve high efficacy. 951 also provides a full 24-hour benefit, which should result in less morning akinesia. We're extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in Europe and the US once approved. In our Aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application in the US for Botox in platysma prominence. We anticipate an approval decision in the second half of this year. And we remain on track to complete the remaining CMC work this year for BoNT/E, our rapid onset short-acting novel toxin. Following completion of the remaining work, we plan to submit our regulatory application in the second half of the year, with approval anticipated near the end of 2025. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2024. I also look forward to integrating the ImmunoGen and Cerevel teams and pipeline assets into our R&D organization once those transactions close this year. These two transactions significantly strengthened our oncology and neuroscience pipelines with the addition of several novel assets that have the potential to become innovative new therapies for many patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Reents: Thank you, Roopal. I'm very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2023. We have substantial momentum across the portfolio to support our long-term growth outlook. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, which is $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.3 billion, $300 million ahead of our guidance, and down 5.4%. Most notably, these results reflect 15.3% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 43.8% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of 13.4% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.7% of sales. Adjusted net interest expense was $363 million, the adjusted tax-rate was 17.2%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2024, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $11.05 and $11.25. This earnings per share guidance includes dilution related to the ImmunoGen and Cerevel acquisitions of $0.32, which assumes closing in the middle of the year. Please note this guidance does not include an estimate for required IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect total net revenues of approximately $54.2 billion, reflecting a return to modest operational growth. At current rates, we expect foreign-exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for our key products in therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $25.6 billion, including Humira sales of $9.6 billion, including US erosion of roughly 36%. Skyrizi revenue of $10.5 billion, reflecting growth of more than $2.7 billion due to strong market-share performance in psoriasis, as well as robust uptake in IBD. And Rinvoq sales of $5.5 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 40% with continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications. On a full-year basis, we anticipate that our strong volume growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq will be modestly offset by low-single digit negative net price. In oncology, we expect sales of $5.7 billion, including Imbruvica revenue of $2.9 billion and Venclexta sales of $2.4 billion. As well as contributions from Epkinly, and partial year sales from Elahere. For Aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.7 billion. Including $2.9 billion from Botox Cosmetic and mid-single-digit revenue growth from Juvederm. For Neuroscience, we expect revenue of $8.9 billion, representing growth of more than 15%, including Vraylar sales of $3.4 billion, Botox Therapeutic sales of $3.2 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.6 billion. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2024, we are forecasting full-year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment of 14% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% of sales, and adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.1 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.7%. Finally, we expect share count to be roughly flat to 2023. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $11.9 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $5.1 billion, including Skyrizi sales of $1.9 billion, and Rinvoq revenue of $1 billion. These estimates reflect typical first quarter seasonality as well as low single digit unfavorable net price. We expect Humira global revenue of $2.2 billion, including US sales of $1.7 billion. We also anticipate oncology revenue just above $1.3 billion, Aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, Neuroscience revenue of $1.9 billion, and eye care sales of $600 million. We are forecasting an adjusted gross margin of approximately 83.5% of sales and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales. We also model a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.30 and $2.34. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $12.8 billion. And we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $18 billion in 2024, which includes roughly $1.9 billion in Skyrizi royalty payments. The strong free cash flow will fully support a strong growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 285% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down the approximately $7 billion of maturities this year, and also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong. We'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.
Operator: Yes, the first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Chris Schott: Hi, great. Thanks so much for the questions. Just I was looking for a little bit more color on the longer-term immunology outlook. You're targeting $27 billion plus by 2027 and highlighting growth from there. So, I guess my question was just can you elaborate on how mature the existing indications, these products are going to be by 2027? And what type of growth can we anticipate longer-term? And maybe as part of that, it seems like from the comments that the growth beyond 2027 is more skewed towards Rinvoq given the new indications, but [indiscernible] like is it balanced Rinvoq and Skyrizi, or has it become more of a Rinvoq driven franchise in terms of the growth drivers over time? Thanks so much.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, Chris. It's Jeff. Maybe I'll walk through a little bit of the process there and answer your questions. So we can see historically actuals and sort of fast forward in terms of the first thing we look at is the bio penetration of these big indications. And there still remain significant headroom in terms of the ability for moderate to severe patients with these diseases to continue to be exposed to these biologics and these advanced orals, absolutely. And we can see for sure that psoriasis still in -- even in the US is about 15%, it's relatively modest, atopic dermatitis, the penetration rate is only about 7%. And then you have higher penetrated markets like IBD and I'll talk about what's interesting about IBD, that’s somewhere in the 40% or 50% range across those. And then we can see clearly as these markets develop and I've highlighted this before that you see line of therapy expansion. So first-line becomes less and less important, as you move towards second and third-line over time. And right now, IBD is a big story about that, that we calculate into our long-term estimates, because it's still largely despite the severity a frontline oriented market, because physicians, just kind of hang on to their frontline agents, that's going to change quite dramatically believe over this mid-term and even in the long-term perspective. We have a good peg on the market growth rates. Many of these market growth rates are very significant, very stable. And we'll have good growth rates going into the next decade because of these dynamics around bio penetration and line of therapy expansion. I highlighted in my remarks around share, share we -- we have a very good competitive position, very high capture rates. And we're really in the sort of low end of the range in terms of the total prescription share, that will feed up and catch up to that. Pricing, I think we talked a little bit. We're not going to give detailed pricing. But certainly, you can see based on Scott's comments that, the idea of a high CAGR on high single-digit pricing is not something we've contemplated. So, we believe that there is significant room for growth even past 2027. Especially, as we'll have more Rinvoq indications coming that we've talked through. So we think that we're going to see robust growth based on our share capture and also how dynamic these markets are into the next decade.
Rob Michael: And Chris, this is Rob. I'll just add, you think about the markets, the rheum market is growing low-single digits, atopic dermatitis is growing mid-teens and IBD is growing high-single-digits. So they're very strong market, they will continue to be strong markets for us. And we're also seeing, as Jeff mentioned, there's a lot of headroom in terms of share capture. So we do expect that robust growth to continue beyond 2027 into early part of the next decade. I think your observation is correct. Given that we would expect up to five new indications for Rinvoq. If you look at the rate of growth, Rinvoq versus Skyrizi, I think it's reasonable to assume that Rinvoq would have a higher rate of growth given the new indications, but both will grow very nicely. So, I would certainly encourage you to look at more robust expectations for both therapies with Rinvoq a little bit higher because of the new indications.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Yes, the next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Terence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Rick, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on succession planning and timing, we've been fielding that question from a number of investors recently, given you're now pass the Humira LOE. And positioned the company very well here given Skyrizi and Rinvoq commercial success and also some of the recent pipeline build-out. And then the second question I have was on our pipeline on lutikizumab. I know you guys have highlighted this, not a lot of focus from the investor side yet. Maybe if you could just talk about the size of the commercial opportunity in HS. And then why you're confident that, that Phase 2 HS data will translate into success in the IBD side. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: All right, Terence. This is Rick. So I'll cover the first one. I guess what I would say is, I have nothing new to report today, but what I'd indicate is, we've talked about the criteria that we're going to use to make the decision when we're going to make the transition. That criteria is the same, when we believe that we are comfortable, we've navigated the LOE, and the rest of the business is performing at high level. That's the point at which we want to make the transition, because we think that's the best time to be able to transition the CEO position. So I understand there's a lot of interest from investors here, that's logical and clear. Maybe what I can do is, give you a little better perspective on the process that we're going to use in order to make the decision with the Board. I would say, the Board has been actively involved for the last four or five years with a lot of emphasis around ensuring that our internal candidate would get the experiences that we thought were needed prior to making the transition. I can tell you from my perspective, that's gone extremely well. We have regularly scheduled Board meetings several times a year where we specifically talk about succession and the progress that we're making. At the point at which the business has achieved that criteria that I described before, at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting, then I would make a recommendation to the Board that this is the proper time to be able to make the transition. The Board would vote on that recommendation. At the end of that vote, we would send out an announcement to investors. And what you can expect when you get that announcement is that, we would make an announcement that we were going to make the transition out at some point in the future, in all likelihood four months to six months in the future. And the purpose of that is to make the final transition between myself and that person. And that'll take four months to five months in order to be able to do that. I would say it's also very likely at that time, based on the discussions I've been having with the Board, is that, I will be named the Executive Chair for a period of time, and the purpose of that will be to make the transition of the full position over a period of time. So I think it's a very well thought out, I think very well managed process. And I think that's what you can expect going forward.
Jeff Stewart: And Terence, this is Jeff, I'll start-off and have Roopal will address the second part of your second question. So we established many years ago now this HS market with the approval of Humira. And we thought it was a relatively small market, and it turned out to be quite a surprise. There is a significant amount of patients around the world that suffer from HS, it's already a multi-billion dollar category. And we think it's going to continue to expand. And I say that, because we can see that like IBD, there's just some new approvals just coming. So, everyone sort of holds on Humira as long as they can if they're exposed to a biologic. And so we see the same dynamic as you start to see IL-17s come into this space, and certainly, we're very excited about lutikizumab because of the profile that we're seeing emerge in the clinic. So it's a significant commercial opportunity. And I would say that when we look back over all the Humira indications, over the last decade or more, HS was one of the most rapid indications that moved to $1 billion plus business. So it's an exciting opportunity, both commercially and certainly for patients. And Roopal can address your comment on IBD.
Roopal Thakkar: Yes. Hi, Terence. Part of it starts, I would say, almost 15 years ago with our insights in Crohn's disease with Humira, as Jeff was discussing, where we started to see efficacy in patients that had HS. We saw a good amount of overlap between Crohn's and HS. So that's part of it. Now that doesn't really pan out for IL-17, but what we've observed with IL-1 beta in particular is that, our internal data and external data do show elevated expression signals with one beta. So we think we have that opportunity with luti, because it also covers 1 beta and we have two shots at this, right. One is, to go specifically and look at a biomarker-driven targeted profile where we would be able to distinguish which patients actually have that higher expression. And the other approach, which we maybe weren't talking about years ago because we didn't have a product like Skyrizi which have high efficacy and very strong safety profile in Crohn's. What we have now is the opportunity to also look at in combination. So a biomarker approach and a combo approach, our insights from Humira and preclinical or biopsy-based insights that we have externally and internally.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Yes, the next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.
Andrew Baum: Hi, many thanks. Couple of questions. One, given AbbVie's strength in market access in managed market, I'd be curious the extensive future contagion from RNA IRA-mediated price cuts on the Medicare book spending over onto the commercial book of business. How much of concern do you think this is, given that has basically the same. And then second question on lutikizumab, if I remember from the canakinumab trials secondary to neutropenia, there was an increase in fatal infections. If you lay on this on top of another immunosuppressive, how are you thinking about the safety concerns in these IBD patients?
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, Andrew. Thanks for your question. It's Jeff. We think that the, particularly the negotiation aspects of the IRA will be very contained on the Medicare side. And as you can imagine with government programs over the years -- when we had discussion with payers, they'll often say things over, well we know what the FSS price is for the VA or demand mandated discounts and supplemental discounts in the Medicaid channel. But we think those are really government actions and government rules. And so, we see that the market we believe will play out largely like it has with the other government channels, that it's a unique dynamic in terms of essentially a forced negotiation that we think will be contained largely in the Medicare space. So that's how we view the world.
Roopal Thakkar: Hi it's Roopal, I'll talk about luti and your question around neutrophils. Yes, we do see impact on neutrophils, it's dose-driven. However, I think we think about inflammatory bowel disease, probably lupus, others to have a different tolerance for benefit-risk, because today in those disease states despite the success that we've seen with Skyrizi and Rinvoq, there's still substantial headroom to lead to more transformational efficacy, not every patient is getting into remission, though high levels, not every patient. So we still believe that a combo can get to that and break that efficacy threshold. The other opportunity there is what we'll do with the combination is obviously optimize the dose to assure safety. And thus far in the HS trial, even at the highest dose we saw very little infections.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Andrew. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Yes, the next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Congrats on all the progress. I just want to go back to the ImmunoGen acquisition and the comments you made before. Can you talk a little bit about the plans to move the drug into earlier lines of ovarian cancer. You talked about maintenance setting, but more we are reading it, I mean, in first-line maintenance, the PFS and OS tends to be really long. So could you talk a little bit about the strategy there and how do you overcome the existing OS benefit that these drugs provide? Thank you.
Roopal Thakkar: Hi, Mohit. It's Roopal, I'll take that. So, I think as you've seen in resistance we've seen that overall survival benefit, a very substantial one, unprecedented thus far. And to your point, the plan is to move into earlier lines of therapy. Secondly, it's also part of the strategy to move into sensitive populations, which is around 55% of the population, resistance is around 45%. And then the third aspect is, we've seen encouraging data in medium expressers of FR alpha. And those are approximately 30% of the patients, high is around 35%. So those are the three strategies to go forward. Now how do we get into earlier lines of therapy? Well, a couple of things, insights that we've seen. One is, we've seen Elahere been able to combine at full dose with carbo-platinum. So that's encouraging, that gives you an opportunity to upfront combine. And then as you stated, maintain on Elahere or with Elahere plus BEV. So the other approaches that we would do getting to earlier line of maintenance is have that upfront therapy and then we see patients that go onto BEV, we can combine with BEV at that time point. And we'll be looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors, which is about the other half of the patient populations, which are HRD deficient. So, taken altogether, we see there is an opportunity. Now, the PFS is going to be a little bit longer, along with OS. So that is something that we're planning for, we'll start these studies as soon as possible, but they will read out in the later part of the decade and into 2030.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is (inaudible) on for Vamil. Thanks for taking my question. So my question is on Humira. I was curious, given the recent performance of company has had with the erosion since the introduction of biosimilars. I was wondering if you can now provide maybe a better sense around the company's expectations on Humira's longer-term tail revenues in both the US and ex-US markets. Thank you.
Rob Michael: Hi, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So we do expect that in the US tail will start to emerge in 2025 or 2026 timeframe. Keep in mind 2024 is the first full year for US biosimilars. We'll have to see what happens with volume uptake this year and also where interchangeability lands. And ultimately, what does contracting look like next year. So, I wouldn't expect us to quantify the tail this year. But it's certainly possible, something we would do either in 2025 or 2026. As it relates to international, you're seeing, I think this year, it's a step-down of about $400 million. Half of that is really the last wave of markets like Canada, Puerto Rico where we're seeing, I'd say, some incremental erosion we would expect this year. And then the other half would be your typical international price erosion you see across therapeutic areas. So not really specific to biosimilars. And then the other quarter of it would be what we're seeing is just the strength of Skyrizi and Rinvoq as these newer agents elevate standard-of-care, you see some share go to those newer agents. And so, probably the best way to think about international would be, if you want to adjust for half of the erosion this year as being more of the final waves, and then you get a sense of what could potentially be the ongoing beyond that. But we'll be more specific, I think we need to see really how the US plays out with this being the first full year for biosimilars, before we can really give you more color. But we're very, very pleased with the progress we've made so far.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Dan. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.
Carter Gould: Great. Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Two on the neuroscience portfolio. I guess first on 951. How should we think about that? Is that more sort of on growing the overall pie of device data therapies versus taking share from apomorphine and gels. And then, maybe looking a little bit longer-term, AbbVie has sort of three Phase 2 Alzheimer's studies that are going to readout later this year or by early next year. Fully acknowledging the commercial challenges by the players in the market today and that's some of these targets are now validated. How should investors think about these assets either individually or collectively and your level of excitement? Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So what we look at when we see this market at a macro -- at a macro-level, you have a significant number of patients, 85% of patients are just on these oral medication. So, oral [indiscernible]. Okay. And they essentially need to consume more and more and more orals, and sometimes at the end of it they're taken 12 pills a day, it's very, very difficult to manage. But then they're faced with a very difficult decision, which we kind of call like a surgical barrier. And that surgical barrier is to get any sort of more advanced relief, you either have to think about deep brain stimulation, which is a brain surgery or our own DUOPA, which is a GI surgery. So the way we see this market developing is we see that 951 starts to establish a very nice transition zone, because you don't have -- it's a subcu. So a new market segment that starts to emerge before bigger interventions like DBS or DUOPA. And obviously, the ability to basically move quicker to more relief from these chronic oral basically over treatment. So that's how we see it. And as Roopal highlighted, we're seeing some very nice uptake in Japan, where we launched late last year, and also in Germany and some of the first European launches. So that's how the market is exactly playing out. We're establishing essentially a new high efficacy category here with 24 hours of ongoing relief. You can do super specific dosing titration and the pump is much smaller and again, it's a subcu injection that you move around every three days. So it's a nice -- it's a nice opportunity for the company.
Roopal Thakkar: And maybe I'll talk about the other assets that you mentioned in Alzheimers. First, 916, that's our A beta antibody. What we like about that one thus far, the profile we've seen is a long half-life, which would be good to space out dosing. Potentially higher potency if that holds, and we see robust reductions in beta amyloid that could allow for subcutaneous dosing that's spaced apart. And the other thing we are looking at is potentially lower ARIA. So if we see those three things over the course, I would say, end of this year, early next year, I think that, that would be quite exciting, because it would be a differentiated profile, again a better convenience and potentially better benefit-risk profile. So that's 916. 552 is our SV2A that's our oral medication in cognition that's currently in Phase 2. And we anticipate readout at the end of this year, early next year. Now, that one is being studied in a setting where patient can be on a therapy already like an [Aricept] (ph), or nothing. And we would use the typical ADAS-Cog assessments along with a variety of others including other neuropsychiatric symptoms, like depression. So that's another nice one that could combine with a variety of different assets in Alzheimers. The third one I'll mention is around Emraclidine, which comes from Cerevel. They are at early stages right now in elderly patients. And the goal there would be an Alzheimer's disease psychosis of the six million or so diagnoses, I would say around 40% of these patients present with symptoms of psychosis. So with all the therapies that are in the clinic, we think we have a very nice complementary suite of options that could address numerous symptoms of Alzheimers, because it won't be just one therapy that's going to solve this. But more to come end of this year and into next year.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: The next question comes from [Technical Difficulty]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks for the question. Just on the reaffirmed long-term guide, can I clarify if the Cerevel and ImmunoGen deals are in this 2029 guide given you included them in the 2024 guide? And you up Skyrizi and Rinvoq by $6 billion, migraine by $1 billion. If these are the pushes, what are the pulls in reaffirming that long-term guidance?
Rob Michael: So, this is Rob. I'll take that question. Yes, we did include ImmunoGen and Cerevel in our long-term guide. The thing to keep in mind is, high-single-digits, when you think about the range that could represent, that's around $10 billion between the low-end of the high-single-digits and the high-end of the high-single-digits. And so, there aren't any pulls, what we've updated as we walk you through it is, we've increased the oral CGRP peak revenue, we've increased Skyrizi, Rinvoq and we've reaffirmed the others. So there's nothing that we took down. But just keep in mind that you've got a pretty, pretty wide range. If you look at Street consensus, we're encouraged that it continues to move up. It has moved up over the course of the last quarter, about $3 billion in 2029. It's nice to see that upward movement. But it's still below what we expect. If you think that, that growth rate for the Street is just under 5%, we expect high-single-digits. And so, even with this update, as well as ImmunoGen and Cerevel, we're still high-single-digits. But keep in mind, it's a pretty wide range. And it would be, regardless industry-leading growth and we're set up very well to continue delivering a very strong growth, and we're setting ourselves very well to grow very nicely in the next decade as well.
Liz Shea: Thanks, [indiscernible]. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Gary Nachman: Thanks and good morning. First on Aesthetics, could you talk a bit more why you're confident in what seems to be a pretty decent return to growth in 2024. So how much of a headwind could China be offsetting the US growth. And what are other regions will you be getting some somewhat of a lift this year. Just talk about the dynamics on that front. And then secondly, just -- as you return to more robust revenue growth in 2025, what are reasonable expectations for operating margins directionally in 2025. Can that expand at all or is it more likely to be depressed from the ImmunoGen and Cerevel deals? Just give us some directional way to think about that for next year. Thank you.
Carrie Strom: Hi, this is Carrie, I'll take your first question on Aesthetics and the Aesthetics market recovery. So I'll start with the US and we have started to see the US toxin market recover the end of 2023. We expect that recovery to continue. And for the market growth for toxins to continue to improve in 2024. For fillers, in the US, in Q4, after multiple quarters of decline, the filler market in the US was somewhat flat. And so, that dynamic of the filler market recovery lagging the toxin market recovery is playing out. And we do expect that recovery on fillers to also continue -- to a lesser degree than toxins, more of a modest growth, positive growth for 2024. And as we look at the beginning of the year here in 2024, we are seeing our patient demand metrics and Google metrics really supporting our expectations here. In terms of China, we do expect the economic headwinds that we saw beginning mid-year 2023 to continue in the near-term with China. And we expect the China Aesthetics market to be flat overall in 2024. That would look like negative market in the first half of the year until the China market starts to recover in the second half of 2024. And we expect that China performance to be balanced against expectations for strong performance in other international regions, including Japan, which has become an important market for Aesthetics and areas of Latin America, like Brazil, which is a highly aesthetically oriented market. It's also important to know in terms of Q1 of 2024, in terms of our guidance there that the growth in the US will be offset by that international decline, specifically in China. So not only the China economic headwinds, but also a difficult year-over-year comp in Q1, because recall, in Q1 of 2023, there was the post-pandemic reopening in China. So that's really how we see the market growth factors in US, China and other parts of the world playing out in 2024.
Rob Michael: And Gary, this is Rob. To build on the Aesthetics story, I said in the past to get to our guidance of greater than $9 billion, we need to deliver annual growth of high-single-digits on average. And as Carrie just walked you through, we haven't quite seen the recovery for the fillers market yet this year. And we will, but it's not going to be a normal year, we'll see a ramping. And we also had a slowdown in China. But despite that we're still delivering high single digit growth. And given how under penetrated these markets are, we can drive that market growth that's required to achieve the long-term guidance. And then on top of that, we have several innovations that will further support that growth. I've said this before, but the masseter and platysma indications for Botox will add a few $100 million each. Our novel short-acting toxin BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients who have not started toxin due to fear of an unnatural look. So that could drive an inflection in market growth and market share. And then our region, our fillers pipeline is really aimed at providing both short and long-term treatment benefits for consumers. So we have several avenues to get to our greater than $9 billion guide. I have seen consensus estimates at $8 billion for 2029, but we're very confident in our guidance of greater than $9 billion by that period.
Scott Reents: Gary, this is Scott. I'll take your question regarding operating margin expansion. So for 2024, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've guided to 46.5%. When we do return to robust growth in 2025, we do see that operating margin will expand, and will continue to expand as we grow through the decade. I think that when we think about the pace of that expansion, it will be a relatively steady over several years. I would though, if you're modeling that, I would kind of peak it out at around 50%. I think that's where we'll hit a peak at the operating margin. But we do see expansion both in 2025 on that return to robust growth, including the impact of the two transactions ImmunoGen and Cerevel, which should presumably be a full-year at that point in time. But at the full year impact, we see that expansion. And I do think it's worth noting, even at our current levels, we have industry-leading operating margin. And certainly with the future expansion we will continue to have that and only grow that position.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Gary. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Yes, our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Steve Scala: Thank you very much. Two questions. Is the current tax rate fully reflecting likely tax changes in the US and outside the US? So, it represents a high watermark for the foreseeable future. Previously the company spoke to a 16% tax rate. And we're pretty much there. So I am wondering if the increases are kind of behind us? And then Rick, a slightly different kind of question, but there are clear, obvious reasons such as the success of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, but I'm curious if you would share with us a few of the externally less visible factors that are leading to AbbVie's success traversing the Humira patent expiration that your pharma peers missed when dealing with their own pressures. I would assume contracting formulary management, allocation of overhead are all part of it. But what would you be willing to share with us? Thank you.
Scott Reents: Steve, this is Scott. I'll start with your tax rate question. So with respect to the tax rate, we were essentially flat between this year and last year at 15.7%. We do see that tax rate over the three year period including this year increasing about 1% on average. Now that's not going to be a 1% per year. What you'll see is a step up in a couple of years when the US tax rates do increase the GILTI rate in particular, will increase. So we see that over a three year period about 1% per year on average. That does include all the impacts of a number of things going on globally with the OECD and some of these -- OECD minimum taxes and other things. I would say the one thing it does not include, you saw just this week, the House passed a tax bill that includes the provision regarding the R&D expensing. So if that bill were to pass, as it's written, we would see a slight step down in our tax rate, about 80 basis points from the impact of that on an ongoing basis.
Rick Gonzalez: Steve, this is Rick. I think if you step back and you look over the last, I'd say, 10 years, we were trying to develop a strategy that we fundamentally believed will allow us to be able to offset the Humira LOE and continue to deliver top-tier financial performance as we have for the past 10 years. That was the whole objective. And we knew we had to build a very diversified growth platform in order to be able to do that, to be able to absorb that impact and return to growth as rapidly as possible. And so, we as an executive team focused a lot of energy around how do we do that, how do we build it, how do we do it in the right markets. I think AbbVie, I'm obviously biased, I guess, but I would say our commercial execution has always been exceptional in my opinion. We understand the markets we're in extremely well. We understand the competitive environment that we compete in those markets extremely well. We understand the patient journey and how that patient journey is affected by access to medicines to ensure that patients can get their medicines routinely and be able to get the benefit of those medicines. It takes all of those things I think to end up with kind of success that we see with assets like Skyrizi and Rinvoq. But it also takes I think a company that is very good at what I describe as read and react. There are always challenges in businesses as big and as complex as this. And I think the difference between companies that can continue to perform at the top tier, year in and year out is they're good at seeing issues, and then quickly reacting to how they're going to either offset those, or deal with those. We had many of those examples. I'd say the label change on Rinvoq was a great example. But look at where Rinvoq is growing now. And despite that label change many would not have predicted that. Migraine, was a very challenging market for a period of time. We look at how we've operated with Ubrelvy and Qulipta. And the kind of success we've seen against the competitors in those markets. Neuroscience, very different kind of market with Vraylar. That's all about trying to grow market-share and expand your position there with a very good asset. And so, we're good at that, and I think that is the real differentiator. The other thing I'd say is, I think we have been very efficient at our R&D investment. We obviously don't have the largest R&D investment in the industry. But we produced a tremendous amount of return against that R&D investment. Now having said that, as we go forward, we know we need to increase R&D as I've said in my comments. We did a fairly significant increase last year despite dealing with the Humira LOE. And we're going to do another fairly significant increase this year because we had some assets that had very, very significant opportunities like 383 and like 400 and several others. They are going to require a large Phase 3 -- multiple large Phase 3 studies to be able to get the kind of label that we need, and that's another thing, I'd say, we're good at. Understanding how you have a competitive label and building your clinical programs to get that. So, I think it requires all of those things. I don't think there is one magic formula. I think those are the kinds of things that we have honed here at AbbVie an executive team. And we execute very well against those.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Yes, our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. It’s [Nachman] (ph) for Evan. I wanted to ask -- thinking about the upcoming approval for Skyrizi, and you see how is management thinking about how that may or may not impact Rinvoq sales, obviously combined AbbVie offers some immpresive suite of inflammatory assets. But what is the expectation of cannibalism across these assets potentially? Thanks.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. I'll take that one. We've learned a lot from watching Skyrizi and Rinvoq in Crohn's. And to Rick's points, look, we're very careful about how we position these assets, you know how we basically represent them with our medical teams and our commercial teams. And so what we see certainly in our biggest markets, we see that they are actually complementary positioning. So, Rick highlighted the label change, right. So Rinvoq, in the US, is basically indicated for use after a TNF. So it's basically a later-line therapy. Skyrizi, if you look at the Skyrizi, you see results, it's very, very impressive. We've studied some very, very tough patients there. The bio-naive patients, the efficacy is just outstanding. I would say it's best-in-class. So we can see that based on the profile of the agents for many of our representatives, we're able to talk to physicians about the consideration for Skyrizi frontline. And then in later lines Rinvoq. So the cannibalization or the overlap is very manageable and minimal. And what happens is you start to see this, this very significant build for total AbbVie share because of that complementary positioning. So we're quite confident that we'll be able to navigate this very well just as we see in the larger Crohn's market.
Liz Shea: Thanks for the question. Operator next call -- next question, please.
Operator: Yes, our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Tim Anderson: Hi, I have a question on obesity drug impact on AbbVie's Aesthetics business. So the uptake for obesity drugs could be a headwind or a tailwind. That's a potential headwind if patients only have so many dollars to spend on Aesthetics and they reallocate their out-of-pocket spending away from dermal fillers and toxins towards obesity drugs? Or it's a tailwind if patients using obesity drugs get things like the so-called Ozempic face and they end up using more toxins and fillers. So, what's been the experience thus far. And what do you expect going forward over the next handful of years? Thank you.
Carrie Strom: Hi, this is Carrie. So the short answer is, we have not seen an impact on our Aesthetics business positive or negative so far. That said, absolutely, our customers and our consumers are participating in this market. We are seeing it integrated into some of these Aesthetics practices. And to your point, there are instances where a patient will make a trade-off in terms of her share of wallet. But that said, we do see it as a long-term tailwind anytime people are getting more engaged in their appearance, that's a positive thing for Aesthetics. And as we ask our consumers and our customers about it, really that -- what we've learned is that it does reinforce its long-term tailwind because the majority of people who engage in these medical weight-loss products are more interested in Aesthetics afterwards than they never before. So, that's really how we see it in terms of the that dynamic impacting Aesthetics.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Yes. Our next question comes from Tim Lugo with William Blair. Your line is open.
Tim Lugo: Thanks for taking the question. After the two announced acquisitions in December, what are the team's thoughts on M&A in 2024. Some of your peers have given guidance on expected deal sizes. Is that something you can provide the Street or at least talk about your capacity at this point?
Rob Michael: Hi, Tim, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on identifying assets, really that can drive growth in the next decade across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics and eye care. But we have what we need in our current portfolio to deliver on growth expectations in this decade. So our external efforts are really aimed at early-stage opportunities, which are typically smaller-sized deals. As we look across the growth areas, if you think about immunology Skyrizi and Rinvoq will drive robust growth into the next decade. So our focus in immunology in terms of BD is really looking for new mechanisms of action that can elevate standard-of-care whether monotherapy or in combination. I'd say there's a lot of interest in combination. In oncology, ImmunoGen really nicely complements our efforts with ADCs, it gives us a head start, an entry in the solid tumor space, that we're not in today. But in addition to ADCs, we're focused on bispecific, multi- specifics immuno onc agents. We also recently announced a collaboration with Umoja studying insight to CAR-T therapy. So a lot of focus in oncology, but these again would be earlier-stage smaller-sized deals. In Neuroscience, Cerevel adds depth to our neuropsych pipeline, but we also have a focus on migraine and neurodegeneration. In eye care, we're extremely excited about the REGENXBIO program in wet-AMD and diabetic retinopathy. But we continue to look for innovation in glaucoma and retinal disease. So we certainly have an interest there. And then in Aesthetics, it's always about looking for innovation that can drive new consumers into our providers practices. So our BD group is still very active. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities to further bolster our pipeline. But those are the areas that we're most interested in.
Liz Shea: Thanks Tim. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Yes, the next question comes from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
James Shin: Hi. Good morning. I had a question on ovarian cancer and it's going to be more competitive with [indiscernible]. How do you feel about [indiscernible] interacting? And how do you feel that market landscape looks going forward?
Liz Shea: Unfortunately. Your line is not very clear. Can you maybe try to repeat the question one time.
James Shin: Sorry about that. [indiscernible] better now.
Liz Shea: It's still little echoey, it's a little bit better, but go ahead.
James Shin: Okay, I was asking about [indiscernible] and the competitive dynamics in ovarian cancer.
Liz Shea: Yes, unfortunately, it's just not coming clear -- coming through clearly. Happy to address the question following the call. Apologies for that. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Yes, the next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.
David Risinger: Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on the long term updates. So with respect to the Alzheimers commentary, a product was left out of the TREM2 AL002, which has an estimated primary completion in September. If you could comment on that as well. That would be helpful. And then with respect to the GILTI tax change that's coming, so can you please provide some more color on that, including the timing and the potential impact? Thanks very much.
Tom Hudson: Hi, this is Tom Hudson. I'll answer the question, the first question, yes, we do have a partnered program with Alector on the TREM2 target. TREM2 was identified in Alzheimers disease through genetic studies, several years ago, very strong link. We have a program which -- TREM2 modulates and no inflammatory response in AD. All patients are enrolled in the Phase 2, we will have data later this year. So again it's an early clinical development, but we will expect to see key data later.
Scott Reents: Sure, this is Scott. Regarding the GILTI tax. So this is the US tax, the foreign minimum tax on foreign earnings that the US supplies. That tax rate today is at 10.5%, it's going to move up to 13.1% a little bit more than that. That will occur -- the implementation date is a little bit mixed, because it depends on fiscal year-ends of legal entities, but let's call it 2026 is when we can look at that. And only part of our income is subject to that rate. So, I would say that's approximately a 1.5% impact to our tax rate that you would see. And that's baked into my 1% on average over the next three years.
Liz Shea: Thanks, David. Operator we have time for one final question.
Operator: Okay. And our final question is Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open.
Luisa Hector: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the Part-D restructure an IRA. So you have a number of drugs that are likely to be impacted by this. And obviously, you talk about your strong rebound in 2025. So I'd just love to hear your thoughts on how that restructure will impact. And perhaps to what extent that is already baked into your expectations of the rebound? And maybe just to check, have you now received the initial offer from CMS owned Imbruvica? Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Yea. Thank you, Luisa. It's Jeff. And we have we have contemplated in our planning and long-term guidance, both the Part-D redesign and of course the IRA impacts based on our projections over when some of our drugs might be negotiated. To give you some color on the Part-D redesign, we have clearly a very good visibility over the pricing dynamics that will take place as you say, many of our brands basically will be under the catastrophic redesign component. Now we've also understood based on one of the policy items, which is the cap and smooth, we've also countered some of that price with volume offsets based on patients having the ability to acquire these. Now that volume does not fully offset the pricing impact. But suffice it to say that, that's been very much contemplated into that. I'll let Rob comment over how that sort of feeds into the growth rates.
Rob Michael: Luisa you asked a very good question. This is Rob. Clearly, and we have contemplated that in the high single digit CAGR, the impacts of IRA. But as you think about the annual progression, it is important to note that Part-D benefit redesign starts in 2025. So that is certainly something you should consider for modeling of annual sales. I mean, that impact by itself, on a net basis could be worth a few points of growth. As Jeff mentioned, the higher cost share with an offset in volume, we have studied the improvement in abandonment rates as we look at the low-income subsidy part of Part-D which doesn't have the out of pocket burden that the standard benefit does. And when we compare the abandonment rates and as you address this issue of out of pocket burden, we would expect the abandonment rates to improve across Medicare Part-D, but not enough to fully offset the higher-cost share. That was something we certainly contemplated. But as you think about the progression of growth, the rate of growth will accelerate starting next year through 2029. So we'll deliver a high-single-digit CAGR. But it's important to note that in 2025, you do have that beginning of Part-D benefit redesign, which adds, I'd say a couple of points of growth headwind that will still allow us to deliver robust growth, but it won't -- you shouldn't think about the same amount of growth every year, it's going to accelerate over the long-range plan.
Rick Gonzalez: And then, this is Rick on the Imbruvica price, yes, we have received the initial offer on Imbruvica recently. As you know, there is a process that CMS is going through here to set pricing. And because none of us have any experience with this, we don't know exactly how that process will proceed. There will be some back and forth between the manufacturer and CMS. CMS has indicated that they'll have the final price by September 1st. It's certainly premature for us to talk about the price now, because it's not the final price. I don't know that we'll know the final price until very close to the point at which they are prepared to publish that price, having not had any experience here. So, I wouldn't anticipate we will get any updates until that date or very close to that date.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Luisa. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. 
Liz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer.  Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we will take your questions.  So with that, I will turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. AbbVie continues to perform exceptionally well. We once again delivered an excellent quarter with results ahead of our expectations. We are now several quarters into the U.S. biosimilar event for Humira and continue to effectively manage erosion. We have been able to maintain significant volume with the majority of the impact to date driven by lower price.  Importantly, our growth platform, the base business excluding Humira, which includes a well-diversified portfolio with multiple leading products in highly attractive markets across immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and aesthetics continues to demonstrate robust performance and outperform expectations. This platform, which is the critical driver in our return to rapid growth in 2025 and beyond, delivered strong double digit revenue growth this quarter, a considerable acceleration from the first half of this year.  We anticipate this platform, which is led by Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, and Botox will continue to drive significant revenue growth going forward. At the same time, we have several promising R&D programs with the potential to contribute meaningfully in the latter part of this decade and into the 2030s. This includes next generation approaches in immunology, a focus on bispecifics, ADCs, and novel I-O in oncology, as well as innovative therapies to potentially treat a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.  In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the continued strong momentum and execution across our business. The growth platform is substantially outperforming our expectations, giving us the confidence to once again raise our financial outlook, including upgraded guidance for floor earnings, which Rob will share momentarily. And further underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today, we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown by more than 285% since our inception.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob? 
Rob Michael: Thank you, Rick. Our results once again demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio and support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance. The performance of our ex-Humira growth platform continues to be very strong with revenue growth above 12% this quarter, including more than 50% growth from both Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our best in category immunology medicines. We continue to anticipate that these two products will collectively exceed Humira peak revenues by 2027 with robust growth expected into the next decade. Neuroscience also delivered strong performance with operational sales growth of more than 20% this quarter, driven by our leading portfolio for migraine and psychiatric conditions. And lastly, aesthetics performance was highlighted by the return to growth of the U.S. toxin market.  This outstanding execution across our well-diversified portfolio gives us the confidence to once again raise our near-term financial outlook. We are increasing our full year revenue guidance by $600 million and have now raised total revenue by $2 billion since our initial guidance in February, including more than $1.4 billion from our ex-Humira growth platform. As a result, we are also raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25, and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.19 and $11.23. Given the strong momentum of our growth platform, which is significantly outperforming our expectations this year, we are now raising the floor guidance for 2024 adjusted EPS to $11, which is $0.30 better than our previous expectations. This floor guidance continues to exclude any impact from IPR&D expense. As is our typical practice, we'll provide our formal EPS guidance range for 2024 on the fourth quarter call.  Finally, today, we are announcing a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.48 to $1.55, beginning with a dividend payable in February 2024. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by more than 285%.  In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong execution across our portfolio. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single digit CAGR to the end of the decade.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? 
Jeff Stewart : Thank you, Rob. We once again delivered strong results across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of nearly $6.8 billion exceeding our expectations.  Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to demonstrate impressive growth and are now on pace to deliver approximately $11.6 billion in combined sales this year. This performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we are still in the early launch phase for both assets and IBD, an area of high unmet need where we are very competitively positioned with two complementary assets, each having generated strong response rates and durable remission across our development programs.  Skyrizi total sales were $2.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 50%. This robust performance includes further share gains in psoriasis, where we remain the clear market leader, capturing roughly one-third of the total prescriptions in the U.S. biologic market, and approximately 50% of in-play patients who are either new to therapy or switching. Increasing momentum in psoriatic arthritis, where Skyrizi is now the leading in-play biologic therapy in the U.S. dermatology segment, as well as continued rapid uptake in Crohn's disease where we are capturing roughly one out of every four in-play patients.  Importantly, we recently announced positive results from SEQUENCE the ninth and perhaps the most impactful head-to-head study across our development program for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. SEQUENCE is a Phase 3 head-to-head study in Crohn's, which demonstrated Skyrizi's superiority versus Stelara across key efficacy parameters, including impressive, statistically significant differences in both clinical and endoscopic remission. The detailed data from this trial were presented earlier this month, and we plan to share the findings more broadly now via our medical personnel and representatives in the field. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will clearly support Skyrizi as the best in category therapy for Crohn's, which is important for continued rapid share capture. So based on this very positive data as well as our continued momentum, we will be once again raising the full year sales outlook for Skyrizi. Moving now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of nearly 60% with increasing prescriptions across each of the approved indications. In particular, I am very excited about Rinvoq's growth potential in gastroenterology, where uptake is exceeding our expectations. In ulcerative colitis, Rinvoq is now capturing more than 25% total in-play patient share in the U.S. second-line plus setting, nearly at parity to the current market-leading therapy. And in Crohn's disease, Rinvoq is ramping very significantly. The inflection we are seeing is even faster when compared to our time aligned launch in UC just last year. Given this impressive momentum in IBD, we will now be raising our full year sales outlook for Rinvoq. Global Humira sales were more than $3.5 billion, down 36.2% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the U.S. played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets is trending better-than-expected. Turning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $908 million down 20% and consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $590 million, up 14% on an operational basis with strong demand for CLL and AML across our key countries. The U.S. launch of at EPKINLY in third line plus DLBCL is also tracking well with commercialization also now underway in Europe and Japan, following the recent respective approvals. In neuroscience, total revenues were more than $2 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $751 million were up 35.4% and we have seen a significant uplift in new prescriptions across all indications, following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder late last year. Our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $365 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 65%, as we continue to see strong demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Atogepant was also recently approved as a new therapy in Europe branded as Aquipta, where it is the only once-daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine, further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity.  Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic global sales were $748 million, up 7.4% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. So overall, I am extremely pleased with commercial execution across the therapeutic portfolio, especially with our growth platform, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?
Carrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Third quarter global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.2 billion, an operational decline of 4%. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $759 million were roughly flat to last year as growth for Botox Cosmetic was offset by declines in other brands that continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures. U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $388 million, an increase of 5%. We are beginning to see a recovery in the U.S. toxin market, which posted positive year-over-year growth in the third quarter following three consecutive quarters of declines due to economic pressures. Botox continues to perform very well despite increasing competition. It remains the clear market leader with a strong and stable share, and we have seen little to no share impact from new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $116 million in the third quarter, a decline of 6.4% versus prior year as recovery in the facial filler market continues to lag the cosmetic toxin market. The filler market is improving, however, as a higher priced, more deferrable procedure relative to toxins. The segment of the aesthetics market continues to be suppressed by lower consumer spending. In the third quarter, the U.S. facial filler market was down low teens percentage compared to the prior year.  Juvederm remains the market-leading facial seller in the U.S. and share was stable in the quarter. While the U.S. facial injectable markets continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending in this inflationary environment, we are seeing signs of stabilization and even a return to growth in the cosmetic toxin segment. This gives us confidence in a stable to improving outlook in the U.S. as we end this year and enter 2024. Internationally, third quarter aesthetic sales were $480 million, representing an operational decline of 9.7%. As anticipated, year-over-year performance in the quarter was impacted by a shipment timing benefit we experienced in the third quarter of last year. Results were also impacted by softening economic conditions across major international aesthetic markets, primarily China. Despite the economic pressures that are currently impacting our aesthetics portfolio, we remain very confident in its long-term growth outlook. In September, we began launching Skin Vive in the U.S. And in the next few years, we plan to launch new indications for Botox in the lower face segment, and our novel fast-onset, short-duration toxin BoNT/E. In addition to our R&D programs, we have a robust Alle technology pipeline, which will bring new tech products into the U.S. market to help our customers acquire, retain and cross-sell more aesthetic patients. Our strong leadership positions in both cosmetic toxins and facial fillers combined with the significant investments we're making to drive market acceleration will position us for strong growth going forward.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. 
Tom Hudson : Thank you, Carrie. In immunology, we had two important milestones in the third quarter for Skyrizi in inflammatory bowel disease. Following completion of the Phase 3 maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis. We submitted our regulatory applications for Scares in this indication in the U.S. and Europe with approvals anticipated in 2024. We also recently presented results from the SEQUENCE head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Stelara in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We're extremely pleased with how Skyrizi performed in this study, which enrolled very difficult-to-treat patients who all failed anti-TNF therapy. Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial, demonstrating clear superiority to Stelara on all endpoints at week 48 and with a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission at 32% of Skyrizi versus 16% for Stelara and endoscopic response at 45% versus 22% for Stelara.  Furthermore, steroid-free clinical remission was 61% for Scares versus 40% for Stelara. So these compelling head-to-head Crohn's data combined with the additional indication approval for ulcerative colitis expected next year will further position Skyrizi as a highly effective, durable, safe and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. We continue to make very good progress with the second wave of Rinvoq development programs as well in addition to the ongoing Phase 3 programs in GCA, lupus and HS, we recently began the Phase 3 program for Rinvoq in Alopecia Areata. We also recently announced positive top line results from a Phase 2 study for Rinvoq in vitiligo. In this study, Rinvoq met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 24 and demonstrating a significant improvement in both facial and total body vitiligo scoring measures compared to placebo.  Importantly, these results continued to improve through week 52 of the study illustrating Rinvoq's potential to provide significant skin repigmentation to patients suffering from vitiligo. Based on these results, we're advancing Rinvoq to Phase 3 in this indication with studies expected to begin soon.  Moving to oncology, where in the quarter, we received approval in Europe and Japan for epcoritamab as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL, were received two or more systemic therapies. These approvals represent important regulatory milestones for EPCO, and we look forward to bringing this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients in these international markets. We also continue to make good progress with the development programs in earlier lines of DLBCL and follicular lymphoma and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. In our Venclexta multiple myeloma program, we recently announced top line results of a Phase 3 CANOVA trial evaluating Venclexta plus dexamethasone compared to PomDex in relapsed/refractory patients with a T114 mutation. In this study, the primary endpoint of IR CSS PFS was longer with VenDex versus PomDex but did not meet statistical significance. accommodation also resulted in numerically higher response rates and longer overall survival compared to PomDex. While the differences in efficacy measures were not statistically significant, we believe the totality of the data show a benefit with the Venclexta combination and we plan to discuss the results with regulatory agencies. We'll provide updates on the program as they become available.  Behind Venclexta, we have several exciting multiple myeloma programs emerging from our earlier stage pipeline. We continue to make good progress with our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 and where we're nearing completion of the dose optimization work and are on track to begin Phase 3 studies in the first half of next year. At an upcoming medical meeting, we plan to present updated Phase 1 efficacy and safety results as well as monthly administration dose data. We're also making good progress with our next-generation BCL2 inhibitor, ABBV-53, which is currently in Phase 1 studies and we'll provide updates as the data become available.  Now moving to Neuroscience, where in the quarter, we received approval for Aquipta in Europe, which is now the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently announced top line results from a second Phase 3 study evaluating Botox in platysma prominence, similar to results from the first Phase 3 study, all primary and secondary endpoints were met with Botox demonstrating a significant reduction in platysma prominence and vertical neckband. We anticipate a regulatory submission in the U.S. here the end of the year.  In addition to indication expansion for Botox, we continue to advance our novel toxin pipeline. We recently announced positive top line results from two Phase 3 trials evaluating BoNT/E, our rapid onset, short-acting novel toxin in glabellar lines. BoNT/E performed very well in both studies meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints compared to placebo. BoNT/E was well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. We're very pleased with these results, which demonstrate this toxin's rapid onset of action and short duration of effect. Patients treated with BoNT/E showed an improvement in glabellar lines as early as 8 hours following injection and a duration of effect of 2 to 3 weeks. This highly differentiated clinical profile could offer patients a novel option compared to currently available neurotoxins. We plan to complete the remaining development work over the course of the next few quarters and anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the second half of next year. So in summary, we continue to make good progress across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to several more important milestones in the remainder of this year, including Phase 2 data for Teliso-V and second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Phase 2 proof-of-concept data for our anti-IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody, lutikizumab in hidradenitis suprativa, and regulatory approval in Europe for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa, carbidopa delivery system for advanced Parkinson's disease. We also plan to submit updated 951 data in the U.S. near the end of the year.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. 
Scott Reents : Thank you, Tom. I'm very pleased with the momentum of our business. The strong performance we are demonstrating from our ex Humira growth platform continues to support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook.  Starting with our third quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.04 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance and down 5.8% on an operational basis excluding a 0.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect double-digit sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform.  The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.7% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.4% of sales acquired IP R&D expense of 0.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.9% of sales. Net interest expense was $398 million. The adjusted tax rate was 15.7%.  Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $11.19 and $11.23. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the fourth quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $54 billion, an increase of $600 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% and unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. The updated revenue forecast contemplates a full year sales increase of $300 million roughly split evenly between Skyrizi and Rinvoq, reflecting strong uptake in IBD. The remaining $300 million full year sales increase is primarily attributed to better-than-expected performance of international Humira and Restasis.  Moving to the P&L. We continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of roughly $1.7 billion. And we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.5%, reflecting IP R&D occurred through the third quarter.  Turning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.87 and $2.91. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated more than $16.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow which is net of approximately $1.1 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments in the first 9 months of the year.  And our cash balance at the end of September was approximately $13.3 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we announced a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payment in February of 2024, and we remain on track to achieve by the end of this year, $34 billion of cumulative debt paydown since the Allergan transaction, maintaining a net leverage ratio around 1.8x. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Liz. 
Liz Shea : Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we'll take the first question, please. 
Operator: First question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. 
Chris Shibutani : The 2024 earnings guidance, it seems as if you were quite confident heading in that $11 floor. As we await further details from top line and other margin structures, can you maybe identify some of the key push pulls that actually gave you that conviction to go to above and where directionally we should be thinking about the source of further growth on the forward? 
Rob Michael : Chris, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So since we provided that guidance in February, recall we gave a $10.70 EPS floor to really help investors model earnings regardless of whether the trough recurred in '23 or '24 we've raised growth platform sales by $1.4 billion covering immunology, neuroscience and aesthetics. We're seeing the IBD indications for Skyrizi and Rinvoq very nicely, and we continue to capture more share in their other indications, both Vraylar and our migraine portfolio have outperformed our share forecast and the strong recovery of Botox has led us to raise guidance for aesthetics twice this year. So given the clear over-performance of the growth platform, we decided to raise the floor to $11 ex IPR&D. We hope this provides investors the view of the low end of the 2024 guidance range and also confirms that '24 will indeed be the trough year. And given that we expect to deliver a high single-digit CAGR from '24 to the end of the decade, it should allow investors to value the company with a better growth multiple. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mohit Banse with Wells Fargo. 
Mohit Bansal : And I have a question regarding aesthetic. So it seems like you are keeping the guidance here. So the first part of the question is it seems like across the board, there is a 10% quarter-over-quarter decline on all the products. Can you help us understand what's happening sequentially? And then if you are keeping the guidance, it seems like there would be quite a bump in fourth quarter. So how should we think about that? 
Rob Michael : Maybe I'll start -- this is Rob. I'll start with your question. So one thing to keep in mind is that we mentioned in the last call that we had some dynamics in the international market when you look at the growth rates where we had more difficult comparison because of some of the -- some stocking that occurred in the prior year, that's something to keep in mind. We also do have a certain amount of seasonality that occurs in our business in the U.S. in particular. So those are things to keep in mind. I'd say as we look at it, we're very encouraged by the return to growth of the U.S. toxin market.  Botox is performing very well, and we're certainly doing a very nice job maintaining our share position despite competitive pressure. So I'd say we're very pleased there. I'd say on fillers, what we're seeing is probably more of a lag in the recovery. And if we've studied this market historically, we do tend to see a lag and that's really relative to thinking about the price point for fillers versus toxins. It's natural to assume that the recovery will take a little bit longer. So we are seeing that recovery take a little bit longer. We're still very, very encouraged by the trends we're seeing. We're very excited about the new fillers we've launched, both SkinVive and Volux. We're starting to see some nice share momentum come from those new introductions. And so from that standpoint, we feel very good. And then as we've been monitoring the situation in China, as all of you I'm sure have been watching very carefully. We saw, as you recall, a very strong recovery in the first half of the year. We've seen it moderate, and we're keeping a close eye on that. And so that's something we're obviously paying a lot of attention to. Now we look at the rest of the international business, it's growing nicely. And so as I think about the guidance for this year, I'd say we're fairly close. We're not overly concerned. We don't adjust guidance for plus or minus $100 million. If it was greater than that, we would consider it. So that's something to keep in mind. But as we look at this, the long-term outlook for this business, we're very confident. When you think about the U.S. toxin market, it's historically grown in the mid-teens and it's still heavily underpenetrated in the low single digits.  And market growth is really the key to deliver on our long-term outlook. We've seen this market rebound very strongly following a period of economic pressure, and we've demonstrated time and again that we can increase new patient starts for our promotional efforts. And something I think probably isn't appreciated is that we do have several innovations that can accelerate that growth. And when you think about the master and platysma indications for Botox, those can each add a few hundred million dollars. Our novel short-acting toxin BoNT/E has the potential to activate new patients that could really drive an inflection in market growth. As you think about one of the biggest barriers for new patients is fear of an unnatural look, and the short-acting toxin opportunity is a great way to unlock that. And then if you look at our regenerative fillers pipeline, those are aimed at providing both short- and long-term treatment benefits for consumers.  And as I mentioned, we're also very excited about the new fillers we've launched both SkinVive and Volux. So with this business, you see us go through some cycles with economic pressure. But over the long term, we feel very confident that we can certainly deliver very robust growth and deliver on that real than $9 billion expectation for 2029. 
Rick Gonzalez : Lee, this is Rick. The other thing that you're looking at sequentially, you have to keep in mind is we do Botox today in the fourth quarter. So that elevates revenue in the fourth quarter, and that occurs every year. So if you're looking at third quarter to fourth quarter and trying to understand why is there a big step up, part of that step-up is that. 
Liz Shea : Operator next question please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Schott : Just maybe a two-parter really focused on immunology for 2024. So maybe first on Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I guess, with more of the '24 formula discussions complete, we're seeing some great volume trends. But are you still comfortable that we should expect more normalized price erosion for those two products versus the high single digits we're seeing this year? And then the second one was on Humira for 2024. And I think, Rob, you might have commented last quarter of your comfort with where consensus sits. And again, maybe a similar question with maybe more color about formulary for next year. Is that something you're still comfortable? And just how should we think about dynamics there? 
Jeff Stewart : Yes. It's Jeff. I'll take the first question. Yes, we're very comfortable as we see things start to evolve and close here as we move into 2024. I mean if you think about all the indications that we've had 7 over the last 18 months, I highlighted in my remarks, 9 head-to-head trials. We're just a very, very nice position for Skyrizi and Rinvoq as we move into '24 to continue some very strong momentum that we're seeing in the actual. So quite confident in terms of how we're looking at that. And to your key point there on the price, we continue to see that we're not going to have a repeat of what we saw this year. And remember, the background there were those 7 indications that came very fast all on top of each other. And so that was the root cause of that -- of those concessions that won't repeat. Next year, we have really one more big indication, not 7, and that's Skyrizi you see that Tom highlighted. So we'll see the normalized price erosion more in line with industry forms versus what we saw this year. 
Rob Michael : And then, Chris, this is Rob. On HUMIRA, I think if you think about the annualization rebates that given the rest increase in the second half of this year, so you have an annualization impact, and the additional rebates to secure parity access next year, really price should be the main driver of the erosion in '24. I mean volume will have an impact, particularly in wax sensitive accounts, but price will make up the vast majority of the erosion next year. And while we're not giving '24 guidance today, as you've mentioned, Chris, I've highlighted the average, it was about $7 billion when I mentioned that was a reasonable expectation for U.S. Humira next year. Now there are a few animals who have forecasted U.S. Humira above $8 billion next year, which is just not a reasonable expectation given the price dynamic. 
Operator: Next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. 
Terence Flynn : Obviously, you guys are very well positioned coming out of the Humira LOE in terms of the growth franchise. But I think there's focus from investors on maybe bolstering the pipeline. So as you guys think about M&A and business development, maybe you could just walk us through your latest thoughts and anything in terms of therapeutic areas of interest and stated development. 
Rick Gonzalez : Okay. Terence, this is Rick. I'll cover it. That question for you. Yes, I think as we look at the business, as Rob indicated, we're extremely comfortable with how the growth platform is performing. And I'd say how we're managing the biosimilar erosion, which gives us a lot of confidence that we can deliver this high single-digit going forward. From '25 -- going forward through the end of the decade. So I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at, and we're in a fortunate position from that standpoint. There are many companies in our sector we need to go out and do lots of BD to be able to drive the growth that they're trying to achieve. We're not in that position. But I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at is we're looking to add assets that could give us incremental pipeline and revenue growth towards the end of this decade and into the 30s. That's what our -- the bulk of our focus is on. .  And I'd say if I look at AbbVie's track record, certainly, BD has been a critical part of how we've grown this company over the last 11 years. And I'd say, for the most part, we have done a pretty good job when we acquire assets and bring them in we can make them perform quite well. Skyrizi is a good example of that. Certainly, Allergan was another good example of that, and there are many others. So I'd say we value BD as a very important tool and how we should grow the business and how we should position our leadership positions in these franchises. Our primary focus is within the franchises that we're operating in. So let's take immunology as an example.  I would say our greatest focus in immunology is to continue to add additional mechanisms in particular, that could be used in combination in order to create deeper levels of clinical response in areas like IBD, rheumatology and other areas. So we continue to look for those. We have several already that are in development now, like Luti, like RIPK1 and several others in our pipeline, but we'll continue to look for additional assets that we could add to that. And like I said, especially focused on combination therapy because we think that is the way to get much deeper clinical remission or responses in those patients who aren't responding to things like Skyrizi, Rinvoq, which obviously performed exceptionally well.  So that's a big area. Oncology is another big area. We have a high level of interest in next-generation CAR-T technology. We have a high level of interest in T cell engagers beyond our BCMA product. I think as we look at that asset continue to develop, we are very convinced it has a best-in-class profile. And it shows us that for the right indication, T cell engagers can be extremely effective, and they're much easier to use and can be much more broadly brought to patients and CAR-Ts, at least the current version of CAR-Ts. So I'd say that's an area that we have a high level -- in psychiatry, we're interested in additional assets in anxiety and mood, and a variety of other assets, but that gives you some feel for it. And we obviously have the financial wherewithal to go out and do transactions. We need to make sure we find the right transaction. So it's a value-enhancing asset for the company. And when we find them, we will act on and we will act on quickly. 
Operator: Next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. 
Alice Nettleton : This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. A question on obesity and its interface with I&I and a lot of other drug categories, frankly, are views that payers have to cover OBD medicines. And if that's correct, it's a big expense, and payers will be looking for offsets. One-off that would be for payers to squeeze other therapeutic areas as hard as they can. An example could be I&I, where there's now a really good product, your own HUMIRA at a much lower price. So we're wondering how much payers might start to force a step edit for products like Skyrizi? It's a relevant question because yesterday, one of the issues Bristol noted with its TYK2 product is step edits and they cite biosimilar Humira as the reason. 
Jeff Stewart : Thank you for the question. It's Jeff. And I think you've got to take a step back regardless of the obesity issues and think about the overall strategy that we pursued, which was 1 of fundamental distinction. And I'll take your point over some of these head-to-head trials, and there's 9 of them, right? So if you take Skyrizi, just in psoriasis, we have gross superiority versus every mechanism in the category. So a head-to-head of gross superiority versus Humira versus the leading IL-17 COSENTYX versus the oral Otezla, and we also have versus Stelara. So fundamentally, when payers think about stepping or not stepping or how they would think about that, there's a medical dynamic there and that distinctiveness that we have across our program is very, very important to help manage maybe the urge of the payers to think of formulary structures like that. If you think about your comments that you have -- that you heard yesterday or the day before, that's a very different dynamic.  I mean, if you're not that different or you have the same efficacy as a Humira, it's not going to go that well on some of these formularies. And so I think you got to take a step back and look at the fundamental distinctiveness that we have on both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And I think my last comment would be, let's take Reno, which is growing very fast, 60%, okay? All of that is in the second-line plus setting. So from a strategic standpoint, it's already stepped. And so when you take a look at those dynamics, we remain quite confident that as we rely on the power of raising the standard of care, that will help us navigate any of these scenarios, whether it's related to obesity or not. 
Operator: Next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. 
Vamil Divan : I mean, transit right now. But the two questions I have actually, one is maybe building on Terence's question around business development base in the pipeline. I think we get a lot of other questions just around sort of the underappreciated assets within your pipeline. I don't know if you can maybe just comment on that. I know there's a couple of assets that you plan out things people are overlooking where they might be some underappreciated upside? And then the second one is just on the charge you took today or this quarter on Imbruvica regarding the Medicare drug pricing program.  And obviously, I understand why you did. I'm curious on the amount and the timing of why you're doing now, I suppose I may be willing to see how the losses play out or negotiation process plays out. And then in terms of the amount or how you -- what your assumptions were that you can share on the competitive dynamics for sort of what you're assuming around the impact this program would have on the pricing of Imbruvica…? 
Rick Gonzalez : Divan, this is Rick. I'll take the first question, and then Scott will take the second question. So on the pipeline, I think as I look at the pipeline and how we built the pipeline and how it's playing out, I think -- I don't know that I would call it underappreciated because you don't necessarily have access to all the data that we have on some of these programs. But we obviously invested significantly over the last several years in rapidly developing the indications for Rinvoq and Skyrizi and a lot of our focus had been built around that. But in parallel, we were advancing a number of other programs along the way.  And I would say the investment that we made on Skyrizi and Rinvoq are pretty clear the kind of return that we are getting for those assets. I mean, they're growing at a phenomenal rate. In fact, in the not-too-distant future, the combination of those two products on a running rate basis will be larger than Humira, to give you some idea of how rapidly those products are growing and how large they are. But if I look at our pipeline, the real meaningful programs that we have in our pipeline that will be true needle movers for the company, there are several of them that are advancing now I think we have a high level of confidence in 400, our topo warhead platform with our c-Met version of that, we're seeing very encouraging data in CRC. We'll follow that with non-small cell lung cancer. And that platform is demonstrating to us that it is a broad-based platform that we can expand to a number of other areas. And that should be a fairly significant opportunity for us going forward. Later sort of the '27, '28 timeframe, I think it's going well have meaningful benefit play through. And then I'd say the second one is 383, our BCMA bispecific. As we indicated earlier, we're seeing more and more data out of that program that clearly tells us this has a best-in-class profile, high levels of efficacy and very good safety and very convenient dosing.  We think it has that ideal profile to be able to enter this market. And as you know, multiple myeloma is a very large market. There are very significant products in this market. So those are two opportunities. I would obviously say, $16 million. And some of our TA programs are also exciting programs that are running in parallel to these. We'll be getting more data on those next year. And I think those have significant opportunities as well. The third program I talked about is in our eye care business. It's our REGENXBIO program for both wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. We're seeing some very, very encouraging data out of that program, and that could be a nice opportunity for us as well, and it continues to advance. So there are a number of important programs that you'll start to see more and more data as we go through '24 and into '25 that I think will give the market an opportunity to be able to better assess those. 
Scott Reents: Vam, this is Scott. With respect to your question on the Imbruvica charge. So I think a couple of things. As we have signaled in some of our regulatory filings, our last 10-Q, for instance, we had indicated that if we were to be selected in the negotiation process under the Inflation Reduction Act, that there would likely trigger an impairment. And so we had anticipated that this would be happy. And so the timing really relates to the fact that under the rules, you have to look at the fair value of that intangible asset with respect to future cash flows. And so the accounting rules would require that we would make that analysis upon selection as we had kind of previewed in our filings. And so we went through the process under that triggering event to determine what the impairment should be. And I would say that when you look at that impairment, the magnitude of the impairment is driven by a number of factors, but really, one of the biggest factors that you're seeing there is it requires you to discount the future cash flow. So as we calculate the future cash flows, looked at what we had assumed was a reasonable assumption on the price, you discount those back. And so that creates part of the magnitude of this adjustment. In terms of the negotiated price that we assumed, I think we're in the middle of these negotiations, and it really wouldn't be appropriate for us to talk about what that is. But we looked at a number of factors, and we think that process is going to play out. Certainly, we will see on February 1 in a private conversation with CMS what they anticipate at least an initial thought on price, but it won't be finalized until September 1 of next year. And so we will see what that price is as the process plays out. 
Operator: Next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. 
Steve Scala : I have two questions and one clarification. First, a clarification. Is the base year for the high single-digit revenue growth to the end of the decade? Is the base year 2023 -- or excuse me, 2024 or 2025. I think it's '25, but maybe you can clarify that. Second, given AbbVie's stated interest in building the oncology business, I assume that AbbVie took a hard look at the ADC deal that Merck signed with Daiichi. I'm just curious what about it didn't you like -- was it the profile of the products? Was it the price? Or do you feel you have everything you need already? And then the last question is at least 1 other company has changed its tax rate guidance stemming from a recent IRS document clarifying Section 174 tax legislation. Do you have any perspective on this update and why it doesn't impact AbbVie? 
Rob Michael : Steve, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So the base year is '24. And if you think about it, we signaled that we expect to return a robust growth in '25. And so that high single-digit CAGR really would pick up that first year of robust growth of 25%. If you start in '25, you miss that your growth. So our intention has always been '24 is a base year and that high single-digit CAGR starts from '24 to the end of the decade. 
Rick Gonzalez : Steve, this is Rick. I'll take the second question. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on whether we looked at that same transaction and that probably wouldn't be appropriate. But what I can tell you is we knew it was there. So maybe that gives you some idea of our perspective on it. But the reality is, we believe we have what we need with 400. We believe that platform, and we own that platform, we developed it internally. We give us everything that we need in that area. And so it wasn't something that we were looking at. Scott? 
Scott Reents : Yes. It's Scott. So with respect to the tax legislation, I certainly when can talk about what our facts are. But when we've looked at -- certainly, this results out of tax reform legislation a few years ago. The tax rules, there's always a little bit of uncertainty. And what happened this quarter, there was guidance that came out that, I would say, clarified a certain approach in treatment. Prior to that guidance, though, there was a little bit of a diversity of opinion amongst advisors as to -- and ourselves as to how we might implement. So I would tell you that we were already implementing consistent with how that guidance ultimately came out, and that's why you're not seeing any impact to us on our tax rate. 
Operator: The next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. 
Gary Nachman : So first, back to the trough raise in 2024. How are you thinking about spending levels for both SG&A and R&D into the trough year next year to set up for growth in '21 and beyond? Do you have a better sense of where the operating margin might end up next year? And then secondly, Scares and Rinvoq have been doing very well in the IBD indications talk about how much headroom you see for those products in UC and Crohn's with that landscape likely getting more competitive in the coming years? And any updated thoughts on 2025 guidance for those products? 
Scott Reents: Gary, it's Scott. I'll start with your question regarding operating margin. So when we've looked at the operating margins we talked about in the past, for '23 and '24, we talked about those being very, very similar. So when you think about the operating margin that we've talked about for this year and next year, it's really about 46% to 47% range. This year, our guidance is 46.5% and we would expect operating margin in '24 to be very similar to what we're seeing this year. And then I think as a result, roughly the gross margin is going to be in line in '24 with what we're seeing this year as well as the expense profile. So very consistent with this year. And of course, we'll refine that when we come out with guidance. 
Jeff Stewart : Yes. This is Jeff. I'll highlight the -- your comment on the head space and IBD. I mean the IBD market is very, very attractive. If we think back historically, we were always, frankly, a little surprised at how fast Humira back in the day grew when we started to achieve the UC and the Chrome's indications. And again, I would say we're very, very pleasantly encouraged about the momentum. The momentum is very, very significant. So there is significant headroom. And what we see in the market dynamic is that unlike what you might think that patients would always want to rotate off of their medications because of the severity of the disease, actually physicians haven't been able to really move the market very much over the years, simply because it's very dangerous to try to go to another drug that hasn't provided any increase in benefit for those patients. It puts those patients at risk. So when you look at what Tom had highlighted, our ability with two complementary assets -- for example, in the U.S., Skyrizi position in the early lines, Rinvoq position in later lines, both of which have exceptional performance criteria versus the market. That gives us a lot of confidence. The other thing that gives us a lot of confidence because there will be more competitive entries in the future is we think our profiles are going to hold up exceptionally well. And then there's the commercial executional component in most of the countries around the world, we have dual sales forces that basically will carry two products with four big indications. So our ability to compete in the market for share even as it gets a little more competitive over time, is still going to be very, very strong. So lots of headroom in the market, lots of unmet need in the market, and we believe we have the best position in the market for the foreseeable future. 
Rob Michael : And Gary, this is Rob. On your question regarding 2025 guidance, we do periodically update the long-term guidance for our portfolio. We're obviously very pleased with the momentum we're seeing both from Skyrizi and RNA, particularly in -- if you recall when we provided -- last time we provided guidance for Skyrizi, we had about $2.5 billion of revenue in IBD in 2025 and it was $1.8 billion for Rinvoq. And those are obviously ramping very nicely. We have a lot of confidence. We periodically update that guidance, we'll find the right time to provide a holistic update to our long-term guy. But clearly, the momentum is there. And the Street reflects that, too. I mean if I look at consensus, not for Skyrizi, I think it's around $11 billion. So it's $1 billion higher than our 2025 guide. So I think the market is recognizing the strong momentum, and we'll update that long-term guide holistically at the appropriate time. 
Operator: Next question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. 
Luisa Hector : To continue with IBD, I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the AbbVie pipeline emerging behind Skyrizi and Rinvoq and how we think about that and maybe potential combinations with Skyrizi? And with the recent competitor launch in psoriasis with a label where the FDA has asked to mention anti-TNF safety warnings. I wondered whether the FDA has mentioned anything to you about the review of labor in that regard. . 
Roopal Thakkar: It's Roople. I'll take the IBD question. So you've heard already some mention of Lutikizumab. That's our IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody. That's an in-house antibody. And we have observed data where there's resistance to anti-TNF and other biologics with patients with 1 beta signal. So we'll be entering into ulcerative colitis looking at a potential biomarker approach. But in addition to that, we will also be looking at a set of combinations as was already mentioned, for example, with Skyrizi, we have Lutikizumab. We have other agents as well. RIPK1 was also mentioned. There's also some partnerships that we have is another mechanism we're interested in. And another one I'll mention is an IL-2 mutein. All of these are under assessment. And we do believe either you find a biomarker approach where you can see the high efficacy or if you want to see real transformational efficacy, you're going to have to go a combination approach. So those are the assets we'll be looking at. Now moving on to the question, I think it was around depression and suicidal ideation if I heard it correctly. This was in an IL-17 class agent that was recently approved. We've also observed a similar warning and precaution previously also in the IL-17 class. In fact, that previous asset, in fact, had a REMS in place. Remember, Skyrizi is an anti-IL-23 very different class. And to date, with all the data that's been generated across numerous indications, we don't see that type of signal at all nor do we have any of that in our label.  And as we look at psoriasis therapy, that particular agent that's been mentioned has been available in Europe and our physicians really don't tell us that there's much of an uptake there. So Skyrizi continues to perform well. Also, our label does not have the high rate of fungal infections that have been observed with the new 1 in the '17 class -- and also, we've talked a lot about IBD. We -- the Skyrizi doesn't also lead to IBD, which is another risk for the IL-17 class. And also with our dosing regimen -- you get it at 0 and week 4, and then it's quarterly after that. With the new one, I think there's 5 doses that are required and potentially every 8 weeks or in heavier patients every 4 weeks. So we're very confident in Skyrizi's position across indications, especially in psoriasis. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. 
David Risinger : Upon your vision for oncology, clearly, the company has compelling assets. But in light of an increasingly complex and competitive oncology landscape, could you just paint a picture of how you see your portfolio evolving and opportunities to acquire assets when it may be difficult to see what's around the corner from, let's say, an emerging oncology competitor in 3 to 4 years? 
Tom Hudson : This is Tom Hudson. We've been -- we certainly -- when we talk about 400, we're also talking about going in different space than lung and breast, where there's a lot of competition, like colon cancer, gastric cancer, pancreas. So c-Met is a target that's expressed in many other tumors, and that's why we've developed this with topo warhead, so we can go to a broader set of tumors. And that's where we're seeing a very good data with ABBV-400 even unselected patient population, third line plus, we saw a 22% response versus 2% to 3%. What's also interesting about this is -- it's not just for colon cancer, but most chemos, most treatments and GI tumors have a lot of toxicity, a lot of diarrhea.  And one of the things that excite the clinicians about this program is actually a very low rate of diarrhea. So what makes that not only can we see some efficacy in third line, but it sees we can move to earlier lines and combined with other therapies have higher efficacy. So there's a lot of unmet need in GI tumors. And so this data, again, we're going to have more data in our next cohort at the end of this year. In CRC will have different doses, and we'll also have potential cutoffs of biomarkers. So moving very well, but we're actually in a big space, in GI tumors, as I've mentioned, even our GARP program, also where we've shown the best data is in liver cancer, where c-Met is also expressed. We have opportunities to go explore places where there's a big unmet need and the competition is not the same. Now the other targets because we talked about topo platform. We have others, 706, which is already in the clinic with 6. Next year, we'll be going to 2 other indications, which for which there's less competition in terms of ADC space. So our strategy is actually to go and bring this in offering to a lot more cancer patients. I'll stop there, and I'll stop there. 
Roopal Thakkar : It's Roopal. Let me add on a little bit. I think you may be also reflecting on some of the ESMO data that came out I will mention long a little bit, we still see an opportunity with Teliso-V. We're going to get data later this year. But what we've already observed is 50% ORRs in a biomarker-selected population in the EGFR wild type. If you look at some of the data that has come out, the ORRs are probably right around 20% to 30%. We don't have all the breakdown of all the different lung subtypes. But 1 approach is to use a biomarker and then select the patient population rather than going so broadly that was observed at ESMO. The other thing I would say reflecting on the data that came out, if you looked at EGFR mutants in lung, you see some higher levels of efficacy, either in the frontline or second line in that space. But that comes at a cost, and that's a chemo-like adverse event profile. And those are things like nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue. These are things that you may see slight increases in efficacy, but clearly, patients don't want that. And like -- as Tom was mentioning with our platform and including Teliso-V, we have an opportunity there in the mutant side to combine with osimertinib, which has a nice profile. And those mutant patients when they progress, half of them have highly expressed c-Met. So that's where a combo looks good. And then we're also seeing 50% ORR in that segment as well. And we have a plan to get into Phase 3 into that next year. And then as we think about heme, we spoke about 383, which we feel has best-in-class potential. And one of the things that we're observing with that one is the high level of efficacy. [PRFs], we're driving down past grade 3 and now driving down to get past grade 2.  So that enables the potential where you may not need hospitalization. And what you see now with the BCMA dual engagers is not just hospitalization but a REMS. And what we would add to that is dose spacing potentially every other month. So that one is a very nice profile, and we're moving into Phase 3 with that one, and we continue to conduct a variety of combinations there so we can move into earlier lines of therapy in multiple myeloma. We are still moving into earlier lines in Phase 3s with EPKINLY in heme, which is another dual engager. We have an asset called 453, which is our next-gen BCL2 blocker. And then we have a BTK degrader called 101 that's also in clinic. So quite a comprehensive approach across oncology. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. 
Geoff Meacham : Just have a couple of quick ones, one on immunology. So you guys have evaluated the impact from Humira biosimilars beyond even 25%, is it your view that tail revenues are likely to be better than you initially modeled. And what, if anything, do Stelara, the delay in Stelara biosimilars impact this. And the second question, just on capital deployment. Just given your higher guidance, I know you guys just raised the dividend, but would you also say that the deal capacity is higher. I know you recently raised kind of M&A range and wondering if that's even going higher. 
Jeff Stewart : Yes. Geoff, it's Jeff here. And we continue to study the tail. I mean it's something that we're -- we look very closely at -- we continue to think that the Humira tail will emerge sometime in '25 or '26. And that's looking at some of the international analogs, how we think we see pricing may move I mean the one thing that we do believe is that you're not going to have a small molecule like tail, which is virtually nothing. There's going to be a sub-segment of patients that are going to stay on Humira. It's going to be modest, whether it's low price or low volume, but it will be there even in an interchangeable world. We don't necessarily believe that since we've outperformed here in volume in '23 that that's going to fundamentally change our view on the tail at this point. And again, we're still highlighting that. In terms of Stelara, obviously, we think in the U.S. that will not come until -- and I think it was recently confirmed this week until sometime in '25. And so overall, we think that's a modest net positive for AbbVie in terms of how that may play out. But that's not the primary driver of our strategy. Our primary driver of the strategy is how distinctive we are across our indications with Skyrizi versus Stelara, which I've already highlighted. So I hope that helps. 
Rob Michael : And Jeff, this is Rob. You're right. We did lift the cap. We had put that $2 billion BD cap in place, although we are rapidly paying down debt. And we lifted that at the beginning of this year because we essentially -- by the end of this year, we're going to have paid off all the incremental financing from the Allergan transaction. As Scott mentioned, our net leverage ratio is around 1.8x. And I have said previously that as long as we're going to pass back to 2x that leverage in 2 to 3 years, that's the way we're thinking about balance sheet capacity. So as we look at it, there's nothing from a balance capacity standpoint that would limit us today for pursuing the opportunities we'd be interested in. So that's not a limiting factor. And to the extent that we continue to raise guidance and perform more strongly. That just means there's even more capacity. But there's -- at this point, that's not a rate limiter for the types of opportunities we'd be interested in. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. 
Evan Seigerman : Congrats on a progress. I just wanted to touch on the dividend growth. So at first line, it seems that your dividend growth, while impressive, is slowing a bit relative to other recent periods. Maybe you could help us understand kind of what's driving this dynamic at play? Is it concerns around near-term performance of key products you Humira erosion continuing next year? Or are you preserving capital for you to help further? Maybe some color on that would be very helpful. 
Rob Michael : So Evan, it's Rob. If you think about it, we're delivering dividend growth both in '23 and '24, while earnings are not growing, right? So then you look at the payout ratio we're at, we're going to be in the mid-50s. And we have said that over the long term, if you look at just across the industry as well, I'd say a good target is in, say, the mid- to high 40% payout ratio, which would mean that during this period where you see our payout ratio go up in the future, we're very committed to growing the dividend. We'll continue to grow the dividend, but we would expect then earnings would grow faster than dividend increases. So I would say we've gone through this period for a couple of years where we are still delivering a very nice dividend growth despite earnings declining. But given our commitment to that dividend, we're going to continue growing it. We'll likely see it step up from here, but not at the same rate as earnings growth because that payout ratio right now will be sitting in. So that's the way we think about it. Over the long term, we want to deliver a healthy, sustainable, growing dividend. And so we have a long view on this, and we are committed to delivering that growth to investors. And so that's the way we're thinking about it. We're going through a period of a couple of years here where earnings aren't growing. And then we see us return a robust growth, we'll step up that dividend again, but it's -- that's a dynamic that we're balancing here. 
Operator: Our last question comes from [Jon Hung] with UBS. 
Unidentified Analyst: I've got two. Just one confirmation on the trough and then one on aesthetics. So -- on the trough in '24, you mentioned that costs you will have the same margin in '24 is '23. So is it going to be a trough year on sales rather than the trough being driven by costs? And then second, again, just lots of noise on GLP-1s impacting aesthetics. You've commented before on fillers and Ozempic face in the past, but there's potential impact on body scope in -- is this actually anything that you're seeing coming through yet in the sales? And overall, is this trend a net positive or a net negative for you? 
Rob Michael : This is Rob. So clearly, we've communicated a floor for earnings. And Scott previously mentioned that I expect a similar level of operating margin year-over-year. And so you can model the sales accordingly. It should be fairly clear. 
Rick Gonzalez : Operating margin profile. 
Rob Michael : Operating margin profile, yes. So we said the 46% to 47% is the way to think about operating margin profile in '23 and '24. We've given you the $11 EPS ex IPR&D as a floor for next year. So I was just using those parameters to model revenue. . 
Rick Gonzalez : Carrie? 
Carrie Strom : And this is Carrie. For your question around the weight loss products and the impact on the aesthetics business, I mean as we look at the long-term view of this market, we continue to think that anything that gets a subset of patients engaged in their appearance, which these weight loss products can do, that is a positive tailwind for our business. And we hear that from our customers and many of our customers are bringing these GLP-1s into their practice, and they see it as a natural opportunity to cross-sell. Now that said, in the short term, especially in an environment where discretionary spending is pressured and there could be trade-offs for higher-priced products such as fillers or body contouring. Now we're not necessarily seeing that as a driver.  Right now, what we're seeing is the broader macroeconomic dynamics. But in the short term, that could be a trade-off in terms of share of wallet. But absolutely long term, this is something that is going to help patients get engaged in aesthetics and be an opportunity for cross-selling. 
Liz Shea : And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us. . 
Operator: Thank you, and that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President and Chief Financer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.  Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. 
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 is an important year for AbbVie as we experience Humira biosimilar competition in the U.S. market, and as we execute our long-term diversification growth strategy. Now roughly seven months into the year, I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making against these objectives. The U.S. Humira biosimilar impact is playing out as projected and slightly better than our planning assumptions. We are competing very effectively with the various biosimilar offerings. We have exceeded our guidance in burst in second quarters with the overachievement predominantly driven by our growth platform, the base portfolio, excluding Humira which, as you know, is the critical driver in our rapid return to growth in 2025 and beyond. To that point, this platform demonstrated operational revenue growth of nearly 8% this quarter with growth expected to further accelerate in the second half of this year. We are also once again raising our full year revenue guidance by $1 billion, which is on top of the $400 million sales increase we delivered in the first quarter for a total overachievement of $1.4 billion. And lastly, we are making good progress with our pipeline, across all stages of development, including recent strong data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis as well as the recent U.S. approvals for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease and Epkinly in relapsed or refractory DLBCL, both important new therapies for patients. So in summary, I'm extremely pleased with the strong momentum and execution across the business. It reinforces our confidence in our ability to return to robust growth in 2025 with high single-digit compounded growth rate to the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob? 
Rob Michael: Thank you, Rick. AbbVie delivered excellent results once again this quarter. We are demonstrating strong execution across our business with each of our five key therapeutic areas beating expectations. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance with the vast majority of the beat coming from our ex Humira growth platform. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive growth with sales for both therapies up more than 50% versus the prior year. These two agents have achieved differentiated clinical profiles, including head-to-head data versus Humira and other novel therapies. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are now collectively approved across 10 large indications, and we are forecasting combined revenue growth of more than $3.5 billion this year. With ongoing programs in several additional disease areas, we expect both Skyrizi and Rinvoq to deliver robust growth into the next decade and significantly exceed Humira peak revenue. U.S. Humira is also performing well. The first half erosion coming in better than our expectations due to volume. We have been carefully analyzing the biosimilar marketplace, where the total number of competitors has now expanded to 8. While many of these biosimilars have been added to payer formularies, Humira continues to maintain strong parity access. Based on the volume trends and parity access, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, an improvement of two points versus our original guidance. Neuroscience is another area that is outperforming expectations. Based on the current run rate, this portfolio is now on pace to add more than $1 billion of incremental revenue this year. with continued strong growth from Vraylar as well as our leading migraine portfolio. In aesthetics, the outlook continues to improve. We delivered positive growth this quarter, driven by strong international performance and stabilizing trends in the U.S. These positive trends give us the confidence to once again raise our full year guidance for aesthetics. And as a clear market leader, we are focused on expanding the aesthetics category with increased commercial investment and continued innovation to support robust long-term growth. Given the strong and balanced performance across our diverse portfolio, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. In closing, our operational execution has been outstanding, and we are very well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2023 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? 
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of $6.8 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi continues to perform exceptionally well. Global sales were approximately $1.9 billion, reflecting very strong operational growth of 51%. Our performance in psoriasis continues to be impressive. Total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market is now at 32%, double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. When you consider that Skyrizi is capturing roughly one out of two every in-play patient, which are either new to therapy or switching, there remains substantial opportunity for continued robust sales growth. And based on the available clinical data we are seeing from emerging competitive therapies in psoriasis, including orals, we feel very confident in Skyrizi's long-term potential with robust sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade. We are also seeing very nice prescription growth in psoriatic arthritis, especially in the U.S. dermatology segment where Skyrizi is approaching the leading new patient biologic market share. Skyrizi's momentum across psoriatic disease is very solid globally as well with total in-play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries. Turning now to IBD, where Skyrizi has demonstrated a very compelling clinical profile, including strong endoscopic data paired with convenient dosing. Uptake in Crohn's disease has been rapid, with total in-play patient share of approximately 25% in the U.S., roughly at parity leadership with Stelara. This uptake is very encouraging for Skyrizi's potential in ulcerative colitis, where we recently reported positive maintenance data with approval and commercialization anticipated next year. Given the momentum we are seeing across all of the approved indications, we will be raising our full year sales outlook for Skyrizi. Moving now to Rinvoq which delivered global sales of $918 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 57%. A key element of Rinvoq's success is its strong differentiation. It is now approved across seven distinct indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD as well as atopic dermatitis. It's the only potent daily oral medication with compelling head-to-head data against multiple novel therapies, including superiority to Humira in RA and Dupixent in AD. It's the only JAK inhibitor now approved to treat both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And we have established strong and broad commercial access for each of the core diseases with formulary coverage for Crohn's expected to ramp quickly over the next months. As it pertains to Rinvoq's book performance, we are seeing increasing prescriptions across each of the room indications globally, further market share momentum in atopic dermatitis, including now high-teens in-play patient share in the U.S. and robust uptake in IBD, where Rinvoq has demonstrated strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. Rinvoq is now capturing roughly one out of every four in-play ulcerative colitis patients in the second line plus setting. And the early data for Crohn's, which launched just in May, also shows a very strong ramp in new patient starts. We remained well positioned for continued momentum in this new indication as the only jack inhibitor approved to treat Crohn's disease.  This level of performance, along with the development of ongoing projects across several other diseases, such as giant cell arteritis and systemic lupus in rheumatology and multiple additional derm indications, reinforces the long-term potential for Rinvoq with strong sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade. Global Humira sales were $4 billion, down 24.8% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. remains slightly better than our expectations due to volume with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were approaching $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $907 million, down 20.8%, consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $571 million, up 15% on an operational basis with strong demand for both CLL and AML, and we are particularly pleased with the international performance here, following continued reimbursement progress in the EU and inclusion in China's national reimbursement list.  We also recently received the U.S. approval for Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL further expanding our on-market portfolio in hem onc. Early prescription trends have been encouraging, with a more robust opportunity expected as we progress development in earlier lines of therapy. We also anticipate approval and commercialization in Europe and Japan later this year. In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 14.2% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to exceed our expectations. Sales of $658 million were up 33.9% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications following the MDD approval late last year. Within migraine, we remain the clear market leader with unique treatment options for both acute and chronic conditions.  Our oral CGRP portfolio contributed $292 million in combined sales this quarter reflecting growth of more than 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $748 million, up 11.3% on an operational basis, reflecting nice momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. This franchise continues to outperform our expectations, and we will be raising our full year guidance for the collective neuroscience portfolio. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance and execution across the therapeutic portfolio with growth expected to accelerate through the second half of the year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? 
Carrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Second quarter global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.4 billion up 2.9% on an operational basis with strong performance from our international portfolio offsetting the economic impact in the U.S. U.S. aesthetic sales were $829 million, down 6.2%. Our U.S. portfolio continues to perform well from a competitive perspective. And as expected, the aesthetics markets continued to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures, which weighed on year-over-year growth rates. U.S. Botox cosmetic sales were $420 million, a decline of 6.5% versus the prior year. While the U.S. cosmetic toxin market declined low single digits in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, growth rates improved through the quarter, with June showing a return to positive year-over-year market growth.  Botox Cosmetic continues to be the clear market leader, maintaining strong and stable share despite new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $125 million, down 14.5% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see a more pronounced impact from inflationary dynamics on higher-priced, more deferrable procedures such as Filler. The U.S. Filler market declined approximately 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic metrics that we track for the U.S. have largely stabilized. Our consumer market research shows a meaningful recovery from last summer and those intending to get treated with toxins and fillers.  Additionally, we have now lapped the beginning of the market downturn, which occurred in the second quarter of last year. Based on these factors, we expect growth rates for the U.S. facial injectables to improve in the second half of this year. Our international aesthetics portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well with strong results in many key markets. Second quarter sales were $555 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 20%. The International Botox cosmetic sales of $265 million increased approximately 14% on an operational basis and International Juvederm sales were $243 million, up approximately 28% on an operational basis. Growth in the Asia Pacific region, particularly robust as aesthetic treatment rates in China have fully recovered to pre-COVID levels.  We continue to anticipate strong normalized growth through the remainder of the year in China. We are very pleased with the strong performance of our international aesthetics portfolio over the first half of the year and continue to expect similarly strong results in the second half. In the third quarter, we will be facing a challenging year-over-year comparison due to a shipment timing benefit we saw in the third quarter of 2022. This is expected to result in relatively flat growth for our international portfolio in the third quarter. On a full year basis, we expect our international aesthetics sales to grow high single digits. We continue to invest to drive future growth for our aesthetics portfolio with a focus on enhanced promotional activities, improve digital products and services through our Alle platform, sales force expansion, and injector training.  We continue to invest in our pipeline as well, and we remain committed to a regular cadence of new product introductions and indication expansions for Botox cosmetic and Juvederm. We recently announced the FDA approval of SkinVive, the first hyaluronic acid filler in the U.S. for improved skin smoothness of the cheeks, which, along with the recently launched Volux filler for jawline contouring, will help sustain our leadership position in the U.S. filler market. Our investments will allow us to maintain a strong leadership position in the highly underpenetrated and rapidly growing global aesthetics markets.  We remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio and continue to expect to deliver greater than $9 billion in 2029. In the near term, the improving aesthetics outlook in the U.S. and continued robust international performance gives us confidence to once again raise our full year aesthetics guidance with an expectation for continued operational growth over the back half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. 
Tom Hudson: Thank you, Carrie. We've continued to make very good progress with our pipeline over the quarter. We had a substantial amount of activity across our R&D pipeline, resulting in new approvals and advancements of several programs. In immunology, we received FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, marking its seventh FDA approval across gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology. In our Crohn's development program, Rinvoq demonstrated a very rapid and strong impact on symptoms as well as endoscopic improvement.  Given its strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients suffering from moderate to severe Crohn's disease. While Crohn's disease approval marks the completion of the core indications, we believe Rinvoq revokes the potential to become a highly effective therapy in several additional important diseases. We recently began Phase III studies for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, hidradenitis, suprativa, and we remain on track to begin Phase III studies in alopecia areata later this year.  We'll also see later this year from a Phase II study in vitiligo, which could support advancement to Phase III in this indication as well. Moving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced positive top line results from our Phase III maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis. In this study, Skyrizi met the primary and key secondary end points at week 52 compared to the withdrawal arm, demonstrating that patients continuing treatment with Skyrizi maintain high levels of clinical remission as well as more stringent endpoints such as endoscopic improvement, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement and steroid-free remission. It's important to note that approximately 75% of the patients in this study had failed advanced therapy, including not only anti-TNFs, but also other biologics, JAK inhibitors and S1P modulators. This represents a very difficult-to-treat population in ulcerative colitis. Skyrizi's strong performance in patients with and without failure to advanced therapies including patients who were naive to advanced therapy demonstrate its utility across the spectrum of moderate to severe UC patients.  We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the third quarter with approvals anticipated in 2024. We also recently published results from a head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Otezla in patients with moderate psoriasis with Skyrizi demonstrating clear superiority to Otezla on all primary and ranked secondary endpoints at week 16 and 52. At week 52 of this study, 64% of patients achieved absolute skin clearance as measured by PASI 100 an SPGA clear compared to just 3% for Otezla, underscoring Skyrizi's ability to drive very high and durable responses in these moderate patients. In addition to higher clinical efficacy outcomes, the patients treat with Skyrizi which is a self-injectable administered quarterly reported improvements in health-related quality of life measures and greater treatment satisfaction compared to those treated with Otezla, which is an oral administered twice daily.  Additionally, Skyrizi demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability compared to Otezla. The rates of adverse events, including serious and severe AEs were numerically higher with Otezla than with Skyrizi treatment. Previous to -- similar to previous studies, Otezla treatment was associated with high rates of gastrointestinal distress such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, which resulted in a 7% discontinuation rate in the first 16 weeks of treatment compared to no discontinuations for Skyrizi patients. We're incredibly pleased with these results, which further underscores Skyrizi's position as the best in category treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, providing very high efficacy, durable responses a safe and tolerable profile and convenient quarterly administration. In oncology, we received accelerated approval in the U.S. for Epkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who had received two or more systemic therapies.  We also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. DLBCL is a very aggressive disease where later-line patients have limited options. We're extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients. In the quarter, we also announced positive top line results from the follicular lymphoma cohort of a Phase II trial evaluating Epkinly in patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. In this study, Epkinly performed very well as a monotherapy, demonstrating an overall response rate of 82%. We are pleased with these results and plan to discuss these data with regulatory agencies about the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval. Beyond the mid-stage studies supporting accelerated approvals in later lines of therapy.  We also have Phase III trials ongoing in earlier lines of DLBCL and for follicular lymphoma, and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. In our navitoclax program, we recently saw top line results from the Phase III TRANSFORM one trial, evaluating navitoclax in combination with ruxolitinib in for patients with treatment naive myelofibrosis. This study met the primary endpoint at week 24, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients who achieved complete volume reduction of at least 35% compared to rux plus placebo. For the primary endpoint, the navitoclax combination showed a doubling of improvement over rux alone with 63% of patients on the navitoclax combination achieving SVR35 compared to 32% in the rux plus placebo combination.  In this study, the navitoclax combination did not achieve the first ranked secondary endpoint, which was improvement in total symptom score at week 24. Additional follow-up data on SVR and TSS as well as other endpoints are expected in the fourth quarter of this year. We plan to wait for these more mature data before engaging with regulatory agencies in order to have a more comprehensive picture of the patient's clinical response and clinical benefit that navitoclax can provide. Looking to the remainder of this year. We remain on track for several additional data readouts from our late-stage oncology programs, including Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with t(114) mutation. As a reminder, this is an event-driven study, and we're just waiting -- we're waiting for just a handful of remaining events. So, we'd expect to have these data in-house in the coming months.  And we remain on track to see Phase II data for Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer in the fourth quarter. We're also making very good progress with several earlier line, earlier stage solid tumor programs. We recently initiated a Phase II study for ABBV-151, our anti-GARP antibody in hepatocellular carcinoma and plan to begin Phase II in several additional solid tumors over the course of the next 12 months. At the recent ASCO meeting, we presented promising initial results from a Phase I study evaluating our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400 in several advanced solid tumor types. We're seeing responses across multiple tumors, indicating broad activity. Results in late-line colorectal patients were particularly encouraging, where monotherapy treatment with 400 resulted in a confirmed overall response rate of 22% well in excess of standard of care, which is typically less than 2% to 3%.  We're also encouraged by the durability of response seen in these early results. These patients had an average of five prior lines of therapy, so this level of efficacy is very encouraging. Based on these results, we plan to start our Phase II program later this year, beginning with a second line colorectal cancer study. Now moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter, we received a positive CHMP opinion recommending approval of atogepant for migraine prevention. We anticipate a decision in the coming months. And if approved, atogepant would be the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. This is a debilitating condition that impacts tens of millions of people in Europe, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. Also, in the area of neuroscience, ABBV-916, our A-beta antibody for Alzheimer's disease is rapidly advancing to dose escalation studies. This antibody is demonstrating a long half-life and very low antidrug antibodies, both important attributes to achieve a best-in-class profile for our A-beta antibody. Dose selection in Phase II is expected to begin early next year. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application for Botox in masseter muscle prominence in China, which is the initial focus for our program given the prevalence of masseter muscle prominence in Asian populations and a significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. In our platisima prominence program for Botox, we remain on track to see data from two additional Phase III studies later this year with our regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of the year. So, in summary, we had a very productive first half of the year across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to the second half of 2023 with several important clinical and regulatory milestones. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. 
Scott Reents: Thank you, Tom. I'm very pleased with the performance and outlook of the business, including the strong momentum from our ex-Humira growth plan. Starting with our second quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance and down 4.2% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.7% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect high single-digit sales growth from our growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 47% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.5% of sales, acquired IP R&D expense of 2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million, the adjusted tax rate was 15.8%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $53.4 billion, an increase of $1 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions with more than half of the sales improvement attributed to our ex-Humira growth platform. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $7.6 billion, an increase of $200 million due to continued strong performance across all approved indications. We now expect neuroscience sales of approximately $7.7 billion, an increase of $300 million, reflecting robust prescription growth for Vraylar following the MDD approval as well as better-than-expected performance of Botox Therapeutics and Qulipta. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.4 billion, an increase of $100 million, primarily reflecting momentum from Botox Cosmetic. Lastly, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, resulting in a sales guidance increase of $400 million based on volume trends and strong parity access. Moving to the P&L. We continue to anticipate adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales and now expect adjusted R&D expense of $6.9 billion, SG&A expense of $12.7 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. Turning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.7 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 40%. And rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.80 and $2.90. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered strong top and bottom line performance, and we are very pleased with the momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions in the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or 2. Operator, we'll take the first question, please. 
Operator: Vamil Divan, Guggenheim Securities. . 
Vamil Divan: So one, I'm just curious, given the strong quarter and the guidance raise, in terms of that you talked about your floor EPS, is that -- do you still see a floor of $10.70 or is it different? And can you talk anymore at this point or when you see that floor happening? And then my second question is around IRA, and you obviously a lot of focus there. I'm curious if you have any thoughts around what the first list of products around September 1. Are you expecting AbbVie products to be included in that first group of 10. And then infused just Rinvoq specifically and how you see that might be at risk from IRI, given you bring obviously a lot of life cycle development there. And is there a chance that a life cycle may not be quite as long? Or kind of how are you thinking about prioritizing investing in a small molecule like Rinvoq? 
Rick Gonzalez : Vamil, this is Rick. I'll take the first question and then maybe Rob and I can also tag team on the first one and the second one as well. So if you look at the floor, if you step back and look at how the business is performing. Obviously, the business is performing extremely well. And a significant part of the over achievement is not the Humira business. In fact, of the $1.4 billion we're raising, as Scott said, only $400 million of it is Humira. So $1 billion of it is the growth platform. So all that speaks. We have very strong momentum going into 2024. And we talked before on these calls about, well, when will the trough year occur. And as you think about the floor, I think you have to sort of think about the trough year at the same time. We said in the past that if we significantly overachieved in 2023, that would increase the probability that the trough year was in 2024. And we said that in the backdrop of primarily thinking about it as Humira overachieving. And obviously, now what we're seeing that it's the majority of the other products that are overachieving the growth platform. So as we look at '24 and as we look at the trough, I think we have to let the year play out a little bit further to see where we're going. But I would say that we're feeling pretty -- we're feeling very good about '24. And the growth of that non-Humira business could more than offset the over performance that we're seeing this year, especially the over performance that we're seeing on Humira. So it's too early to raise the floor. But what I would tell you is the performance that we're seeing now gives us a tremendous amount of confidence of what '24 looks like. Rob, anything you'd add? 
Rob Michael : I'd just add that we've now collectively raised revenue guidance by $1.4 billion, as Rick mentioned, we raised $400 million in the first quarter, $1 billion this quarter. When you look at it, it's really across the key therapeutic areas that will drive long-term growth. We've raised Skyrizi, aesthetics, neuroscience, and also Humira. So we do feel very good about the performance of the business. We've debated when we update the floor that will come at some point may not come until we actually give the Q4 guidance -- on the Q4 call of 2024 guidance, but as we look at it, the fundamentals of the business are very, very strong, and we're seeing performance across all of the therapeutic areas. 
Rick Gonzalez : On your second question, IRA. I think it's very difficult to predict. In our planning assumptions, we have assumed for some products to be impacted here early on. Imbruca is obviously one product that we're looking at carefully. I would say it's right from how you would calculate it based on the data that we would have, it would be right on the bubble of where the cutoff would occur in those first 10 products. So it could be 10, it could be 9, it could be 11, depending upon how some other products. And I say it that way because remember, we're using the data that we have, we're not 100% sure that, that is the data that CMS is going to use. So there's not perfect clarity around it. But I would say that's one that we obviously have on the radar screen and we're looking at carefully. Anything you'd add, Rob? 
Rob Michael : When IRA was passed a year ago, we obviously modeled the impact and we reaffirmed the long-term guidance expectation of high single-digit growth in the second half of this decade. That remains. We looked at what it means in terms of inflation penalties, party benefit redesign, negotiations. So we did make assumptions around that. I think Rick is correct in that there is still enough uncertainty we're going to know soon, right? September one is when they expect to announce the first list. We have modeled it, but we feel good even with IRA although it does have an impact -- has impacted everyone in the industry, we can still deliver on our long-term growth expectations. On your question -- and I think keep in mind, too, when you look at the Medicare percent of business for AbbVie. In the U.S., it's about 20%. Globally, it's a little bit lower, obviously. And so you look at us relative to our peers, we have a lower percent of the business as exposed to Medicare. And then when we look at specific at Rinvoq, you have to keep in mind with Rinvoq with indication expansion, the percent of sales you're talking about by the time it potentially be selected for negotiation, potentially in the later part of the decade, you're talking about something where like 10% to 12% because if you keep in mind, new indications, in many cases, serve younger patient population. And so that's the way we're looking at Rinvoq continuing to develop it. We obviously have a number of indications that could launch later in the decade. We feel very good about that. Those indications can collectively contribute a couple of billion dollars of revenue. We'll continue to drive that robust growth we expect from Rinvoq and Skyrizi as well. And so, we've modeled the impact of IRA, we don't expect it to impact the development plans for Rinvoq. 
Liz Shea: Thank you, Vamil. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Chris Schott, JPMorgan.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. I guess first, can you just elaborate in terms of what you're seeing with biosimilar Humira as we think about kind of the price and volume dynamics. I guess specifically, any surprises from your side in terms of how this is playing out? And then just any qualitative comments you can provide about how you see this kind of translating as we kind of think out to 2024? And then my second question was just on the Skyrizi updated guidance. Just a little bit more color on that $7.6 billion of at this point, how much is coming from psoriasis versus psoriatic arthritis versus this Crohn's launch that seems to be off to such a strong start. So just directional color of like the mix of the indications would be very helpful. Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Yeah. Hi, Chris. It's Jeff. And I'll answer your first question. So in a nutshell, we haven't been surprised at any of the dynamics that we've seen play out, we've called it very, very accurately. So again, nothing that's really other than some small volume holding on a little bit better that's really different. So we're quite pleased with how our contracting and access has played out. And that parity access for Humira has been important. And again, it's what we believe would happen. We think it's good for patients, obviously, who can maintain their therapy with very little volatility, and it certainly provided us with a lot of predictability. And so I think we've managed sort of the first half with the Amgen launch and then the second half dynamics very, very well. And if you look to '24, as I've highlighted before, we do have 2-year agreements with some of our accounts. And we negotiated those in good faith, and we expect them to be honored. And remember, these are parity contracts for both '23 and '24 with Humira access coexisting with these multiple biosimilars. So I would say based on these dynamics, we're confident that Humira access will remain quite meaningful in 2024. And we know that as more biosimilars become established, we're also, as we've highlighted, appropriately planning for some volume loss in those certain so-called wax-sensitive accounts over time. So really no surprises in terms of what we've seen overall. So we're quite pleased. 
Rob Michael: Chris, this is Rob. Just to give you some color, both in terms of the '23 guidance and the erosion assumptions around that, and then I'll talk about '24 briefly as well. In the first half of the year, obviously, the vast majority of that erosion came from price. We saw very little volume impact. But now with eight biosimilars on the market and some pursuing a low act strategy, we have assumed high single-digit volume erosion in the second half of the year, which would put the full year volume impact at mid-single digits. The rest of the 35% comes from prices we've negotiated those higher rebates and maintain strong parity access. Now while we're not providing '24 guidance today for U.S. Humira, it is reasonable to assume that there will be additional price erosion. Some will come from the annualization of the rebates that increased in the second half of this year and some will come from rebate increases negotiated for 2024 parity access. I'd also expect more volume erosion in '24, given the midyear entry of biosimilars this year, especially those that are pursuing a low act strategy. We've taken a close look at consensus estimates, analyst estimates have a very wide range the difference between the lowest estimate and the highest estimate approach is $4 billion. However, I'd say the average of those estimates appears to be a reasonable expectation for next year. Obviously, we'll give formal guidance likely on the Q4 call, which is our customary practice. But if you look at the average of those estimates, it should give you a good sense.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator? Oh, sorry. 
Rob Michael: Yes. And then I'll take -- this is Rob on to your question on Skyrizi. So of the $200 million, it's split evenly between psoriatic $100 million and IBD a $100 million. So that $7.6 billion psoriatics, about $6.7 million, and IBD is around $900 million. Thanks Chris.
Liz Shea: Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Mohit Bansal, Wells Fargo. 
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And congrats on the quarter. One clarification question and then one question. So clarification. So Rick, you mentioned that you think, like, again, at this point, you're not talking about increasing the floor, but you feel comfortable about the floor EPS range of $10.70. Is that fair to be in 2023 or '24, that's the first clarification question. And then second one is, when we talk to investors, they do feel comfortable about the ex-Humira portfolio. But one question that cuts up all the time is that, I mean, the lack of shiny object or pipeline beyond Skyrizi and Rinvoq. To the extent you agree with that assessment, how do you plan to mitigate that? Or is there anything in the pipeline that investors are missing at this point? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. This is Rick. So as far as the $10.70, I would tell you that we feel highly confident in the $10.70. So there shouldn't be any concern there. And as I said, with how the growth platform is performing, we would expect to update at some point the floor. And obviously, by the way I'm saying it, the update would be in an upward direction. So hopefully, that gives some clarity around the floor.  And when you think about the pipeline, what I tell you about the way we operate is we design our investment in R&D to be able to deliver the kind of growth that we expect for the business over the long term, both short term and the long term. Our expectations of the business haven't changed. Our expectations are to build a strategy that allows this business to grow at the top tier and be able to do it over the long term and do it in a consistent way. And I'd say, as I look at our historical performance, we've obviously delivered on that. But as I look at forward-looking performance through the end of this decade and into the early part of the ‘30s, we're highly confident we can deliver high single-digit growth with the pipeline that we have now, and ultimately, with the assets that we have in the marketplace and how they're performing in the marketplace and their ability to be able to drive significant growth. And you see that in the performance that we're delivering now. If you look at the growth platform's growth in first quarter, and then look at it in the second quarter, it's accelerating at a very good pace, and it will continue to accelerate as we go through the rest of this year. And that once we get to a stable tail or relatively stable tail on Humira will be that growth that emerges to be able to drive the company, and that's what gives us such a high level of confidence. But I think when you look at our pipeline, certainly, we invested significantly in Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and that investment is paying off extremely well. We have a number of assets in our pipeline that will continue to help accelerate that growth as we move forward. So venetoclax for t114 and MDS are in samples of that. 951, we should do any submission and get that product on the marketplace. There’s a huge need for that product in the marketplace. And a number of other assets, I won't go through every one of them. The rest of our investment in R&D has really been focusing on assets that are designed to be able to sustain our growth from 2030 - ‘40 forward. And so as I look at our pipeline, and I know you don't have as much visibility as we do, but when I look at our pipeline for things like the 400 platform and the cement platform that we have, the data we're seeing in CRC, non-small cell, that's a significant opportunity for us [indiscernible] is another significant opportunity for us. Our neuroscience portfolio is 916 and other assets is another significant opportunity for us that will emerge in that time frame. We have a next-generation BTK degrader that we're excited about. We have a second-generation BCL-2 that we're very interested in pursuing in multiple myeloma. And so there's a number of assets here that just haven't emerged to the point that you have clear visibility on all that data, but we do have visibility to where they're progressing. And so I think it's just hard for you to assess that earlier pipeline, but it's really designed to deliver on that long-term growth. So we're confident between now and the early ‘30s. And as that pipeline matures and the data comes out, three is another good example of where we have a lot of data now that is demonstrating that is probably best in class for a bispecific in myeloma. And so as that data emerges, you're going to get more visibility to it. And then obviously, we have the ability to go out and acquire things and we find things that we're interested in. 
Liz Shea: Okay. Thank you, Mohit. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Terence Flynn, Morgan Stanley. 
Terence Flynn: Maybe a couple for me. Maybe Rick, just to follow-up on that last comment, maybe just an update on your M&A BD appetite here, particularly assets that can contribute more near term to growth? And then again, I want to see what you guys are hearing out there regarding the long-acting Botox competitor. It sounds like you're seeing stable market share, but any feedback on that product? 
Rick Gonzalez : Okay. So M&A, I mean, obviously, we have a very active group who's constantly working in the area of business development. We're primarily focused in the areas that we operate in franchises. So think of things like immunology, neuroscience, certain areas of neuroscience, oncology, aesthetics, as an example, we constantly look at and then eye care would be, I would say, the key areas of focus.  As I said before, we don't need anything to be able to drive that high single digits. Obviously, if we can grow even faster, that's a good thing. I think all of us recognize that. If we find assets that are out there that are later-stage assets, and they fit our strategy and they fit the kind of target product profile that we would expect because we only look for assets that can significantly change standard of care. That's what we're good at. And so we evaluate lots of things, but many of them don't meet that threshold that we're looking for. But if we find something, we would obviously pursue it. If it was in an area that we thought we could maximize the value of it. And so, we'll continue to do that.  So like I said, I feel good about where we are and what we can drive, and I feel good about how we're looking at assets that are in the outside. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to be able to acquire assets that are out there. And as we've mentioned before, we obviously acquire larger assets. And so we continue to look at those. But they have to meet our criteria and they have to be able to deliver a good return to the business. On DAXI, I feel very good about how the team -- Harry and the team are performing against that. But I'll let Carrie actually describe to you how it looks. 
Carrie Strom : Thanks, Rick. So in terms of DAXI, it's been more than six months since their launch and the uptake has been quite limited from our perspective in the low single digits. So for context, as we benchmark our competitive launches. And you would benchmark this launch versus the most recent toxin to enter the U.S. market you would see it's tracking to about 25% of where another product would be at the same point in its launch. And in terms of customer feedback, we continue to hear that expectations are just not being met on duration, that expectations on the customer side and on the consumer side.  So we have yet to see impact on Botox share and Botox will continue to be the clear market leader as the other toxins compete for the number 2, 3, 4 position in our customers' offices. We are very pleased with the team's ability to execute on these competitive strategies here. And actually, their clear focus not only on the competitive strategies, but also on the broader focus and vision to grow the entire toxin market in the U.S., which we continue to see as biggest opportunity now and in the future. 
Liz Shea: Thank you, Carrie. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Evan Seigerman, BMO. 
Evan Seigerman: I wanted to just talk about kind of how you think about market share across the growth portfolio, specifically Skyrizi and Rinvoq kind of going forward. Is there a potential ceiling for them in one market share you can realize in these markets? Or maybe comment on some of the gating factors for market share growth in each of the patient provider or reimbursement agreements. 
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Evan, it's Jeff. I'll take that one. One of the aspects that we have that I highlight and we look very carefully at, we look at both sort of in-play capture which I often refer to, for example, right now, the in-play capture for Skyrizi in psoriasis is about 50%. So we're capturing one out of every two patients. And our market share is about 32%, as I highlighted. So theoretically, as we study these markets that if there's not major innovation or major disruption that comes in place. And we really don't see that in psoriasis. You get such a high level of efficacy with Skyrizi, your market share, so the 32% starts to ramp up over time towards your in-play capture because you get the persistency effects and the fall off that take place in the market.  So really, when you look at that, I could say the same thing, for example, with Rinvoq. I mentioned that it's capturing 25% of second line plus in-play share. It has like a 3% market share. So in terms of the ability to sort of grow that market share over time, we really monitor that capture rate in the early years, and then you just sort of -- the in place sort of pulls up your market share over time. So that's why we're quite encouraged at the speed of the ramps that we're seeing there and the ability to move that market share.  Now when we study the models, you don't fully get there because typically, something else launches, time goes by. But we can feel very, very encouraged as we look at our in-play momentum that the market share starts to approach that over our long-range planning cycle. 
Rick Gonzalez: The only other thing I would add, this is Rick, is with Otezla head-to-head. I would say currently, Skyrizi is not competing much against Otezla, which is a pretty sizable opportunity. And we're very pleased with this head-to-head data. So that will open up another pool of patients that today Skyrizi doesn't necessarily compete against. So that data will obviously allow us to be able to position it quite effectively against Otezla. 
Liz Shea: All right. Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Chris Raymond, Piper Sandler. 
Chris Raymond: Just maybe a pipeline line of questioning here. Rick, I heard you mention maybe ABBV-951, but it wasn't in your prepared comments. Maybe -- I know you guys were saying you're working to respond to the CRL later this year with PDUFA in the first half. Is that still the case. And then maybe also on the pipeline. A couple of quarters ago, I think you guys talked about an interesting combo opportunity in IBD with that GLP-2 in-licensed, I think, from Scripps. Any updated thoughts here with this sort of mechanism as a combo agent? 
Roopal Thakkar: It's Roopal. I can take those. So for 951, the team is still on track for a resubmission this year, consistent with what you just stated. And in fact, we've launched in Japan, and there's already commercial patients receiving it. So the team is very excited about that. And what was described earlier. The unmet need is still quite high, and we still believe in a very strong profile in that asset.  Along the lines of combinations, as you mentioned, on GLP-2, we feel with something like Skyrizi, the data that we've seen in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis there's still potentially an opportunity to even increase endoscopic or mucosal healing even higher. We're seeing high ranges already 50%, 60%. And but we can still potentially go higher and something like a GLP-2 can directly address mucosal healing. So that could be a potential combo. There's other assets in our immunology pipeline that we are also considering for a combination. But when you have an asset like Skyrizi and the safety profile that we continue to observe that creates, I would say, multiple opportunities. 
Tom Hudson: If I can just add, we didn't really opt in yet. Our collaboration with Caliber, which we expanded this week to more programs includes them doing a Phase Ia study which is almost finished. We're going to see the data and make that decision. It does fall into our -- part of our immunology program, which is in epithelial repair, which Roopal just mentioned. And so this is one of the assets which we think if you get a healthy gut to prepare that there will be in combination with immunomodulators will get a better response over time. We have another program called RIPK1, which also is involved in epithelial repair. So as multiple strategies, but this is one where we'll be making a decision and announcing a later time this year. 
Liz Shea: Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Steve Scala, TD Cowen. 
Steve Scala: A couple of questions. This morning, Takeda noted weakness in the U.S. GI market, and it seemed to be mainly on patient levels as opposed to competition. Wondering if you're seeing this and to what do you attribute it? So that's the first question. On the second question, on the Q1 call, the company said it would narrow the EPS range when it had clarity on biosimilar Humira and the landscape for that. So you narrowed that range today despite most biosimilars having been on the market for only three weeks, what do you know now that you didn't know when you reported in April that gives you the confidence to narrow the range today or is it all about the performance of the rest of the portfolio and really not about Humira?
Jeff Stewart: Yeah, hi Steve, it's Jeff. No, we don't see any slowdown in the IBD market. I mean this market has been just one of the highest growth markets we've seen from a CAGR perspective over many, many years. There's such unmet need. And so no, we're not seeing any patient slowdown. I would say, look, if we look at our particular data, I mean, you're seeing very fast ramps on this in-place share from Skyrizi and Crohn's disease. Now you're seeing an equally fast ramp in the early weeks from Rinvoq and Crohn's disease. And again, we're capturing up to 25% of the second line plus patients in ulcerative colitis. So I don't know what data Takeda is looking at, but we're seeing that the competitors in that space. And the leading competitors are Stelara and Entyvio and of course, our own Humira, but it's Stelara and Entyvio, they're under pressure in terms of incremental patient capture since our launch, and we'll continue to monitor. But we don't see any patient flow issues in the marketplace. 
Rob Michael: And Steve, this is Rob. On your second question. I think it's a combination of both. We're seeing very strong performance from the ex-Humira growth platform, as you can see by the guidance raise, that's really a contributor. But now that we're beyond the middle of the year. We know the biosimilars that have entered the market, we know they're facing prices. We've maintained strong parity access. And so that also increased our confidence which is why we've narrowed the range to $0.20. But it's a combination of both the ex-Humira growth platform performing very strongly as well as where we sit today with biosimilar competition for Humira. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Carter Gould, Barclays. 
Carter Gould: Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on the quarter. I guess, two, acknowledging all your comments on the pipeline and previous comments on BD. Rick, was looking to get your thoughts on how the more assertive FTC here is limiting your target list on BD or your ability to complete deals? And then maybe just on Botox. Just was hoping for a little bit more color on the sustainability of the ex-U.S. trends versus maybe some of that demand getting pushed into the quarter after some of the shutdowns, COVID impacts and whatnot ex-U.S. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So, I'll take the first question. Obviously, the FTC appears to be applying a lot more scrutiny to transactions. Having said that, I would say even before this happened, we would always evaluate an acquisition of a product or a company in the backdrop of what we thought the competitive environment would be our position in that market, meaning we didn't necessarily go out and try to do transactions that we thought would be extremely difficult from an FTC standpoint. So, I think the way we think about the FTC situation now is, look, it may require more time to get acquisitions through it may even require that you're willing to pursue litigation in order to get those through. But in the end, if your position is that what you're trying to do is not anticompetitive. You will be able to ultimately prevail in that process. And I think we're seeing that as some of these transactions go to court. Some not in our own industry, but in other industries, I think that's playing out. And so, I think ultimately, it will end up being more of a delay, but not something that staples your ability to do things that are appropriate to do. That's my perspective on it. Carrie? 
Carrie Strom: Sure. In terms of the aesthetics market internationally, like we said, we've been very pleased with the performance so far, and we expect to -- we continue to expect to see that type of strong performance through the rest of the year. We're continuing to invest in key growth markets like Japan and in markets like Brazil. And of course, China has become our second biggest market globally. And in China, in the first quarter, we did see significant growth as the market was reopening from COVID and some pent-up demand that came through in Q1 and early Q2. And now China has returned to normalized high growth rates. And so despite some economic pressures there, we really continue to see strong growth as we continue to invest and expand our promotional footprint there through field force, through injector training and our consumer efforts. And China will continue to be a really attractive market for us. Based on that commercial expansion and also, we're going to have a steady flow of new product launches throughout the decade in that market. One thing to note, which we did mention in our prepared remarks is that we do expect Q3 to be relatively flat internationally based on shipment timing from last year with that return to growth in Q4 and high single-digit growth for the full year internationally. 
Rob Michael: And then, Carter, you were specifically asking about international Botox. I think if you just look at the run rate through the six months of the year, that's probably a good proxy for where we expect international Botox to land. We're holding strong share positions. Force is very, very good. So there's really no dynamic there. As Carrie mentioned, I mean you have to keep in mind that fillers a very large market for us, business for us internationally. We do have the Q3 dynamic. But when you look at the full year for international, that high single-digit growth, is certainly a way to think about the international business for aesthetics. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: David Risinger, Leerink Partners. 
David Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So I have two questions. Rick, you had mentioned that you're expecting stabilization of Humira sales at some point. Could you provide some perspective on when you might expect that? And then second, with respect to the filler franchise, obviously, it's performing strongly, could you discuss the prospects including the driver of weight loss drug patients seeking to compensate for facial hallowing? Thank you very much.
Rick Gonzalez: On the Humira tail, as Rob mentioned earlier, obviously, you have the annualization of the impact that we have this year, the second half annualization that's going to roll into '24. We're going to have further price erosion in '24, both based on the contracts that we have and how we're expecting the market to play out. And I'd say the pricing in the marketplace has been consistent with what our original assumptions were. So, I think the expectation you'll start to see stabilization of that tail in '25. And benefit operates similar to what we see in the international markets, which I think would probably be low at that point. it becomes relatively stable, I'd say, in '26 going forward. And it should be still a substantial tail that we maintain. But see less erosion pressure on it at that point. Carrie, do you want to talk a little bit about the Otezla impact? 
Carrie Strom: Sure. So, in terms of the filler opportunity and outlook, I guess, as that big -- I'll start -- I'll zoom out a little bit and just comment on that the filler market continues to be really attractive, especially internationally, as you've already seen here right now. with China driving some strong growth. And really some of the key Juvederm brand have just become available in China in the past few years, and we'll continue to have, like I said, a cadence of Juvederm launches in China. And then our increased investment all over the world and continues to drive our filler business and gives us a lot of optimism there internationally. Now in the U.S., we have said that the inflationary dynamics have impacted the U.S. market for filler and more than toxin just by the nature of the filler pricing and procedure. And also in terms of the patient journey patients tend to start on toxin before they add filler. And so, for all those reasons, we believe that the top -- the filler market will continue to improve in the second half of the year. although it will lag the toxin market recovery a bit. Now in terms of the question around Ozempic, we have been keeping an eye on that and how these weight loss products could have an impact on the aesthetics market. And what we see is that really anything that gets a consumer engaged in their appearance, including products like Ozempic are a positive tailwind for the aesthetics business. And we are hearing some customers say that these facial hollowing fillers or for -- that's a result of these products is an opportunity for fillers. We see that on social media. We're tracking it in other forms of media. And we think that like many other consumer trends around aesthetics, this will just continue to be a tailwind and the positive dynamic of the business. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, David Risinger. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Tim Anderson, Wolfe Research
Tim Anderson: Thank you. A couple of questions. How much uncertainty is there in terms of contracting in the I&I category in 2024 from a pricing standpoint for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And when will you be able to provide an update on how those pricing discussions are going for those two brands. So not the formal sales guidance for those products, but how the pricing discussions are going. And what is your expectation today for that level of price erosion in 2024 relative to what it's been in 2023? 
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So, I think Jeff and I will tag team this one. It's a great question because, look, I think we all know there has been some question out in the marketplace since the first quarter about I&I pricing. And so let me try to frame our perspective on the pricing because I think there's some misconception that's developed in the marketplace to some extent around I&I pricing. I guess the first thing I'd say to you, this is a market we know well. We've been in this market for a long time. We're obviously a leader in this market. So, it's a market we know extremely well. And obviously, we know any trend that's occurring in this market to a high degree of detail. And what I would tell you is that we see no fundamental change in the way pricing is being dealt with in this marketplace nor do we expect to see any fundamental change that occurs in the foreseeable future. So that brings me to the rebate question in the first quarter. And I would tell you that we're operating exactly the same way we have historically operated in this segment as it relates to rebating or discounting. When we get a new indication or a new product, one of the things that we evaluate is -- okay, what level of rebating should we do in order to maximize two things for the product. The speed at which we can drive the ramp and the ultimate peak sales that we can drive for that asset. We weigh those two things against how we look at contracting and getting on formulary. And so when you get an indication, you make a trade off. Do I want to be on formulator? I don't. If I do, I have to provide some level of incremental rebates. Is that a financially positive decision for the asset in the company. And if it is, we make that decision. And I would say that Skyrizi and Rinvoq are classic examples of that strategy. And I would say, look at how they're performing. We're going to grow those two assets despite the increased rebates, $3.5 billion this year. And that's a pretty good trade-off. I don't know, Jeff, anything you'd add? 
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Maybe just to build on that point, Rick. I mean this fact base of seven indications in one year in one category with one firm, it's just -- it's really unprecedented. It's not going to happen again. And I think it's important to think about how it works. I mean, when you get a new indication and they're sequencing over time, you've got to clear the payer's P&T clinical committee, and they don't meet every day. They meet every couple of months. So there's a process there. And then you've got to be added to the formulary structure. So you either have to somehow gain a new spot by indication or replace a competitor. And that's not easy as well. And so that's why what we see in the marketplace. Many competitive firms have to offer these free or bridge programs and not just for a quarter or 2, sometimes there are multiple quarters or years until that access ramps. And I would say, in contrast, Rick, as you noted, on average, we achieved fully paid access for those seven indications in about 60 days, really, really unprecedented. So that means we had to give very little free goods we had almost immediate paid access and profit flow and then, of course, that rapid revenue accumulation that you highlighted. So definitely the right trade-off, and we don't see that recurring. 
Rob Michael: And Tim, on your second question, I mean we've said this before, the high single-digit price impact this year is a function, again, as Jeff mentioned, seven new indications. We do not expect that type of price erosion going forward. It should not be what investors are modeling. So I wouldn't be concerned about high single-digit price erosion in '24. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, we have time for one final question. 
Operator: And that will be from Geoff Meacham, Bank of America. 
Geoff Meacham: Great. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. On OUS Humira, you're obviously well past the initial biosimilar way, but you're still seeing some sequential decline. So what's the context here? And is there a dynamic that could impact Skyrizi or Rinvoq even indirectly OUS? And then on navitoclax, I know you guys have more details to come, but is there a threshold you're looking for and TRANSFORM one to move forward or even to inform development in other indications, just thinking about maybe the tolerability profile and the comps in that? 
Rob Michael: So Jeff, this is Rob. I'll answer your question on International Humira. If you look at the '23 erosions, about $600 million it's really split in, I'd say, three buckets. About $300 million of it is new biosimilar markets, markets like Canada, Puerto Rico, Mexico. Those are -- remember, we have additional waves coming in. So that's the next wave coming in so about half of it is that. And then I characterize about $200 million being really the impact of new agents like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, right? So you have agents that deliver higher standard of care, and so you're going to see share erosion just through that dynamic. And fortunately, we've brought forward our own products that do that. And so I'd say of that $600 million, $200 million is roughly that. And then in the international markets, you typically see some, I'd say, low to mid-single-digit price erosion, just typically year-over-year. So that's about another $100 million. So it's important to characterize it the right way. It's not so much markets that were biosimilar several years ago. It's more recent biosimilar markets, our own competition from our own agents as well as the typical price erosion you see in the international market. 
Roopal Thakkar: It's Roopal. I'll take the navitoclax question. So we'll continue to monitor the spleen volume reduction and see how that looks towards the end of the year. And if it maintains the high level that Tom described, that's something that definitely a positive. The other things that we'll get that will reveal themselves over the longer term as the marrow fibrosis and that, along with the spleen volume reduction and actually some of our earlier data may be correlative for survival events. So we'll get an early look at those. And then in terms of tolerability, what we've seen thus far is consistent with what we've seen initially, and it is a titratable dosing. So the clinicians can tailor in the study to what the patient needs. So more to come by year-end.  Liz Shea Okay. Thanks, Jeff. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us. 
Operator: As we are concluded. Again, thank you for your participation. You may please disconnect at this time.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-27 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]
 I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. 
Elizabeth Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman and President; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President, Allergan aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer.
 Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
 On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.
 So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. 
Richard Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2023. With first quarter total revenues and adjusted earnings per share both exceeding our expectations. This performance was driven by double-digit sales growth from several key products, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta and Vraylar. Positive momentum from our aesthetics business with strong results internationally and stabilizing consumer trends in the U.S. and in line performance from U.S. Humira where biosimilar erosion is tracking as expected with much of the impact driven by price.
 Since our inception, we have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in highly attractive markets, including immunology, hematological oncology, neuroscience and aesthetics. Our commercial execution, including the launch of new products and expanded indications has been outstanding, especially across Skyrizi and Rinvoq and recently with Vraylar and MDD. Each of these assets are expected to contribute significant revenue growth over the decade. The breadth and the depth of our R&D pipeline also supports our long-term growth outlook and we anticipate numerous important pipeline milestones over the next 2 years.
 In summary, we are 1 quarter into the U.S. biosimilar event for Humira and are managing the erosion well. Most importantly, our growth platform is demonstrating strong performance, exceeding our expectations. We are executing well across all aspects of our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob? 
Robert Michael: Thank you, Rick. We're off to an excellent start in 2023 with each of our 5 key therapeutic areas meeting or exceeding our first quarter expectations, a testament to the strength of our broad portfolio. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations.
 First quarter results include continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which remain on track to contribute more than $11 billion in combined sales this year. Growth rates in the first quarter for both products are consistent with our full year expectations.
 Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating momentum across all approved indications and we expect to round out their opportunities in IBD later this year. This includes Rinvoq's anticipated U.S. approval in Crohn's disease as well as Skyrizi's European launch in Crohn's and its global regulatory submission in UC.
 We are also performing exceptionally well in neuroscience. Total net revenues this quarter were nearly $200 million above our guidance with Vraylar sales accelerating following MDD approval and migraine delivering strong growth. As a result, we will be increasing our full year outlook for neuroscience.
 Aesthetics is also performing better than expected. We are seeing positive recovery trends in China and some stability in the U.S. market, where we are closely monitoring several economic indicators that correlate with aesthetics procedures, including consumer confidence, personal consumption and Google searches. Although it's still early in the year, these positive trends, especially across our international markets, give us the confidence to increase our full year outlook for aesthetics as well. This continues to be an underpenetrated market with significant growth potential.
 Based on our robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.72 and $11.12.
 In closing, I'm extremely pleased with the performance of our diverse portfolio. We're off to a strong start to the year, which further reinforces our confidence in the long-term outlook of the business.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? 
Jeffrey Stewart: Thank you, Rob. I'm very pleased with the strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. Immunology delivered total revenues of approximately $5.6 billion with continued robust double-digit growth from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Skyrizi global sales were nearly $1.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 46%, despite retail inventory destocking in the quarter. Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market with a total prescription share now at 30%.
 In psoriasis, Skyrizi has set a very high bar relative to other therapies on the market or in development with differentiated attributes across the categories that physicians and patients deem most important. This includes the rapid onset of action after the first dose, nearly complete skin clearance with multifold higher rates on PASI 90 and PASI 100. High durability of response, which we have demonstrated can increase over time as well as quarterly dosing for maintenance therapy, a convenient alternative to daily oral or more frequently administered injectables. With a nearly 50% U.S. in-play share of new and switching patients, there is substantial room for Skyrizi's continued growth in psoriasis.
 This best-in-class profile is supporting strong momentum now in psoriatic arthritis with Skyrizi achieving an in-play biologic share of roughly 20% in the U.S. dermatology segment. Skyrizi is also being co-positioned with Rinvoq in the U.S. room segment in PSA where we are seeing increasing utilization among rheumatologists as well. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved in-play psoriatic disease leadership in more than 25 countries and total market share leadership in nearly 20 of those key markets.
 In Crohn's disease, we are seeing very fast adoption of Skyrizi in the U.S., with a total in-play patient share at approximately 20%, second only to STELARA. Feedback from gastroenterologists is very positive, especially as it relates to Skyrizi's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We see strong uptake in Japan and Canada as well with the European launch forthcoming.
 We also recently reported strong induction data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which Tom will discuss momentarily. Based on the results of that trial, it is increasingly clear that Skyrizi represents a differentiated asset across inflammatory bowel disease and we look forward to bringing this potential new indication to physicians and patients next year.
 Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $686 million, reflecting operational growth of more than 50% despite similar retail inventory destocking in the quarter. I'm very pleased with the performance in rheumatology with total prescriptions increasing across each of the 4 approved indications. Atopic dermatitis is also tracking in line with our expectations. We continue to see market share momentum globally, including in-play patient share increasing to approximately 17% in the U.S.
 We are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology. Rinvoq has set a high bar for efficacy in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, demonstrating strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. We're seeing very strong momentum in UC, where adoption has been robust. Rinvoq is now achieving a 23% in-play share in the U.S. second-line plus setting, reflecting an impressive ramp since our launch in UC less than 1 year ago. This accelerated adoption among gastroenterologists is very encouraging for Rinvoq's pending outlook in Crohn's. We are currently launching this indication in the EU, a geography where Rinvoq is the only JAK approved to treat both IBD conditions, and we remain on track for CD approval and commercialization in the U.S. later this quarter with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the back half of this year.
 So we see inflammatory bowel disease continues to be an area of high unmet need. Having 2 novel therapies in IBD with Skyrizi and Rinvoq that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy is an important step forward for patients. And with these 2 complementary assets, we are very well positioned to compete against other oral or biological agents.
 Global Humira sales were approximately $3.5 billion, down 24.3% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. remains in line with our expectations with most of the impact driven by price.
 Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.4 billion with continued pressure on Imbruvica, partially offset by robust double-digit growth with Venclexta. Imbruvica global revenues were $878 million, down 25.2% due to increasing competition and the cumulative impact of a suppressed market. Venclexta global sales were $538 million, up 17.5% on an operational basis with strong momentum across both AML and CLL.
 In neuroscience, revenues were approximately $1.7 billion, up 15% on an operational basis. Vraylar is performing exceptionally well. Sales of $561 million were up 31.3% on an operational basis, above our expectations. We are very pleased with the AMDD label and the launch, which has resulted in a significant uplift in total new prescriptions for Vraylar. With a dedicated sales force that calls on both psychiatrists and primary care as well as ramping DTC promotion, we see an opportunity for accelerated growth across all approved indications. And we will be raising our full year guidance for Vraylar accordingly.
 Within migraine, we remain uniquely positioned with a portfolio to support complete migraine freedom. Our leading oral CGRP therapies contributed $218 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 45% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. We recently expanded the label for Qulipta, which is now uniquely positioned as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine further strengthening our competitive profile.
 Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $719 million, reflecting strong performance in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance across the therapeutic portfolio.
 And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie? 
Carrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. First quarter Global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.3 billion, which came in ahead of our guidance, primarily due to a faster reopening in China as well as a slightly stronger economy in the U.S. versus our planning assumption. In the U.S., aesthetics sales were $777 million, down 8.1% as we continue to see softness in aesthetics procedures related to inflationary dynamics. As a reminder, we saw a very robust performance for our U.S. performance in the first quarter of 2022, which created difficult comparison for growth in the first quarter of this year.
 U.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $409 million, down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see a lesser impact from inflationary dynamics on Botox Cosmetic compared to other areas of our aesthetics portfolio due to its relatively lower price point and large install base of loyal repeat consumers.
 The U.S. cosmetic toxin market was down low single digits in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Botox Cosmetic continues  be the clear market leader and its share of the U.S. toxin market remains stable.
 Sales for our U.S. Juvederm collection were down 18% as our dermal filler portfolio continues to be impacted by inflationary pressure on consumer spending. The U.S. filler market was down nearly 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains the clear market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic pressure on our U.S. dermal filler business is partially offset in the quarter by strong initial uptake for our recently launched Volux filler, which is approved for the improvement of jawline definition. We expect Volux combined with the upcoming launch of our skin quality injectable [ Skinvive ] to support long-term growth for our filler portfolio in the U.S.
 While the aesthetics category in the U.S. continues to be challenged due to the fast economy, the key external economic metrics that we track have remained relatively consistent with year-end 2022 levels.
 Our international aesthetics portfolio continues to demonstrate robust growth with strong performance in Japan, which is rapidly growing and China, which is recovering faster than expected. Sales from our international aesthetics portfolio were $523 million, up 7.8% on an operational basis. International Botox Cosmetics sales grew approximately 17.5% operationally, and international Juvederm sales were down approximately 1.4% on an operational basis. China, which is our second largest market, was negatively impacted by COVID in January and February, but experienced a sharp recovery in March. We expect this level of activity to be sustained throughout the remainder of the year.
 Recall, our original guidance assumed we would not reach a full recovery until the second half of this year. And in Japan, which is an underdeveloped market and proving to be very responsive to promotion, we continue to make significant investments in injector training, our field force and consumer education. Overall, we are pleased with how our team has been executing through this dynamic environment and remain encouraged by improving trends internationally and stabilization across our U.S. portfolio. These positive trends and continued strong momentum give us the confidence to increase the full year outlook for our aesthetics business.
 Longer term, we remain extremely confident in our ability to grow the aesthetics business and continue to expect to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion by the end of this decade. Aesthetics continues to be an extremely attractive underpenetrated market and our proven ability to drive consumer demand and develop a strong base of loyal customers as well as bring innovative new products to the market will support robust growth over the long term.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. 
Thomas J. Hudson: Thank you, Carrie. We've continued to make very good progress with our pipeline to start this year. In immunology, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, making it the first JAK inhibitor approved for this indication. We continue to anticipate FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease next month. We also recently announced positive top line results from our Phase III induction study for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which is a disease with unpredictable symptoms and frequent players making it challenging to manage.
 In our study, Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary end points demonstrating a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement. We're particularly pleased with Skyrizi's impressive performance on the more stringent measures in this trial with approximately 37% of Skyrizi-treated patients achieving endoscopic improvement compared to 12% of patients on placebo. This level of efficacy has the potential to position Skyrizi as a highly effective therapy, and we believe it will be a welcome new treatment option for physicians and patients once approved. Detailed data from this induction study will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting. We expect to see data from the Phase III maintenance study in the second quarter with our regulatory submissions planned for the second half of the year.
 In oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our hematology and solid tumor pipelines. We remain on track for several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approval for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory in multiple myeloma patients with a t(1114) mutation and navitoclax's TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. And Phase II data for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support a regulatory submission for accelerated approval.
 We're also beginning to see very encouraging data for our next-generation c-Met ADC, which uses a more potent Topol payload than our Teliso-V ADC. Based on the data we've seen to date for ABBV-400 in our Phase I solid tumor basket study, we plan to expand the program to earlier lines in colorectal cancer as well as evaluate in other tumors where c-Met is expressed, including pancreatic and liver cancer.
 Moving to our neuroscience pipeline, where we've recently received FDA approval for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine, making it the only oral CGRP antagonist approved for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our Phase III study, Qulipta provided a significant reduction in migraine days as well as significant improvements in function and quality of life in patients with chronic migraine, a common and debilitating disease. As a highly effective oral treatment option, we believe Qulipta will be well positioned in a chronic migraine prevention market. In Europe, we continue to anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine.
 Turning now to ABBV-951. We announced that we received a complete response letter for our regulatory application in the U.S. The FDA has not asked for additional efficacy or safety studies related to our drug delivery -- drug device delivery system, but rather they have requested additional information regarding the pump as well as updates to instruction for use. We are working to generate the necessary information, and we expect to respond to the CRL later this year with an FDA action anticipated in the first half of '24.
 In international markets, we've recently received approval for 951 in Japan, and we continue to expect approval in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.
 In our early-stage neuroscience pipeline, we recently began Phase I studies of our selective D3 dopamine receptor agonist, ABBV-932. Our experience with Vraylar has highlighted the potential clinical benefit of achieving D3 selectivity, and we believe that a compound that more selectively engages the D3 dopamine receptor has the potential to provide enhanced efficacy. Our program will initially focus on general anxiety disorder with the potential to expand to other neuropsychiatric disorders.
 The programs under our collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. We now have 4 assets in clinical trials, including 2 PTPN2 inhibitors in Phase I in oncology. Our eIF2B activator for neurodegenerative diseases and an IGF-1 signaling pathway modulator that will be explored in aging-related diseases. Our most advanced program is the eIF2B activator 7262. The first patient was recently enrolled in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a Phase II/III study conducted by the HEALEY Center for ALS at Mass General. This trial is designed to evaluate multiple therapies simultaneously with a goal to accelerate the development of potential breakthrough treatments for ALS.
 Now I'd like to provide a brief update on 2 earlier stage programs in our therapeutic pipeline. In cystic fibrosis, we recently analyzed data from an ongoing proof-of-concept study, evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results from this interim analysis did not meet our criteria for advancing and we are discontinuing our cystic fibrosis program.
 We also recently reviewed interim data from our exploratory studies for ABBV-154 in PMR in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the RA study, while we observed efficacy with 154, we also observed some changes in biomarkers that are consistent with systemic steroid exposure at the higher doses. The benefit risk profile does not sufficiently differentiate 154 from other available treatments. So based on the totality of the data across RA, PMR and Crohn's disease studies, we will not be pursuing further development of this asset.
 Now moving to our aesthetics pipeline. We recently saw data from our Phase III studies for Botox in platysma prominence and masseter muscle prominence. In our study for prominent neck muscles, Botox met all primary and secondary endpoints demonstrating a significant reduction in the unwanted appearance of platysma prominence on the neck and jaw line. This was the first of 3 Phase III studies in platysma prominence with data from the 2 remaining trials expected in the second half of the year, followed by regulatory submission in the U.S. near the end of 2023.
 Botox also performed very well in our study for prominent masseter muscles, meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial. Our program is initially focused on China and other Asian markets as masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. Based on the results from this trial, we expect to submit our regulatory application in China in the second half of the year. Once approved, we anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication, which will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment.
 So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones throughout the remainder of 2023.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott. 
Scott Reents: Thank you, Tom. I will discuss our most recent financial results and guidance. Starting with our first quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottom line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance and down 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 45% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 13.6% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.4% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million. The adjusted tax rate was 13.7%.
 Turning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.72 and $11.12. This earning per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $52.4 billion, an increase of $400 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions. We now expect Vraylar sales of approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting strong prescription growth following the MDD approval. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting the better-than-expected recovery in China and stable economic trends in the U.S.
 Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.5 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of 27%. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 48.5% of sales. We are modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.90 and $3. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.
 In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations.
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to 1 or 2. Operator, first question, please. 
Operator: Our first question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. 
Terence Flynn: Great. Maybe 2 for me. Just on immunology, can you quantify the amount of destocking for both Skyrizi and Rinvoq in the quarter? I think Biogen on their call spoke to some tighter working capital requirements at wholesalers due to rising interest rates. So just wondering if you're seeing something similar here and just to want to be sure that it's not a pricing dynamic. And then can you elaborate at all about your ALS program when we might see some data there? 
Robert Michael: Terence, it's Rob. So on the retail inventory destocking, we do typically see this in the first quarter, so it wasn't a complete surprise. In fact, it was factored into our guidance. We did beat our guidance in immunology for the quarter. The impact was high single digits, both for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In terms of absolute value, we're talking about around $70 million for Skyrizi and $30 million for Rinvoq. 
Jeffrey Stewart: And it's Jeff. Just to clarify on your wholesale comment, I think, as Rob highlighted, it's in the retail. So it's in the specialty pharmacy channel. And you'll recall, as you know, there's about 18 specialty pharmacies that basically distribute the I&I products, and there are some big ones there. So it was not a wholesaler dynamic. It was a retail inventory dynamic, which, again, as these products get bigger, we do see and contemplate in our projections. 
Robert Michael: And then Terence, this is Rob. Just to more broadly answer the question that I'm sure many investors have. If you look at the growth in the quarter, so overall, U.S. demand was up just north of 60% for Rinvoq and Skyrizi. We saw very strong performance across all approved indications, as Jeff highlighted. We did have the 2 partial offsets, one being the retail inventory destock, which I've already quantified. And then price was down high single digits and that's really driven by rebate increases, which is typical when we see the type of volume increase.
 And we saw Skyrizi sales up 80% last year, Rinvoq in the U.S. up 40% last year. So when you see that kind of volume growth and couple that with the number of indications we had approved, we had 5 new indications for Rinvoq and 2 for Skyrizi. So it was something we were contemplating. It was factored into our guidance, but I don't know that The Street fully appreciated that in terms of the first quarter estimates that were put out there. 
Thomas J. Hudson: This is Tom for the ALS question. I'd say about 2 years, we had to recruit the patients and there's about a year of follow-up that is needed. So I would say, late '24, early '25, all depends on the enrollment, which I understand is starting off on a good pace. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. 
Steve Scala: A couple of questions. Some of your peers have called out co-pay resets early in the year that have led to more modest performances in products such as Dupixent and Cosentyx. AbbVie has been less vocal on this point. How much was that a factor? Or are Skyrizi and Rinvoq different in some way? And then secondly, despite the solid performance in Q1, the EPS guidance range continues to be very wide. What factors would have to play out for you to hit the high end of that and the low end of that? 
Jeffrey Stewart: Yes, Steve, it's Jeff, and thanks for the question. I'll take the co-pay one. Look, I mean, some of the peers are seeing the effects of the so-called maximizer programs or even some of the lingering accumulator programs which do sometimes as benefit designs are reset in the first quarter can apply some pressure. We don't see that. We've been managing that very tightly. And we're not seeing any significant sort of surge or creep in terms of that dynamic. The dynamic is exactly what Rob had highlighted, which is the modest price based on the number of indications and how fast the volume is moving and this destocking event that we talked through. So co-pay is very stable for AbbVie. 
Robert Michael: And Steve, this is Rob, on your EPS range question. We've typically given a $0.20 range; this year, we gave a $0.40 range. And the key driver of that is obviously the U.S. Humira dynamics. As we see that play out, particularly in the second half, we would typically tighten that range. Now keep in mind, that $0.20 wider range represents about 1% of U.S. Humira growth. So it's not as wide as you might think. But we did widen it given the dynamics of U.S. Humira. And I think we'll be able to give you more color as we see those 7, 9 biosimilars coming in the market in the middle of the year. We'll have more clarity for you on the second quarter call. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. 
Christopher Schott: Just coming back to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I think you mentioned high single-digit price erosion beyond just those inventory changes. I guess is that a reasonable assumption to think about price as we progress through the rest of this year? And then maybe longer term, should we think about that level of price erosion as more like a onetime kind of issue this year given all the new indications and a more stable trend going forward? I'm just trying to kind of get my hands around the pricing a little bit more.
 And my second question was on the aesthetics business. You obviously saw a very strong 1Q. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on your confidence in the sustainability of these trends? I know the market has been a little bit bumpy, but it seems like the tone is that you're encouraged with the trends you're seeing. But just how much, I guess, visibility you have in terms of sustainability of those favorable international trends we're seeing right now? 
Robert Michael: Chris, this is Rob. So on your question on price, yes, the way to think about 2023 price for the year for Skyrizi and Rinvoq would be down high single digits. Now we wouldn't expect high single digits to be the rate going forward given a big driver was the number of new indications that we launched. And so I would expect that to moderate over time.
 Carrie? 
Carrie Strom: This is Carrie. In terms of your questions around the aesthetics market, there are 2 key assumptions for the 2023 planning. One was around the U.S. economy and the other was around the recovery in China. When you think about the U.S. economy, we look at Q1 and we see some favorability to our planning assumptions with the metrics that we track, which Rob mentioned, include real personal consumption expenditure and Google.
 And so in January and February, we saw favorability there. Although in March, there are some potential signs of softening. So we continue to have a cautious outlook for our U.S. business for the rest of the year. The way to think about market growth for the full year would be low -- for toxins, the market would be down low to mid-single digits until we lap the 2022 downturn, which happened around May. And then after that, we would expect flat market growth for the rest of the year. So that's how we think about the U.S.
 Our other -- our second biggest market is China. And recall, we had assumed that the aesthetics market in China would not recall -- would not fully recover until the second half of the year. Well, in actuality, what we saw was although January was significantly impacted, in February, we started to see improvement. And in March, there was a really steep recovery that we do expect will sustain through the rest of the year. And in other markets around the world, I guess, in Canada and U.K., we are seeing some high inflation impacting consumer demand, but the rest of Europe seems stable right now. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. 
Mohit Bansal: I have one clarification and one question. So clarification is regarding the price decline for I&I. You said that high single digit, but should we assume like going forward, year-over-year, we should -- versus volumes, should we assume high single-digit decline still going forward for at least for rest of the quarter and then more stable pricing quarter-over-quarter term, just that clarification.
 And the question is, regarding the I&I pipeline, so you have a leadership position with Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and they are growing. But some of the pipeline products like 154 and 157 did not pan out as you were hoping them to. So what is -- how should we think about the pipeline strategy beyond these 2 products? And can you even do M&A given the increased FTC scrutiny nowadays? 
Richard Gonzalez: So this is Rick. I'll cover number two and maybe just touch on number one. If you think about our pipeline, obviously, as we look at Skyrizi and Rinvoq, they clearly have restated the immunology market across most of the segments that we operate in. We view those assets as being able to drive strong growth through the early part of the next decade.
 Having said that, we're continuing to look for assets in areas where we believe there's still a significant opportunity to restate standard of care. And we obviously explore, as everyone in this industry does many different assets and different mechanisms to try to find those kinds of mechanisms that will deliver that kind of performance. It's interesting. When you look at the 154 platform, it did exactly what we thought it would do from the standpoint of efficacy. But it did it in a way only at the highest dose and at that highest dose, we did see it -- some effects of steroids on some of the biomarkers. And based on the way we think regulators would look at a label for those kinds of products, we didn't believe that would be a competitive profile.
 But the hypothesis certainly worked around the mechanism. So we continue to look for opportunities. We have lots of runway here to be able to get to those, but we do desire to find some additional mechanisms that will be the follow-on products that should be introduced hopefully near the end of this decade or early into the next decade as the next-generation immunology assets for AbbVie. So -- and I feel good about the progress that we're making there. We're continuing to explore a number of other areas. And we're continuing to look both internally and externally at different assets that we can bring into the company to be able to do that.
 To your question of being able to bring assets into this market, we don't believe that we would be encumbered because immunology is a very crowded space from a competitive standpoint. And that's one of the most important criteria that you look at from an FTC standpoint. So we believe we have freedom to operate across most of those segments from an FTC standpoint as well.
 And on price, maybe Rob and I will tag team this one to make sure it's clear. It is common that when you go out and you add indications in this industry, that when you negotiate those contracts to be able to get access, it does require some level of price concession. I would say we're on the lower end of what you typically would have seen with the speed at which we got access for Skyrizi and Rinvoq for those indications and the breadth of that access. And so we certainly would expect this year and last year to be the areas where you saw the most significant amount of price because those are the years that we added the majority of the indications, you would expect that to moderate.
 So then going forward, the way to think about it is, then it's only really driven by volume at that point. And volume typically requires much more modest kinds of price as you go forward. It's not 0 price. You shouldn't have that expectation. But I would not have an expectation of high single digits going forward.
 Anything you'd add, Rob? 
Robert Michael: Just to answer the question, Mohit, on the gating. Yes, I think it's safe to assume that you'll see high single-digit price in each of the quarters this year. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thank you, Mohit. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. 
Alice Nettleton: This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. So a question on PBMs, which are under renewed scrutiny. If there were material changes to the rebating structure currently in place, would that put big incumbent products at risk because it might remove the so-called rebate wall? And more generally, do you think there is any chance of some of the proposed legislative changes actually becoming law? And then secondly, any collateral impact you're seeing on Skyrizi or Rinvoq since Humira biosimilars have launched? And given the overlapping indications, do you think that you'll start to see some picking off of patients from these 2 brands to biosimilars in the second half of the year? 
Jeffrey Stewart: Yes, it's Jeff. I'll give some comment on that. I think the way that we think about our brands is the first place that we look at is how distinctive they are. I mean we've got 4 head-to-head trials with Skyrizi and another one on the way where we can clearly differentiate the product. And we have many as well on Rinvoq. So we've really thought about it from a development standpoint. And I would say the perspective is somehow there was a restructuring of the PDMs, which I don't think is imminent. And the rebate sort of approach disappeared. It disappears for everybody. I mean all of these I&I products have a fairly reasonable rebate load and there would be a different basis of competition, which we would do very, very well. So we're not concerned about sort of a fundamental structural change relative to these 2 products, which are very distinctive.
 If we look at your second part of your question, which is it's really the same answer, which is we don't see that there are going to be significant impacts of Humira biosimilars on the performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And one perspective, let's take Rinvoq is sort of a very simple way of thinking about it. It's already in the United States, a step behind TNF and it's performing at that level because you see such expansion of second and third lines in that space. And Skyrizi is very, very distinctive. So no, in the second half, we do not anticipate sort of a knock-on effect of the emergent biosimilars to our 2 core brands. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Alice. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. 
Carter L. Gould: Maybe a different spin on sort of the BE question there, just given sort of the volatility in the marketplace, as you kind of have those conversations or engage with potential targets. Just if you've seen a shift in sort of that bid-ask spread and the willingness of boards and management to consider deals. Any update on that front would be helpful. 
Richard Gonzalez: This is Rick. I'd say the environment hasn't changed materially in the last 24 months from my perspective. I still think it's certainly more difficult to raise money for biotech companies. So it probably makes them a bit more willing to engage with players like us or engage in a process, if they're at a point where they've generated data that makes them attractive. But I'd say the interest level in that engagement is similar to what has been for the last 12 to 24 months. And there's a lot of opportunity to be able to find assets that are in the biotech area. The question is you have to find the right kind of asset and you have to find one that's attractive and meet your needs. And I'd say being able to negotiate a transaction, I think, is a reasonable probability.
 I'd say prices are still relatively high. And so valuations for good assets tend to go at a pretty high level. So again, it's got to be an asset that can demonstrate that it's going to provide significant value to justify that kind of a valuation and a return. But we continue to look for opportunities. And I think as we find those kinds of opportunities, as I've said in the past, we're certainly going to pursue them. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Carter. Operator next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. 
Vamil Divan: Maybe a couple from me as well. So one, just a couple of data points you have coming up this year that I think may be a little bit less focused on is on Navitoclax and Teliso-V. So maybe you can just sort of frame so what we should be looking for, what your expectations are, what you're hoping to see from those assets, especially Teliso-V given your comments on the sort of next-gen ABBV-400?
 And then the other question, I guess, would be for Rick and is more on succession planning. I know we've talked -- you've mentioned before that your plans to stick around through the Humira bench. I'm just wondering if you have any sort of updated sort of thoughts around timing on that now that we're in the middle of this process. We've been getting some questions there, too. Is this something we should expect some sort of announcement this year? Or is it more -- are you're looking for 2024 or later? 
Roopal Thakkar: It's Roopal. I'll take the ones on Navitoclax and Teliso-V. So for Navitoclax, it's the combination with the JAK2 in myelofibrosis. And there, we're looking to be better than monotherapy with JAK2 in that space and improving spleen size and symptoms like abdominal pain, fullness, fever, fatigue. Also, perhaps uniquely, what we've observed is also an improvement in bone marrow fibrosis and a decrease in variant allelic frequency. So that's what we would be looking for, and we should get a readout by midyear or so.
 For Teliso-V, in lung cancer, EGFR wild type with high c-Met and that's the indication where we have breakthrough therapy designation. Around the end of this year, I would say that's where we would see a readout. What we've seen in earlier data cuts is an ORR above 50%, which is quite a bit higher than what would be expected in standard of care in that second, third line setting. And if the data looks strong, there's a potential that we could submit next year for an accelerated approval. 
Richard Gonzalez: I'll take the second question. And maybe I'll make a little bit of a comment on Teliso-V because I think you mentioned 400. I think the early data that we're seeing in 400 is impressive to us. There's no question about it. And I think we're going to have some data presented at this ASCO, right, where you'll have an opportunity to see that in CRC.
 Now having said that, Teliso-V, as Roopal said, does get very good responses in c-Met highs. But to get a broader set of c-MET population, we do believe you need to move to the Topol warhead and seems to get deeper responses and more durable responses.
 Data has to play out over time, but it appears to be a very good platform for c-MET. And so we need the data to mature, and we need to develop more data in that area. But I'd say the early data is pretty encouraging. You'll have a chance to see a snippet of that at this ASCO.
 As far as leadership changes, I'd say it's similar to what we've said in the first quarter or fourth quarter, I can't recall, last year around succession. We obviously have a process in place. We have a very experienced board. I've had many, many discussions with the Board about succession. The Board knows I'm committed to be here to ensure a successful and smooth transition. The criteria that we're operating against is we need to completely get through the transition for Humira biosimilars here in the U.S.
 I'd say, so far, I'm pretty pleased with how the transition is going. And I'm even more pleased with the way the growth platform is operating right now. And in fact, if you look at it this year, the growth platform is going to deliver mid-single digits and it's going to do it despite the headwinds that we see on Imbruvica and the headwinds that we're seeing from the economy on aesthetics. Once the aesthetics business returns to its normal growth rates and much of the pressure on Imbruvica starts to subside, we should see that growth rate increase significantly as we move into '24 for the growth platform.
 And obviously, returning to robust growth in '25 and deliver high single digit from that point forward. So that's the expectation that we're working against. So we want to make sure that the business is operating the way we want it to. We want to make sure that we're through the biosimilar erosion to the point that we believe it is predictable.
 And then obviously, the second part of the criteria is ensuring that the candidate that will succeed me is ready to do that. We can make a successful transition. I've also told the Board that I'm willing to stay in any capacity that they would desire for whatever length of time they would. I think the expectation right now is that I would assume the Executive Chairman role for a period of time to finish the transition to the new CEO. You should not be expecting that, that transition is going to occur in '23. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. 
Evan Seigerman: Just on kind of Skyrizi and some of the dynamics you're seeing there, can you characterize about kind of how you're thinking about further penetration in the psoriasis indication, kind of some puts and takes in the dermatology market? And just a follow-up on the CF program, is it safe to assume that you're totally done investing in this area? Or do you have other assets kind of in earlier development that could emerge? 
Jeffrey Stewart: Yes. It's Jeff. I'll take your comment on psoriasis. I think that, as I mentioned, it's -- the share is very, very impressive. So we have a 30% total market share now which is really putting significant headroom against any other drug in that category by a lot. And one way to think about it is, I think what you're asking is how much further can it run? And it can run quite a bit further. To some degree, if you think about it, so we're capturing on the dynamic share roughly 50%. So 1 out of every 2 patients. And our market share is about 30.
 So theoretically, over time, right, unless there's some disruption, which we don't see significant disruption in the market, your total market share is going to move towards that in-play share. Now that takes many, many years. But as we look at the fundamental momentum that we can achieve, it's still very, very significant. Add on to that, that basically, we're still in the rest of the world, starting to really see the PSA ramp. And remember, PSA has a very significant impact because it's treated by derms and it was sort of the last remaining gap that we had, so you're going to see continued momentum in the international markets and the U.S. market and we have a long way to run.
 And I'd be remiss if I didn't say how fast again that we're growing in both Crohn's right now and very exciting data in UC. And that market is very, very dynamic. So we feel very secure in our ability to continue to create a lot of value with Skyrizi. 
Thomas J. Hudson: This is Tom. Regarding the question on our triplet program, yes, we are -- our C2 corrector that we just tested did not work. This was not our first attempt that producing one and we do not have another backup. So we don't have other options than to discontinue the CF program. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Evan. Operator, next question, please. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with Credit Suisse. 
Carson Wong: This is Carson on for Trung. Just on Imbruvica, how confident are you for the [ 5.7 ] hem-onc guide given the significant competitive pressures there? I mean I understand Brukinsa did particularly have legs in the U.S. until late January. What level of pricing pressures can we expect through the year? And is there a potential for further step downs in your guide for later in the year? And if you do that, could the trough be pushed out given the delay with 951 as well? 
Jeffrey Stewart: Yes. It's Jeff. And I think we think that's a very good call. And just as a reminder, we're not seeing significant pricing pressure in the market. This is really two effects, which is one, the cumulative effect as we've highlighted over the suppressed market over time, which looks to be normalizing. Actually, for the first time in 3 years, we actually saw a positive growth in the market. So that's encouraging.
 The big driver is the share -- is the new patient share, which has been under pressure, initially under pressure by Calquence certainly from our own Venclexta and then the recent Brukinsa launch. And so when we put all of that into the calculus, we think we've got it right and it's probably unlikely that we're going to see any significant step down that would put that in jeopardy. 
Robert Michael: Carson, this is Rob. I'll answer your second question. So I wouldn't consider Imbruvica in 951 to be variables that would push the trough out. It's really more about how the overall year plays out, particularly the second half with U.S. Humira. So if U.S. Humira does better and we outperform in '23, then we could see the trough in '24. I think the important thing to keep in mind is regardless of when the trough occurs, we wouldn't expect earnings to fall below the [ 1074 ex-IPR&D ]. That's really what I would focus on, and we don't consider Imbruvica in 951 delays to be variables that would push that trough. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Carson. We are cognizant of a number of peers reporting today. And so in the interest of time, we have one last question. 
Operator: Our last question comes from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. 
Unknown Analyst: This is [ Susan ] on for Geoff Meacham. We had a follow-up on Imbruvica. Do you guys expect any changes to outlook following MCL/MDL withdrawal? And then do you expect any read-through to follicular lymphoma from that withdrawal? 
Jeffrey Stewart: It's Jeff. Thank you for the question. First, these are very small indications. So to give you some sense of the relative size for Imbruvica, MCL is about 4% of the value. MDL is really less than 1% or about 1%. So we don't anticipate that those withdrawals due to the fact that we didn't get the confirmatory studies to clear, we'll have a material impact. I think it's also important to note that many physicians will continue these patients on the medication. They won't be all switched, for example, or taken off and put on another product. That's the market intelligence. There's no requirement that they need to do that for the physicians. And so net-net, this is not a really material issue given the size of those indications. And I think Roopal will address your point on follicle. 
Roopal Thakkar: Yes, I can talk about FL here for a minute. So a Phase III readout is expected later this year. It's not clear if the MCL outcomes would be reflected in what we see there. But what I would say about FL is our focus would be with epcoritamab, or dual engager, which we expect DLBCL actions here soon. And then we have programs and we're seeing very high levels of response in FL with epco either as monotherapy or in combination, which we'll see some data in those combos in DLBCL and FL at ASCO as well. 
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, [ Susan ]. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us. 
Operator: Thank you for your participation. Participants, you may disconnect at this time.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-09 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn -- introduce the call to Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may proceed.
Liz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman and President; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President, Allergan Aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Scott Reents, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Roopal Thakkar, Vice President, Global Regulatory Affairs. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook and then Jeff, Carrie, Tom and Rob, who will review our business highlights pipeline progress financial results and 2023 guidance in more detail. Today, we reported another strong quarter and a highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $13.77 reflecting double-digit growth. Total net revenues of more than $58 billion were up by 5.1% on an operational basis, driven by impressive growth from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ which generated nearly $7.7 billion of combined sales in 2022. As I reflect on our 10 years as an independent company, we have made excellent progress evolving AbbVie into a leading biopharmaceutical company. We have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in attractive and sustainable markets. This includes the rapid development and launch of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ across all of HUMIRA's major indications, plus a distinct new indication, atopic dermatitis. We anticipate these 2 products will collectively exceed the peak revenues achieved by HUMIRA by 2027 with significant growth expected through the end of the decade. We are also building a substantial portfolio of novel, heme and solid tumor assays for oncology. The anticipated launches and indication ramp of several new products like venetoclax in multiple myeloma and MDS, epacritumab across B-cell malignancies and Teliso-V, a new treatment option in non-small cell lung cancer will collectively support growth in the middle of the decade. We expect continued robust performance in neuroscience with our leading on-market portfolio to address migraine and psychiatric conditions as well as a promising pipeline for neurodegenerative diseases. And we see significant long-term growth potential for aesthetics, an extremely attractive market which is underpenetrated, where we have the leading position in toxins with BOTOX cosmetic and Fillers Rejuvido [ph]. Second, we've established a productive innovation-driven R&D organization with a robust pipeline. Our R&D engine has discovered and developed Five major billion-plus medicines over the past decade. We are committed to pursuing new ways to address patients' most serious health issues and have more than doubled our annual R&D investment since our inception. The breadth and the depth of our pipeline which now includes more than 80 programs across all development stages, further supports our long-term growth outlook. Lastly, we have maintained a strong financial position. to fully invest in innovative science and commercial initiatives across our therapeutic categories to drive long-term growth. We've also used that financial position to support a robust and growing dividend which we have increased by 270% since our inception. And we have also used it as capacity to pursue value-enhancing business development to augment our existing portfolio and pipeline. With these strong operating characteristics, we remain well positioned to absorb the impact of the HUMIRA LLE and quickly return to robust sales growth in 2025. As it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we anticipate 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $10.70 to $11.10. This guidance range contemplates, we expected headwind from direct biosimilar competition with U.S. HUMIRA sales down approximately 37% which is at the lower end of our previous erosion projection of 35% to 55%. Robust performance from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ which we expect will collectively generate $11.1 billion of revenue, reflecting year-over-year growth of nearly 45%. Revenue pressure in [indiscernible] with recent challenging market and share dynamics impacting IMBLUVICA, partially offset by strong sales growth of venetoclax. Double-digit revenue growth of neuroscience including accelerating sales of Vraylar with our recent MDD approval. Our guidance also contemplates the transient economic impact primarily in the U.S. on aesthetic procedure growth, affecting near-term performance for toxins, fillers and body contouring. Given that it's difficult to predict the duration of economic and inflationary pressures, we have not assumed the recovery in 2023. And finally, this guidance reflects increasing investments in both R&D and SG&A to support our long-term growth opportunities. It's also important to note that while it is possible 2023 could outperform our guidance, depending upon the shape of the HUMIRA erosion curve. We don't anticipate that 2024 earnings will be lower than the $10.70 for of the 2023 adjusted earnings per share guidance which we are issuing today. In summary, we are executing well across our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology which delivered total revenues of more than $7.9 billion, up 19.5% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $2.3 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 70%. SKYRIZI continues to exceed our expectations, outperforming our initial full year guidance by more than $750 million. Global revenues this quarter were nearly $1.6 billion, up 12.8% on a sequential basis. SKYRIZI is achieving strong market share momentum globally with in-play psoriatic disease leadership in 24 countries and total market share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. In psoriasis, SKYRIZI's total prescription share of the U.S. biologic psoriasis market has increased to more than 28%. And there is substantial room for continued growth in psoriasis based on SKYRIZI's leading in-play share of new and switching patients which remains at nearly 50%. Psoriatic arthritis is also providing a nice inflection to SKYRIZI sales, especially in the U.S. Dermatology segment, where we have achieved approximately 10% share of the total biologic market. And we are also seeing encouraging SKYRIZI new patient starts in the U.S. room segment as well which accounts for more than 80% of all PSA treatments. SKYRIZI is being co-positioned with RINVO to rheumatologists where these 2 products combined have already achieved a leading in-play PSA room share of approximately 16%. In Crohn's disease, we are making excellent progress with the U.S. launch. Feedback from gastroenterologists has been very positive, especially as it relates to SKYRIZI's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We recently started DTC promotion for this indication and are already achieving a total in-play patient share of more than 15%. Turning now to invoke which delivered global sales of $770 million, representing double-digit sequential growth. In rheumatology, global prescriptions are ramping nicely across RINVOQ's 4 approved indications, RA, PSA, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We continue to see positive market share momentum in both the U.S. and across key international geographies. In atopic dermatitis, RINVOQ is demonstrating strong uptake in both treatment naive and second-line patients globally. Feedback from the global derm community supports the importance of RINVOQ as a long-term chronic therapy to control atopic dermatitis, especially as it relates to skin clearance and rapid itch relief. RINVOQ AD prescriptions are trending up globally with 20% to 35% in-place shares across our major international markets and a mid-teens in-place share in the U.S. which are both tracking in line with our expectations. In gastroenterology, the launch trends for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis are very strong. Physicians have been pleased with RINVOQ's high rates of endoscopic healing as well as the speed of onset which has quickly resulted in RINVOQ achieving approximately 20% in-play share in the U.S. second line plus setting. Internationally, RINVOQ UC is now approved in 50 countries with reimbursement discussions progressing in line with our expectations. This strong adoption in UC amongst gastroenterologists is very encouraging for RINVOQ's potential in Crohn's disease as well. We are on track for U.S. and EMA regulatory decisions in the second quarter and are preparing for the commercial launch. Global HUMIRA sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 6% on an operational basis with 9.9% growth in the U.S. partially offset by international, where revenues were down 16.9% operationally due to biosimilar competition. In the U.S., we have secured broad formulary access for HUMIRA encompassing more than 90% of all covered lives which enables us to compete for patient volume at parity to biosimilars. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.6 billion, down 11.2% on an operational basis. Imbruvica [ph] global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 19.5%. The U.S. performance continues to be impacted by challenging market and share dynamics attributed to the pace of COVID recovery as well as increasing competition. Venclexta global sales were $56 million, up 12.2% on an operational basis, with continued strong demand in both AML and CLL. We are particularly pleased with the international performance driven by robust share gains in the EU and across Asia. In neuroscience, revenues were $1.7 billion, up 5.1% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth. Sales of $565 million were up 15.5% on an operational basis, reflecting increasing market share, primarily in bipolar 1 disorder. Vraylar was also recently approved as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder, marking its fourth approved indication and adding a new substantial opportunity for long-term growth. We are very pleased with the AMDD label which confirms Vraylar's strong benefit risk profile, dosing flexibility with positive efficacy results for both the 1.5 and 3-milligram dose and the ability to reduce depressive symptoms as an add-on for the partial responders who present and this is important, with or without symptoms of anxiety. The AMDD launch is off to a strong start and we are already seeing a nice inflection in total new prescriptions in the marketplace. Within migraine, our leading oral CGRP portfolio contributed $249 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and QULIPTA. We are also pursuing in the U.S. commercial approval for QULIPTA as a preventative treatment for patients with chronic migraine which would further strengthen our competitive profile and uniquely position QULIPTA as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. Rounding out the migraine portfolio is BOTOX Therapeutic, a unique treatment with a dozen approved therapeutic indications and the clear branded leader in chronic migraine prevention. Total BOTOX Therapeutic sales were $728 million, up 10.7% on an operational basis. And last, we continue to prepare for the launch of ABBV-951 in both the U.S., Europe and Japan later this year. 951 represents a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. So overall, I'm pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?
Carrie Strom: Thank you, Jeff. Full year 2022, global aesthetic sales were approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting growth of 5% on an operational basis. Global Botox cosmetic sales were approximately $2.6 billion, up nearly 21% operationally and global Juvederm sales were approximately $1.4 billion, down roughly 2% operationally. Our global aesthetics portfolio grew in 2022 despite several headwinds, most notably inflationary dynamics in the U.S., COVID-related lockdowns in China and suspension of our operations in Russia. In the U.S. we began to see a slowdown in aesthetic procedures in the second quarter of last year which coincided with the softening in economic metrics. These trends continued through the end of the year with the most significant impact on higher priced more deferrable procedures, including fillers and body contouring. Despite these economic pressures, U.S. Botox cosmetic sales grew approximately 16% in 2022, driven by strong first half sales with growth moderating over the remainder of the year. Similarly, U.S. Juvederm saw strong growth in the first quarter of the year but filler market declines throughout the second half of the year resulted in full year sales being down approximately 17% versus a robust 2021. We continue to track a number of key external economic metrics, including real personal consumption and the U.S. Consumer Confidence Index. While we have not seen major improvements in these metrics, data over the course of the last several months has shown stabilization. It remains difficult to predict the duration of these economic headwinds. But as Rick noted, we have modeled them to persist through the end of 2023. Our international aesthetics portfolio continued to demonstrate robust growth with the strong performance in most major markets, offsetting impacts from China and Russia. International Botox cosmetic sales of nearly $1 billion were up approximately 29% operationally and international Juvederm sales grew approximately 9% on an operational basis. We delivered this performance despite the significant headwinds we faced last year in our 2 largest international filler market, China and Russia. While our aesthetics portfolio in China continues to be impacted by COVID-related headwinds -- the current wave appears to have peaked. We expect the situation to improve through the first half of 2023 with full recovery in China beginning in the third quarter. Despite the transitory challenges we're facing, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio. Consumers continue to be very interested in the aesthetics category and in our brands. We see substantial room for further market penetration across each of our aesthetics categories and are continuing to invest to support long-term growth. Our promotional efforts are focused on driving more consumers into our customers' offices while increasing retention and productivity of existing patients. We have built a best-in-class commercial technology team known for developing our consumer loyalty program, Eli. We have over 5 million consumers who use Eli and more than 20,000 of our customers' offices. We have a series of new technology products launching this year to drive growth in the aesthetics market and support our customers and consumers. Internationally, we are focused on markets with significant growth potential. We have increased investments in injector training and expanded our field force in China which is our second largest market. Latin America which is very aesthetically oriented and Japan which is growing rapidly and is expected to be one of our fastest-growing markets in 2023. Additionally, we are focused on delivering new product innovation. This year, we're launching 2 new fillers in the U.S., VOLUX for improvement of jawline which was approved late last year and Skin Vive for enhanced skin quality attributes, including hydration which is expected to be approved in the first half of 2023. We're also continuing to launch Harmonica, our hybrid bio-stimulatory HA filler in several international markets. The investments we're making to support long-term growth for our aesthetics portfolio, along with the stabilizing economic outlook and improving tobidynamics in China, leave us well positioned for future growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Tom Hudson: Thank you, Carrie. We expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline this year. In immunology, we continue to make very good progress with programs in our core diseases as well as in adjacent areas of rheumatology and dermatology, where we are expanding our portfolio. We're nearing completion of SKYRIZI's registrational program in ulcerative colitis which is the last major indication expansion program for SKYRIZI. In the first half of this year, we'll see data from the Phase III induction and maintenance studies for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year. We'll also see data this year from our head-to-head comparison studies evaluating SKYRIZI versus other commonly used agents which we expect will further distinguish its profile from competitive offerings. These studies include our Phase III trial in Crohn's disease versus STELARA and our Phase III trial in psoriasis versus Otezla. Results from these studies will add to the body of evidence supporting SKARIZI as a best-in-category agent in these indications. We're also nearing completion of the core indication expansion programs for RINVOQ. Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ and Crohn's disease are under review and we anticipate approval decisions in the second quarter. RINVOQ demonstrated very strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement in our Phase III induction and maintenance studies and we believe RINVOQ will be an important new treatment option once approved in Crohn's disease. This is a market where approximately 80% of bioexperience patients have used the TNF inhibitor and there remains considerable unmet need for therapies that can deliver high rates of response and long-term remission. Beyond our core immunology indications, we're developing RINVOQ in several diseases where we've seen strong evidence that our JAK inhibitor has the potential to become a highly effective therapy. Our Phase III program is already underway in 1 of these indications, giant cell arteritis. And later this year, we plan to begin Phase III studies for 4 additional diseases, systemic lupus, hidradenitis suppurativa, vitiligo and alopecia areata. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we expect several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year. In the area of hematology oncology, we'll see data from several Phase III studies, including results from Venclexta's event-driven de novo trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a T114 mutation and Navitoclax' TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. Results from these studies are expected to support regulatory submissions in the second half of the year for Venclexta and navitoclax in their respective indications. We also anticipate regulatory approval this year for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma in several major geographies, including the U.S. in the second quarter and in Europe and Japan in the second half of the year. Based on the very deep and drillable responses demonstrated thus far in our clinical program, we believe that epcoritamab has the potential to significantly improve upon treatment options for these patients. We believe that epcoritamab has the potential to become a core therapy for B-cell malignancies. And we continue to make very good progress, expanding our development programs for epcoritamab across several indications. Over the course of 2023, we expect to begin several new studies, including a Phase III study in frontline DLBCL in combination with R-CHOP and multiple Phase II studies in CLL and MCL. We remain very excited about epcroritumab's potential to become a best-in-class therapy across multiple B-cell malignancies and look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving our solid tumor pipeline. We remain on track to see data later this year from our Phase II study evaluating Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. As a reminder, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for Teliso-V, our c-Met ADC, based on the encouraging results from Stage 1 of this Phase II study and the data we'll see later this year has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Our Phase III confirmatory study in patients with overexpressed c-MET is also ongoing. Treatment options for these cancer patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are very limited and prognosis for these patients is extremely poor. As a targeted therapy for patients with overexpressed cement which represents approximately 25% of the non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer population, we believe Teliso-V has the potential to become an important new treatment option for these patients. We're also making good progress with our next-generation c-MET ADC, ABBV-400 which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload, to potentially drive deeper tumor responses as well as broaden the range of solid tumors where c-MET therapies can be used such as gastroesophageal and colorectal tumors. We expect to see early data from our Phase I program in 2024. Elsewhere in the solid tumor pipeline, we have begun to see encouraging data from several programs which we plan to advance into Phase II studies this year. Our anti-GARP antibody, ABBV-151 is showing strong signals of activity, including deep responses with prolonged durability. Based on this preliminary efficacy, we plan to initiate Phase II studies in several tumor types. We also plan to advance ABBV-647 into Phase II dose optimizing studies this year based on the promising results from our early stage program. This ADC targets PTK7 which is a subset of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and represents approximately 25% of patients and has little overlap with c-MetSo our c-Met ADCs and PTK7 ADC combined will target approximately 45% of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. Now moving to neuroscience, where we recently received FDA approval for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder which marks its fourth indication approval. We're very excited by this approval and pleased with the label which highlights Real or strong benefit risk profile in this indication. Vraylar is an important new treatment option for patients who are currently taking an antidepressant but continue to have unresolved depression symptoms. We also recently received approval in Japan for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. This innovative approach to delivering DUOPA-LIKE efficacy through a subcutaneous delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. With a less invasive, nonsurgical delivery system, it also has the potential to significantly expand the patient population currently addressed by DUOPA or other more invasive therapies for advanced PD patients such as deep brain stimulation. We remain on track for approval decisions this year in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S., we anticipate approval in the first half of the year, with product launch expected in the second half after we secured reimbursement. And in Europe, we anticipate approval in the fourth quarter of this year. And in the area of migraine, we remain on track for an FDA approval decision in the second quarter of this year for QULIPTA as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine. In Europe, we anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine. If approved, this would be another differentiating feature for Lipa as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. This is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life and we look forward to make this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. And in our aesthetics pipeline, we expect to see results this year from several toxin programs including data from our Phase III study for Botox in platysma prominence with regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of 2023 as well as data from our Phase III study for BOTOX in masseter muscle prominence, where we expect to submit regulatory applications in certain international markets in the second half of the year, including China and Canada. These 2 novel indications for prominent neck and jaw muscles will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment. We'll also see data from our Phase III trial for Bot-AE or short-acting toxin in glabellar lines near the end of this year with regulatory applications plan for 2024. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2023 financial outlook. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Tom. AbbVie's performance and financial foundation remains strong with our leadership positions across a diverse portfolio, we are well positioned to return to robust growth by 2025. Starting with fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.60 which is $0.07 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.13 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion, up 3.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 52.1% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 86% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.5% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.8% of sales. Net interest expense was $476 million and the adjusted tax rate was 13.4%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2023. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $10.70 and $11.10. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect net revenues of approximately $52 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a neutral impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect immunology sales of $24.8 billion, including SKYRIZI sales of $7.4 billion, reflecting growth of more than $2.2 billion due to strong market share performance across all approved indications. RINVOQ revenue of $3.7 billion, reflecting growth of more than 45% with continued indication expansion and HUMIRA sales of $13.7 billion, including U.S. erosion of 37% and following a loss of exclusivity in late January. With 1 biosimilar currently in the market and potentially 9 more biosimilars available in the middle of the year, we anticipate that sales erosion will be more heavily weighted towards the second half of 2023. In hematologic oncology, we expect VENCLEXTA sales of $2.2 billion and [indiscernible] revenue of $3.5 billion. For aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.2 billion, including $2.5 billion from Botox Cosmetic and $1.4 billion from Juvederm, with growth rates expected to improve when we lap the market slowdown in the middle of the year. For neuroscience, we expect revenue of $7.2 billion representing growth of more than 10%, including Botox Therapeutic sales of $2.8 billion, Vraylar sales of $2.5 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.1 billion, including Ubrelvy growth of approximately 17.5%. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion and we expect Mavyret revenue of $1.4 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2023. We are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of $6.8 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of $12.4 billion. We forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of 47% of sales. This profile includes a 70 basis point benefit that is fully offset in tax expense given the transition of Puerto Rico's excise tax to an income tax effective at the beginning of this year. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $1.8 billion and we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be 15.3%, including an impact of 1.3 points from the Puerto Rico tax transition. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2022. Turning to the first quarter. We anticipate net revenues of $11.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas. Immunology sales of $5.5 billion which includes U.S. HUMIRA erosion of 27%, Oncology revenue of $1.4 billion. Aesthetic sales approaching $1.2 billion; Neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion; and eye care sales approaching $600 million. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 46% of sales and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 13.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.39 and $2.49. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of nearly $19 billion in 2023 which is net of $1.4 billion in SKYRIZI royalty payments. This cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend which we have increased by 270% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down $4 billion in maturities this year bringing our cumulative debt reduction to $34 billion. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong results in 2022. And with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator?
Operator: Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.
Mohit Bansal: And so maybe a question -- a bigger question for Rick. So AbbVie -- when we talk to investors, AbbVie has always been 1 of those. The R&D as a percent of sales has always been low. And right now, even it is still less than 15% and that's the pushback we get that the company cannot grow organically. And in some ways, you have always been playing defensive given that since inception, HUMIRA has always been an issue. Now that you're beginning to get past that, do you think something you'll change -- you want to change fundamentally with the company and the way you allocate internal versus external R&D spend? That would be very helpful.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. This is Rick. So it's a good question. We've obviously heard that question. I think there's a number of dynamics that play into it. when you look at our R&D expense as a profile. One is, obviously, we have a large volume of HUMIRA revenue that requires relatively little R&D support. And so that obviously dilutes out the profile of the business. As we see biosimilar impact, obviously, there will be some impact on that as you know, our revenues were to go down. The second thing is the aesthetics business, we're funding it aggressively to grow it. But by definition, it's not that expensive to be able to fund many of those programs. So it has a much lower profile. So some of it is mix when you think about it. The second thing I'd say is we obviously fund R&D at a level that we believe we can drive productivity. And I think if you look at our productivity over the last 10 years, the data I've seen suggests we are 1 of the most productive R&D engines in the industry. Certainly, when you look at products like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, the return on those assets is tremendous. The third thing I'd say is, look, what drives R&D expense to the greatest extent is when you have large volumes of Phase III programs. And we're coming into a phase as we move forward over the next 3 or 4 years, where we have a number of programs that if they are successful, they will create a scenario where we will increase R&D. So an example of that would be our GARP program. We've seen some incredibly encouraging data out of that program thus far to next-generation immuno-oncology program. That combines with checkpoint inhibitors. And if that program continues to advance the way we see it now, we would want to expand our as our Phase II and then Phase III trials in that program significantly across the relatively broad range of solid tumors. That will require a significant increase in investment to be able to do that. So we tend to drive R&D based on programs that we have a high level of confidence can be productive and can be successful. And we don't constrain R&D in any way from that perspective. Another program will be our AbbVie program. If that program proves to deliver high rates of amyloid reduction and low REA. That will be another program that we want to rapidly move into Phase III. And so I can tell you, I'm very comfortable with the productivity we're getting out of R&D. Certainly, we will want to continue to increase that and that's 1 of our objectives. We always look at programs on the outside to bring them in. And in fact, I'd say over the last couple of years, we brought in a number of programs that are earlier stage programs. And we're fortunate from the standpoint that we have the ability to drive very strong growth, as we've indicated to investors between now and the end of this decade. We can drive high single-digit growth. We're going to return to robust growth in '25. So we're looking mostly for assets that will allow us to drive growth in that late 20s and early 30s time frame. So again, as those mature and they're successful and they go into later-stage development programs, they will drive further need for investment.
Rob Michael: Mohit, this is Rob. I'll just add that. If you look at this year's guide, it's a great example of our willingness to increase R&D investment where it's needed. So if you look at we're increasing it from $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion. Those increases are focused on epcoritamab as well as midstage assets such as GARP and PTK7. We also have several new Phase III studies for additional RINVOQ indications which could contribute several billion dollars of revenue in the latter half of the decade. So even in the year where we're seeing a decline in the top line, we're increasing R&D investments. We're very committed to increasing innovation investment, whether it's internal or external.
Operator: Our next question is from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.
Terence Flynn: I guess, I just wondered, high level, if there was anything different, Rick, or Rob, about your approach to guidance on the revenue side this year versus last year. I think last year, performance was choppy across a number of different franchises. So as you thought about the guidance this year, anything different as you approached it? And then my second question is any other details you can provide on how you're thinking about HUMIRA in 2024. Obviously, I appreciate the color this year but how should we think about 2024 dynamics in the U.S.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So maybe I'll start and then Rob can fill in anything that I might miss. I think whenever we look at guidance, we look at it and I think this has been our historical practice. We obviously look at guidance as something that we have a very high level that we can execute against that guidance. I would say this year, you've seen that the range is a little bit wider than what we normally project. And we did that based on the fact that as HUMIRA goes biosimilar, obviously, very small changes in the assumptions we're making on erosion for HUMIRA can have a fairly significant impact. So we're right in the range by about $0.10. and that's reflected in this guidance. And so I would say that as we have in historically, we have a high level of confidence we're going to deliver on this guidance. As it relates to 2024, we have provided as part of this guidance, what we are projecting to be a floor because we've gotten a lot of requests from investors about when will we hit the trough and will it be '23 or will it be '24? So maybe to give you a little color around how we think about that. One, the $10.70 is a floor. That doesn't mean that we will go down to $10.70 but it means that we would say to investors that, that's what you should assume is the absolute floor. Now when will that or if it were to occur, when we occur? Will we see the drop in 2023? Or will we see the trough in 2024. And I would tell you that our expectations would be based on this plan, the trough should occur in 2023. But what I would tell you is if we significantly overachieved this plan into 2023 and there's obviously somewhat greater risk it could move into '24. The reason why it is in '23 versus '24 based on our current planning assumptions, is because the strength of the growth platform has the ability between where it will grow in '23 and where we're growing 24% to offset what will obviously be further erosion of HUMIRA in 2024. 2024, you will basically have to impacts on HUMIRA. You will have the annualization of this year. And as Rob said in his remarks, we expect more of an impact in the second half of '23. So when you annualize that, you're going to have an impact that flows through to '24. And then we would expect further erosion of HUMIRA, both price and probably to a greater extent, volume in 2024. But the growth platform has the ability to grow through that based on those assumptions. And so that's the philosophy that we operate with on the guidance. Rob, anything you'd add?
Rob Michael: I think if you reflect back on the history of AbbVie, we've had a long track record at delivering exceeding our guidance. I think 2022 is an exception. And if you look at on the top line now, we didn't make earnings. So that's important to highlight. If you look at the top line, the 2 biggest factors that drove the miss versus original guidance in 2022 were with Imbruvica and Venclexta, the CLO market, we did not anticipate that, that market would actually not recover. I mean that's -- it's down 20% versus pre-pandemic levels. And then we did see some additional share impact on IMBRUVICA. And then aesthetics, we saw, obviously, in the month of May, we started to see a slowdown in the economy. We had a very strong first quarter. So both of those things really are what drove the top line miss, we made earnings. Now we have factored both those things in the 2023 guidance to give investors confidence that we said it appropriately. But we always look to set the most responsible guidance we can and we feel good about where we set 2023.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
Chris Schott: Just 2 for me. Maybe just following up on the 2023 guidance being a trough number. It seems like you're still going to have about a $12 billion U.S. HUMIRA franchise here. So can you just provide maybe a little bit more color of what you're envisioning 2024 to look like for HUMIRA? Like is it reasonable to think about the down 35% to 40% year as we look out to '24. I think we just turn your hands around just the how much growth in that core platform and how much of a headwind, I guess, HUMIRA is going to be facing at the same time. My second question was just on aesthetics trends as we move through this year. You've talked about some signs of at least sequential stability the last few quarters. You're talking about stepping up investments. You've got a couple of new products launching. I guess why shouldn't we think about some recovery in this business as we look out to the second half of the year?
Rick Gonzalez: Chris, this is Rick. Let me talk a little bit about HUMIRA and the trough. We're 2 weeks into the biosimilar activity. So it's a little difficult to give you precise predictions or 2024. I think the way to think about HUMIRA going forward is what we would expect is the most significant impact on HUMIRA is going to be price. And obviously, we're trying to predict going forward what that price will look like. Certainly, as we look at this year, the most significant impact is clearly price. So that's more predictable because we obviously know what the pricing is in the contracts that we've put together. And so I think that's something that we have a high level of confidence. There will be further pressure on price as we move into '24 and there'll probably be further pressure on volume in '24d. But I would say, at the end of '24, I would expect HUMIRA to start to develop a more stable tail of revenue. It will still have some pressure as we move in '25 but '25 and '26 is where we should see that more stable tail for HUMIRA emerge. And that's 1 of the things that allows us to be able to see the underlying growth from the growth platform. So a number of things happen between '23 and '24 and then '25 as we move forward. As you mentioned in your second comment, we would certainly expect that the U.S. economy will start to recover in '24. It may recover earlier than that. And if it does, that would be great. We don't want to put a plan together to assume that because obviously, that's difficult for us to predict. But I think we would all expect that 24 will see a recovery in the U.S. economy. And we would fully expect for the aesthetics business to return back to historical growth rates very quickly when that happens. And so that will be another opportunity for that business to be able to grow. And then I would say Imbruvica is the other key issue for us. as we move forward. We would expect the majority of the erosion that we see on Imbruvica will occur this year and there will be less downward pressure as we move to '24. So that's what allows the growth to be able to come up. What I would tell you even though I don't want to make a; prediction in '24 of what HUMIRA will look like. I think we have a high level of confidence that we have the ability if the erosion curve looks like how we've modeled it now between '23 and '24 that we have the ability to be able to have the growth platform and go through that. So we can absorb that impact. And so far, like I said, it's early on but I'd say so far, we're comfortable with how things are playing out. Rob, anything you want to add on the first question and Carrie, maybe you can give a little more color.
Rob Michael: I think you characterized it well, Rick. I mean the thing to highlight for this year for '23, the way you think about HUMIRA really in the first half of the year, the vast majority of that erosion will be priced. In the second half, you'll see because we've contracted rebates, you'll see a step-up in the price erosion, although you also will see more volume with biosimilars coming in the market in the middle of the year, we would expect more volume erosion. I think as we think about '24, we would expect, based on the contract to see a step up in price but albeit not at the same level as we see in '23 but '24 would be more volume. It's probably the best way to think about it right now. We're not going to give you guidance but if you think about how to model HUMIRA '23, '24, that's the way to think through it.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Carrie, anything you want to add on aesthetics?
Carrie Strom: Yes. This is Carrie. The -- in terms of the aesthetics market and how we're thinking about it for 2023, I mean, first, I'd say, yes, this is still a very strong fundamental market with consumers who are very interested in entering the category. And so that remains a strong opportunity the now and in the future. But what we saw as we exited 2022 is as these economic metrics were softening, we also saw that reflected in demand for aesthetic procedures. And in our conversations with customers, we saw that reflected in their practices, market research with consumers, where they said, yes, we're interested in the category but we want to see what's going on with the economy, perhaps before a new patient might want to enter the category. And based on that, we are modeling for those trends to continue in 2023. And what that means for U.S. toxin market is the market growth would be around a mid-single-digit decline for U.S. filler market around a 10% decline. And like we said, those growth rates would be different by quarter as we lap a strong first part of the year. Now of course, if there is a scenario like a deep recession, where unemployment skyrockets, that is not something that we've contemplated. Or on the other hand, if the macroeconomic environment stabilizes or improve that would represent favorability to our plan.
Operator: Our next question is from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets.
Gary Nachman: First question is on neuro in the quarter. It's actually weaker than we thought. So was there any additional pressure on gross to net, maybe for the oral CGRPs? And what sort of inflection are you expecting for Vraylar and MDD, how rapid do you think that adoption might be this year? And then, Rick, you recently said that you would be in an article that you would be lifting the self-imposed $2 billion annual cap on business development that you have more capacity to do deals. So how much capacity do you guys have what areas are you looking to be most aggressive? And how important is it to add sizable marketed products into the mix? Or would it be mostly focused on pipeline?
Jeff Stewart: Yes. I'll take the first one, it's Jeff. Thanks for the question. No, we did not see material incremental pressure on the gross to net -- we did see a little softening versus our expectation on the overall preventative marketplace but it was quite modest. So no, fairly consistent trending. I mean if you look at our new prescription capture and the oral market, it's basically a 50-50 shared capture rate between ourselves and the major competitor. In terms of the Vraylar adoption trend, we had discussed previously because we really have very, very strong access for Vraylar that we would anticipate a pretty rapid inflection in adoption for the depression indication, the adjunctive depression indication. As I mentioned in my remarks, that's what we've seen. So we're quite encouraged. I mean we can see a significant trend break on the new prescription adoption versus what was already a very nice growth rate for the bipolar 1 indication. So I think the early dynamics and again, it's only really been a month here in January where our sales force has been out promoting the new indication. We're quite encouraged in terms of the market response, both from the metrics in terms of IQVIA, the scripts we see but also the qualitative feedback from the customers.
Rick Gonzalez: And on deal capacity, we obviously look at business development based on what we believe are -- we're trying to accomplish strategically in each of the therapeutic areas that we're operating in. we identify areas that we think would be good opportunities for us and then we look to see if we can find those kinds of assets. As I mentioned before, I think we're in the fortune of a position that we can drive very strong growth. with the assets that we have on the market today as well as what's coming out of our pipeline over the next 3 or 4 years. That gives us the ability to be able to return to growth and then drive that high single-digit growth through the end of the decade. And we're also fortunate that after HUMIRA, we have a -- relative to our peers, we have a very low LOE [ph] exposure. So we don't have a lot of downward pressure on the business. Now having said that, we've done an excellent job of paying down the incremental debt from the Allergan transaction, we put that $2 billion cap in place when we did the Allergan acquisition that allowed us to focus again on some earlier-stage assets. And I'd remind everyone that was about 4x what our historical practice has been for those kinds of assets. So there was plenty of capacity to do that. But we're certainly in a position now that if the right thing were to come along, we could do a transaction that would be much larger. We certainly have the financial wherewithal to be able to do that. And we've certainly shown that we were able to do that and create value in the assets that we bring in. The areas that we typically look at are aligned with our therapeutic growth areas. So immunology, oncology, certain areas of neuroscience and eye care, I would say, are the predominant areas as well as aesthetics. We obviously continue to look for opportunities in the states. They tend to be smaller acquisitions, though. And so at the end of the day, I feel good about where we are and we've been quite active. We have a very active business development group. And we'll continue to look at those. And like I said, we find something that's of interest and it could really help us round out a category that we're in, then you should expect us to act on that.
Operator: It comes from Carter Gould with Barclays.
Carter Gould: Maybe to come back to aesthetics. It does sound like you built in conservatism on a number of fronts. I wanted to also -- you didn't touch much around sort of China reopening and how you expect that sort of business to -- as it comes back, if you expect it to sort of return to how it was? Or if that will evolve differently. And then in the -- I guess as we think then around the guidance for '23 and the link you've drawn to as you sort of maybe if the guidance potentially evolves over '23, should we think about that link remaining intact? Or is that sort of a near-term phenomenon and that will sort of, I guess, disappear going forward.
Rick Gonzalez: Carrie, why don't you touch on the aesthetics question.
Carrie Strom: Yes. So your question around China and I'd say China is our second largest global business. It has demonstrated significant growth in the past few years and proven to be very responsive to the increased promotion that we're putting into that market. Of course, in 2022, China COVID-related issues did impact the aesthetics market, especially in the second and fourth quarters. Now, as we look at the year beginning in China and as everyone is returning from the Chinese New Year, it does look like the current wave has peaked. And that the situation is beginning to improve and will continue to improve through the first half of 2023 and we're expecting a full recovery in the market in Q3 and for the second half the year. So despite the challenges in 2022, China still posted positive growth and we will definitely be continuing our investments in China in 2023 and beyond.
Rob Michael: And Carter, this is Rob. I'll try to answer your second question. I think the way to think about '24 -- clearly, as we go through the year, we always look at the trends and contemplate what that could mean for flow through in '24. But the reason we gave you that guidance range, we mentioned the $10.70 [ph] being the way to think about it as a floor for '24 is because of the dynamics around the HUMIRA erosion. So if we do better in '23 and more of it happens in '24, then you can at least anchor back to we're not going to fall below that $10.70 EPS floor in our guidance range. So we always would factor in trends but that's the way to think about it. If it's just the erosion on HUMIRA is better this year than we have in this guidance. We want to make sure you understood that what it means potentially for '24. So that's again, always factor in trends. But as we sit here today, that's the best way to think about it.
Rick Gonzalez: Maybe just let me add 1 thing that might help clarify it. I think you should think about HUMIRA in '24. We believe we're going to get to a certain level of price and volume in '24, almost regardless of what happens in 2013 because of the competitive dynamic. And so when we talk about the shift, what we're really talking about is inflating '23. If you anchor '24 is a solid point that we have a high level of confidence of where HUMIRA's tail will be in '24. And the only thing that happens to shift it between '23 and '24 is that we do much better in '23 than we expected, right? So that inflates but it still anchors against the '24 point [ph]. That's the way to think about this.
Operator: It comes from Steve Scala with Cowen.
Steve Scala: The low end of 2023 guidance implies 22% EPS erosion, the high end of Q1 guidance assumes 21% EPS erosion. How is it possible that Q1 could be in line with the full year and not appreciably better? It seems as though the Q1 guide is low? Or is that because AbbVie believes the floor on HUMIRA price is already reached? Maybe another way to restate the question. What should be our anticipation for the quarterly cadence of EPS as we go through the year?
Rob Michael: So Steve, so I think the best way is 1 anchor on the guidance we gave you on U.S. HUMIRA today. So we said for the first quarter, we said it would be 27% erosion. And so -- and that's going to -- the vast majority of that will be priced. And we said because there'll be 9 biosimilars coming to market in the middle of the year, we would expect more of the erosion to come in the second half of the year. So you have to factor that dynamic into the way you look at the quarters that there'll be more erosion in the second half of the year for HUMIRA versus the first half of the year. Then you also have to factor in that you've got things like aesthetics, we haven't quite lapped the economic impact yet, right? So in the first quarter, you have a dynamic where you will see aesthetics still down, right? But when we get into the middle of the year, when we lap it, that also affects your year-over-year growth rates. And then, the underlying performance of the growth platform as we continue to drive those brands, you'll see those growth rates accelerate. So those are all the things that would factor as you look at the quarterly -- really, we've given you Q1 and then full year. We haven't given you Q2, 3 and 4. But that -- those are the variables I would look at. There's not really a whole lot in terms of if you look at investment, for example, that you have to flex. We do tend to see some higher levels typically in the fourth quarter. So, you could -- you could look at historically our investment patterns and use that as a proxy. But those are the variables to consider as you think about the first quarter versus the rest of the year.
Operator: It will come from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: I'm going to torch you with a couple more questions on the same subject as others. The U.S. HUMIRA erosion guidance of minus 37% in '23. How much of that is price versus volume? If I look at what your Q1 U.S. HUMIRA erosion is, so the guidance is minus 27%. Given that volumes for HUMIRA are, call it, 5% positive, that would suggest the price cuts may be in the 30% to 35% range. So can we triangulate off of the Q1 guidance to understand what percent of that minus 37% comes from price? And then the second question, again, goes back to 2024. I know there's lots of uncertainty on the exact rate of erosion for HUMIRA '23. But if you hit that minus 37% right on the nose, would 2024 erosion likely be slower or faster than net minus 37%.
Rob Michael: So Tim, on your question related to price and volume. The way to think about it is in the first half of the year, the 27% in the first quarter, is the vast majority of that is price, right? So there is some volume impact but not very much. it's in the second half, what you'll see is in the second half, the overall erosion will step up and think of it as equivalent between price and volume because you're going to have -- we know we'll have rebate rates in some cases, increasing as well as the biosimilars coming to market, we expect to see more volume erosion. So as you think about -- as you're trying to triangulate the price volume with the guidance you've given, 27% vast majority's price, second half of the year, you'll have some more volume kicking in. That's I think the best way to think about the price volume split. And then your question on '24, is your question in terms of the percentage or the absolute percentage [ph]?
Tim Anderson: So, if you hit the minus 37% this year which is your guidance for U.S. HUMIRA, the rate of erosion in '24 would be greater or less than that 37%?
Rob Michael: So we're not going to give you a 2024 guidance, Tim. I think the way to think about '24 is we would expect to see additional price but albeit not at the same level as '23 and more volume coming through because you're going to have up to 10 biosimilars in the market for the full year. So we would expect to see more of a volume impact in '24 that we would expect to see in '23.
Operator: It comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.
Chris Shibutani: You previously commented about the operating margin trajectory of '23 into '24. I believe characterizing them is basically flattish. Is that still the case? And then across the immunology category broadly, we're seeing some -- a lot of cross-currency [ph] mix dynamics, clearly, with your portfolio being part of that. What is your expectation about the potential for some of the newer mechanisms that are emerging with clinical data. Are you keen to figure out whether you want to invoke those as part of your portfolio? What do you see the outlook for novel mechanisms, given that we're going to have some biosimilars to some of the most standard of care approaches PNSIL-23.
Rob Michael: Chris, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. I think for modeling purposes, I would expect operating margins stay roughly at this level in '24 and then begin expanding again in with our return to robust sales growth. I think the pace of that expansion will depend on investment needs as we will always prioritize R&D and SG&A investment to drive long-term growth but that's the best way to think through '24 and then what the operating margin will look like in '25 and beyond.
Jeff Stewart: And Chris, it's Jeff. I'll maybe kick off on your immunology question and then ask Tom to comment on some dynamics as well. So it is very, very clear that certainly in the midterm, the most excitement across these immunology categories are for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. It's quite striking. And I think Tom mentioned there's still incredible interest in a next wave of dermatologic indications that follow on for atopic dermatitis that he highlighted. And really, as I noted in my remarks, I mean, the amount of excitement around the IL-23 and particularly our IL-23 across these indications is really profound. Now having said that, we are watching the competitive landscape for some maybe potentially some novel orals. We don't see them as major players. As we look deeper in the pipeline, we can see that there is the possibility for combination use of novel biologics or biomarker-driven approaches, particularly in IBD. And we monitor those very carefully as we look at our long-range plan. And Tom, I don't know if you want to address some of the things that are back in our pipeline in terms of immunology.
Tom Hudson: Sure. I mean I think the -- I just want to start saying that with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ really raised the bar in terms of efficacy and you see it in mucosal healing, for example. So the bar is getting higher and we will continue to do that. But even to show that we're raising the bar, we're also going to do -- we're going to read out head-to-head studies this year with STELARA and Otezla. So another way to kind of show that what we have is really very profound in terms of responses we're seeing with patients. And we continue -- I mean, honestly, we look at the field. We look at competitors. We're hearing data of S1P1 inhibitors but the data appears to be less effective based on a number of patients which are discontinuing treatment and the signals that we see cardiovascular and others that are similar to what we've seen with previous ones. So I mean, again, without having seen the data, it's all difficult to kind of predict how they'll be able to do accept that our data with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI are very strong, durable and again, very strong at the level of endoscopy also. So we think we have already a competitive edge. We continue we'll see PMR data later this year. We have talked about our RIPK1 inhibitor, again, from the coal healing that's in the clinic right now. We're looking at additional indications. So over time, obviously, we're going to look at additional mechanisms. But not necessarily just pushing down on the same cytokines as JAKs but looking at other target pathways of things that happen in the scan or in GI, again, mucosal healing being an tool pathway. And this is where we think a combination of our immunomodulators like RINVOQ and SKYRIZI with other mechanisms will combine well to give even more profound responses.
Operator: It comes from Colin Bristow with UBS.
Colin Bristow: For all the helpful color so far. So maybe a broader question just with regards to HUMIRA biosimilars. I just I'm curious like, what is the broader impact you anticipate on the I&I market just in terms of net price has been sort of a question we've been getting a lot of people are trying to wrap their heads around -- and then maybe just one on your CF triple. I know that the trial is ongoing. Can you give us an update here? How is the progress? Should we still expect data later this year?
Jeff Stewart: Yes, I'll take the one on the immunology marketplace. I think that the impact overall in the category for net price would be modest. And I think a lot of it has to do what Tom and I've discussed before which is the -- just the pure profile of some of these agents particularly SKYRIZI and RINVOQ and either others in the pipeline that are coming. I mean they really are setting different standards of care versus what they've seen in the past. And certainly, the physicians and the payers are recognizing this. I'll give a really quick example on 1 of our major products which is RINVOQ. I mean RINVOQ, based on the label changes that have taken place is already a post-TNF type of dynamic. And so the pricing is going to be the pricing there's no incremental ability to step it, for example. The other thing I would note is on SKYRIZI, we have 4 head-to-head trials against all the major competitors and another one coming with Otezla, as Tom noted. So you start to see that level of performance, whether it's against STELARA, multiple TNFs. Otezla, as I said, that's pending here. And it just becomes very clear that you're just going to achieve much higher levels of clearance and relief. So we feel pretty confident that the pricing impact over time, particularly in the U.S. market will be very modest. And certainly, we can navigate that based on the power of the performance of the portfolio.
Tom Hudson: This is Tom. I'll just answer about the cystic fibrosis program. Again, this program continues. And just to remind you, we're working on a triplet and where we believe that 2 of the 3 components of -- for this drug, this triplet, we have best-in-class assets. But we were looking for another part of the triple called the C2 corrector, where last year, the previous ones basically didn't give the meaningful improvement we were expecting in FEV1 sweat chloride. So we've actually, in our discovery groups, continue to develop new ones. In the last year, we've moved our ABBV-576 forward. in SAD in Phase I studies. We continue to see these, again, safety, high exposures, good PK, things that with -- if you combine with our preclinical data, makes us think it will, it has a potential to be best-in-class -- and that's triplet again with -- is -- first of all, to being tested, we'll have data this year to actually show how they behave together. And later at this part of this year, I'll be able to give an update.
Operator: Our next question is from [indiscernible] with Credit Suisse.
Unidentified Analyst: Trung [ph] from Credit Suisse. Two, if I may. So I was just wondering on your thoughts more broadly on the pricing dynamics in the EU and U.S. So in the EU, you recently exited the U.K. pricing agreement. In Europe, it does feel like there's -- it's just becoming an increasingly complicated pricing environment. There are a number of reforms being proposed in Europe. So I guess my first question is, is do you see these changes being material or any headwinds to you in your growth ex U.S.? And then secondly, can you just perhaps talk about your reasons you decided not to renew your membership for pharma and bio. How are you going to remain engaged in D.C. and have a voice when it comes to things like IRA and pricing controls.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first one there in terms of the EU. We do see some movement there, particularly in the, let's say, industry tax and I'll comment on the so-called VPaaS [ph] in the U.K. In some ways, whether or not we were in that voluntary program or outside of the voluntary program, the impact is about the same. And frankly, it was a policy decision because we really think that the U.K. government needs to reform that VPaaS. They didn't plan properly for how things might dynamically evolve in the U.K. and it's a very substantial part of the revenue now that is causing problems, I think, across all of the company. So it was a position of policy position, net neutral. It didn't matter, frankly, whether we were in or not and the U.K. is a relatively modest business for us. We are seeing perhaps more importantly, some changes in the German law, as you're probably aware of. And that is, I think, a modest net pressure that will come in Europe in Germany, in particular, because there's the move, as you may know, from 1 year of free pricing to 6 months. There's a modest increase in rebates, for example. So we do see some austerity impact. But on the bigger scheme, it's -- I wouldn't say it's material to our growth platform that we've been discussing.
Rob Michael: And Trung [ph], this is Rob. In terms of international prices, I mean, typically, we see year-over-year decline of low to mid-single digits and that's the way we're modeling it for '23 as well.
Rick Gonzalez: And then on pharma, this is Rick. Obviously, every year, we evaluate any kind of significant investment that we're going to make. And we make a decision as to whether or not we believe that investment is appropriate and is going to have the right level of return at that point in time. And ultimately, we made the decision around pharma based on that. We have a very significant government affairs group that's been active and been in place ever since we came into existence. Back in 2013, we've grown that organization. We did grow it somewhat this year as well in anticipation of not being part of pharma. We plan on being active as we have been in the past to try to appropriately advocate for things that we think are appropriate for patients. And I think that group is quite capable of being able to do that. And I would tell you that at a point in the future, we might decide to go back into pharma. But at this point, we've made the decision that we think that investment could be used elsewhere to be more effective. It's as simple as that.
Operator: Our next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.
Geoffrey Meacham: I appreciate all the perspective on guidance. I just had a follow-up on it. Rick, on your comments on the HUMIRA scale for starting next year in the U.S. I think when you look at other geographies, international revenues, you're still seeing double-digit declines after 4 years or so. Maybe just give us some context for what you're seeing there broadly versus what we could expect for the U.S. And just to be clear, when you see next year the impact from all the HUMIRA biosimilars, how much do you think that biosimilar STELARA may play a role here when you look at your assumptions for HUMIRA erosion? And then second question, just on the BD front, you guys talked about some of the therapeutic categories that you're interested in. But with the appetite to expand to expand the menu here and to say more orphan indications, I think across the landscape, some companies in the I&I space are getting into more niche indication. I wasn't sure if that was something that you guys would consider?
Rick Gonzalez: So I think on the HUMIRA tail, just to maybe clarify what I said is I would expect that as we move through 2024 then in 2025 and 2026, we would start to see a more stable tail for HUMIRA. In other words, we're going to see erosion in 2024. I want to make sure I didn't somehow communicate that, that wasn't the case. So if you look at OUS, I think what's probably deceiving to you is you had different countries going biosimilar at different periods in time. So you can't necessarily look at that as an analog because it's so heterogeneous in the year that those countries went biosimilars. So you are correct. Yes, it is still experiencing double-digit decline but it's been driven by the fact that those countries have not -- some of those countries haven't reached stability yet. But typically -- and the U.S. market is a little different because you have all a large number -- you have a small number of large payers who drive the bulk of the activity in this market. So, it's more like some of the countries that did other kinds of government-wide activity, like in Germany as an example. And there, we do see after a couple of years, we've seen stability. So I think what's misleading you is you're looking at the overall number but you're not factoring into that, the fact that these countries went biosimilar across a number of years.
Rob Michael: Jeff, this is Rob. Just to add to that. So if you just look at this year, so about half of the erosion is going to come from newer markets like Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. So that, as Rick mentioned, we have different waves. And so you're still seeing some of those waves come through. You also have some volume going to new agents like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, right? So that's something to keep in mind that that's a dynamic that's also playing out for HUMIRA in those markets. And then you typically see negative price trends in international markets, again, low to mid-single digits. So you're going to see some level of pressure there. So those are all factoring into the year-over-year on international HUMIRA something to make sure you're keeping in mind.
Jeff Stewart: And if you look at the STELARA dynamic with the biosimilar, I think there's a couple of dynamics that we're watching. And it does go back to my prior comments over the clinical differentiation. The first is that there will be less biosimilar competitive intensity against STELARA. Certainly, we've not seen anything like the 9 that we were -- 9 or 10 [ph] that we're going to see on HUMIRA. And so -- and that price point is quite high actually. If you look at where Stellar is now with the branded program. Now I think maybe more importantly, as we've highlighted before, we've anticipated that entry. And certainly, in Crohn's, we have an ongoing head-to-head trial against STELARA that will read out towards the end of the year. We plan on putting that into promotion if and we believe it will be positive, particularly what we're studying which is that endoscopic endpoint which is really becoming the standard in the gastroenterology space. So we think we can carry quite well with the ultimate arrival of that IL -- the 12/23 [ph] versus our Pure '23. So I hope that helps.
Rick Gonzalez: I think on your third question, again, what tends to drive our BD strategy is the long-term strategic road map that we put in place across the branch. So if you think about it, you mentioned immunology as an example. I would say in immunology, we have 2 fundamental objectives that we're trying to drive. There are still areas within immunology, where we believe we can significantly raise the effectiveness of the therapies that are used on patients to drive higher levels of remission or higher levels of endoscopic healing. In other words, better clinical outcomes within the areas that we're in. And so we have a tremendous amount of effort in those areas to bring next-generation assets or as Tom mentioned in his comments, there are opportunities to potentially combine 2 mechanisms together to achieve that level of therapeutic benefit. But then we look outside those areas at the adjacencies. And we look for where are the opportunities for us to be able to bring in either an existing mechanism or something we can either develop within our own discovery group or something that we can acquire on the outside as a mechanism that we don't currently have. But we tend to look for where there are areas of large unmet needs and relatively significant patient populations. So, I use 2 examples to illustrate. Vitiligo. Vitiligo is a disease that's very prevalent. There aren't good therapeutic options in it today at all. We do believe there are mechanisms that will allow you to effectively treat vitiligo. If those are effective, that could be a very significant opportunity overtime. Alopecia is another good example of that. So that's how we focus BD in these areas. That's not to say we would never look at a more much opportunity or an orphan opportunity but I wouldn't say orphan is something that is core to our strategy.
Operator: It comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist.
Robyn Karnauskas: It was great with all the color you've given. I just had some -- I want to follow up on, you mentioned Vitiligo. With the competition with topical rux [ph] which might have a first mover advantage and then they have an oral as well in Pfizer. How do you see the opportunity for you in vitiligo for RINVOQ? Can it compete? And then my second question last earnings call, you highlighted your GARP TGF beta. So that's 151. And I know there's been a lot of cardio-tox [ph] in the space. So what gives you some confidence what features and what indications, like how do you focus on this? And how do you view the competition profile?
Rick Gonzalez: On vitiligo, maybe Jeff and I will tag team on it. I would certainly say a topical has a place but it is difficult for people that have large areas of their bodies that are impacted by something like vitiligo for a topical to be a manageable therapy for those patients. So an oral for those patients that have more severe disease typically has greater benefit and frankly, better compliance among those patients which ultimately gives you better clinical outcomes. So I think the RINVOQ will stack up against whoever the competitive alternatives are based on the data. Based on how we've seen RINVOQ perform in other areas, I think we feel pretty good about what the potential is. But the data will speak for itself, see what the data looks like Jeff and Tom, would you add anything?
Jeff Stewart: Just to build on that. When we look at the valuation of, for example, that indication or HS or alopecia which again are those derm oriented indications that will follow on pretty quickly in the middle of the decade on top of atopic dermatitis. We do exactly what Rick highlighted. We will segment the patients based on the body surface area. We know that the topicals will be important for a certain percentage of population. For example, if it's maybe highly located to the face, that might be more appropriate, at least as the first course of action. But we do believe that in almost all indications that we've looked at for RINVOQ, it just performs exceptionally well in the clinic. And we would anticipate that as well above a base case scenario. Perfect example is Crohn's disease. There will not be another JAK inhibitor in Crohn's disease for the United States just because they just don't work. And you have spectacular results with the selective JAK with RINVOQ. So We take that all into that competitive context all into our calculations as we look forward to return for those future derm indications.
Tom Hudson: If I can just continue with. I mean, we will have readouts for our Phase II study this year and we've mostly been looking at those cases where there's more extensive body coverage disease -- or the face. So I think it would be a different -- it's a much better to take an oral than a cream when you actually have significant body coverage. Again, we'll see the data, we will report on another quarter call. Thank you, Robin, for the second question. Yes, TGF-beta is a known tumor suppressive pathway and people have tried to drug it to increase the response to immunotherapies. The first-generation TGF-beta because the target is so many parts of the body, you actually have effects, the cardiovascular effects having related to the TGF-beta activity in some of the endothelial cells in the valves and so on of the heart. Here, we're using GARP as our target. GARP is actually a receptor for TGF-beta that's called latent inactive that GARP sound only on Treg cells, a little bit on some fiber some store sales but it's not some in the heart or other tissues. That's what gives us our safety profile and the ability to causing a suppression on Treg cells found in tumor cells as opposed to other places in the body. So that we felt from the beginning was the attribute we needed to go to target this pathway would be something that will be tumor selective and that's what we've been able to see so far.
Rick Gonzalez: She asked about what tumors potentially.
Tom Hudson: Tumors. So in our -- initially, we focused on tumors. So this pathway is found on almost every solid tumor has some subset tumors which express TGF-beta and GARP. We started off thinking that we'd do a Phase I SAC [ph] study which we did well that we will expand. And we had picked liver and bladder because we saw a lot of TGF-beta pathway in those indications. And we also -- although we knew there was 7 CRC, we saw in patients in our Phase I study which were unselected in terms of tumor type. We saw responses. So we've actually continued expanding studying CRC but we did see responses in liver cancer where we expected to see it based on expression of TGF-beta. We did see it in bladder cancer and we're expanding in those indications at this point. Given the fact that I said earlier that we TGF-beta in all types of tumors, both tumors called hot or cold, we're actually expanding in other tumors to get signals right now. And again, we have we'll have baskets to actually continue to explore its indication space. But right now, we're expanding when we're going to Phase II dose rating studies that's indications where we've actually seen data in our Phase I study.
Operator: It comes from Simon Baker with Redburn.
Simon Baker: Two, if I may, please. Just going back to U.S. HUMIRA. Giving us the expected erosion is extremely helpful. It's also extremely impressive that you confident enough to give a point estimate for the percentage erosion in '23. So notwithstanding that, I wonder if you could give us what the likely pushes and pulls are. Is this something where we should be thinking more about the being upside risk due to inability of those additional generics biosimilars to supply the market. So any color pushes and pulls there and also into 2024 and your confidence around the erosion curve in '24? And then a question on tax. One question topic that's been raised by some of your peers has been an impact from the OECD minimum global tax rate initiatives in '23. Your guidance would suggest that isn't a factor for you. I just wonder if you could give us any color on when and if you expect those initiatives to impact your tax rate?
Rob Michael: Simon, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So when we give guidance, we typically give approximate assumptions and we do use point estimates. We don't typically give product level range. So it has been our practice. So we said approximately 37% erosion for U.S. HUMIRA. We have confidence in that number, obviously. But I think in terms of the pushes and pulls, it's really going to be about volume erosion, right? I think that's -- if you think over the course of the year, we made assumptions around volume erosion. We have good visibility of the price. Now it's a question of what will the volume erosion look like? And obviously, as we go through the year, we'll update you on that.
Scott Reents: This is Scott. I'll give you some thoughts on the OECD question that you asked regarding tax. So you're right. For 2023, we do not see any impact from this. In our view, there's a lot of things to be worked out with respect to the global minimum tax you mentioned. We have, in the U.S., as you know, a minimum tax we see ultimately this OECD tax being a top-up on that if that does occur but there's a lot of details to be worked out and we wouldn't anticipate any impact there until 2025, if there is an impact.
Operator: It comes from Navann Ty with BNP Parabas.
Navann Ty: I have 3 quick follow-ups, please. The first 1 on aesthetics, in addition to the macro impact. Are you seeing or do you expect increasing competition from your smaller competitors, DTC campaigns and new products? The second question is on HUMIRA. Was AMGEVITA in line with your expectation. And the third follow-up is on capital allocation. So can we think of 2x as a soft net leverage target which is relevant for AbbVie to consider material business development.
Rick Gonzalez: Carrie?
Carrie Strom: I'll take that first question on aesthetic competition. So in terms of U.S. BOTOX [ph] Cosmetics, this is a product that's around for 20 years and has based increased competition and still commands market-leading market share in the high 60s. And we know though that the competitive market will expand as new entrants are coming and have entered and in terms of a revamped toxin at the end of last year. What we've seen in the aesthetics market is that, of course, customers are going to try these new products. It's highly kind of newness driven and there's a novelty factor and trial and competitive trial is to be expected. And what we see is that these products and past aesthetic launches that we've watched, the share ramps for the first 12 to 18 months and then tends to stabilize. And so, of course, we don't underestimate any of our competitors. And so in 2023, we are modeling what we think is a competitive amount of share erosion in terms of our Botox business. And we'd expect that in '23 and beyond that U.S. BOTOX [ph] cosmetic will continue to be the clear number 1 market leader. And the new toxins that enter the market will be competing for their position number 2, 3 or 4 in our customers' offices.
Jeff Stewart: And it's Jeff. On your comment on AMGEVITA, the range of pricings that were released were not really a surprise. There's been some external thoughts that this is of interest where there were 2 different AMGEVITAs, 1 high WACC and on low WACC. But again, we've seen this across very different categories and studied it very carefully, as you would expect. So we've seen variably priced WACC products in our own HCV market with authorized generics from competitors. We've seen it in the diabetes space across multiple competitors, including biosimilar competitors. And certainly, with the -- with Amgen and the other segments of their own business. They were often moving around the list prices as well. So all in all, within the range that we would expect from Amgen. Yes.
Rob Michael: This is Rob. I'll take the question on net leverage. So the 2x is -- think about it as our sustainable target. So as long as there's a path back to net leverage of 2x, could take us in some cases, it could take 2 to 3 years to get back to that. But as long as there's a path, a very clear path to get back to net leverage of 2x, that's the best way to think about how we would evaluate it.
Operator: Our final question will come from Gavin Clark-Gartner with Evercore ISI.
Gavin Clark-Gartner: Wanted to confirm if you were planning to submit the Imbruvica plus Venclexta frontline CLL combination to the FDA following the ASH this year? And then on 951 in Parkinson's, we saw top line data from competitors from last month. I don't have the full data yet. One thing that sticks out is that they have lower discontinuation rates. So just wondering if there's any insight on devices or trial design that may explain this.
Rob Michael: It's Roopal. I'll take those. So for the ISV that you referenced, we have that in Europe and I think you're talking about the ASH data, overall survival. There as it clears couple of years is 0.5% or less and the PFS still stays low. At this time, we're not submitting here at the FDA. They would like to see a little more prospective data in another trial setting. So that's the hype. On 951, this is interesting on the competitors you bring up. So the when you run these patients in, you could have discontinuation rates. And if you include them or not include them, it's going to impact what happens post run in. So for example, when you see our data set, we count the run-in discontinuation and post run-in as you get into the main part of the trial. So you see that in the 20 percentile range or so. And that's fairly consistent with what you would see with a subcutaneous infusion. And it's not clear to us how that data, as you're speaking about is reported. Also, we don't know if that's more than 1 injection is that 2 injections and is it rotated daily. I can tell you about 951. We have dosing exposure that gets up to DUOPA unique from DUOPA to 24 hours. It's a single injection and you can leave it in for 72 hours.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Gavin. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great rest of your day.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-28 09:00:00) =====
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman and President; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics; Scott Reents, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neil Gallagher, Vice President, Development and Chief Medical Officer; and Roopal Thakkar, Vice President, Global Regulatory Affairs. Before we get started, I will note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our overall performance then Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our third quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie continues to perform very well, a testament to the strength of our broad, diversified portfolio. I'm especially pleased with the performance of our immunology assets, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenues of $14.8 billion were up 5.4% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. Immunology once again demonstrated impressive results with Skyrizi and Rinvoq now on pace to deliver more than $7.5 billion in combined sales this year, well ahead of our initial expectations. This performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we're in the early launch phase for both assets in IBD and PSA, as well as Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established outstanding launch trajectories across existing and new indications, giving us a high degree of confidence in the collective potential of these two assets to ultimately exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira, achieving the strategic objective we had for replacing Humira. We also saw a continued strong double-digit operational sales growth from several additional key products, including Botox Cosmetic, Vraylar, Venclexta and Botox Therapeutic. This strong momentum is helping us offset some of the interim economic pressure we now see in our Aesthetics portfolio. Based on these results, we remain confident in the outlook of our business and are reaffirming the midpoint of our full year 2022 EPS guidance at $13.86, which represents strong double-digit growth. As many of you are aware, we have a leading consumer-facing aesthetics portfolio, which is largely cash pay. We have been monitoring the global economic situation. Based on all the data we have been observing, especially in the U.S. with both the consumer confidence index and real personal consumption expenditures trending down and continued high inflation, these factors are putting pressure on consumers' discretionary spending. This metric correlates with a slowdown in treatment procedures that we're seeing across the aesthetics markets, impacting the growth rates for toxins, fillers and body contouring. While our U.S. aesthetics market share remains stable across both toxins and fillers, we now believe it's prudent to adjust our full year aesthetics forecast to reflect the moderating market growth over the near to medium term, which is expected to predominantly impact Juvederm as well as our body contouring portfolio products, which represent higher price points for consumers. While it's difficult to predict the duration of these economic dynamics, we expect these conditions to persist into 2023. As consumer confidence improves, we would once again expect the market growth to accelerate. Our aesthetics portfolio experienced a rapid and sustained recovery following the 2008-2009 recession, so we anticipate any impact will be transient. Over the long-term, the aesthetics business continues to be an extremely attractive, underpenetrated market with significant growth potential. The current market dynamics do not change our long-term guidance for aesthetics and we remain confident in our ability to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. I also want to provide a brief update on the outlook for 2023. With regards to the status of contracting for Humira, our intent has always been to maintain broad formulary access so that we can compete effectively with forthcoming biosimilars. We are making very good progress consistent with this objective, and are currently projecting formulary access for at least 80% of all U.S. covered lives. We expect this percentage to increase further as we conclude additional contract discussions between now and the end of the year. As a result, we anticipate strong access for U.S. Humira throughout 2023, and project biosimilars will share access as they become available. We will provide sales guidance for Humira on our fourth quarter call. While we're not issuing 2023 guidance today, it is important to note that when we issue our EPS outlook, we expect the lower end of the range to represent for earnings. So while it's possible 2023 could outperform our guidance regardless of the shape of the erosion curve, we don't anticipate 2024 earnings will be lower than the initial 2023 EPS guidance given the momentum and growth from another year of our ex-Humira portfolio, which is expected to more than offset any incremental Humira erosion in 2024. We know that many investors have an interest in the timing of AbbVie's trough earnings, whether that would be 2023 or 2024. The guidance range will provide and give investors additional clarity regarding our expectations for the company's core EPS.  In summary, we continue to deliver strong results and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth. To that end, as noted in our news release, today we're announcing a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.41 per share to $1.48 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2023. Since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 270%. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. We once again demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. I'll start with Immunology, where we are well positioned for sustained leadership in this extremely attractive market. Total Immunology revenues were more than $7.6 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. We remain very excited about the long-term potential for Skyrizi and Rinvoq which are already having a significant impact on AbbVie's growth and performance, contributing approximately $2.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, representing nearly 15% of total company net revenues. Skyrizi continues to exceed our expectations. Global revenues were $1.4 billion, up 12% on a sequential basis. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is capturing nearly one out of every two new and switching patients in the U.S. biologic market, with our leading total prescription share increasing to approximately 27%. We have also achieved total market share leadership in a dozen key international markets, including Japan, Canada and France. Psoriatic arthritis is ramping very nicely, with an expected global sales contribution of approximately $500 million just this year. Our PSA performance is especially strong in the U.S. Dermatology segment, where we have already achieved 10% total market share. Lastly, our launch of Skyrizi for Crohn's disease in the U.S. is progressing very well. Early prescription trends as well as feedback from gastroenterologists has been overwhelmingly positive, especially given Skyrizi's convenient dosing and strong clinical profile. Importantly, commercial access for Skyrizi Crohn's is now equal to psoriasis and PSA with sales in this indication expected to ramp significantly over the next several quarters. Given the momentum we are seeing across the indications; we will be raising our full year sales guidance once again for Skyrizi. Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $695 million, demonstrating more than 17% sequential growth, we continue to see positive momentum in RA, with total market share increasing to more than 6% in both the U.S. and across key international geographies. Global prescriptions are also ramping nicely in PSA ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA, a testament to the strong clinical profile Rinvoq has demonstrated across the broader rheumatology segment. Rinvoq is now the only JAK inhibitor with global approval for all four major Rheum indications. In atopic dermatitis, we continue to see strong demand for Rinvoq, particularly in the second-line setting. U.S. in-play market share is tracking in line with our expectations and we were making excellent progress internationally, with in-place share ranging now from approximately 20% to 35% across our major markets. AD remains a highly underpenetrated market globally and an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Rinvoq. Lastly, in ulcerative colitis, we are very excited by the early prescription trends in the U.S. In the second line plus setting, Rinvoq is already achieving the second highest in-place share, which is now approaching 20% in just a few months’ post launch. Physicians have been pleased with Rinvoq's high rates of endoscopic healing as well as the speed of onset. With over 70% of bioexperience UC patients currently on or having used TNF therapy, the second line plus opportunity for Rinvoq in UC is substantial. This strong adoption in UC among gastroenterologists is also encouraging for Rinvoq's potential in Crohn's disease as well. We are on track for U.S. and EMA regulatory decisions in the first half of 2023. Global Humira sales were approximately $5.6 billion, up 3.9% on an operational basis with 7.4% growth in the U.S., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 16.8% operationally due to biosimilar competition. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 9.9% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.4%. The U.S. performance continues to be impacted by an incrementally challenging CLL market, with new patient starts down approximately 20% relative to pre-COVID levels. Given the U.S. CLL market has been consistently lower than our expectation in the past several quarters, we are now reducing our view of the total size of the addressable patient population for this indication going forward. We also anticipate further share erosion following the recent unfavorable change to the NCCN guideline preference for Imbruvica in CLL, as well as increasing existing and new competition. These market and shared dynamics are expected to have a flow through impact on Imbruvica’s 2023 performance.  Venclexta global sales were $550 million up 11.3% on an operational basis. Continued share gains across both approved indications are being partially offset by a softer CLL market in the U.S. and a higher foreign exchange impact on international revenues. As a result, we will be adjusting our full year sales guidance for Venclexta. Longer term, we anticipate our oncology portfolio will return a growth driven by several promising new products and indications such as epcoritamab for DLBCL, and follicular lymphoma, Venclexta new indications for multiple myeloma and high-risk MDs; navitoclax for myelofibrosis; and Teliso-V for nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer. We are beginning launch preparedness activities for several of these important opportunities and look forward to bringing new treatment options to patients. In neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.7 billion, up 8.3% on an operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of 554 million were up 20.2% on an operational basis reflecting continued market share momentum. We continue to anticipate the regulatory approval and the commercial launch of Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder this quarter, which would make Vraylar the only antipsychotic, as a dual partial agonist approved to treat the most common forms of depression, both bipolar I, and adjunctive, and DD. Within migraine, our market leading oral CGRP portfolio contribute $222 million in combined sales this quarter. Ubrelvy prescriptions increased high single digits sequentially while total revenues were unfavorably impacted by a one-time prior period accrual adjustment of $40 million related to patient access program costs. Excluding this one-time adjustment, Ubrelvy sales were up more than 20% versus the prior year. Qulipta revenues nearly doubled sequentially as we continue to make very good progress with commercial access. Potential label expansion in the U.S. as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine and new therapy approvals in Europe represent additional opportunities to support Qulipta's strong momentum. Botox Therapeutic is also performing very well with total sales of $699 million, up 10% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, which accounts for roughly 45% of our therapeutic sales, Botox remains a foundational preventative treatment, and the clear branded leader for existing as well as new patient starts. Lastly, our launch preparations are underway for ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's. We anticipate approval in the first half of next year and believe ABBV-951 has the potential to achieve peak sales in excess of $1 billion. So overall, I'm very pleased with the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D programs. Tom?
Tom Hudson: Thank you, Jeff. In the area of immunology, we had several important regulatory milestones since our last earnings call, receiving FDA approval for Rinvoq in non-radiographic axial SpA and positive CHMP opinion for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease. These developments demonstrate the continued progress we are making with a global indication expansion of our next-generation immunology assets. In the quarter, we also saw longer term data from our Phase 2 study for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, where strong responses and flare reductions continued through 48 weeks of treatment. Based on these results, we plan to advance Rinvoq development in this indication and will be discussing our Phase 3 program with regulatory agencies in the coming months. Now, I would like to provide a few updates on our earlier stage immunology pipeline. We recently began a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis for our RIPK1 inhibitor, ABBV-668. This small molecule inhibitor is designed to address chronic inflammatory diseases by preventing necroptosis and reducing TLR4-driven inflammation. This could be a differentiated approach that has a potential to provide significantly improved efficacy to patients suffering from ulcerative colitis. We look forward to providing updates as data mature. Turning now to ABBV-154, our anti-TNF steroid conjugate, which is being evaluated in multiple indications. We recently completed the primary analysis for the Phase 2 dose-ranging study in RA patients. The hypothesis for this program was that by delivering the steroid directly to the site of inflammation, you could drive higher rates of efficacy with limited or no effects of systemic steroid exposure. In this study, all doses of ABBV-154 met the primary endpoint of ACR50, as well as the majority of secondary endpoints at week 12. At the medium and high doses, ABBV-154 delivered ACR scores that are similar to Rinvoq or slightly better, which validates the platform's ability to drive high levels of efficacy. The safety profile for ABBV-154 was generally consistent with the safety profile for adalimumab. As part of our safety assessment in this study, we analyze metabolic parameters including cortisol levels. The data showed minor decreases in cortisol levels at the higher exposures, which are consistent with evidence of systemic steroid effects. Given the number of effective therapies available in RA and a more limited use of steroids in these patients, we do not plan to move forward in development for the RA indication. However, we continue to believe ABBV-154 has the potential to provide a benefit in other diseases such as PMR and Crohn's disease, where steroid use is part of the typical treatment paradigm. Our exploratory Phase 2 studies in these two indications are ongoing and we expect to see data from the PMR study in 2023 and from the Crohn's study in 2024. Also in the area of immunology, we recently made the decision to stop the clinical studies and discontinue development for ABBV-157, our RORγt inverse agonist. This decision was made due to new findings observed in our preclinical chronic toxicology study. Moving now to our oncology portfolio where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline. We recently submitted our regulatory application in Europe and our partner, Genmab, submitted an application in the U.S. for epcoritamab in relapse-refractory large B-cell lymphoma. We're seeking accelerated approval based on the positive Phase 2 study results for epcoritamab in this indication where we saw very deep and durable responses in these highly refractory patients. We expect decisions in both U.S. and Europe in 2023. We are also nearing completion of the registrational studies for two additional key programs in our heme/onc portfolio; Venclexta in multiple myeloma; and navitoclax in myelofibrosis. We remain on track to see results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation near the end of this year. Following the event-driven data readout, we anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the first half of next year. For navitoclax, we remain on track to see data in the first half of next year from both the Phase 2 REFINE and the Phase 3 TRANSFORM-1 trials. Results from both studies will be included in our regulatory submissions, which we expect in the second half of 2023. Moving to neuroscience where we have applications under active review for several key assets. We anticipate a decision from the FDA in December for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. We believe Vraylar has a potential to be an important new therapy in this patient population and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients. We also expect a decision from the FDA in the first half of next year for a ABBV-951, our innovative, subcutaneous level levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. And in the area of migraine, we have regulatory applications under review in both the U.S. and Europe for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine with decisions expected in the first half of next year. If approved, this would be another differentiating future for Qulipta as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. This is a common and debilitating disease that significantly impacts quality of life, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. And in eye care, our partner REGENXBIO recently announced positive interim data from the Phase 2, AAV8 dose escalation trial for RGX-314 using in-office, suprachoroidal delivery for the treatment of wet AMD. RGX-314 continues to be well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events, and a meaningful reduction in treatment burden was observed at six months across all dose levels. Two pivotal trials evaluating RGX-314 for wet AMD using subretinal delivery are active and enrolling patients. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing our programs this year and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the remainder of this year and into 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Tom. AbbVie’s third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio. The continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq are helping offset the impact from higher inflation and the stronger U.S. dollar. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.66, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.02 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.8 billion, in line with our guidance and up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 2.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 53.4% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 85.4% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.8% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense up 20.9% of sales. Net interest expense was $497 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.9%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are narrowing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $13.84 and $13.88. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $58.2 billion, reflecting growth of 5.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated assumptions. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $5.1 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong market share performance. For Venclexta, we now expect global revenue of approximately $2 billion, based on a lower market outlook in CLL and unfavorable foreign exchange. For Aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, given the impact of higher inflation on near-term market growth and due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Moving to P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of approximately 85% of sales and forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 52% of sales. Turning to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.65 and $3.69. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie’s strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first nine months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of September was $11.8 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie’s long-term outlook, today we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2023. And we remain on track to achieve $30 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year, bringing our net leverage ratio to 1.8 times. In closing, AbbVie’s strong performance allows us to reaffirm earnings expectations in the face of economic pressure. And with our diverse portfolio, we continue to be well positioned to deliver long-term growth. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we’ll take the first question.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just my question is really centered around Humira. And I know you – appreciate some of the access commentary you made at beginning of the call, but are there any surprises so far in these discussions as we think about where either rebates or price is settling out for Humira? And I’m really sure I was trying to get my hands around, I think previously, you’ve commented you expected U.S. Humira erosion to be down roughly 45%, plus or minus 10%. And I just was wondering if that range holds given what you know today about the negotiations? And if I could just do a quick follow up, second question, immunology. There was a European JAK update out this morning, and I just was wondering any impact you expect to the Rinvoq franchise for that? Just maybe some context about how relevant, I guess, Europe was as part of the mix? And does that label update kind of impact your outlook at all? Thanks so much.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay, Chris, this is Rick. I’ll cover part of that question, and then I’ll have Jeff fill in on any additional commentary around the contracting. I think first, if we talk about the 45%, plus or minus 10%, that is the range that we gave. We’re obviously working on doing the final forecasting for 2023. As we’ve said in the past, there are two major components, which will play into that forecast. One is how are the biosimilars priced, that will certainly have some impact. We won’t know that until we actually get into the market and start to see some of that activity. But the other big component is obviously our coverage, our access coverage for Humira and the position that Humira has on those formularies. I would say that negotiating by Jeff’s team is going very well. As I mentioned in my comments, we’re at about 80% of all covered lives now, and I would expect that to rise to a level that’s above 90% as we move towards the end of the year. Once we have a final number there, it will allow us to do the final modeling for 2023, and that’s at the point where we’ll be able to refine that 45% plus or minus 10%. I’d tell you it’s going on track. I would say there’s no surprises, and I’d say I feel good about how the negotiations are going with all the major managed care organizations and PBMs. Jeff, anything you’d add there?
Jeff Stewart: No. Just to confirm, Rick, that no real surprises in terms of where we’ve been. And as we’ve communicated before, our principles of co-existing over time with one or more biosimilars seems to be the way that the market will play out. And certainly, like we saw in Europe that we had the principle of – for patient continuity to concede pricing to maintain that patient access. So Chris, no major surprises that we’ve seen so far.
Rick Gonzalez: And then do you want to talk about PRAC? You and Roopal, can talk about PRAC.
Jeff Stewart: Maybe, Roopal, you could address the procedure and where we are in the procedure, and I’ll cover the commercial.
Roopal Thakkar: Yes. Thanks, Jeff. I’ll give some context. So the next step here after PRAC would be moving to the CHMP here in November, and then the European Commission should finalize this. We expect December or January. So PRAC completed their review, and what we see in the labeling is an update in warnings, and this is related to outcomes of the oral surveillance study. And in particular, in Section 4.4, which is the warnings, there’s a list of subgroups that were found to be at risk based on analysis from oral surveillance. For example, patients greater than equal to the age of 65, those that are at risk for cardiac events, smokers, for example. And in these patients, the use of JAK inhibitors would be after a consideration of other therapies, if I’m paraphrasing, if no suitable alternatives. So this is consistent with the practice of medicine. It provides specific guidance, and we would say pragmatic at this stage.
Jeff Stewart: And Chris, to that point, I mean, this is largely consistent with what we see from oral surveillance and the Xeljanz label, which is widely sort of understood by the European physicians. And so to cut to the quick, we don’t anticipate a material impact as this continues through the process.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: Thank you. I was under the impression that we’d get more granularity on Humira erosion this quarter, and you’re saying that’s really going to come in Q4. So, I’m wondering did I kind of not hear it right before, or has something changed? And then second question is just on contracting in general, my understanding is that payer contracts, really not rock solid. They can be reopened when there’s a change in the marketplace on things like pricing, in this case of biosimilars. So, when we do kind of get whatever next level of guidance we get from you, isn’t that going to continue to remain fluid? Because market dynamics won’t all play out as of January, we’ll get to mid next year, you’ll get more entrants, you’ll know pricing better and that sort of thing? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Yes, Tim, this is Rick. I’ll cover that one. So, I think we’ve talked a number of times on these calls about what we project in the third quarter call, and I believe what we said is that we would ultimately provide you an update on where we were in the process. And so that’s what we attempted to do. I can’t give you a number for 2023 until I know what the total access is, and not all those contracts are done yet. They’re proceeding well, so I feel good about that. But until we actually know that the contract is solid and we know what that access looks like, we can’t give you an accurate projection. And I understand the desire by the investment community. I understand what that number is, but I think you probably also understand that we want to give you the most accurate number that we can give you, and we don’t want to give you a number that’s not accurate. And so it is going to require us until we get to the fourth quarter call to provide that for you. You are correct, in a sense, about the way you describe how these contracts work. They can be reopened at some point in time. I wouldn’t say that’s all that common usually, and in particular, I’d say around this kind of a situation, you’re going to anticipate what you think is going to happen in the second half of the year and try to position the contract in a way that it can ultimately deal with those changes going forward. But you are correct to say that they could reopen a contract if they chose to do that. There are various kinds of contracts that we use. In some cases, there are penalties or repercussions that would have to come into consideration if a contract got reopened at some point in time. They’re not all like that, but many are like that. So it varies. And I’d say generally speaking, your concept is valid. But I would say it’s probably a little less fluid than the way you necessarily described it, particularly in this environment where we know there will be a number of biosimilars coming in. So you anticipate that we’ve built the contracts around that set of assumptions. Jeff, anything you’d add?
Jeff Stewart: No, I think, Tim, Rick described it in the right way. While there are typically, there are typically out clauses based on timing or other dynamics I think one of the considerations is obviously, as we’ve highlighted before, most of the biosimilars are going to be coming in the second half of the year. So to some degree, that actually limits if it was a rare case. And they typically are rare where a contract is blown up or renegotiated in the middle of the year. That length of time that’s left in 2023 for some of those payers to let’s take a negative action puts some natural constraint on them in terms of when they would time that out. But Rick highlighted it very nicely in terms of the dynamics.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.
Mohit Bansal: Great, thanks for taking my question. And maybe one more question on the contracting side. Could you help us understand if the pricing part of the contracts is something that you have a good handle on at this point? And then a follow-up question is that how do you think about the cadence of BD activity once you hit the mark of less than two times leveraged by end of the year? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Jeff, do you want to cover that?
Jeff Stewart: Yes, so look, in terms of what Rick had highlighted in terms of our confidence in projecting the 80%. Obviously, there’s a couple components to that. So we have – while all the contracts aren’t fully complete with the ones that we’ve done. We’ve done some significant modeling work to understand if we’re retaining the ability to stay on the formulary. We would model our volume like how much would we retain versus would go to one or more biosimilars. That’s something that we can understand. And we have made base case, both first half and second half pricing assumptions based on those contracts. Now what’s been highlighted in the last couple of questions is there’s still uncertainty on the rest of the contracts that are yet to been secured and also a bid on that second half price dynamic. So those are the elements that are going to give us more confidence as we go to the fourth quarter call to give everyone a secure number for next year.
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick. I’ll cover your business development question. I think if I step back and I look at where are we today. We have been for the last several years operating with an approach of roughly $2 billion to add incremental pieces to the business. We’ve effectively used that over the last several years to be able to build some additional, particularly, I’d say early stage pipeline assets to the company. We’re continuing on that same approach right now. Now having said that, we obviously have paid down debt very rapidly. We will be in a position where if we chose to do something, we could do something. I’d say if I look at the business today and I look at how it’s performing around the expectations that we had for the business going forward, I would say there’s no need for us to be able to do anything in that area. And I’d go back to the original premise of what we described to the investment community of what we believed would happen when biosimilars entered the U.S. market for Humira. What we said was that we believe the bulk of the erosion would occur in 2023, some additional erosion in 2024, in 2025 and beyond. We would return to significant growth. We’d be able to deliver high single digit growth from that point forward through the end of the decade. That’s what we said. Everything I know about the business today would suggest to me that we are able to do just that. And we’re confident that we’re able to do that with the portfolio we have and the late-stage pipeline and additional indications that we have coming forward. Having said that, I can also tell you that, over the last 10 years, we’ve demonstrated to ourselves and hopefully to you that we can acquire businesses and assets and we can integrate those and we can successfully drive those. And so if we found something that we thought was very important to add to the business, we certainly have the financial wherewithal and this business has tremendous cash flow. We could do that. I can tell you we don’t see that right now. So I wouldn’t assume that. And the other thing I’d point out is, as an example, the most important thing, and I know everyone is focused on what that erosion curve is going to look like, including us, to be honest, but – and I know why. But probably the single most important thing for us going forward to hit what I described to you a moment ago is that underlying non Humira business growing at a rate that it can drive those expectations. And that’s key and I’d say there’s two factors that are most important around that. The first is that Skyrizi and Rinvoq grow fast enough that they can more than offset that they can essentially grow through all of the erosion that occurs on Humira and deliver incremental performance of above and beyond that. And I feel highly confident in that. I mean, when you can look at the trajectories of those assets now in the early phase we’re in right now in IBD and PSA. I would say, I have a very high level of confidence that they will perform at that level or well above that level. Then the second thing is all the other growth assets they have to be growing fast enough that they can get us to be able to grow at that rate that I described. And if you take this quarter as an example, and you look at the business without Humira, the underlying growth is about 6.5%. And remember that 6.5% is absorbing the economic impact we see in the aesthetics business and the market and competitive dynamics that we see in Imbruvica. So that’s – that tells you that underlying growth is pretty strong. And so I think those are the important things that investors have to focus on. And the erosion curve is certainly one of those. And I’m sensitive to the fact that you want to know when you’re going to hit trough earnings, and I recognize that. And that’s why we wanted to provide you some assurance of what that trough earnings is going to look like.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.
Terence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Rick, I appreciate your comments on 2023 and the aesthetics business. No, you don’t want to give guidance. But I guess at a high level, do you think you can grow that franchise next year versus this year? And then on epcoritamab, congratulations on the filing there. Just wondering what you’re expecting regarding the requirement for inpatient administration. J&J recently got approval of their bispecific and myeloma and looks like there’s a requirement there for inpatient administration of the drug during the step up period. So just wondering how we should think about inpatient versus outpatient dosing of epco? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay, excellent. Thanks, Terence. I’ll cover the first one. So if I look at the aesthetics business, we’re clearly seeing this economic pressure in the U.S. And I would expect that we will see that to continue into 2023. Certainly, it’s difficult to predict what will happen in the U.S., will it get worse? Will we go into a recession? Will it stay about the same? I’d say, we’re looking at this extremely carefully. But good news right now I would say is that the factors that we’re looking at that seem to be driving this consumer confidence and behavior the most in the U.S., appeared to have stabilized at the levels that they’re at. And so I would say that’s a positive thing. Now it’s fluid because obviously if the economic situation got worse in the U.S., my guess is they would trend down again. And so – but at least it appears right now that they’ve stabilized and maybe even ticked up just a little bit, moved in a positive direction just a little bit. I think it’s very difficult to predict. Here’s what I would assume. I would assume that a significant part of 2023 we will have an impact on it. Now also recognize that we saw this phenomena as we said in the last call start in May. We weren’t sure at the time whether it was the summer season starting a month early or it was the economic impact, because we had been watching the indicators and they trend down several months ahead of that. But we didn’t see an impact until the month of May. So the point is, when we hit May and beyond, we’re going to be lapping the impact. So the negative impact will be softened on the business. So we’ll return to better growth rates no matter what just mathematically, right. So – but I think the best prediction we can have is it’s going to have an impact in a good part of 2023. I think it’s the best way for us to think about it. Now again, the rest of the business has an opportunity to be able to offset that as we saw in this quarter.
Rob Michael: And this is Rob. I would just add that if you think about more long term. If you think about what happened in 2008 and 2009, the business declined high single digits and then we saw, after that very robust growth in the mid-teen to the next decade. So given that penetration rates are still very low today. There’s clearly ample opportunity to grow this market. I think once you get on the other side of the economic impact which we expect to be transient. We still expect as business to deliver long-term growth as Rick highlighted earlier, we’re still on track for that. Long-term high single digit growth getting to greater than $9 billion by 2029. So we’ll have to navigate, obviously, the short-term economic impact. But we still have tremendous confidence in the long-term outlook for aesthetics.
Rick Gonzalez: Epco?
Neil Gallagher: Hey, this is Neil Gallagher. I will take the epco question. So the first thing I just want to caution, put a word of caution before I answer your question directly around inpatient stay, which is that the patient population that our competitors studied with the BCMA, CD3 is quite different in terms of overall benefit risk. So the indication that was granted was in fifth line plus multiple myeloma, which is very heavily pretreated and frail population. So to extrapolate any interpretation of benefit risk from that population into the relapsed/refractory DLBCL population that we have studied and filed for with epcoritamab would not be valid, so just a word of caution there. That said the study that we have filed had required for a 24-hour patient stay overnight – one overnight stay. However, in subsequent studies we are aiming to remove that requirements so patients would not require – be required to remain overnight. And we do believe because of the emergent and stable overall benefit risk for epcoritamab, a couple of things that we believe that it has the potential to be best-in-class, and we also believe that our strategy to remove overnight stays is a very valid one and reasonable one to pursue. Hope that answered your question.
Liz Shea: Thanks Terence. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citigroup Global.
Andrew Baum: Thank you. A couple of questions please. First on in Imbruvica, I'm assuming that Imbruvica is going to be included in the Top 10 CMS lists for price negotiation under Medicare next year. Assuming that's correct what do you think about the impact on net pricing from Imbruvica. Do you anticipate pricing – net pricing coming under pressure prior to 2026, given the contracting that's expecting to take place among your competitors to secure favorable positions given their catastrophic coverage burden on PBMs post the IRA implementation? So is the impact going to get brought forward for the class including for Imbruvica before you actually get the price cut coming? And then then seconds with epcoritamab, there's been some interesting data on the importance of profound B-cell depletion in lupus using CAR T assets, as CD20 bispecific could get to a similar level. I'm wondering whether you have interest in pivoting epcoritamab and exploring it in refractory lupus as one of your competitors already is particularly given you have a subcu administration, which obviously has some advantages? Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Hi Andrew, it's Jeff. I'll take your – I'll take your first question. So when we – obviously we're still studying very carefully the IRA and we're also discussing directly with CMS not just through pharma, but our own company in terms of how they're going to basically select the different drugs that will be negotiated. That's a little bit unclear at this point. It's not unreasonable based on the size of Imbruvica to suspect it will be one of the earlier drugs that could potentially be negotiated, so just to clear that. In terms of what may take place before that potential negotiation in 2026, I would expect to see some modest changes in rebate. We see very small levels at this point now but we do have a third competitor coming. So that would be something that we would continue to plan – to plan for as we move into that potential event.
Tom Hudson: Yes. This is Tom. Maybe I'll answer the lupus question. First, I'll say it's actually was very exciting to see that paper showing that B-cell depletion can actually put patients with very severe lupus in remission. It's a very small study. Some five patients, but everyone's looking at this as a, even with is a surprise because we used to think we had to affect many mechanisms themselves in lupus. So that was one of the reasons it's so difficult. I used to be part of a lupus clinic in Montreal, so I know the challenges with patients. So what we're looking at right now is we're asking yes, the answer to your question is can we use our existing assets and collaborations to see if we can do B-cell depletion, for as a treatment for lupus? The answer is yes. And the type of questions we're asking ourselves is, do we have to have as deeper depletion as we have with in heme malignancies? Nobody knows the answer. That might be important because if you have to have a very deep depletion it might be restricted more to more of the severe patients and again that would be an advantage. But if we want to go to all lupus patients because not all lupus patients are, are flaring all the time. The majority have a normal life. Go to the clinic once a year and just see their physicians when they have flares. So going to a very deep regimen for B-cell depletion might be deemed to too severe. So the questions is yes we're looking at it and trying to figure out what's the right regimen and how to approach that in lupus is very exciting questions, which we're obviously looking into.
Liz Shea: Thanks Andrew. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: Thank you. What is your level of confidence in a positive outcome for Vraylar in MDD at the end of the year? I imagine the review is well along, so you probably have good visibility. So for instance our labeling discussions underway, is the sales force being trained, et cetera. This is a very large opportunity that does not seem to be a point of external focus as far as I could tell. So I'm wondering what you could tell us about how things are going? Thank you,
Roopal Thakkar: Hi, it's Roopal. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll go and then Jeff can talk about the opportunity. You're correct, the review is proceeding per our expectations. We have two positive studies in the space. I mean, recall, we also have the same endpoint – the depression endpoint that's read out in three other bipolar depression studies that are already within label. So there's quite a bit of evidence that's already been generated, that's in front of the agency now. So I would say it's proceeding well and we still anticipate a decision by year end. And I'll pass it to Jeff.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Steve, and just in terms of your salesforce question, I mean, we are very encouraged and excited about this potential approval. I mean, obviously we continue to gain share week-by-week sequentially for our base indication – the bipolar indications. And we know that based on the profile that we have with Vraylar. So very, very strong efficacy – proven efficacy of a very good tolerability profile for an antipsychotic, no material weight gain, low metabolic effects, and I think importantly maybe not as appreciated it's, there's no titration. You have a very simple starting dose of 1.5 milligrams. So as we do our research, we see that that profile is very strong as this potential add-on therapy and depression. In the last decade there's been only one drug that's been approved for this indication and that's Rexulti, and we think that's a branded drug, obviously, and we think we can compete very, very well. So we have a big existing sales force and infrastructure. We are gearing up in terms of training. We have the established relationships across the big primary care doctors as well as the psychiatrist. So we are – we agree with your approach. That's a meaningful commercial opportunity that could evolve very quickly here once we get the approval.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets.
Gary Nachman: Thanks. Good morning. First could you just provide some more color on how much of a benefit you're seeing for Skyrizi and Rinvoq and IBD? As you've been spending more time with the GIs, and have your outlooks changed on a potential there as major contributors to the long-term growth for those franchises? So were both of those being used in the treatment paradigms for the respective indications in Crohn's and ulcerative colitis? So that's one. And then secondly, just OpEx came in much lower than we expected, so you seem to be getting better operating leverage than what you originally guided. Are there areas where you've scaled back in spending, whether in Aesthetics or heme/onc if there's pressures there? And how will you be thinking about that into the Humira LOE next year? So how much additional flexibility might you have on the spending side? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Yes. I'll take the IBD question. I think we've mentioned before that the IBD has been a very important part of our long range plan and when we gave the 2025 guidance, it looks relatively small because they're just ramping down. I would say that as AbbVie we are very, very encouraged. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks on the launch, and maybe I'll start with what we're hearing from the gastroenterologists. I think first is they, they look at both assets and the global guidelines, the impressions and the clinical approach that we hear from the top leaders and also the community gastros is this idea over – I have to start to think about endoscopic healing, higher basically rates of efficacy and more significant clarity on what it's doing in the bowel versus just symptoms. And that seems straightforward, but we see the market moving very, very fast there in terms of understanding and that's what we can deliver, whether it's the Skyrizi data on the endoscopic healing rates with a very, very convenient and strong safety profile, or similar on the Rinvoq side in second line in the U.S. second line for patients that aren't doing well in UC. So we see rapid adoption already as I mentioned, that in the Rinvoq in the United States will be a second line plus based on the label. And we see very, very fast adoption. I'll give you some color on it. Xeljanz had been approved and is approved in UC in the United States, but basically it had very low adoption. We're seeing now in the community that 70% of the prescriptions are coming from physicians that have never written a JAK before. So it shows you that the clinical profile of Rinvoq in terms of its speed and the depth of the response is being viewed very, very well. So not only is that encouraging for Rinvoq, you see as I mentioned we're going to have the approval for Crohn's for Rinvoq in later lines next year as well. Skyrizi continues to surprise us to the upside, as you've heard from the call today. This is viewed increasingly as the preferred frontline drug coming straight out of the gate for Crohn's in the U.S. And the qualitative data that we're starting to see, and we are seeing some quantitative data that looks very strong, too, is that this is viewed as a already as a best-in-class product for Crohn’s, which is a very, very substantial market. So we are very encouraged. We continue to say that the IBD is probably underappreciated, and we’ll continue to give updates as these launches progress.
Rob Michael: So Gary, this is Rob. I’ll take your question on OpEx. If you look at the benefit we’re seeing, about half of it is actually coming from the stronger U.S. dollar, so it’s more of an FX impact. The other half is spend productivity. We always look for opportunities to drive more productivity in our spend. It’s not so much about scaling back in parts of the business, we always look for ways to spend better, buy better. And ultimately, that helps us. In many cases also, over the long-term, redeploy that investment to drive growth. If you think about 2023, I’ve said – given that 46% to 47% operating margin directional input. I’ve also said we’re not going to cut back investment. We’ll obviously be prudent given that you will see a decline in gross margins next year, but we’re not going to be cutting back investment because we expect to return to growth quickly. So you’ll see us not necessarily cut back, but certainly put more behind this business to drive that long-term growth that we expect to be industry-leading over the long term.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Gary. Operator, next question please?
Operator: And our next question comes from Colin Bristow from UBS.
Colin Bristow: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So first on CF, you recently posted an updated clinical trials for your new C2 corrector-based regimen. I just wondered if you could walk us through what gives you confidence that this has a higher probability of success versus your last deterioration? And then second one for Rick, I just wanted to touch base on your succession plan. It’s been an increasingly sort of important or a frequent topic with investors. You’ve been the architect of AbbVie’s success inception, and so just wanted to confirm specifically how long you expect to stay in the seat? And then how should we think about the time lines around the process of identifying your successor? Thank you.
Tom Hudson: Well, this is Tom, I’ll answer the CF question. Again, this is very challenging to actually make that abnormal CF protein get to the membrane and act as a chloride channel, and it takes three different drugs to make it effectively to get it to the cell membrane and open up in the right way. And so we all felt that we had – intakes we call them Corrector 1, Corrector 2 and Potentiator, these three different compounds. We always see good results with double our C1 corrector. We think it’s best-in-class. Our potentiator is very good. What we had difficulty is to get a good C2 corrector, and what I presented earlier this year was that it wasn’t good enough. But what we’ve done since then, we will continue to look at better ones and we came out with a differentiated product, 576 [ph], which is structurally different and the data supports higher safety margin, higher exposures, good PK. Hopefully, a single pill. And then we’d be able to get to this – to be able to have this triplet which is really important to be competitive. So again, our doublet, the data we had was very strong. But we need that third piece, and that third piece seems to be coming along really well. That’s what you really saw on the website at ct.gov is moving to evaluate this triple combo with our new C2 corrector.
Rick Gonzalez: And this is Rick on the succession question. I’d say that, we obviously have a very experienced Board, and we’ve had an active approach on succession going back to about 2016, 2017. And that process has proceeded extremely well in developing internal candidates to ultimately assume the role when I do retire. I can tell you that there are no plans at all for me to retire in 2023. The most important thing to me and to the Board is to make sure that the business is performing exactly as we expect going forward, and we’re not going to make any transition until we’ve gone through the biosimilar event, and we’re confident in the performance of the overall business. That would be the appropriate time once we’re confident to make a transition at that point. We’ve also had discussions with the Board of what that transition would look like. And assuming it’s an internal candidate, the transition will essentially work where we will name a new CEO. And at that point, I will assume the role of Executive Chair for a period of time thereafter. So I think we have a well-thought-out succession approach. I feel very comfortable with the approach, I feel comfortable with the work we’re doing to develop the internal candidates. And I think the transition when it occurs, I think, will go smoothly and be successful. So hopefully, that answers your question.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Colin. Operator, next question please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.
Liz Shea: Chris, are you there? We can’t hear you.
Operator: Please check your mute feature, Chris?
Chris Shibutani: Yes, apologies. Two questions, if I may. On Rinvoq, you had previously commented that you were seeing some use in the first-line setting. Can you update us at all with any color there? Secondly, for Skyrizi, obviously, a very attractive market and an opportunity in Crohn’s disease. Can you show us how you’re thinking about the potential impact given the LOE in 2023 of a major branded players, STELARA? Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Chris, it’s Jeff. Just to clarify in terms of your Rinvoq question, was there a specific question related to a certain indication on the front line? Or I’m not sure I fully appreciate that one.
Chris Shibutani: Yes, no. In AD.
Jeff Stewart: In AD, okay, right. So yes, we do see frontline use across the globe and even in the U.S. And what we’re seeing is now, as I mentioned in my remarks, we’re seeing in-line in-play share, which is in the high mid-teens right now in the U.S., and it’s higher in the international markets. So there seems to be, as we look to the research and we look to our market – end market performance, there’s really two segments of dermatologists. There’s very cautious dermatologists that are slow to adopt JAKs, and typically, they’ll start in the later line, a second line plus. There is an emerging cohort of a significant group of dermatologists as well that basically are looking at the underlying high efficacy parameters, so basically like the EZ90 skin clearance and almost no discernible itch for the product. They typically are starting to use more and more in the frontline. So the overall balance is leaning towards the second line, but we do see increasing frontline utilization based on the profile of the drug in atopic dermatitis. In terms of the Skyrizi for Crohn’s, we think we’re very, very well positioned for a couple of reasons. One is the overall profile of the medicine is really exceptional, as I’ve highlighted, and we’re going to see very, very rapid adoption both in the U.S. and the external market. In addition, we have anticipated the STELARA LOE. We see that we have an ongoing head-to-head trial versus STELARA to make sure that we can continue to differentiate with direct data that will come over the next year or so, so we’re anticipating that. And we think we’re going to have a good setup to maintain the early momentum that we’re seeing with Skyrizi.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.
Geoff Meacham: Hey guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just have one quick one. Rick, lots of questions on Humira for next year, but I wanted to ask at a high level environment beyond that. I know there are formal treatment guidelines in I&I, but what’s the risk that payers mandate cycling through one or more biosimilars? And what’s the risk – the pricing environment doesn’t really recover in 2024 and beyond? Just obviously thinking about the Skyrizi and Rinvoq franchises over the long term? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: So I’m actually going to have Jeff walk you through that. He’s probably the closest to that environment.
Jeff Stewart: Yes, so thank you for the question. I mean, one of the things that we see certainly in the near term is that the formularies in I&I are actually expanding. So many years ago, you might have six or seven preferred agents. The payers are now requesting sometimes up to 11 or 12 preferred agents, so you’re seeing an expansive nature in the short term. Now as you go forward, maybe middle of the decade or later where you have more and more biosimilars, could the U.S. environment move towards sort of a step through? I mean, it’s possible. But we have, again, as I mentioned in my last statement, we have anticipated that with the right types of data, the trials. We have five head-to-head studies in Skyrizi in psoriasis; we have more coming in Crohn’s. And so we think that basically, we have a data-driven approach that’s going to continue to allow us to significantly differentiate our products. The other dynamic that we watch very carefully, and we talked about this during the Immunology Investor Day, is the lines of therapy as there’s more and more high efficacy products that get introduced, continue to expand. So in the middle of the decade or longer, the second plus and the third line markets are going to be very, very significant at that point. So when we put all of that into the calculus we feel again, we have a pretty set up for the middle of the decade and longer.
Rick Gonzalez: And this is Rick. I agree with everything Jeff said. The one thing I would add that as you think about even under a scenario where if we did get to some kind of a step at it, you have to go back and remember that most of these mechanisms, most patients fail, and they fail at a relatively high level and over a relatively short period of time. So even if you had to rotate through you’re going to get to second line relatively quickly, and recycling somebody back through another TNF typically doesn’t work very well for those patients. And I’d say the domain now with the kind of agents that we have in the market now and the level of remission that they can create, the demand among physicians is much higher to get patients into remission as rapidly as they possibly can. And so I think all those dynamics tell us that this model should continue to work over the long-haul.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. I believe we have taken all the questions in the queue, so that concludes today’s conference call. If you’d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President, Head of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman and President; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D, and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics; Scott Reents, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neil Gallagher, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer; and Roopal Thakkar, Vice President, Global Regulatory Affairs. Before we get started, I’ll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today’s conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll take your questions. So with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I’ll briefly comment on our overall performance. Then Jeff, Tom, and Rob will review our second quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion was up 6.1% on an operational basis, in line with our expectations. This performance reflects robust double-digit operational sales growth from immunology, where Skyrizi is exceeding our expectations with impressive market share gains in both psoriasis and PSA. Skyrizi’s recent U.S. approval in Crohn’s disease will add yet another source of long-term growth. As a result of the strong performance we’ve seen in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for Skyrizi. Rinvoq is also demonstrating strong growth. RA continues to perform in line with our expectations, following the label update, and we’re making very good progress with all of the newly launched indications, including PSA, AS, atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis, which collectively represent a significant long-term growth opportunity. Neuroscience is another area with outstanding performance Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and Ubrelvy and Qulipta each demonstrated double-digit sequential sales growth. Pending regulatory approvals for Vraylar in major depressive disorder, Qulipta in chronic migraine and 951 for the treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease represent additional near-term growth opportunities for our neuroscience portfolio. Turning now to aesthetics, Botox Cosmetics once again performed very well with sales up more than 20% on an operational basis. Demand for toxins remains strong with high teens growth in the U.S., despite inflation dynamics. As expected, Juvederm performance was negatively impacted by COVID-related lockdowns in China, as well as the suspension of our operations in Russia. Additionally, in the U.S., we had a difficult prior year comparison with a promotional event that we ran last year. We also saw a modest impact in the quarter due to economic pressures. We continue to expect positive full year growth for Juvederm driven by the lessening COVID impact in China and two new filler launches in the U.S. which will benefit growth in the second half of the year. In hematological oncology, Imbruvica continues to be unfavorably impacted by a delayed market recovery for new patients starting therapy in CLL and increasing competition. These ongoing dynamics will have an impact on Imbruvica’s projected 2022 revenues. As a result, we will be adjusting our full-year guidance to reflect these impacts. Venclexta to continues to demonstrate robust share performance in both CLL and AML, with sales up double digits on an operational basis. Venclexta also has registrational studies ongoing in additional attractive indication, such as multiple myeloma in the t(11;14) patient population with Phase 3 data forthcoming, as well as high risk MDS. Additionally, we have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both, blood cancers and solid tumors, which are expected to support the next wave of AbbVie’s growth in oncology. In summary, the diversity of our portfolio, once again allowed us to deliver another strong performance, despite the challenges we see in the CLL market and increasing Imbruvica competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well and are on pace to deliver approximately $7.5 billion in combined sales this year. Neuroscience demonstrated balanced double-digit growth driven by migraine and Vraylar and continued robust Botox cosmetic growth offset some of the U.S. inflationary impact to our filler and body contouring portfolios. As a result, we are confirming our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $13.78 to $13.98, representing growth of more than 17% at the midpoint. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. I’m very pleased with the momentum across our therapeutic portfolio, including the continued progress we’re making with new product and recent indication launches. I’ll start with our immunology portfolio, which delivered total revenues of $7.2 billion, reflecting growth of 19.2% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were approximately $5.4 billion, up 6.8% on an operational basis with 9.6% growth in the U.S., partially offset by international performance where revenues were down 7.3% operationally due to biosimilar competition. Skyrizi is performing extremely well, well ahead of our expectations. Global revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 33% on a sequential basis. We continue to advance our leadership position in psoriasis where Skyrizi’s total prescription share of the U.S. biological market has increased to approximately 26%, driven by an in-play share of new and switching patients that is now approaching 50%. We have also achieved in-play market share leadership in 23 key international markets, including Japan, Germany, France, Canada, and Australia.  Psoriatic arthritis is also adding significantly to Skyrizi’s momentum, where we are now approved in 54 countries. In the U.S. dermatology segment, where approximately 30% of patients exhibit both skin and joint involvement, Skyrizi is already achieving an in-play patient share of nearly 20%. We have also launched Skyrizi for PSA in rheumatology, where we’re seeing strong utilization, which is driving accelerated share growth. Our recent launch of Skyrizi for Crohn’s disease in the U.S. represents the first new biologic approval in six years for an area where there continues to be considerable unmet need. We believe Skyrizi represents a highly effective and differentiated treatment option for Crohn’s patients, including the potential to provide meaningful levels of endoscopic improvement with novel and infrequent dosing. Managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for this indication in the coming months. Turning now to Rinvoq, where we’re seeing good momentum across each of the approved indications. Global sales of $592 million were up more than 27% on a sequential basis. Prescriptions in RA remained strong with a total market share of 5.8% in the U.S. and approximately 6% across key international markets. Rinvoq is now achieving an in-play RA share of approximately 13% in the U.S. In PSA, Rinvoq continues to see nice uptake, especially in the room segment with commercial access now equal to RA. We also recently received FDA approval for ankylosing spondylitis and European approval for non-radiographic Axial SpA, further expanding Rinvoq’s potential across rheumatology. In atopic dermatitis, new patient starts are tracking in line with our expectations with Rinvoq’s in-play patient share in the mid-teens. Strong commercial access in AD, which is also now equal to RA and PSA, is expected to considerably increase paid prescription volume in this highly underpenetrated market over the remainder of the year. Lastly, our recent launch of Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis in the U.S. is progressing well. And we recently just received European approval for the same indication. Commercial access in the U.S. is ramping strongly, and we are seeing encouraging new patient starts. Physician feedback regarding Rinvoq’s approved profile in UC has been favorable, especially given the very high rates of remission and endoscopic improvement demonstrated across our UC development program. The addressable patient population for Rinvoq in UC is substantial, with nearly 50% of patients currently on or having used TNF therapy. Turning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.65 billion, down 7.9% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.1 billion, down 17.1% and below our expectations. The CLO market continues to remain challenging in the U.S. with new patient starts down double digits relative to pre-pandemic levels. Now, as you may recall, our initial 2022 Imbruvica sales guidance contemplated a partial market recovery, which, unfortunately, we have not yet observed. In fact, the latest data reflects new patient starts in the U.S. were actually down high single digits versus last year. So, based on recent trends, we no longer believe it’s prudent to anticipate a meaningful market recovery in CLL over the second half of this year. Therefore, we will be removing this assumption from our 2022 guidance. In addition, increasing competition from newer therapies, including other BTK inhibitors as well as our own Venclexta also continue to lower Imbruvica’s share of new patient starts, especially in frontline CLL. Despite this increasing competitive pressure, Imbruvica continues to be the total market share leader across all lines of therapy in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $505 million, up 21.2% on an operational basis. In CLL, we continue to see share gains in the U.S. and across all major international markets. We’re also seeing continued strong performance in AML. Venclexta is now approved in 80 countries and in many markets is already considered the new standard of care for frontline AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. As a result, we are seeing ramping market share throughout the countries where we have launched. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of $492 million were up 13.9% on an operational basis, reflecting continued share gains in the U.S. atypical antipsychotic market. Our launch preparations remain well underway in anticipation of our MDD approval in the fourth quarter. This is a potentially large indication that would represent incremental upside to our current projections for Vraylar. Within migraine, Ubrelvy remains the market-leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine with revenue of $185 million, up 34% on a sequential basis. Qulipta continues to increase its leading new-to-brand share in the U.S. preventative CGRP class when we consider both, paid and bridge volume. We continue to make good progress with expanded commercial access, which will support strong Qulipta sales growth over the remainder of this year. We are also pursuing the commercial approval for Qulipta as a preventative treatment in patients with chronic migraine in the U.S. as well as a new therapy for Europe, potentially further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well in chronic migraine as well as its other indications with total sales of $678 million, up 14.5% on an operational basis. So overall, I’m pleased with the commercial execution across the therapeutic business. Our broad portfolio of differentiated therapies and new launches is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D programs. Tom?
Tom Hudson: Thank you, Jeff. I’ll start with immunology where we had several notable pipeline updates in our inflammatory bowel disease programs for both, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We recently received FDA approval for Skyrizi in Crohn’s disease, and we’re very pleased with the label which reflects a strong benefit risk profile that Skyrizi demonstrated as an induction and maintenance treatment for this condition. Based on its profile, we believe Skyrizi will be a highly effective and differentiated treatment option for patients with Crohn’s disease. Our regulatory application for Skyrizi in Crohn’s disease remains under review in Europe with an approval decision expected near the end of this year. Also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. And we’re excited to bring this new, highly efficacious oral option to patients suffering from this often debilitating disease. In the quarter, we also completed a registrational program for Rinvoq in Crohn’s disease, reporting positive top line results from our Phase 3 maintenance study. We recently submitted our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in this indication and expect approval decisions next year. Once approved for Crohn’s disease, Rinvoq will have completed development programs for all the major rheum and gastro indications covered by Humira plus atopic dermatitis. The strength of the data generated in our clinical programs should position Rinvoq as a highly differentiated treatment across this broad indication set and enable Rinvoq to deliver significant value to AbbVie over the long term. And just this morning, we announced that we received European approval for Rinvoq in non-radiographic Axial SpA, which rounds out Rinvoq’s label in rheumatology. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our pipeline. At the recent EHA meeting, we presented results from the large B-cell lymphoma expansion cohort in the Phase 2 study evaluating epcoritamab in patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. In this study, epcoritamab was well tolerated and drove very deep and durable responses in challenging to treat highly refractory patients with large B-cell lymphoma. We recently discussed these results with regulatory agencies and based on the strength of the data, we intend to submit regulatory applications later this year for accelerated approval of epcoritamab in patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. We expect approval decisions in 2023. We continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on track to see results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. As a reminder, we’ve seen very promising results in this population in prior clinical studies with Venclexta showing high overall response rates and meaningful trends towards prolonged progression-free survival. The level of efficacy we’ve seen suggests that t(11;14) patients may be particularly responsive to Venclexta and this agent has the potential to become an important biomarker-driven treatment option in the multiple myeloma market. In neuroscience, following successful completion of our Phase 3 chronic migraine prevention study, we submitted our regulatory application to the FDA for Qulipta in chronic migraine. Chronic migraine is defined as 15 or more headache days per month with at least 8 of those days associated with migraines. This is a debilitating disease that affects nearly 10% of people suffering from migraine, significantly impacting their quality of life. If approved, this would be another differentiating feature for Qulipta as it would be the only oral CGRP approved for prevention in patients with chronic migraine. We also submitted data from our Phase 3 prevention studies in both, chronic and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the U.S. We expect approval decisions in the U.S. and in Europe in 2023. In the quarter, we submitted our regulatory application in the U.S. for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease. This innovative delivery system has the potential to become a transformative treatment option for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease by providing DUOPA-like efficacy with less invasive nonsurgical administration. We also expect to submit our regulatory application in Europe later this year with approval decisions anticipated in both, the U.S. and Europe in 2023. Now, I’d like to provide a few updates on some earlier-stage programs where we have new data and are advancing programs in development. In immunology, we recently obtained encouraging data in a Phase 2 study evaluating Rinvoq in systemic lupus, an autoimmune multisystem disease. In our study, Rinvoq demonstrated greater response rates as well as a reduction in flares compared with placebo. We’ll see longer-term data in the coming months, which will allow us to make a decision on moving Rinvoq into Phase 3 for lupus. In oncology, where we have a pipeline of promising early-stage programs aimed at solid tumors, we are beginning to see very exciting data from several programs. Our anti-GARP antibody, ABBV-151 is designed to block the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory T cells, which leads to increased T cell effector functions in the tumor microenvironment. This reactivates the immune system against tumors, enhancing the antitumor immune response triggered by a PD-1 inhibitor. In our Phase 1 program, we’re combining 151 with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor in cancer patients who are refractory to or relapsed after PD-1 as well as evaluating this combination in PD-1 nonresponsive tumors. Based on the preliminary efficacy we’ve seen in the dose expansion cohorts for multiple solid tumors, including a deepening of responses over time and prolonged durability, we recently declared proof-of-concept for 151. We plan to advance to Phase 2 in several solid tumors, starting with urothelial cancer. We’re also expecting additional data readouts later this year in other solid tumor indications, including colorectal cancer, which may enable further expansion studies in this hard-to-treat cancer type. We will also begin new studies to explore a broader set of solid tumors where GARP is implicated as a critical immunosuppressive pathway, based on tumor tissue analyses. We’re also making excellent progress with our next-generation c-Met ABBV-400, where the emerging clinical data is very promising in several solid tumors. This asset is similar to Teliso-V as c-MET ADC that uses a microtubulin inhibitor payload. Teliso-V received breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of patients with a subtype of lung cancer with high levels of c-Met overexpression. The toxin warhead for 400 uses a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload, which is similar to irinotecan, a chemotherapy that is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. By targeting c-MET positive tumors with ADCs bearing different warheads we believe we can broaden the range of solid tumors where c-MET therapies can be used. In our Phase 1 program, we are seeing good responses in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and remain encouraged by these early efficacy signals. So in summary, we’ve seen tremendous progress across all stages of our pipeline in the first half of the year, and we remain on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2022. So, with that, I’ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Tom. AbbVie’s second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diversified portfolio. Momentum from new products and recently launched indications allows us to maintain our earnings outlook despite market dynamics for Imbruvica, higher inflation and the stronger U.S. dollar. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, reflecting growth of 11.2% compared to prior year and $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.14 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $14.6 billion, up 6.1% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 220 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.8% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.8% of sales. Net interest expense was $532 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 13.4%. Turning to our financial outlook. We are confirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance between $13.78 and $13.98. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $58.9 billion, reflecting growth of 6.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.7% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated assumptions. We now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $4.8 billion, an increase of $400 million due to strong market share performance. For Imbruvica, we now expect global revenue of approximately $4.7 billion, given the lack of recovery in the CLL market and increasing competition. Moving to the P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales and continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. Turning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 2.1% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.55 and $3.59. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, we delivered strong performance again this quarter, including meaningful contributions from new products and recently launched indications. Given the momentum of our business as well as our pipeline advancements, we are well positioned for the long term. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we’ll take the first question.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is Andrew Baum, Citi. Your line is open.
Andrew Baum: First question is on the guidance range you’ve given for anticipated trajectory of Humira in the U.S., presumably you’re finishing contracting, both with Medicare and commercial. Could you provide any guidance further on ‘23 and even ‘24 [indiscernible] contracts? And then second, a pipeline question in relation to your anti-GARP monoclonal, which you’ve taken a long time to sort of optimize or move forward. I’m just curious whether you’re using any molecular markers in order to minimize risk given the failures of other TGF-beta targeted agents, particularly in colorectal using CMS 4 or a subgroup of the total population, or are you putting it in all comers, the suggestion that what’s an all comers or is this again informed biomarkers? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Andrew, this is Rick. Thank you for the questions. I’ll cover the first one, and then Tom can cover the second one. So, we are in the process now, as we’ve indicated before, of negotiating with the managed care organizations and the PBMs to establish our contract position for Humira in 2023. This is a normal time that you would go through that. It is progressing as we would expect. I would say we’re midway through that process right now. I would expect it to conclude near the end of the third quarter, early the fourth quarter. At that point, that’s an important part of refining our model for 2023 in particular. And what that will tell us is that the positions that we have formulary status for 2023 in for Humira, and that will help us define clearly the volume aspect of it. And so, that’s going well, and that’s going to be an important part of us being able to refine that model. And so, as we get further along in that process, that will give us the ability to be able to potentially refine the model that we have. Now, the one thing that’s important to remember in all of this is price is the other key aspect here. And there, we won’t know real pricing until the actual event starts to occur. So, we will make assumptions around what that price looks like. And I think those will be informed assumptions, but they are just that they’re assumptions. And so, that’s the one piece that will still be somewhat of an unknown until we see the landscape start to play out in 2023, and particularly in midway through 2023 when more biosimilars enter the market. So, as we get more information and we can provide more clarity, we’ll certainly try to do that, but I think that’s where we are right now. Tom?
Tom Hudson: Thank you. Andrew, I’ll try to break down the question in different parts because you’re right, there are many TGF-beta assets. This one is unique, GARP. Most of the TGF-beta assets work either antibodies against receptors to be active for TGF-beta or TGF-beta itself that’s in circulation on cells. But GARP blocks the inactive form of TGF-beta before it’s released from TGF-beta. And we believe that actually is a differentiated mechanism, also allows that specificity to what’s happening in TGF-beta in the tumor as opposed to other systems in the body. At the beginning of this, we thought -- we had already had people that published that they are very good TGF-beta signatures that exist. And I can tell you that GARP signature follows tracks with TGF-beta signatures. And that’s often seen in all solid tumors as susceptive tumors that express these pathways. It’s a very common immunosuppressive mechanism. That’s why people and us are interested in it. We learned -- initially, from data, we kind of suspected that people who actually had a nice hot tumors but were not responding to PD-1, often had, at least from published work -- actually had a higher TGF-beta signature. So, we thought that was a reason to mechanism why these patients with hot tumors were not responding. And a lot of our initial clinical strategy there was actually to go after hot tumors where PD-1s had relapsed or refractory. And we thought we could augment the PD-1 checkpoint response by doing this combination. We did not see monotherapy activity, but in combination, we did. And that’s why our first data sets and expansions like I’ve just discussed in urothelial cancer, this project started earlier, we’re seeing data that’s suggesting that this is correct that you need to reflect both the pathway of TGF-beta and PD-1, to get a response. And those, again, in multiple tumor types we’re seeing these responses and we’re moving forward. At the same time, to bring it to colon, we could also see the same signatures of TGF-beta and GARP in cold tumors, but we weren’t sure that since they’re not IO responsive, whether we’d get a response, we would get a clinical response. So, we did start some investigations. And yes, we did see some responses in cold tumors. They happen over time, sometimes they appear, the tumors are stable for 3 months, maybe 6 months, and then you see these responses appear. They’re very durable, 1 year, 2 year, very unusual. These are patients with advanced disease that have very poor prognosis in Phase 1 studies. So, we saw some, I would say -- we sometimes say in academic column exceptional responders. And so, we decided to expand. So, those data sets are newer, are happening right now. I probably will have the data at the end of this year. But yes, we’ve seen responses to this combination. And to answer your question, so the signatures we’re looking at are not the CMS or kind of histology-based signatures on the tumor. It’s more signatures of the inflammatory response that we can measure in the tumor, and it has to do with both, inflammatory T cells, which are there for the killing, but also the inhibitory TGF-beta signatures. And of course, we’re going to continue to investigate this. I don’t have all the answers for you today, but it certainly has been exciting to see how this program has evolved.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Andrew.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.
Terence Flynn: Maybe two for me. Just wanted to make sure that you are maintaining your 2022 aesthetics guidance of $5.9 billion. Rob, I didn’t hear you call it out, so I’m assuming that was a reiteration, just given what you’re seeing with Juvederm in the U.S. And then the second question I had relates more of a, I guess, strategic one, Rick. I know you’re still going through the conversations with 2023 for Humira. But, as you think about providing an update to guidance, whether that happens with the 3Q results or with the 4Q results, do you think you’ll be able to provide some outlook on 2024 because I think something investors are discussing now is just if the possibility of the impact is more in ‘24, how we should think about revenue margins in ‘24 versus ‘23. So, just wondering strategically how you’re thinking about that at this point, not asking for guidance, more just thought process.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So, Terence, I’ll take both of those questions, and then Rob can certainly jump in here if he has something he wants to add. We are maintaining the aesthetic guidance as we’ve indicated. Certainly, we have seen good, strong performance on the toxin side of the business, and we would expect it to continue. As we look at the filler side of the business, as you’ve noted, it was lighter this quarter than we’ve seen historically. And I’d say that was driven by a couple of issues. It was certainly driven by the China- Russia issue outside the U.S. In the U.S., we did have a very successful promotional program that we ran last year. So, it was a tough comparison versus last year. But I’d also say, we have seen some glimpses of what could be inflationary pressure on that business or it could be pent-up demand for vacations. And Carrie can certainly go through more detail if there’s a follow-up question. But I think as we look at the business overall, we’re comfortable maintaining the guidance now. We believe that Botox will continue to perform very well. And obviously, we’re doing more things to be able to drive the toxin side of the business. It’s at a price point where it should be less sensitive to inflationary pressures. The price point for toxin is about $500, I think, right, Gary? And where fillers are almost twice that or maybe even a little more than twice that. So clearly, from a disposable income standpoint, fillers are more challenging for people than toxins are. And so that’s the rationale behind it. And certainly, as we look at the overall performance of the AbbVie business, we have plenty of opportunities with the diversity of our portfolio to cover any potential shortfall if we ended up having an issue. So, that’s why we’re comfortable maintaining the guidance. And I think we need to see more time play out here to see exactly where we are from a U.S. inflationary impact. On the second question, as it relates to an update on ‘23 and potentially something on ‘24. I think the way you’ve described it is accurate. When we have more information, we’ll try to provide that. And when we’ve gotten to a point that certainly by the fourth quarter call, we’re going to provide you guidance on what we think will happen in 2023. But if we can provide something on the third quarter call, I wouldn’t be looking for guidance. I think that’s not a good expectation. But certainly, potentially a little more clarification on what our contracting status looks like at that point and how that will translate into what we think. And if we can refine the model to a greater degree, we would certainly provide that. As it relates to 2024, certainly, I’m not going to -- we’re not in a position we’re going to talk about 2024 right now. And I think that would be a little bit unlikely because not all these contracts will be two-year contracts. And so, you really won’t know what your volume position is at that point. And as I said, you won’t know what the pricing is going to be, particularly midway through the year. And so, I think those will be important things to be able to dial in to where the forecast is going. I’d say, overall, we feel good about the contracting position that we’re in. And then, I’d say, the other thing is, I know investors really want to try to model this between ‘23 and ‘24. I understand why you want to do that. Certainly, we obviously would like to do that to the greatest degree possible. But, when you step back and you actually look at the performance of AbbVie and how you will value AbbVie and what AbbVie means going forward, it has relatively little to do with Humira, and that shape of that curve between ‘23 and ‘24. And certainly, by the end of ‘24, we should reach a point where we’ve achieved some level of stability on the tail of Humira. What AbbVie is all about is these other products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq and Vraylar and Ubrelvy, the aesthetics business, Qulipta. Those are going to be the things that drive it. So, if you want to focus on something and it’s what we focus on internally is that underlying growth engine that will emerge on the other side of whatever erosion Humira ends up suffering before it hit some level of stability and tail is those assets and then what comes out of the pipeline. Those are the key things that are going to create that growth between 25% and 30%. And that’s the part that we -- I would say, we’re obviously managing Humira to the greatest extent we can. But that’s the part that we as a team are focusing on. And I think that’s the most important part because that is the AbbVie going forward.
Operator: Our next question is Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.
Mohit Bansal: Maybe dwelling a little bit more on the Humira question for Rick and Jeff. So, you said that pricing from the competition will be key unknown for next year. As you get into contracts this year, for the next year, how rigid or flexible these contracts are from the pricing point of view when PBMs realize that the biosimilar is giving an X or Y pricing, or would that be more of a 2024 issue rather than 2023? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Well, let me take a shot at that, and certainly, Jeff is closer to it. So, Jeff, if you want to add anything in, feel free to jump in and add. Typically, when you contract for an asset like Humira, you’re contracting for a formulary position. And there aren’t volume requirements or other kinds of requirements. I think it’s also -- it would be prudent to assume that biosimilars will be on these contracts, whether it’s one or more than one that will coexist with Humira. So, price plays an important role in that because they will coexist. And so, I’d say -- and as that becomes fluid, you would have to make decisions around how you try to deal with that to maintain the kinds of volumes that you want to maintain. And we’ve said all along, the strategy that we’ll have in the U.S. is similar to the strategy that we had internationally, and that is maintain as much volume as we can at the highest level of profit that we can maintain it at. And that is the logic that we will employ. But that doesn’t mean we won’t have to be somewhat responsive to prices in the marketplace on Humira. Jeff, anything you’d add?
Jeff Stewart: No, I think that’s -- Rick, that’s a very reasonable way to look at it in terms of how these negotiations are going and how we see ‘23 playing out. I mean, the real big ones in terms of how we look at it is the two big scenarios are you are likely coexisting with one or more biosimilars or if the negotiations don’t go the way that we anticipate that were excluded in favor of biosimilars. And that’s basically where price and volume -- in terms of refining our model, for ‘23. That’s the work that we’re doing over the summer and then into the fall.
Operator: Next question is Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets.
Gary Nachman: So, Skyrizi was very strong in the second quarter, and you raised guidance nicely. How much of a benefit are you getting from the psoriatic arthritis indication thus far? What are you expecting Crohn’s to contribute this year? How much are those playing into the raised guidance? And are you revisiting the long-term guidance on Skyrizi at this point, given the strong performance? And then just on the hem/onc franchise. Are you keeping the infrastructure intact preparing for new products to contribute? And maybe you could talk about the near-term opportunities you see for products like epcoritamab and navitoclax, how much of those could contribute and potentially offset some of the pressure you’ve been seeing from Imbruvica? Thanks.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you. It’s Jeff. Thanks for the question. So, your instinct and observation is right. The big dynamic change for Skyrizi here, largely what you’re seeing is from the psoriatic arthritis indication. And obviously saw very, very large sequential moves. And let me give you some sense of what we’re looking at. So, we’re seeing that we’re putting more and more basically headroom into the overall share position, first in psoriatic disease, so that’s psoriasis plus PSA. So, we’re at 26% in terms of total TRx share and moving very, very nicely up. So, that’s being driven by this PSA acceleration. So first, remember that the PSA indication, we were the -- really the last large product that didn’t have that indication. So first, what happens is it starts to interact very positively in the dermatology segment. So, as I mentioned, about 30% of patients both have skin and joint involvement. And so we actually had a lower despite the fact that we had the leading psoriasis share, we had a lower psoriasis share because we weren’t covered with the joints with that indication. So, you see an immediate, very rapid acceleration of our overall derm business that I highlighted. Secondly, strategically important to the performance is that we’re able to launch the PSA indication for Skyrizi in rheumatology. So, it starts to work together with the Rinvoq PSA indication, and the rheum segment is 3 times as large as the derm segment. So, it’s a very, very good dynamic in terms of our momentum in two large segments, even before we get to Crohn’s. Now, I would say that as we’ve talked about before, I mean, Skyrizi is a very special product, very unique dosing, very stable, incredible efficacy. And so, we are encouraged on the early results of Crohn’s. It’s too early to start to see numbers or et cetera. But all of that is playing into the raise that Rob talked about.
Rob Michael: And Gary, this is Rob. Just on the guidance. So, if you recall, earlier in the year, we got asked the question, I said PSA for Skyrizi was going to contribute about $200 million this year. It’s probably closer to $400 million now with the guidance range, given the very nice uptick we’ve seen in PSA. But part of that guidance raise is also the strong share performance in psoriasis. So, it includes both. In terms of Crohn’s, that hasn’t changed. We’ve set approximately $100 million this year as we ramp access for Crohn’s. But obviously, the long-term potential for it is tremendous, and we’re very excited about that.
Jeff Stewart: And maybe I can also then chime in on the second question. Certainly, that is a -- the new assets are a very important part of our growth story for hem/onc. Certainly, as I mentioned, we’re still continuing to ramp around the world with CLL. We have more and more impressive data, particularly in the unfit frontline population. We have five years of data in the fit population for frontline for Venclexta. We’re encouraged with the myeloma data, which is very unique in terms of biomarker driven approach for the (11;14). Navitoclax would be really one of the first new entrants for myelofibrosis, where there’s really only been rocks in terms of that market. Epcoritamab, increasingly encouraging data in terms of the simple subcu, very rapid ways to get this medication in later lines and then building into frontline. So we are very, very encouraged while we see some pressure on Imbruvica, the new indications in base for Venclexta helps to offset that. And then we start to build with those near-term hem assets and super encouraged in terms of what we’re seeing in terms of the probability that we can get there.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Schott J.P. Morgan.
Chris Schott: First one, I just wanted to come back to dynamics on the U.S. dermal filler market. I guess specifically, can you just quantify how much of the weakness we saw this -- or the decline year-over-year was due to the promotion events last year versus the impact from the economic pressures that you’re seeing? And I guess, in the same context, are you seeing any signs of weakness in the European business? I’m just -- and what I was just trying get your hands around, what type of magnitude of impact you’re talking about here in terms of either of its inflation or economic sensitivity to that business. My second question was just thinking about Rinvoq and Skyrizi formulary and pricing dynamics going forward as biosimilar Humira enters the market. I guess, are you expecting or are you hearing through discussions, any major shifts in the way payers are thinking about those products as we think about pricing coming down and obviously the largest kind of product in the space there.
Carrie Strom: Hi. This is Carrie. I’ll take your first question around Juvederm. And as Rick said, there was a onetime promotional event that we ran in the U.S. for Juvederm in Q2 of last year, and it was highly successful, and it increased sales in the sales space, which created the challenging prior year comparison. So, that was the key driver. But as you noted, there is also this impact -- economic impact that is suggestive of some early changes in consumer behavior. And that really isn’t surprising in light of the inflationary pressures that we’re seeing on discretionary income. And as Rick said, the filler market is likely more sensitive to that than toxins for a few reasons. We mentioned the price point. So a price point of closer to $1,000 versus $500 for toxin, also the nature of the filler business is different than toxin from a patient dynamic and treatment dynamic and that there are more -- there’s a longer interval between treatments for fillers versus toxin, which is sort of like a more regular treatment paradigm a few times a year. Also, the patient bases are different. When you think about the toxin patient base and Botox Cosmetic, the majority of the patient base is continuing patients versus more of a reliance on new patient acquisition. And so, those are some of the factors we’re thinking about when we think about the deceleration of the filler market in Q2 but while the market has slowed and despite the performance in Q2, we do continue to expect a positive second half growth for U.S. Juvederm, really weighted more in the fourth quarter as we’re going to launch two new fillers in the fourth quarter. And those two new fillers will get us into incremental categories for HA fillers, including jawline and skin quality, which will help to drive some incremental demand at the end of the year. And in terms of your question around economic impact outside of the U.S., we are watching that very closely, and we really have not seen that yet outside of the U.S.
Jeff Stewart: In terms of your second question, again, it’s Jeff. Thanks for that. We’re -- we don’t see some significant pressures on Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Now, we always have discussions with the payers, we look at our contracting strategy. But I think we fall back on our clinical evidence that we have on these two major assets. I mean, we have four head-to-head trials against other major competitors with Skyrizi, where we have just really growth superiority versus whether it’s an IL-17, whether it’s Humira, which one day will be biosimilar, STELARA, et cetera. So just the pure performance there and the momentum, it’s clearly a distinguished asset. We’re going to be first in terms of Crohn’s to start to establish that new area and build the market there. And I think on Rinvoq to some degree, there’s only one other JAK inhibitor that is not going to have the scope of indications and it’s Xeljanz. And Xeljanz has been significantly wounded based on the oral surveillance data. So, in terms of our ability to build and protect and grow Skyrizi and Rinvoq into the next stage of development, we’re quite confident that we have the assets to be able to do that.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Scala, Cowen.
Steve Scala: Two questions. First, Rick, in the past, you have laid out four factors that will dictate Humira’s trajectory in 2023. The first two were Humira access and biosimilar price, and it’s clear it’s too early for any news on either of those points. But the second two were competitiveness of biosimilars, which you said in part was interchangeability and also the biosimilar ability to supply the market. So, those two factors, three and four are things that won’t fluctuate and presumably, you have some visibility on that now. So, I’m just wondering if there’s anything unusual occurring there. And in discussions, how important is interchangeability with payers. The second question is, and I apologize if I missed it, but are there any updates on the TNF steroid conjugate and is Phase 2 RA data still expected this year? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: All right. Thanks, Steve. This is Rick. I’ll cover the first one. And Roopal can cover the second one. So, you are correct. That is what I described a meeting or two ago as the four variables. I would say, when you think about interchangeability, I think you have to think about it in the backdrop of not just interchangeability, but also what is the profile that is the closest to Humira today? And we can look at all the biosimilars and have -- we have pretty good visibility as to what that profile looks like. And what I would say is, to get a profile that is interchangeable and is consistent with the current Humira that’s predominantly in the marketplace today, that’s probably going to occur in the summer of 2023. There should be one or two biosimilars that have a profile that looks like that. And that would make it somewhat easier for an organization to make a switch. So, I think that will play an important variable. Nothing has changed in the last few months in what that profile looks like. And then obviously, supply is an important aspect that certainly anyone that we’re looking at making a significant change in their position with Humira is going to want to make sure that they’re going with a company that has the ability to be able to produce at volume, at significant volumes, Humira, and they can do it sustainably. So, there are certain players that I would say clearly have that ability to be able to do it, similar to us. Certainly, no one does it at the scale of us or anywhere close to the scale of us. But there are also a lot of small players that I think supply is going to be an important aspect and going to somewhat limit the ability to be able to have broad market impact. And so, those are going to be important dynamics as we negotiate with the various managed care organizations. I can tell you that we’re talking through those kinds of things with them. Roopal?
Roopal Thakkar: Yes. Thanks. Yes. So, 154 is our anti-TNF conjugated steroid, as you mentioned, and it’s enabled to target delivery of steroid directly to inflammatory cells. So, we do have that Phase 2 running several hundred patients, and we still anticipate getting read later this year and then further data to follow next year.
Operator: Our next question is Chris Raymond, Piper Sadler.
Chris Raymond: Two questions. Maybe one that’s more broad policy and then another one that’s maybe a little bit more detailed. So, maybe first for Rick. I know you guys keep pretty close tabs on healthcare policy. Just on the most recent Senate Democrat drug pricing language in the reconciliation bill. The provisions on the face of it seemed pretty manageable in terms of direct impact from pricing controls, but there’s been some concern around this being just the start of something larger in terms of price controls. Any thoughts from you guys on this would be appreciated. And then, maybe a more detailed question on ABBV-951. I know you guys haven’t provided specific guidance on this or on Duodopa, but there seems to be a lot of recognition of 951 among movement disorder KOLs as a real improvement in terms of overcoming reticence around Duodopa. Just how should we be thinking about 951 vis-à-vis Duodopa, if approved? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So, I’ll take the first question. I mean, I think if you look at the drug pricing proposal that’s out there, it’s certainly an important issue for us, and I think it’s an important issue for patients. I think if I look at that bill, and I’m assuming that if there were something that were to pass, it would be somewhat consistent with what was in the build back better for the Senate Finance text. And so far, it looks like that, but obviously evolving a bit here as we go along. And if I look at it in total, what I’d say is there’s a couple of positive things in there. Certainly, most notably, the $2,000 cap out-of-pocket costs for patients and the ability to be able to smooth, I think that’s an important step in increasing affordability, especially for patients in Medicare Part D. And so, that’s something we’ve been supportive of. We’ve been vocal that we think that’s an important step forward. What I’d say on balance, this is a bill that has far more negatives than it has positives in it. And I think although it may not be short term that challenging from a financial standpoint, I think the long-term implications of this bill are pretty significant. And they really hinge around this so-called negotiation clause that’s in there and how that’s being implemented, particularly for small molecules. And if you’re familiar with it, essentially what it says is that CMS or we’re assuming it will be CMS, has the ability at a certain point in time to be able to negotiate a price on a set of drugs. And by the time you get there, it will be a big set of drugs that they’ll have the ability to be able to negotiate on. And the key issue is this. Essentially, they have full latitude to basically decide whatever price they want the drug to be. And I wouldn’t necessarily call it a negotiation because the only alternative that the manufacturer has is to accept a 95% penalty on their revenues or, in essence, take a 95% discount. So, it’s not a negotiation. We should just call it what it is. It’s price controls is what they’re basically putting in place if the language stays the same. And ultimately, I think the real challenge is how we invest in this as an industry in innovation. If you take small molecules as an example, I’ll walk you through an example that illustrates the point that I’m going to raise here. If you take a small molecule, it says at year nine after the first approval, CMS has the right to be able to negotiate the price on that drug. So, if you take an oncology drug as an example, how do we develop oncology drugs in this industry? And what do the regulatory authorities typically require us to do, to be able to develop an oncology drug. Well, they typically require you to do and what we typically do is we go to patients who have failed on all the existing therapies, fourth-line patients, fifth-line patients. And we take whatever drug we have and we determine, do we have a positive benefit risk in that patient population. If we find that we do, then we seek approval for that drug in that patient population, so that those patients will get the benefit of that drug. And then, we start to work our way up towards front line. Those who refractory patients are typically very small populations of patients, right? And you can never get a return on a drug just on that patient population. And then, you work your way up to front line, or second line, or wherever you end up. That process typically takes 7 to 9 years because of the length of the trials. So essentially, with this, by the time you got to the larger populations, you’d be within a year or two of when CMS could change the price. But one, it’s impossible to figure out what the return is going to be, so how do you invest? Two, it really puts negative pressure on you not to continue to develop new indications. But the most detrimental part of it is to patients who need these drugs or small indications or in later stage. Because you’re faced with the dilemma -- and this is a horrible dilemma, right, as a company and for patients. You’re faced with a dilemma of do I choose not to seek approval in those late-stage patients, so I don’t start the clock and wait until I’m closer to frontline before I start the clock. That is not the right policy. And I would say, on balance, this bill will have a couple of things that are good for patients that I’m fully supportive of. But unless Congress wants to harm patients and harm innovation in this industry, they need to change that part of it. It doesn’t make sense. It’s shortsighted. Now, they can change it in a couple of different ways. They can determine, okay, what is a floor price or a maximum discount by year and then you can calculate the return on investment that you’re going to have on the drug or they can at least make it consistent with biologics that are out 13 years. Otherwise, the investment in small molecule oncology drugs or neuroscience drugs, which Medicare patient populations are highly dependent on new innovative drugs in those areas because they’re elderly patients, are going to suffer. And the CBO report that was published back in April of last year clearly pointed that out. So, this isn’t something I’m just saying or industry is just saying. And in fact, if anything, I’d say, they probably undercall the magnitude of the impact. So, this is an important issue. We all know the affordability and access for Medicare patients is important. But you don’t need to destroy the innovation model in the process in order to provide that. And so, I’m hopeful that we’ll see some movement here and some rationality will play out.
Jeff Stewart: Okay. And to address your 951 -- hi, it’s Jeff. Thanks for the question. So, I think some perspective is globally, DUOPA is about $0.5 billion brand. And certainly, we’ve said that we believe that 951 could certainly double that up or more. I’ll give you the perspective of why we think that way. So, if you look at the advanced Parkinson’s patients, about 85% sort of cycle when they stay on these generic orals that become less and less and less effective. And the only thing they can really do, and that’s about 15% of the market, the advanced Parkinson market, is they can move to either deep brain stimulation or DUOPA. But you got to go through a surgical barrier. So, the families and the patients are forced to think if I need to get improvement in my symptoms and my quality of life, I’m forced to basically think about do I get a hole in my head or a hole in my stomach with a gastric surgery. This is going to be a subcu. And so, we see in our market research that at least 40% to 60% of people never want to move towards DBS or DUOPA. So, we think this is a way where we can start to expand and create a new market segment, in essence, a subcutaneous segment where you don’t have to take that risk on the surgery. And like you mentioned in the movement disorder centers, there’s a significant amount of experts that are excited about this new option, and we believe that it’s going to be a real innovation for patients without having the surgery.
Rob Michael: And Chris, this is Rob. As Jeff said, I mean, we expect this to be market expanding. At the JPMorgan conference earlier this year, we did give peak revenue guidance for 951 greater than $1 billion. Obviously, DUOPA is $0.5 billion now. If you’re modeling it, obviously, there’ll be some level of cannibalization, I’d say, minor level of cannibalization on Duodopa. But when you think about the combination between 951 and Duodopa, obviously, it’s going to grow the revenue for the Company and expand the market.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. It’s Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: Hi. If I could just go back to the whole ‘23 versus ‘24 thing, am I -- I thought that in the past, you guys have said earnings would trough in 2023 and then return to growth in 2024. Is that still the case, or is that off the table? And then, second question goes back to the 154 compound, your antibody drug conjugate. We understand that the timing is still on track, but I just -- it feels like to me there’s a distinct lack of enthusiasm towards this program, you don’t seem to mention that much or at all really, despite its novelty and despite it being in your most critical franchise of immunology. So, has the enthusiasm waned over, let’s say, the last couple of years?
Rob Michael: So Tim, this is Rob. On your first question, what we’ve said -- we’ve talked about this 45% with a range around that plus or minus 10% and using, obviously, the Europe analog as an example. And in that case, with the steep erosion year one and ‘23, you would expect then the trough to be in ‘23 and return to growth in ‘24. As this plays out, we’ll see how that shakes out. Ultimately, if more of it happens in ‘24, you obviously have another year of growth for all your growth brands. And so, you have a different floor in that scenario. But most importantly, it’s what happens in ‘25 and beyond. When you look at this company with the growth drivers we have, we’ll be delivering high-single-digit growth in ‘25 and beyond, which is industry-leading. We’ll have the lowest LOE exposure in the industry in the second half of this decade. And so, we’re focused on the long term, we feel very good about the prospects of this business. But as it stands now, the most recent direction we’ve given is expect that first year erosion, so that 45% plus or minus 10%, which then play out to a return to growth in ‘24. We’ll obviously update the market as we see it play out next year.
Tom Hudson: Maybe I’ll take this one. This is Tom Hudson. I’m a clinical immunologist, and I know how we’ve been using steroids, they can give very profound and deep immunosuppression, decrease inflammation, and that’s often used in severe cases when patient shows up. So, we know that the response is very strong, but there are a lot of side effects. And, when our problem is always weaning, the steroid’s out in the clinic. So here, again, the combination of immunomodulator like TNF and steroid have that potential of giving us that deep, deep response very quickly to remove the immunosuppression. And based on the data we’ve seen preclinically in our Phase 1 studies, we’re not seeing those biomarkers or side effects in the bone or brain, a cortisol or others. So we’ve already demonstrated that, and we have nice data. The other -- so that’s my enthusiasm. We expect to see deep responses, durable responses with much well better tolerated than steroids. Our program -- and we’ve shown this also is that we’ve actually believed in the platform and we’re developing steroid ADCs for other targets to target other immune systems -- other immune cells, more specifically around some T cells or some B cells or some fibroblasts. These programs are coming forward. We think this is a profound platform in immunology to go after different biologies -- in very targeted steroid suppression of different specific immune cell types, and that’s going to play out over the next couple of years. So, based on the data we saw, we expanded the platform to other biomarkers getting into other specific immune cell types. Of course, we’re quiet because we need to see the data, all -- the study has been fully recruited, actually moved faster than we expected. And the day was randomized. We’re just going to see the data in the fall because it’s a blinded study. But the enthusiasm is there. And we’re also, of course, seeing that data, and then we have PMR because we also started studies there in Crohn’s disease. We’ll see that data later, but the more data we have, the more likely we’re going to expand this program to other indications where we believe that deep steroid suppression with TNF might actually bring new solutions for patients.
Operator: Our next question is Geoff Meacham, Bank of America. Your line is open.
Geoff Meacham: Great. Thank you so much for the question. Not to belabor the point on Humira, but I wanted to ask you, is the long-term, meaning the four-year kind of trend that we saw this quarter for Humira in Europe, is that still a good proxy for how you guys are thinking about the tail for Humira, just given we’re coming up on four years in Europe and we’re talking about high single-digit erosion still. So, I wanted to kind of ask you about the tail piece of what you expect in the U.S. And the second question, just on Rinvoq, I wanted to ask you also on the -- since the FDA labeling change, you just seen any changes with regard to persistent rates or new starts just on your feedback from the field and how docs view the safety of the JAK class. Thank you.
Rob Michael: Jeff, this is Rob. I’ll take your first question. So, the way we’ve talked about Humira erosion, it’s played out in Europe as we saw that steep erosion in year one, more moderate erosion years beyond. In our modeling now, that’s probably the best way to think about it is deep erosion year one, more moderate. You’ll have an annualization impact in year two, but more moderate beyond that. And specifically within the Wave 1 countries, when we look at Europe, and the level of revenue we have this year relative to pre-LOE, we still have about 30% of the revenue footprint. So, it gives you a sense of where Europe is after four years. Obviously, as we model the U.S. out, and it will be more specific in the future, but right now, we’re using Europe as an analog.
Jeff Stewart: And regarding Rinvoq in terms of perceptions from the field or what we’re seeing. It’s largely developing as we predicted. So, we do see segments of physicians that are more wary of the JAKs after the label change. However, we anticipated that. So, we are starting to see a recovery in second line plus in RA as we anticipated. And the new indications because really we’ll be the only JAK inhibitor with the four big indications of RA, PSA, AS and then non-radiographic ultimately in the fall. That just builds upon the confidence level of the physician. So, that’s what we’re feeling from the field. I’ll mention maybe some color on ulcerative colitis. I mentioned that we’re encouraged on the ulcerative colitis start. So, we saw in the quarter because we launched in early April. We saw 600 unique gastroenterologists start to write prescriptions, which is quite interesting and good, a positive. And about half of those customers had never written a JAK inhibitor. So, Xeljanz was approved. And so, we’re seeing, obviously, the ability of these customers to understand the overall risk benefit of Rinvoq relative to, let’s say, another JAK inhibitor. So I feel that our communication is on track, and we’re seeing positive feedback as we build the indications that we’ve highlighted in the call.
Operator: Our next question is Colin Bristow with UBS.
Colin Bristow: Another one on the ‘23 Humira guidance. Could you just walk us through -- at the point at the end of 3Q, what percentage of contracts or volume will you have confirmed at that point? And then, it sounds like that by the -- by the time you have the full year results, you’re still anticipating that there could be a meaningful change. Could you just confirm that’s a fair characterization? And then just on ABBV-154, what are you hoping to see with the Phase 2 data that we’re going to get at year-end? And what’s the threshold here that you need to surpass to move forward? Thanks.
Tom Hudson: Yes. So, if we look at the discussions that we’ve highlighted and Rick highlighted, I think and they’re progressing as we would expect. So typically, they start in the late spring. And look, these are complex negotiations. They go on for many, many months. In many years, we would have completed the -- at least the large PBM negotiations, which is the vast majority of the volume by that October time frame. In some cases, as you probably know, the payers would publish this information. But very often, not always, the immunology an inflammatory segment, those negotiations can go on longer, and they’re very often published as a TBD in what used to be called the exclusionary formulary. So, we would -- as Rick mentioned, we would have visibility to sort of the status on the volume in that October time frame. That’s a reasonable assumption. Again, I don’t know for sure, given the complexity of biosimilar negotiation, which has never taken place before. But that’s a reasonable way to think about when we’d start to have the visibility to the volume component, as Rick highlighted.
Roopal Thakkar: Yes. And it’s Roopal on the 154 question. Dovetailing on what Tom just walked through, things that we want to see are consistent with how we develop in immunology, certainly raising standard of care. So, the way this was designed was to have that anti-TNF and then that direct delivery to avoid systemic side effects of the steroids. So, you’d see sort of that one-two punch as Tom was describing and see that depth of response. So, once we see that type of information along with how it looks from a steroid standpoint, metabolic effects, bone effects taken together will give us a great sense of where it could fit before anti-TNFs, even after we’re studying patients that have failed anti-TNFs in this Phase 2 study. So, taken together, that will give us a really good sense of where to go. And then remember, we’re also going to get data in polymyalgia rheumatic. It’s not an uncommon disease, and these patients are -- many of them are steroid-dependent, 50% or so three years and going and they can’t withdraw from steroids and maybe a third can be 5 plus 6 years. They’re stuck on steroids. So we’ll see that data where we’re able to prevent them from flaring and to be able to reduce their systemic steroid dose. So, there’s multiple facets to this and potentially a number of opportunities and then later on in Crohn’s disease as well.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Colin.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.
Chris Shibutani: Two questions, if I could. For Skyrizi, if I could just return to this question of how you’re thinking about the long-term guidance. I think on Skyrizi, recalling that you said $7.5 billion, consisting of about 6 from the psoriatic complex. And yet you’re almost already approaching something close to $5 billion. So, can you tell us how you’re thinking about how that could factor in any long-term thinking? And then, for epcoritamab, positioning of that treatment in the overall treatment paradigm. How are you thinking about that in relation to, for instance, CAR-T therapy treatment options before, after? Thank you.
Rob Michael: Chris, this is Rob. I’ll take that question. So look, we’re very encouraged by Skyrizi’s continued strong performance. We remain confident in our ability to achieve or exceed that 2025 guidance. Now, keep in mind, I mean, the Street also reflects that too. Street is about $400 million higher than that $7.5 billion. That said, we don’t intend on frequently updating that guidance. Obviously, we’ll provide that guidance update every few years or if there’s an event or there’s a major disconnect. So obviously, if the Street was way off, we want to point that out. But overall, we’re very encouraged about the uptake for Skyrizi. It’s clearly demonstrating its ability to drive long-term growth for AbbVie, and we’ll provide an update for long-term guidance at the appropriate time.
Neil Gallagher: Thanks. And on the epcoritamab question. So I’m not going to go through all of the data points again, we’ve described them several times in the public domain. What I would remind you of is that we’ve observed extremely robust efficacy in a heavily pretreated population. Now it’s true to say that 40% of those patients have sailed CAR-Ts, but 60% of those patients didn’t sail CAR-T. Therefore, our expectation, our intention, rather, and as we’ve mentioned earlier on in Tom’s prepared remarks, we are anticipating filing for accelerated approval during the second half of this year. And I think that what you can expect is that we believe that the total population, the total relapsed/refractory population, whether or not they sail CAR-Ts should have access to epcoritamab because of the strength of the data overall. In terms of future positioning, we’ve also discussed in the past our intention of initiating multiple phase -- additional Phase 3, the confirmatory study for the DLBCL application what would be the confirmatory study, the Phase 3 study is ongoing. That’s in the relapsed/refractory setting. And our anticipation is that we will initiate multiple additional Phase 3s, both in DLBCL and other indications over the coming 12 to 18 months.
Jeff Stewart: Maybe I could just build on that. Chris, it’s Jeff. So, we’ve started to talk to different types of physicians, whether they’re in the CAR-T centers or certainly the community centers. We’re increasingly believing that this lymphoma is treated in the community centers. And so, what we hear, at least at a high level from our research so far is wow, that efficacy is incredibly impressive, even after CAR-T. But where they go is this simple subcu of epcoritamab may be the fastest way to deliver T cells to my patients I’m dealing with. So to build on Neil’s point, that data doesn’t look like it’s niching the drug. In fact, it looks like it’s sort of contributing to the idea of like this is a democratized type of medication for the lymphoma. So, it’s very encouraging from our initial work that we’re doing with physicians.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: And that question comes from David Risinger with SVB Securities.
David Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much, and thanks for all the details on today’s call. Rick, I was hoping that you could help us to understand the current M&A landscape, how would you characterize it broadly? And then, if you could also comment more specifically on AbbVie with respect to the transaction opportunity set for AbbVie. Thanks very much.
Rick Gonzalez: I think, if you look at the M&A environment, I think many players are trying to add to their portfolios. I think there’s less of an appetite for larger transactions right now in general across the industry. Some of that’s probably predicated on the fact that the FTC has been pretty tough in their language around larger kinds of transactions and your ability to be able to get those through. And I think as it relates to us, I mean, we have continued to execute the strategy that we put in place after the Allergan transaction. Allergan, obviously brought us a tremendous amount of diversity. That transaction has been highly successful and has really changed the look and the shape of AbbVie and it has clearly enhanced our performance, and we’ve done quite well. Our focus is continuing to look for opportunities to be able to fill out our portfolio in areas that we believe there are opportunities to bring in strategic assets. We’re probably working more on earlier-stage assets add to our R&D pipeline. Epcoritamab is a good example of the kinds of things that we’re out looking for and finding, to supplement the overall pipeline. I think that strategy has worked well, and it’s a strategy that we’ll continue to do going forward.
Liz Shea: Thanks, David. That concludes today’s conference call. If you’d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: And thank you. This does conclude the call. You may disconnect your line. And thank you for your participation.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-04-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] Today’ conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President, Head of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman, Finance and Commercial Operations and Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D, and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call are Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics; Neil Gallagher, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer; and Roopal Thakkar, Vice President, Global Regulatory Affairs. Before we get started, some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today’s conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll briefly comment on our overall performance, then Jeff, Tom and Rob will review our first quarter business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. I'm pleased with the excellent start to 2022. It further reinforces our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of the business. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, exceeding our expectations. Total net revenue of more than $13.5 billion was up 5.4% on an operational basis, also above our expectations. These results demonstrate strong momentum across several key products and portfolios, including robust double-digit operational revenue growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well. We are achieving impressive market share gains in psoriasis, which remains a significant market opportunity. Skyrizi's recent launch in psoriatic arthritis as well as the anticipated regulatory approval in Crohn's disease should also serve as important growth drivers over the long-term. Rinvoq is also contributing compelling sales growth. Subscription trends in RA have recently stabilized as we expected and we are making excellent progress repositioning the brand as the leading second-line agent based on the robust data generated across our broad development programs. The early launch trends for Rinvoq in both atopic dermatitis and psoriatic arthritis are highly encouraging, with commercial access and paid prescriptions expected to ramp significantly over the coming months. We anticipate that these two new indications, along with the recent U.S. approval in ulcerative colitis, should add substantial revenue growth for Rinvoq over the long-term. Neuroscience remains an exciting opportunity for our company. Vraylar continues to have strong momentum across our currently approved indications and the pending regulatory approval in major depressive disorder represents a significant upside to current projections. In migraine, our portfolio of distinct therapies with Ubrelvy, Qulipta and Botox Therapeutic is demonstrating robust double-digit sales growth. With the migraine market anticipated to roughly double in size over the next several years, there is significant headroom for continued revenue growth with these compelling therapies. Aesthetics is once again exceeding expectations. The category continues to grow robust double digits, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial opportunity for further market penetration. Our commercial team is executing at a high level with targeted promotion and enhanced digital services, including our Alle loyalty program driving strong market share performance across our major brands. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie, and I'm extremely pleased with the evolution and momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're making excellent progress with the launches of several new products and indications, which will collectively add meaningful revenue for AbbVie as commercial access ramps for each of these opportunities over the remainder of this year. We're off to another exceptional start, and our long-term growth prospects remain strong. I'd now like to take a brief moment to thank Mike Severino for his contributions to the success of AbbVie over the last eight years. As you know, Mike has decided to leave AbbVie at the end of May to pursue another career opportunity, and we wish him all the best. I'd also like to take this opportunity to formally introduce to you Tom Hudson. Tom joined AbbVie back in 2016 as the Head of Discovery and Early Development. In 2018, Tom undertook responsibilities for AbbVie's entire discovery organization. Then in 2019, was promoted to the Head of AbbVie R&D and Chief Scientific Officer, where he assumed responsibility for all of AbbVie's R&D. Tom has an impressive background as a clinical scientist. His medical specialty is in clinical immunology and allergy. Tom played a critical role in the human genome project while working at both the Whitehead Institute and MIT, where Tom led the team that mapped the human genome. Tom was also instrumental in the international half map project to refine the genetic architecture of the human genome. Tom went on to further lead the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, which included discovery and translational cancer research with a clinical network of more than 1,000 investigators. Tom will be providing an update on our continued pipeline progress to you later in the call. But first, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with Immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 8.1% on an operational basis. Humira global sales were approximately $4.7 billion, down 1.8% on an operational basis with low single-digit revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across international markets, where revenues were down 17.9% operationally.  Skyrizi global revenues were $940 million, reflecting positive momentum in both approved indications. In psoriasis, Skyrizi is demonstrating impressive market share gains globally. Skyrizi now accounts for approximately 23% of the total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market. Skyrizi's in-play psoriasis share, which includes both new and switching patients, also remains very, very strong and now reflects roughly 40% patient share in the U.S. and a clear number one leadership position.  Skyrizi is performing exceptionally well internationally, where we have now achieved approximately 10% psoriasis share across our top 12 markets, as well as in-play share leadership in more than 20 key countries. While we were early in our launch in psoriatic arthritis, we are encouraged by the uptake in this indication. In the dermatology segment, Skyrizi has already achieved in-play patient share of more than 10% in the U.S.  Internationally, Skyrizi PSA is now approved in 45 countries, with reimbursement expected to increase throughout the year. Importantly, we are also preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in Crohn's disease, which represents another important long-term growth driver with approval decisions anticipated this year.  Turning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $465 million, demonstrating continued strong growth. As anticipated, we have seen an impact on new patient starts following the label update and Rinvoq prescriptions have now stabilized in the U.S., with in-play market share currently 12% in RA. We expect growth in the second line plus RA setting going forward where our field force is now focused on leveraging compelling data from two important Phase III trials. First, SELECT-CHOICE, which demonstrated Rinvoq's superiority versus ORENCIA across key efficacy parameters, including clinical remission in previously treated RA patients. And second, the open-label extension of SELECT-COMPARE which demonstrated that many RA patients with an inadequate response to Humira are able to achieve remission after switching to Rinvoq.  Early feedback suggests this updated Rinvoq RA messaging is resonating very well with healthcare practitioners. Internationally, Rinvoq share continues to ramp in RA with a total market share of approximately 5.5% across key geographies. We are also making excellent progress with Rinvoq's newly launched indications, including atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis.  Managed care access is expected to ramp strongly for each of these indications over the coming months. As we build access, initial prescriptions are covered by our BRIDGE program. which provides free patients or free goods to patients until formulary coverage is established. As a reminder, the volume from our BRIDGE program is not captured in third-party prescription data.  I'll start with atopic dermatitis. We are seeing new patient starts accelerating as we build access. When you include prescriptions from our Bridge program, Rinvoq total in-play AD share is already in the mid-teens. So, we are pleased with the early adoption and repeating prescribers. As an oral option that provides significant skin clearance and itch relief, we believe Rinvoq has a strong differentiated position in this highly underpenetrated AD market. In PSA, we are seeing a nice uptake in Rinvoq's in-play share, especially in the rheum segment, where the severity of joint or skin manifestations of the disease can vary significantly by patients. And importantly, we have also launched Skyrizi in the rheum-PSA segment this quarter, giving us two very compelling therapies to address the wide range of PSA patient types, regardless of how their symptoms present. We have also launched our first indication in the IBD segment, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, where we are seeing a significant long-term opportunity in the second-line plus setting. Nearly 50% of UC patients are currently on or have used TNF therapy, so the addressable patient population is substantial. Given the strong benefit risk in this indication, we believe Rinvoq will be a welcome therapeutic option for UC patients and physicians. Turning now to hematologic oncology. Global revenues were more than $1.6 billion, down 0.6% on an operational basis. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.2 billion, down 7.4%. There are two factors impacting our Imbruvica results. First, we are seeing greater market share erosion in new patient starts than originally anticipated from newer therapy, including other BTK inhibitors, as well as our own Venclexta. Second, we continue to see higher-than-expected COVID suppression on new patient starts in CLL, which as a treat-to-progression therapy, has impacted the total BTK treated patient market. Our guidance assumes a market recovery over the course of this year, but it's too early to determine exactly how this may play out, given the continued impact from recent COVID variant. Despite these dynamics, Imbruvica remains the market-leading therapy for total patients across CLL and several other major blood cancers. Based on the magnitude of clinical data and real-world evidence generated for Imbruvica, showing sustained disease control as well as overall patient survival, we are confident it will continue to be a meaningful product for AbbVie over the long term. Venclexta, however, is helping to offset some of the headwinds facing Imbruvica. Global sales were $473 million, up 21.1% on an operational basis. In the US, Venclexta's the clear market share leader in frontline AML, among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy and recently achieved leading new patient share in second line plus PLL. We are also seeing robust momentum internationally, with strong performance across all approved indications. Additionally, we continue to make excellent progress building out our hem/onc portfolio, with several compelling late-stage assets, such as epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, Navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-383 for multiple myeloma, expected support -- expected to support sustainable long-term growth. Turning now to neuroscience, where revenues were approximately $1.5 billion, up more than 20% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth from Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and Ubrelvy. Ubrelvy is performing very well and continues to be the market-leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine, with sequential demand growth observed. Qulipta is also demonstrating exceptional uptake in migraine prevention, with recent total prescriptions performing ahead of comparable branded launches. Qulipta is now capturing nearly 25% on of the new-to-brand share in the US preventative CGRP class when we consider both paid and bridge volume. We expect commercial access to continue to ramp strongly over the remainder of the year. Qulipta has also recently demonstrated positive results from a registration-enabling study for the preventative treatment of chronic migraine, which we plan to submit to the agency for potential expanded use in the US as well as to support regulatory applications across the international market. This indication, if approved, will provided added differentiation for Qulipta as the only oral CGRP therapy for the preventative treatment of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our other notable therapeutic, eye care revenues of $771 million were down 2.8% on an operational basis with recent generic competition for Restasis unfavorably impacting our results. Mavyret sales were $380 million, down 4.6% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes remain depressed compared to pre-COVID levels. So, overall, I'm extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on-track to deliver strong revenue growth once again in 2022. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for additional comments on our R&D program. Tom?
Tom Hudson: Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology. We recently received FDA approval for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, a disease where there continues to be a significant unmet need for therapies that can provide high response rates and durable remission. In our UC development program, Rinvoq demonstrated some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in Phase 3 studies. Importantly, Rinvoq also provided durable responses sustained through one year of treatment. Given the strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients. Our regulatory applications for Rinvoq in UC remain under review in Europe and Japan, with approval decisions expected in the second half of this year. Also in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we recently reported positive topline results from the second Phase 3 induction study for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the first induction trial, in this induction study, Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission and endoscopic response. We expect to see results from the Phase 3 maintenance study later in the quarter with our regulatory submissions for Rinvoq and Crohn's disease expected in the third quarter and approval decisions anticipated in 2023. Rounding out Rinvoq's development programs in rheumatology, we also have regulatory applications under review in ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision in the second quarter for AS and decisions in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. Moving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced an update regarding our regulatory application for Crohn's disease in the US. Following an FDA request for additional information, primarily related to the on-body injection device used for maintenance dosing, we provided additional data for the device from an ongoing real-life use study, which showed that patients can safely and effectively use the on-body device to self-administer Skyrizi. After responding to the agency's request, we received a 3-month extension of our Skyrizi submission in Crohn's disease. We remain confident in a strong benefit risk profile for Skyrizi in Crohn's disease and we now expect a decision in June. Moving now to our Oncology Portfolio, where we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. We recently announced positive top line results from the first expansion cohort of the Phase II study, evaluating epcoritamab in patients with aggressive B-cell lymphoma who have received at least two prior lines of therapy.  Epcoritamab performed extremely well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated and high-risk patients, demonstrating an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. These results are particularly encouraging, given that nearly 40% of patients had failed CAR-T therapy. We plan to discuss these results with regulatory agencies about the potential to support submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We continue to make good progress with the indication expansion programs for Venclexta and remain on-track to see results from the Phase III CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation in the second half of this year. In our Venclexta MDS program, based on feedback from the FDA, we have recently modified our regulatory strategy and now intend to submit data from our ongoing Phase III program. Venclexta remains under Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MDS and we continue to have a high degree of enthusiasm for Venclexta in this indication. We expect data readout from the Phase III study and our regulatory submission for MDS in 2024. In Neuroscience, the FDA recently accepted our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar will be an important new therapy in this patient population, and we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to patients suffering from major depressive disorders.  In the area of migraine, we recently reported positive topline results from a Phase III study evaluating Qulipta for the prevention of chronic migraine. Qulipta performed very well in this study with both doses meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints, demonstrating Qulipta's ability to significantly reduce migraine days for patients suffering from chronic migraine.  This summer, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA for Qulipta in chronic migraine and also plan to submit data from our Phase III studies in both chronic migraine and episodic migraine to support regulatory applications in markets outside the US. In our cystic fibrosis program, we recently completed an interim analysis of a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results – the efficacy results from this interim analysis did not meet our prespecified criteria for advancing this triple therapy in development. This study was designed with a 28-day run-in treatment period, with a dual combination therapy containing our C1 corrector and potentiator, followed by a 28-day treatment period, with a triple combination, which included the addition of our C2 corrector, ABBV-119. This allowed us to independently assess the therapeutic potential of our C2 corrector. The results showed that the addition of 119 did not provide a meaningful improvement in FEV1 or reduction in sweat chloride concentration over our dual combination therapy. During the run-in treatment period, we were able to again assess the efficacy of our dual therapy, which performed well, providing efficacy consistent with results for the existing dual accommodation therapy. So based on the performance of our dual therapy, we plan to continue our CF program. We have an additional C2 corrector, ABBV-576 in Phase 1 studies that we plan to advance into a new triple therapy with our existing C1 corrector and potentiator. 576 is structurally distinct from our previous C2 corrector 119 and has a better PK profile and provides higher drug exposure, which has the potential to deliver better efficacy. Our plan is to begin a Phase 2 study for this new triple combo by early next year. And in Aesthetics, we recently began the Phase 3 program for our short-acting toxin in Glabellar Lines. This novel toxin is designed to provide rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect, which would lower the barrier for adoption for certain segment of consumers. We expect to see data from this program next year with regulatory applications also anticipated in 2023. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year, and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2022. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Tom. AbbVie's first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio, including double-digit growth from Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta, Neuroscience and Aesthetics. We also continue to deliver strong P&L performance, with another quarter of robust operating margin expansion, while fully funding the business for long-term growth. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.16, reflecting growth of 9.3% compared to prior year and $0.04 above our guidance midpoint. This includes an $0.08 unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense that was not factored into our original guidance. Total net revenues were more than $13.5 billion, up 5.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Net revenues came in above our guidance despite the entry of generic competition for Restasis. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.4% of sales, an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 10.9% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.1% of sales. Net interest expense was $539 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.1%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to include the $0.08 for acquired IPR&D expense that was incurred during the first quarter. As a result, we now expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $13.92 and $14.12. This earnings per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $59.4 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.4% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue guidance includes updated Restasis sales of approximately $400 million. Moving to the P&L, we now expect adjusted gross margin of 84.5% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of $12.5 billion, and an adjusted operating margin ratio of 51.8% of sales. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.38 and $3.42. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across multiple areas. We are making significant progress with new product launches and the pipeline, underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we'll take the first question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Your line is open
Mohit Bansal: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And maybe to begin with on Imbruvica. So, I mean, the script trends are down, and you mentioned that we are -- for new starts, you are losing some share to the competition. When you think -- can you please characterize how much share you are losing? And do you think it will stabilize over time? And when you look at Imbruvica and Venclexta combined, do you think the franchise can grow going forward from here? Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you for the question. So, as I mentioned in my comments, we are seeing greater share erosion. Imbruvica continues to be the leading share in the later lines, although we have lost our frontline share position to Calquence. And obviously, Venclexta is also moving there. So we see a couple of things that are taking place. So, we have that share erosion that's putting some pressure on the brand. And then clearly, we see the continued suppression of the market. So, it's kind of like a double hit. If we think of this over the short, mid and longer-term, what I would say would be this. So, in the short-term, meaning this year, we projected the share decline and that includes some stabilization, but we still think the brand is under some pressure from other BTKs and Venclexta. And basically, we have flat guidance this year. And some of that includes a recovery of the market back to sort of more normal levels and we'll have to see how that progresses over the year. If I think more about the midterm, I think what's important context there is, new patient starts essentially make up roughly 13% to 15% of Imbruvica. So it's got a very, very large installed base, about 85%, maybe a little bit more in terms of what that's going to happen. We're not seeing any changes in persistency or items like that. So we think that we have a very good sense of stability for the brand over time in terms of what this may mean. And so that's basically how we think about it. To answer your other question, if you look at the combined share, AbbVie has quite a strong position. We have roughly 33% of total share in the front line and we have between 42% and 46% of second-line plus. So clearly, Venclexta is able to offset as I commented in my remarks some of those pressures. So it's very important for AbbVie. It's going to be a very big brand over the long-term. In the short-term here in midterm, the growth is going to be more challenged moving forward.
Mohit Bansal: Thank you. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Terence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, obviously, you guys have been speaking with payers about the Humira positioning for 2023. Are you willing to give us any update in terms of how you're thinking about that guidance figure that you put out a couple of years ago? Any change in thinking there? And then are you able to disclose the CR rate for the recent epcoritamab Phase II trial? Just wondering how that factors into the decision about whether to seek accelerated approval here? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: So Terence, this is Rick. I'll take the first question for you. And I'm probably going to answer a little broader because I think it is important. I understand the interest in trying to understand how to model 2023, it's obviously important to us to model 2023 as accurately as possible. And I think if you step back, obviously, contracting is one portion of a variable that will impact the speed at which biosimilars are able to adopt – be adopted in the market.  If you step back and look, there's probably four key variables that will impact, what that adoption rate looks like. One of them is obviously, what will Humira's access be post biosimilars entering the marketplace? And this is the period where you would normally be doing the contracting around that. I think we'll do well in being able to be co-positioned versus biosimilars in the vast majority of covered lives here in the United States. But that process isn't done, and we're not in a position to be able to ultimately, give you any further update until we're a little further along in that process.  The second variable that will impact what 2023 looks like is, how will the biosimilars price? We don't know that. Obviously, we have seen how they price in markets outside the U.S., but there's no market exactly like the U.S. internationally. And so that's a variable. We're making some projections of what we believe that pricing will look like. But that's ultimately something we're going to have to see how it plays out.  I'd say the third variable is, how competitive will these biosimilars be? It's going to be by the summer of 2023, there's going to be a lot of biosimilars in the U.S. market, but they're not all the same. And how competitive will they be against what is Humira today? And what are the bulk of patients use as it relates to Humira. And what I mean by that is interchangeability and a number of other factors are going to play into the competitiveness of those biosimilars. And I'd say the fourth variable, and it's not something that people think about that much, and that is the ability of a biosimilar to be able to supply the U.S. market. There's no market like the United States for Humira anywhere around the world. In the United States, it's significantly larger than any other market around the world. There are certainly biosimilar players that are like an AbbVie, and I would expect them to have manufacturing capacity. There are generic players that could have sufficient manufacturing capacity, and then there are very small companies. But I think anybody -- any payer that's going to want to convert in any significant way to a biosimilar, they're going to want confidence that they can have a reliability of supply of that biosimilar and we've spent years building the network that we have. We have full redundancy of every aspect of the manufacturing process on Humira. And we've never had a problem supplying the U.S. market. So, I think we can be viewed as kind of the gold standard. So, those are the variables that are going to impact what this transition looks like. The guidance we've given so far is this 45%, plus or minus 10%. I think at this point, that's still the best information that we can provide. Later this year, I think some of these variables will be clearer to it. And we may be in a position to be able to provide some more information to investors, and we would do that. Some will not. Pricing will not be clear at that point. We're not going to know how they're going to price until we actually get into -- they actually get into the marketplace. So, I think that's the way to think about these variables. Rob, anything you'd add?
Rob Michael: Yes. So, this is Rob. I would just add that we've been trying to give investors some directional guidance on how to think about 2023 beyond just the Humira, 45% plus or minus 10%. We've talked about Aesthetics growing high single digits annually over the next decade. You can get a sense based on Jeff's response today and the way to think about Imbruvica. In terms of operating margin, I've talked about that pulling back to the 46% to 47% range with no cuts to investment because we're going to return to growth very quickly. So, we're going to continue to invest in this business. And as I look at Street consensus, I see modeling of cuts in SG&A not necessarily reflecting the appropriate operating margin levels. So, it's something just to keep in mind. And then even -- we've talked about the tax rate growing one point per year on average. Obviously, you saw this year, it only grew 0.2 points. Other years, it may go higher. So, we've tried to give the Street some ideas of the way to think about 2023 model in advance of our formal guidance.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Number two, Neil?
Neil Gallagher: Hi, this is Neil Gallagher. I'll take the question regarding epcoritamab. So, we recently reported data from the expansion cohort of relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients. We reported an overall response rate of 63% with a median duration of response of 12 months. One thing that's really important to bear in mind is that this is a pretty refractory patient population with a median number of prior therapies of 3.5 in a range up to 11 in at the upper end. And importantly, just under 40% of these patients have failed prior therapy with the CAR-T. Overall, the safety profile remains manageable with the vast majority of the cases of CRS at class effect with these agents being Grade 1 and 2. To directly address your question, we are not yet ready to reveal additional detail about the data. They will be revealed at a forthcoming medical meeting. And in fact, I was just in contact with the team yesterday and I know that they're working very diligently to get those data on a podium in a meeting in the very near future.
Liz Shea: Thank you. Terrence. Operator we’ll take the next please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Q – UnidentifiedAnalyst: Hello, thanks for taking our question. This is Alice Nicholson [ph] on for Tim Anderson. A question on Rinvoq. Where could in-play market share in atopic eventually get in your view? And are you seeing any switching away from Dupixent at all? Thank you. 
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you for the question. I'll give you some context. I mentioned that we see roughly in the mid-teens now after about three months, which we're very pleased in and some more flavor on that. If you think about the HCPs and the doctors that prescribe in the US now, you've got about 9, 000. Those are the dermatologists and some allergists. There's about 3,000 of those physicians that are the big prescribers. They're very productive. Those 3,000 are the ones that are driving Skyrizi, for example, or other big brands in psoriasis.  So we see, after just about three months, we see almost 1,000 doctors that have prescribed Rinvoq. And so that's driving that 15%. Some of it depends in terms of where the in-play share ends up, how many of the competitors come in. We're not really sure that baricitinib will come into the market. We'll have to see. We haven't seen much Pfizer activity yet. To give you some sort of international perspective in the Canadian market, we're seeing where there's really just Dupi and Rinvoq at this point after a couple of quarters, we're seeing a 30% in-play share in Canada.  So we are, as I mentioned, very, very encouraged with the early adoption. In particular, my comment around, how fast once you see the first prescription take place with some of those productive doctors, how fast they go to the second or third. To give you some flavor of what we see in the US, and again, the data is early, we see, as expected, the majority of our use so far in that dynamic market are not switches necessarily. We see about, let's say, 1/3, believe it or not, that are not even exposed to Dupi. And the doctors are saying, look, I've already given another oral systemic, for example, but the itch and the skin is so severe that they're going to go -- I'm going to go right and get the relief with Rinvoq.  And then maybe the other two-third, you see Dupi partial responders, particularly related to the itch, just isn't suppressed as much, and they still have some skin involvement. Or there is, as we've highlighted before, a warehouse of Dupi non-responders that has been built up over the last four years. So that's the behavior that we see. Again, I'm very encouraged on the early results, not just in the US but around the world. Rinvoq is going to be a real player in this underserved market.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Alice. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Your line is open. 
Q – Steve Scala: Thank you. Two questions. First on epcoritamab, the data looks great. Could this molecule immediately start taking share from CAR-T, or do you think physicians will want to see durability data before selecting a bispecific ahead of a cell therapy? So that's the first question. The second question is, I'm trying to sift through the answer to the Humira question just a moment ago. On the one hand, it seems we need to consider that Humira could be more resilient in 2023 than expected. On the other hand, the Street needs to raise spending assumptions. So, would you object to either of those conclusions based on what was stated? Thank you.
Neil Gallagher: Thanks Steve. This is Neil. I'll take the first question on epcoritamab. The fact that we saw such remarkable activity in a patient population that had failed CAR-T does not imply that the medicine should be positioned after failure of CAR-T. I think they are two very different classes of medicines, as you know. CAR-T has significant challenges with respect to the need for -- to be prior to administration. Whereas the safety profile with epcoritamab is extremely manageable. And again, I don't want to repeat what I said earlier on around CRS. So, overall, we see a very strong benefit risk profile emerging for the medicine. And therefore, our intention is to move the medicine into earlier lines of therapy initially gain an approval with respect to -- gain approval in refractory DLBCL and after that move the medicine into earlier lines of therapy.
Rick Gonzalez: Steve, this is Rick. I think Rob and I will handle the second question for you. Yes, look, I think it's a great question, and we've gotten that question a lot. What's the erosion going to be in 2023? And is it going to be lighter in 2023 and therefore, spill more into 2024. And I think that's a reasonable question to start to think through. I'd say as I step back and look at it, I would tell you this. Look, at the end of the day, it could be lighter in 2023. That would force more of it out into 2024. If I look at the business, that's a good thing. We give us higher cash flows in 2023 than what we would be projecting now. Ultimately, I think there will be a settling out between 2023 and 2024. We'll still get to the levels that we have described or at least that we are modeling. And I think the important thing is, look, Humira is going to play out over these two-year period of time. What's important to AbbVie, though, is what's that underlying growth that's driving the business and is going to sustain the growth on the other side of the LOE. That's the critical aspect of it. The Skyrizi, the Rinvoqs, our Neuroscience pipeline, Aesthetics, it's all of those major growth drivers that we have because that growth is going to be suppressed in 2023 and somewhat maybe in 2024. But as soon as that pressure is off, that's when it reemerge and be able to deliver growth on the other side of it. And so what we're focused on is, obviously, we're going to try to manage the 2023-2024 dynamic to the extent that we're able to. But that's not the most critical part for the business. The most critical part is driving these growth brands and delivering on the pipeline.
Rob Michael: This is Rob. What I would add, Steve, just to clarify, I mean, we have a business that's going to deliver high single-digit growth during 2025. It doesn't make sense to be cutting investment in 2023. And that's what the Street consensus is modeling currently. So, we expect to invest in this business, invest in R&D, invest in SG&A to drive that long-term growth. And given how quickly we'll return to that growth, I wouldn't expect us to be cutting investment in 2023.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks Steve. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open.
Andrew Baum: Thank you. Question for Jeff. Perhaps you could comment on the impact of IL-31 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis where we're expecting additional Phase 2 data, which obviously don't have the JAK labeling associated with how you think it's going to impact the market in terms of delaying the onset of JAK therapy? And then second for Neil, could you talk to how large the commercial potential for Venclexta in t(11;14) myeloma, which is due to reported Phase III this year anytime?
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So important question. So the way that we see the market for the other ILs, I do think that there will be a segment of conservative dermatologists that will attempt to sequence. And I think that largely that they'll be disappointed because it seems the newer agents are very, very difficult to distinguish from Dupixent. I think certainly, there could be market access dynamics that start to appear with subsequent ILs, I think that's something that we will watch and you would want to watch.  I think what's, again, maybe not appreciated as we watch the early quarters of performance in Europe and the first quarter of performance here in the US, is that there's significant amount of early adopters and dermatologists that will go right to a JAK inhibitor, as I mentioned. They're not always sequencing through Dupi. And it's because the severity of some of these patients and the level of the clinical involvement is very, very significant.  And so, we do see what you would call a significant amount of naive use based on the profile of the JAK inhibitor. Now these are early adopters. These are people that have already contemplated the risk benefit and I think that's important. And so, the way that we see the market developing is that, when physicians would start with Dupi, which will be in a significant proportion of patients, it's not clear at all that their next step will be another IL that has been approved or will be approved.  In fact, we think it's more likely that they will move towards the best JAK that can get to these high levels of skin clearance, the EZ 90 plus almost no perceived itch. And I think that's the endpoint that this market is going to move towards and Rinvoq is the drug that clearly can deliver on that promise. And so that's how we see the market developing, and that's why we remain encouraged on the early results around the world from what we're seeing with the agent.
Neil Gallagher: This is Neil. With respect to the question on Venclexta, venetoclax CANOVA. So the CANOVA study is a study of venetoclax in multiple myeloma patients with a particular translocation, t(11;14). We're making extremely good progress with the study, and we fully anticipate having a Phase III data from the study during the course of 2022. We know from this particular patient population that were included in earlier studies with Venclexta that they are explicitly sensitive to treatment with the medicines in various combinations. The prevalence of this population is around 20% of multiple myeloma and multiple myeloma, as you know, is the common of [indiscernible] malignancy. So, this is a very significant proportion of the multiple myeloma population that could gain benefit from Venclexta. And as mentioned, we're looking forward to being able to communicate the Phase III data during the course of 2022. Thanks for the question.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Andrew. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open. 
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks very much for the question. First one for me is just can you elaborate a bit more on Rinvoq coverage, both in AD and UC. I guess just trying to get a sense of where we are today and what's the outlook for the next few quarters? And maybe as part of that, it seems like you're seeing some nice uptake in your BRIDGE programs. Can you just comment when you expect we should start to think about those translating over to third-party Rxs and that would be maybe more visible to the outside world in terms of how that uptick you're seeing? And then my second question was just on Q1 itself. Were there any notable either payer adjustments or gross to net issues? I guess Humira, for example, it seems like the low single-digit growth was a departure from recent trends. I'm just trying understand a little bit better what happened in the quarter. Is there anything we should just be kind of keeping in mind as we consider the Q1 results? Thanks.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you, Chris. It's Jeff. So, with your first question is -- we're very confident that we are going to get to high levels of paid access for Rinvoq and Skyrizi's new indications. So, typically, what we'll see based on the approval timeline, we'll be ramping up into the -- by the middle of the year up in the high 90s in terms of our access -- for commercial access. So, I think that everyone should be confident that, that's where you're going to start to see this bridge program start to fully convert as the months go by into the paid prescription. So, typically, that's the timing we're looking at. You're going to see very strong momentum on paid access by -- towards the end of next quarter is what we've guided towards. So, that's the answer to your first question. I think if you think about -- and maybe just to frame the Humira question. The Humira fundamentals are -- and the market fundamentals are quite strong. You see the markets are performing nicely. Our market share growth trends, we haven't seen any trend shift. They've been largely stable. There's some sequential decline based on the size of the market and actually our own brand, Skyrizi and Rinvoq that are playing very strongly into these markets. What I would say is that, in some cases, Q1 can be quite unique over the years. You've got the issue with the plans resetting their deductibles, you've got issues with doctors that have to put in another prior authorization for the year. And so you do see some co-pay and sort of deductible dynamic. But we think that's really a first quarter type of event, and it's largely been very consistent with what we expected. So, maybe I don't know, Rob, if you want to build on that a little bit.
Rob Michael: Yes, I would just add that if you look back to our guidance for the quarter and we gave guidance to the therapeutic area level, we pretty much came in line with that guidance. And so we expected this dynamic, and we're also we're not changing our full year outlook for US Humira, 8% growth. And that, again, will be driven by market driving volume growth. And so -- it's in line with our expectations. I understand Street consensus had a different point of view, but we weren't surprised by that.
Liz Shea: Thanks Chris. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chris Shibutani: Thank you. Good morning. If I could ask on Vraylar, the product, I think you comment expectations for an MDD approval and yet they'll frame it as potential for upside. Can you help us understand perhaps some of the potential there? Just thinking back to some of the scale of the peak sales opportunity that, that drug was characterized previously, MDD certainly seems as if it's a potential significant opportunity. Thanks.
Jeff Stewart: Yes, Thank you for the question. And it is a significant opportunity. So, as we highlighted and Tom highlighted, the NDA has been accepted, and we're confident in the approval. I think what we said in the past is that just with the base indication. So, before we get that approval, I mean, the FDA has to still approve it towards the end of the year. We believe that we can ramp towards a $4 billion opportunity. So, that would mean our share just in the base indications of a unique profile with the mania, the mix manian depression, the bipolar depression, we moved somewhere up sort of doubling our share penetration. So right now, we're at about 2.7% TRx share. So we we'd really get close to doubling that based on the momentum.  And then MDD would build on top of that. And so it's significant. I mean, the physicians that we've talked to when we show them the profile are very pleased. First, they know Vraylar, they like Vraylar, they like the strong efficacy, they highlight nonsedating, they highlight at least verbally a brightening effect of the agent, minimal weight gain, metabolic effects. And so as they think about that, how that would translate to adjunctive MDD, they like that profile. The other piece that we hear is they like the starting dose. They like that starting dose of the 1.5 milligram dose, which is what we believe that ultimately will be approved. We'll have to see. So easy to start, easy to take, well tolerated. And so to your point, we believe that MDD will offer some upside and acceleration to the brand's momentum when we achieve it.
A – Liz Shea: Thanks Chris. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. 
Vamil Divan: Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. So just maybe get back to some of what we were just talking about around the pricing in 1Q. But I had a couple of questions regarding the migraine franchise. So, the Ubrelvy scripts from a legacy publicly out third-party data, it looks like the gross to net – some net pricing is back to where we were in 1Q '21. And just trying to understand if this is just a seasonality of things or 4Q to 1Q dynamic or maybe there might be something broader where net pricing for these products is going down.  And then tied to that, with Qulipta, as you mentioned, look, the prescription numbers are pretty good as it builds up here. I'm curious now that you have sort of two products in that market, does that impact how you're thinking about the opportunity, especially from a pricing side or sort of payer negotiation side? Is there any thoughts on sort of bundling the two other in any way to present to get even better active than what you have right now? So, any thoughts you could share there would be helpful as well? Thank you.
Rob Michael: So Vamil, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So when you look at that there is seasonality in this market in the US, and so you do see a shift from Q4 to Q1. If you look at year-over-year, you'd see that in Q4, as you mentioned, Q1 year-over-year is relatively flat. I would think about it that way for the full year as well. So, you do tend to see a suppression in Q1 because of plans resetting that dynamic we see in the US market. But then over the course of the rest of the year, you do see higher pricing. So, on average, the way to think about it is price is relatively stable.
Jeff Stewart: And Vamil, it's Jeff now. So I think -- look, we are pleased with the Ubrelvy momentum. I mean, actually, since we launched Qulipta, Ubrelvy has accelerated. So, we have to -- because we can't see the competitor because you can see the whole thing. But when we factor Nurtec by 8 versus 16, and we try to understand the acute dynamic, we can see that we're clearly the market-leading acute CGRP and that's nice to see. The physicians really like Ubrelvy, the markets are robust. I think what you're seeing is what Rob highlighted in terms of the overall performance. I didn't really fully appreciate your second question in terms of the access. I can give you a broad overview. Obviously, we're seeing great momentum with the brand. Much of the brand is still because the access is ramping is still bridged, just like we discussed there with the immunology agent.  So we think, again, by the middle of the year, we're going to see commercial access really start to ramp, and you'll see the conversion start to take place. What's nice is that we're confident in that. We think that our price points and net price or negotiations are going well. And because of its unique profile, as an agent, basically, the strength of the drug is really significant in terms of its performance against episodic migraine. We feel like we're in good shape. And we're going to build on top of that basically 25% in-play share, which is right now at the top of the league table. So, that's how we see it. We're confident in the access ramp.
Vamil Divan: Maybe just to clarify the second question then just -- thank you for all that. Is there any advantage of another strategy you might have now because you have two approved migraine oral therapies, or is it pretty much similar it would be if you had one or the other?
Jeff Stewart: Yes. It's pretty similar based on the way that the pricing and the different dynamics work on the other CGRP. It's not -- it's just sort of a straight -- it's a straight play on the access there.
Vamil Divan: Okay. Thank you so much.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Vamil. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Geoff Meacham: Hey guys. Morning. Thanks for the question. I just had another one on the INI landscape. Rick, when you look at the market disruption that you'll see in 2023 and 2024, presumably, that's going to have an indirect effect on Skyrizi and Rinvoq when you think pricing and share. What would you guys view as a win over this period from a new start or switch perspective or a growth perspective is the first question. And the second part of it is, what gives you guys confidence in the market really normalizing after a 2024 period? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: I think as we look at our long-range plan, we don't see or anticipate a dramatic impact. We've provided that 2025 guidance and I think it's reflective of significant growth of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. If you look at those assets and you look at their clinical performance, they really stand out. And that's what's driving the kind of volume and growth that we're seeing. And I think you will see obvious price disruption in the Humira market from biosimilars. But I don't anticipate that you're going to see that bleed over in a significant way to those other assets. Jeff, do you see any differently?
Jeff Stewart: Yes, I don't see, Geoff, much difference. I mean if you think of it in some ways, even on -- let's take Rinvoq, for example. I mean, you could say, wow, in prior viewpoints, maybe everyone will step behind a biosimilar at some point in the future. Well, one, we didn't think that, that would happen wide scale as the market develops anyway. But even if it did, our label is already behind a TNF. And so when you look at the level of efficacy that Rinvoq's bringing in those later lines, I mean it's -- we're really quite insulated from that, I would put forth. And second Skyrizi is just -- is a phenomenal asset. I mean the level of performance and what it's doing to transform certainly psoriasis today, PSA right now and what we think will happen with Crohn's and ultimately, IBD, when you look at the level of healing and sort of restating that standard of care, we think the assets themselves are quite well positioned for the middle part of the decade, and that sort of goes to the elements of the planning that Rick talked about.
Liz Shea: Thanks Geoff. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Gary Nachman: Hi thanks. First, just following on that last response. Can you talk more broadly about how you see the expansion of Rinvoq and Skyrizi into the IBD indication? So how is the initial launch for Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis going? I know it's early days, but what's the outlook there given physician receptivity around the product? Are physicians saying they're excited to have Rinvoq for Crohn's as well? And also, how do you see Skyrizi fitting in with Crohn's versus Rinvoq? And then secondly, on Aesthetics, it was strong in the first quarter, but did you see any impact in the early part of 1Q from Omicron? And what have the trends been more recently in March and April in the Aesthetics business?
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thank you for the question. It's Jeff again. So we are very, very encouraged by the IBD momentum that we can build. And we're right on the cusp of it. And to give some sense is basically this market -- the market of Crohn's and you see that – it actually has fairly high biologic penetration.  When we do our research and our engagement with the physicians, what they typically have done for more than a decade since the availability of Remicade and then Humira, they really hang on as much as possible to their first-line use. They try to intensify, they do all sorts of things because it's quite scary for the physicians and the patients because no one set a different standard of care. So when you start to look at the healing rates that we start to see with Rinvoq in UC, the healing of the bowel, the remission rate, the combination of what we can see, this market looks very, very good to have both of those assets come in with higher standards of care. So we're very, very encouraged and we think that the IBD market is probably underappreciated in terms of what that looks like. And the patients are so challenged with their disease because it's quite severe with the bowel preparations, the hospitalizations, all of these things, having two assets is a great thing to bring to the market. Certainly, in the US, it's likely we see that with UC today that you're going to have later line use based on the labeling.  Skyrizi is not going to have that limitation. So, you can imagine that you have an ability to co-position to sequence appropriately to think about how you bring that whole portfolio around the world and that's how we see it. We're quite encouraged that we would have both Rinvoq for Crohn's and Rinvoq for Skyrizi in the market. And it's kind of very similar to my comments I made on what's happening with PSA today in rheumatology, where both of those assets Rinvoq for PSA and Skyrizi PSA are in the market together working as a portfolio. To get to your first point, it's been only a month or so with our UC launch, but the physicians, gastros are very encouraged with the profile. They've not seen the level of remission or the level of healing before in any asset. So, there's quite a wow reaction to the efficacy profile. They realize that they have to think about, I've got to think through my patients that are not doing well on TNF or have cycled through a TNF and are struggling. And I mentioned that's a pretty large addressable population. It's at least 50% of the market today. So early qualitative results are quite strong. And the BRIDGE results are also quite strong. So, we're pleased with the gastro launches thus far.
Rick Gonzalez: Carrie?
Carrie Strom: Gary, this is Carrie Strom, President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, and I'll take your question about the aesthetics market. And in Q1, we did see US toxin and filler markets, both growing in the mid-20s percent. And we expect that sort of growth to continue for the rest of 2022.  And the way to think about it is similar amount of absolute volume growth as 2021, but of course, off of a larger base. And in terms of what's driving that market growth, we're seeing very strong demand trends supported by our increased commercial investments, for example, increased consumer activation for acquisition and retention, field force expansions in key markets. And we see these trends also supported just by fundamentals and aesthetics that will continue in the long-term. People think about aesthetics more like health and wellness. It's been much more destigmatized, and we see factors like social media and word of mouth continuing to drive aesthetics in the future. Your question around the pandemic, I would say that we are seeing an impact right now in China, and we anticipate that this recent surge of COVID cases in China which has resulted in lockdowns across several major cities, has reduced patient traffic into aesthetic offices in China. And China is a top market for aesthetics. So, we expect this to impact our near-term international performance for both toxins and fillers. I should also mention that Russia is a key market for fillers globally. And as the tragic events in the Ukraine have unfolded, we have suspended operations for our Aesthetics business in Russia. So, although absolute aesthetic sales in Russia are modest, like I said, Russia is among one of the largest filler markets in the world. So, we expect to see an impact on our filler performance in coming quarters. But despite these dynamics, we do not need to change our total guidance for Aesthetics. So, we see our continued robust toxin performance in the US to offset this anticipated transitory impact in both China and Russia.
Gary Nachman: Great. Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks Gary. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Robyn Karnauskas: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So, for epcoritamab, I just have a question on approval. Given the recent FDA discussion around the PI3 kinase class and sort of hinting that they want controlled data for accelerated approval, how do you view that in light of that panel, the likelihood of accelerated approval? And then second. Just a little bit more questions around the Bridge program. I think you said that you're going to expect more payment reimbursement coming online in the middle of the year. Just talk to me how long people stay in the Bridge program and how you expect that Bridge program to continue? And what -- how many people might continue to use it after payers and online? Thanks.
Neil Gallagher: Hey Robyn, it's Neil, I'll start off with the question around epcoritamab, but maybe just a comment -- a general comment on accelerated approval overall. I think as we're all aware, it prompted your question that the agencies in the course of -- in the process of updating its guidance with respect to accelerated approval. We haven't seen the totality of that guidance, but we anticipate hearing more from them during the course of 2022. As I alluded to, and I'm not going to repeat what I said earlier on about the epco data, but we are extremely pleased with how the molecule is performing, and it is our intent to engage with the agency based on the data that we've toplined recently. It is our intent to engage with the agency in a conversation to explore a path to accelerated approval. And likewise, with some of our other programs, we recently got a BTD designation for Teliso-V, for example, earlier this year with a 54% response rate in c-Met high non-small-cell lung cancer. Again, it is our intent when we have data that are these strong to continue to engage with the agency on those programs to explore potential costs to accelerated approval. So thanks for the question.
Jeff Stewart: Okay. It's Jeff. Just to comment on your BRIDGE question. Thank you for that. So the BRIDGE transition will be very efficient. So, what I mean by that is because of the connections that we have with the payers and our specialty pharmacy network, we're able to – once access is achieved rapidly and appropriately transition patients from the BRIDGE to basically their paid pharmacy in their prescription.  So, there's not going to be lingering bridge effects, particularly in the immunology space. So, once it starts to move and that access ramps, the BRIDGE transition is quite fast. And that can be within weeks or a month. And we know that that's the case because we have the model from our earlier launches from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So ultimately, once you start to achieve those high levels of access, BRIDGE programs drop very, very fast, and the vast majority, the very vast majority is paid prescriptions. So it's very efficient, and I hope that helps.
Liz Shea: Thanks Robyn. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. 
Josh Schimmer: Thanks for putting me in and congrats to both Mike and Tom. For Skyrizi, did your long-term outlook improve again, or am I misunderstanding the contingent consideration line item? Thanks so much.
Rob Michael: So Josh, it's Rob. If you look at the continued consideration, actually, it's a fair value liability, it went down this quarter because of discount rate. So we always have to pay attention to discount rate movement. So we saw the average discount rate increase by about 130 basis points. You're seeing, obviously, as rising interest rates are taking hold of the market. That's something we have to take into account because we had to mark this to market every quarter.  If you look at our release, we had a similar – we had a decrease last year as well. Again, we had discount rates increase in Q1 of last year, albeit to a lesser extent. So that's what you're seeing is just really the discount rate movement. No other real fundamental changes to the valuation of that liability.
Josh Schimmer: Got it. Thanks for clarifying.
Liz Shea: Well, thank you, Josh. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-02 09:00:00) =====
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman, Finance and Commercial Operations and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer, and Corporate Secretary.  Before we get started, some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today’s conference call non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for Allergan. For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast to conform to AbbVie’s revenue recognition accounting policies, and exclude the divestitures of Zenpep and Viokace. References to operational growth further exclude the impact of exchange. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll take your questions. So with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I’ll provide perspective on our overall performance and outlook, and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our quarterly business highlights, pipeline progress, financial results and guidance for 2022 in more detail.  Our performances this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie with results well above our initial expectations. We delivered full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.70, representing growth of more than 20% versus the prior year. Full-year adjusted net revenues were more than $56 billion, up 10.5% on a comparable operational basis. These results demonstrate balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, aesthetics, and neuroscience. I’m extremely pleased with our momentum, and we’ve entered this year in a strong position, which is reflected in our guidance. We anticipate 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $14 to $14.20, representing growth of 11% at the midpoint. Longer-term, we remain well positioned with an impressive set of diversified growth assets. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are already contributing meaningful revenue, including $4.6 billion in combined sales last year with substantial growth anticipated in 2022 and beyond. Over the next few months, we expect to add several new indications to the list of approved uses for these two assets, at which point, Skyrizi and Rinvoq will be commercialized across all of Humira’s major indications, plus atopic dermatitis. With the strong performance that we’re seeing in their initial indications and the robust data we’ve demonstrated across our broad development programs, we expect combined peak sales for Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed the peak revenues achieved by Humira.  In hematological oncology, we’ve established a leading position with Imbruvica and Venclexta, which were both expected to remain important revenue contributors through the decade. To support our next wave of growth, we also have an exciting and diverse pipeline of promising new therapies to address critical unmet needs in both blood cancers and solid tumors. Notable opportunities from our mid to late stage oncology pipeline include Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, which has the potential to provide disease modification in a market where current treatments only address symptoms. At Epcoritamab, a potentially best-in-class CD3XCD20 for B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL and follicular lymphoma; ABBV-383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific, which has the potential to become a best-in-class treatment in multiple myeloma; and Teliso-V, our promising c-Met ADC being studied for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, which was recently granted breakthrough therapy designation. In neuroscience, we have a portfolio of compelling and differentiated therapies to support robust long-term growth in migraine, Parkinson’s disease and psychiatric conditions. Ubrelvy and Qulipta are both demonstrating strong launch trajectories in migraine, with each treatment expected to contribute more than $1 billion in peak sales. Vraylar continues to have a significant opportunity with currently approved indications with peak sales expected to approach $4 billion. An approval in major depressive disorder represents upside to our current projections. And 951, a potentially transformative improvement to our current treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease with peak sales also anticipated to be more than $1 billion. Our leading aesthetics portfolio represents another extremely attractive growth opportunity. This business is performing well above expectations, delivering full year 2021 sales of more than $5.2 billion, $700 million higher than our initial guidance. AbbVie’s increased promotional investments are driving accelerated category growth, especially in toxins and fillers, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration globally. Dedicated resources are also of focused on delivering new product innovation within aesthetics, with several exciting R&D programs internally, including both short-acting and long-acting toxins, as well as novel fillers with biostimulatory or regenerative features. And we remain active with business development to pursue promising external technologies and complementary opportunities, including the recently closed Soliton acquisition, which further expands our body contouring portfolio. Given this focus and investment, we expect our aesthetics franchise to deliver high single digit revenue growth, through the end of the decade, including sales of more than $9 billion in 2029. Lastly, we’ve developed a robust pipeline, including numerous attractive late-stage programs, novel early stage therapies in a growing range of potential platform technologies, which we expect will collectively contribute to our growth through the decade. With the actions that we’ve taken to diversify our sources of growth, we remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our business. Following the U.S. Humira LOE event in 2023, we expect to quickly return to growth in 2024 and deliver high-single-digit growth from 2025 to the end of the decade. This is a testament to the strength of AbbVie’s broad and balanced portfolio. In summary, this is an exciting time for our Company. We’re demonstrating excellent execution across our portfolio, and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. Looking at our quarterly results, we continue to demonstrate excellent commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I’ll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.7 billion, reflecting growth of 13.3% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were $5.3 billion, up 3.5%, with 6% revenue growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 8.8% on an operational basis. Skyrizi is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $900 million were up 12.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. Skyrizi has now surpassed Humira as the leader for total prescriptions in the U.S. psoriasis biological market, with share of approximately 20%. We are also now leading the market in several international geographies, including Japan. Total in-place share, which includes both new and switching patients, remains very and now, reflects roughly 37% patient share in the U.S. as well as leadership in nearly 20 key countries around the world. Skyrizi is also now approved for its second major indication, to treat adults with active psoriatic arthritis, further enhancing its compelling profile in dermatology. Field promotion is now active globally and early feedback from physicians has been very positive. Given Skyrizi’s demonstrated skin clearance and joint efficacy in our PSA clinical program, with nearly 30% of patients visiting dermatologists, having both, skin and joint involvement, this new approval will sustain Skyrizi’s strong momentum. In addition, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi’s in Crohn’s disease, an indication with very meaningful long-term revenue potential, with regulatory approvals in both, the U.S. and Europe anticipated this year. Rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $500 million were up 14% on a sequential basis. Prescriptions in RA remain strong with a total market share of more than 5.5% in the U.S. and nearly 5% across key international markets. We’re very pleased with the competitive labels for both PSA and atopic dermatitis, where we are making excellent progress with their launches globally. In atopic dermatitis, dermatologists appreciate key elements of Rinvoq’s new label, including the incorporation of stringent skin and itch endpoints, reflective of the performance in our registrational trials, as well as an adolescent indication and dosing flexibility. Managed care access is expected to ramp fairly quickly for both atopic dermatitis and PSA in the U.S. We are also preparing for the launches of Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis and axial SpA with regulatory approvals for both indications anticipated this year as well. Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and progress we’re making with both, Rinvoq and Skyrizi, which are expected to contribute more than $15 billion in combined risk adjusted global sales in 2025. In hematologic oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 4.7% on an operational basis. Venclexta once again, delivered robust growth. Sales were up 34% on an operational basis with strong share performance across all approved indications. Imbruvica global revenues were down 2.7%, reflecting a slower than anticipated market recovery in CLL and increased share pressure from newer therapies. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.6 billion, up 19% on an operational basis, including robust double-digit growth for both, Vraylar and Botox Therapeutic. I’m also very pleased with our performance in migraine, where we have a portfolio of multiple distinct therapies to address the full spectrum of this disease. This includes our two leading oral CGRP therapies. Ubrelvy for acute migraine, which delivered total sales of $183 million, up 13% on a sequential basis, we anticipate robust sales growth again this year based on Ubrelvy’s competitive profile, continued strong new patient starts and a rapidly expanding CGRP segment. And we also have Qulipta, the only oral CGRP treatment specifically developed for the prevention of episodic migraine. The launch is going extremely well. When considering both paid and bridge volume Qulipta is already capturing nearly 20% of the new-to-brand share in the preventative CGRP class. Roughly three months post-launch, this is an incredible accomplishment and it’s a testament to Qulipta’s demonstrated efficacy, including rapid and meaningful reduction in migraine days. We expect commercial access for Qulipta to ramp quickly in the first half of this year. In eye care, revenues of $960 million were up 3.9% on an operational basis, including $364 million in sales from Restasis. Lastly, Mavyret were $427 million, down 10.1% on an operational basis, as treated patient volumes remained suppressed compared to pre-COVID levels. Overall, I’m very pleased with the performance and the momentum across the therapeutic portfolio. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Jeff. We made significant advancement across all stages of our pipeline in 2021, and we expect continued progress again this year. In immunology, we had several recent important regulatory updates. We implemented safety and indication updates to our RA label for Rinvoq, and also received FDA approval in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis to curing strong labels that highlight Rinvoq’s favorable benefit risk profile in both new indications. In atopic dermatitis, we received approval for both the 15 milligram and 30 milligram doses, and based on the impressive levels of skin clearance and itch reduction demonstrated in our development program, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new treatment option for adult and adolescent patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, who have not responded well to other systemic agents, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or biologics. We also have regulatory applications under review for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial SpA. We expect an FDA approval decision next month for ulcerative colitis, in the second quarter for ankylosing spondylitis, and in the fourth quarter for non-radiographic axial SpA. In Europe, we anticipate approval decisions for ulcerative colitis and non-radiographic axial SpA in the second half of the year. We’re nearing completion of Rinvoq’s registrational program in Crohn’s disease, which is the last major indication expansion program for Rinvoq. We recently announced positive top-line results from the first Phase 3 Crohn’s induction study, where Rinvoq demonstrated a very impact on clinical remission and endoscopic response in a difficult-to-treat refractory patient population. We expect to see results from the second Phase 3 Crohn’s induction study and from the maintenance study in the first half of this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2022. Also in immunology, we recently received FDA approval for Skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, an important indication expansion for this asset. Based on the strong joint efficacy and the high level of skin clearance that Skyrizi provided in our registrational trials, we believe Skyrizi will be very competitively positioned as an effective new treatment option for psoriatic arthritis patients. We also have regulatory applications under review for Skyrizi in Crohn’s disease with approval decisions expected in the U.S. next month and in Europe, later this year. We’ve seen impressive results in our Crohn’s disease program, and we believe Skyrizi has the potential to become an important new therapy in this market, where there continues to be considerable unmet need. We’re making very good progress with our early-stage immunology pipeline as well, where we are developing novel agents with the goal of significantly advancing the standard-of-care across our core areas, by providing deeper and more durable responses. Our anti-TNF steroid ADC ABBV-154 is a novel approach for delivering a potent steroid that has the potential to provide durable remission in diseases such as RA, PMR and Crohn’s disease. We expect to see preliminary data from our Phase 2 dose ranging study in RA in the fourth quarter of this year. We also expect to see Phase 2 proof-of-concept data in PMR and Crohn’s disease in 2023. In dermatology, our early-stage efforts are focused on developing oral agents that can provide clear skin with durable responses. Our RoRγT inverse agonist, ABBV-157 is designed to more effectively inhibit IL-17 production compared to pure antagonists, which has the potential to result in a greater impact on skin inflammation. We’ve recently been again a Phase 2 dose ranging study for 157 in psoriasis. Moving to oncology, where we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. We recently received an FDA breakthrough therapy designation for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced or metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer, based on the encouraging results we’ve seen to-date in our clinical program. Treatment options for patients who have exhausted platinum-based chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy are limited to single agent chemo, which typically provides response rates of only 15% to 20%, with a median overall survival of less than one year. Prognosis for these patients is very poor. While targeted therapies have been approved by the FDA for the 3% to 4% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, harboring MET exon 14 skipping mutations, there are currently no therapies approved, specifically for the much larger group of patients, who exhibit c-Met protein overexpression. Patients with overexpressed c-Met represents about 25% to 30% of the advanced or metastatic nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer population with wild-type EGFR, which corresponds to an incidence of approximately 35,000 patients each year in the U.S. In stage 1 of our Phase 2 study, we saw promising efficacy in heavily pretreated patients who received Teliso-V, including a 54% objective response rate in those with highly expressed c-Met. The second stage of the Phase 2 study is ongoing and has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second-line plus advanced metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer. We expect to see additional data from this study next year. We also recently began the clinical program for our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400, which utilizes a more potent topoisomerase inhibitor payload to potentially drive deeper tumor responses in patients with both, intermediate and high levels of c-Met expression. We also expect to see data this year from several important indication expansion programs for Venclexta, including results from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation as well as results from our program for Venclexta in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, where we received a breakthrough therapy designation. We plan to submit our regulatory applications to the FDA in the first half of this year for an accelerated approval in MDS, and late in ‘22 or early ‘23 for multiple myeloma. Both indications represent important expansion opportunities for Venclexta and will help drive long-term growth for our oncology portfolio. We are also making very good progress with epcoritamab, where we continue to generate strong data in early-stage studies to support our view that epcoritamab has the potential to become a differentiated and best-in-class CD3xCD20 bispecific across several B-cell malignancies including diffuse B cell and follicular lymphomas. We’ll see monotherapy data in the third quarter from the Phase 2 expansion cohort in DLBCL, which has the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval in the second half of this year. We also have a Phase 3 study ongoing in third-line relapsed/refractory DLBCL and we plan to initiate several additional Phase 3 trials this year, including studies in earlier lines of therapy for diffuse B-cell lymphoma in multiple combinations, as well as in follicular lymphoma in combination with rituximab and Revlimid. This year, we’ll also see additional data maturing from our cohort expansion studies for ABBV-383, both as a monotherapy and in combination with standard-of-care and novel agents in multiple myeloma. We believe our BCMA-CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and can be best-in-class across multiple lines of therapy. We plan to initiate Phase 3 studies later this year in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We also continue to make good progress with Navitoclax in myelofibrosis, where we’ve seen strong mid-stage data supporting our view that Navitoclax has the potential to provide disease modification, which we believe will lead to improved and durable clinical outcomes for patients. We expect a Phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the first half of next year, with approval anticipated near the end of 2023. Moving to neuroscience, where we expect several important pipeline events in 2022 as well. We recently completed discussions with the FDA and are preparing to submit our application for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Based on the totality of the data and the strong benefit-risk profile demonstrated in our clinical program, we believe Vraylar has the potential to be competitively positioned as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. We expect a submission in the first quarter and an approval decision by the end of the year. We’ve also completed our registration-enabling program for ABBV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for treatment of advanced Parkinson’s disease. In our Phase 3 studies, 951 proved superior to oral levodopa/carbidopa in reducing motor fluctuations in this advanced population, and we believe our innovative new delivery system represents a potentially transformative improvement to current treatment options. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the first half of this year in the U.S. and Europe, with both approval decisions anticipated in early 2023. And we expect to see Phase 3 data for Qulipta in chronic migraine prevention later in the first quarter and plan to submit our regulatory applications in both, the U.S. and Europe this summer, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2023. So, in summary, we remain focused on continuing to execute on our pipeline programs and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones across all stages of our pipeline in 2022. This includes important indication expansion for on-market drugs and data readouts and regulatory actions for key late-stage assets as well as proof-of-concept data from several early-stage NME programs. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2022 financial outlook. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Mike. AbbVie once again delivered outstanding performance while also advancing our strategic priorities. The strong results across our portfolio continue to support AbbVie’s long-term growth outlook. Starting with fourth quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.31, up 13.4% compared to prior year and $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.9 billion, up 7.5% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.3% of sales, an improvement of 240 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.6% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 22.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $571 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.5%. Shifting to 2022, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $14 and $14.20, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $4.74 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $60 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.8% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect Immunology Global sales to grow double digits, including U.S. Humira growth of 8%, International Humira revenue of $2.6 billion at current exchange rates, Skyrizi Global sales of $4.4 billion and Rinvoq Global sales of $2.7 billion. In hematologic oncology, we expect Venclexta global sales of $2.3 billion and Imbruvica global revenue of $5.4 billion. The Imbruvica forecast assumes market recovery in CLL, offset by share erosion from increased competition. For aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.9 billion, including $2.6 billion for Botox Cosmetic and $1.7 billion from Juvederm. For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of $6.9 billion, including Botox Therapeutic sales of $2.7 billion, Vraylar sales of $2.2 billion, Ubrelvy sales of $800 million and Qulipta sales of $200 million with commercial access increasing rapidly in the first half of the year. For eye care, we expect global sales of $2.9 billion, including $700 million from Restasis, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2022. Lastly, we expect Mavyret global revenue of $1.7 billion. Looking at the P&L for 2022, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.8 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $12.7 billion. This guidance includes approximately $2.5 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting the adjusted operating margin ratio to expand by 120 basis points to approximately 51.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense approaching $2.2 billion, our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.7% and our share count to be roughly flat to 2021. Turning to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.5 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas: Immunology sales of $6.2 billion, HemOnc revenue of $1.7 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, neuroscience revenue of $1.5 billion and eye care sales of $900 million. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 51% of sales, and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.10 and $3.14, excluding approximately $1.22 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie’s strong business performance and outlook continue to support our capital allocation priorities. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of approximately $24 billion in 2022, which is net of roughly $1 billion in Skyrizi royalty payments. This cash flow will fully support a strong and growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 250% since inception; continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down just above $12 billion of debt in 2022 and estimate a net leverage ratio of 1.8 times by the end of the year. Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development, with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative therapies. In closing, we are very pleased to AbbVie’s strong results in 2021. And we expect to deliver robust performance in 2022 and over the long term. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we’ll take the first question.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I just have a couple here digging into Rinvoq in a little bit more detail. I guess, first in rheumatoid arthritis, can you just -- it looks like volumes have plateaued a little bit. It’s probably not hugely surprising given label revision, but just elaborate a little bit more on the feedback you’re getting from physicians there. And when you anticipate you’ll start to see sequential growth again in that indication? The second question I had on Rinvoq was then on atopic derm. Just elaborate again a little bit more on the ramp you’re expecting here. Is this something that’s going to take some time, or do you view that there’s some low-hanging fruit maybe with some of the DP failures? I’m really just trying to get to with all of these is, I guess, the $2.7 billion guidance, how much of that’s RA? How much of it is new indication? Just a little bit more color on that front. Thanks so much.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thanks. Hi. It’s Jeff. I’ll give you some sense on what’s happening with RA. So, the RA market after the drug safety and label is progressing as we anticipated. So, I’ll give you some sense, and I’ll refer to sort of in-play share because you have to be a little bit careful in the December, January time frame with overall volumes in the market. But right before the Drug Safety Communication, we had about a 16% in-place share in RA, which was just right behind Humira. So very, very strong. If we look at where that’s trended over the fourth quarter, it’s dropped about 20%. Okay? So, it’s about 14 reported in October, just over 13 in November, very consistent with what we thought would happen. So, about a 20% shift in new-to-brand starts over that time period. And what we see from the market is it’s exactly as we would expect, very, very stable, no change really in second-line plus and doctors start to suppress their starts in first-line consistent with the label. So, what we’re going to see is that as basically the promotion kicks back in here after December in the first quarter, we’re going to see that type of stability, which we can see is very, very clear from our overall share in our weeklies and start to progress as we shift and pivot towards that second-line plus. So, the market is responding very similar to our expectations that we’ve been talking about in terms of overall RA. Obviously, PsA is going to help build upon that RA dynamic and then ultimately, later in the year, the big axial approvals as well. So, everything is progressing as we thought it would progress from a market perspective. In terms of atopic dermatitis, listen, I said in my prepared remarks, we’re very pleased with the label. We have those stringent endpoints of the EASI 90, the high skin clearance, very powerful itch reduction are reflected in our label. We obviously have both doses approved. The market, I can tell you, has been very pleasantly surprised about the adolescent indication, which is -- it’s very important. So, that’s basically -- we’re going to start to see that ramp. It won’t -- we don’t think it’s going to be slow. And to your point, in terms of our ability to start to capture patients, it’s happening already. We obviously haven’t reported any of the TRxs yet, but we can see it in the market. And typically, it’s falling into a couple of areas. First, dupi failures, not a surprise, and there’s a reasonably significant number of people after 4 or 5 years that just have failed and exited the market. They’re going to come back in. We have reports from our research and our teams over partial responders to dupi that just aren’t doing well, in particular with the itch. We see some early starts there. And then, of course, challenging patients in general, we are seeing starts there as well with those higher levels of skin involvement. So the market seems to be progressing as we expected. It’s not surprising that as we look at the development of the second-line market, we’re going to see initially most of the starts in the dupi partial responders or the nonresponders, which is a fairly significant population. Also, as I mentioned, that we will start to see our access ramp fairly quickly here over the first part of the year. So, we’re encouraged. Maybe I can turn it over to Rob to give a sense over the relative magnitude of the sales.
Rob Michael: Thanks, Jeff. Chris, this is Rob. So of the Rinvoq guidance of $2.7 billion, the AD and spine indications will each contribute a couple of hundred million dollars, while UC will contribute around $100 million. And to keep in mind in terms of sequential growth, keep in mind, in the U.S., you tend to see from Q4 to Q1, it’s a sequential decline. So that’s just a seasonal dynamic that we see across the business. So you would see sequential growth resume in Q2 and beyond.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.
Ronny Gal: First question is around Humira. I was wondering if you guys will be in a position to give us some sort of a floor number in 2023 based on payer contracts. Sometimes this year, obviously, the market is looking for that. And then, when I talk to payers, it seems a lot of the decisions about what product they would use longer term will not happen in 2023. That will happen in 2024. You kind of talked about kind of like a decline and then a quick ramp-up. Do you see the floor here in 2023, or do you see it in 2024? And then, if I could sneak one more. You have one of the largest differences between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in the industry because of that Allergan acquisition. As you look at the amortization period and so forth, when do you think this thing will begin to narrow in a significant way just because that’s a concern for some investors?
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Ronny, this is Rick Gonzalez. I’ll take the Humira questions. I think if you look at the guidance we provided thus far, I mean, I think that’s consistent with how we see the market playing out overall. We’ve said basically you should be thinking about 45% erosion, plus or minus 10%, that’s probably a reasonable range. Nothing has really given us any indication that it should be different than that at this point. I think we will be in a position as we move later on this year to potentially be able to provide some more specificity around that. We should be through all of the contracting at that point, in a better position to be able to understand the ramp and the change that will occur over that period of time, and we certainly want to provide guidance when we have confidence that we can give you a high degree of specificity of what that guidance looks like. As it relates to your question about floor for Humira, I think your question is, will the floor for Humira be in ‘23 or ‘24. And I believe you’ll see further erosion from ‘23 to ‘24 on the Humira business alone. But what we have described is we returned to growth on the overall business. So, you have to think about it from the perspective of this underlying growth engine that gets suppressed in ‘23 by the significant erosion that you see around Humira, both price and some volume. And then, as that continues, it continues at a slower pace when we get into ‘24. So, the overall business has the ability to be able to drive growth for the total Company. But yes, Humira would continue to decline in ‘24. And then Rob, why don’t you cover the third one?
Rob Michael: Sure, Ronny, this is Rob. So when you look at our adjustments to specified intangible amortization, I’d say intangible amortization is like 70% of it and this is on the $4.74 guidance that we’ve given this year. And that will continue. Obviously, those things fall off over a number of years. But I would say that’s probably a level that I would assume would be present for the next several years. Another big component is kind of the contingent consideration given that we’re -- that’s purchase accounting, and we record that accretion as such, that will certainly fluctuate over time. But I’d say those are the two biggest components of the guide this year. And certainly, integration costs are starting to wind down, so you would expect to see those come down. But it is going down from last year. And so you would expect it potentially trend down. But overall, I think you can model this level going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi.
Andrew Baum: A couple of questions. Firstly, on Imbruvica. As we move into 2022 and the COVID dynamic shakes out, we’ll be able to see the impact of competition versus COVID. Assuming that a significant chunk of the U.S. slowing growth rate or decline is due to competition, what can be done to recoup the momentum against the narrative, particularly of Calquence? And then second, in terms of your aesthetics business, you terminated your contract with Medytox liquid formulation. There are competitive products coming to market as well as increasing price competition. How much of that is concerned or as your franchise and the breadth of the portfolio enough to minimize any impact of novel formulations? Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, Andrew, it’s Jeff. So, thanks. And you’re right that we still have the continuing lingering effect with COVID, and Rob addressed that in his comments. So, we still see the market versus ‘19 levels down about 10% and even marginally down from 2020 in Q4. So we anticipate that that will moderate go forward. And then we’re left to manage the competitive impact. So, we are seeing competitive BTKs have some impact on Imbruvica, but we’re also seeing the competitive impact from our own Venclexta. So we have to start to think about looking at the combination of the AbbVie position, which is still very, very strong. To give you some sense in second-line, we have 45% share of the market, and it’s even higher in third-line, and it’s in the 30s for frontline. So, we have to continue, which is our strategy to highlight where we have a lot of distinction, which is the strength of our data across every comparator in CLL, the overall survival benefit, and then also bring the strength of our overall portfolio. So, that’s how we plan to mitigate it. As Rob mentioned, we see market recovery offset by some share pressure on Imbruvica, mitigated by positive Ven impact. So, that’s how we see the market develop as we go into 2022. We also are seeing some pricing pressure in some select segments that are also contributing to the share loss for Imbruvica. And obviously, we -- as much as we can, we keep the pricing discipline in the market moving forward. So, I hope that context helps.
Rick Gonzalez: Andrew, this is Rick. I’ll cover the Aesthetics questions for you. And certainly, as you look at Botox, both here in the U.S. and internationally, it competes today against a significant number of competitive alternatives that are available. I think it’s a pretty impressive position that Botox has in the market. When you look at the brand equity that it has, when you look at the confidence that injectors have in using the product, they tend to describe it as the most forgiving of all the toxins that they have experience with. And then there’s obviously a fairly significant customer loyalty aspect to Botox with the loyalty programs and Allergan has a very significant loyalty program that offers patients incentives to be able to use the product and to go back and get repeat procedures. Having said all of that, we feel confident in the position that we have competitively against the competitive alternatives that we see out there and those that we see coming. We have a very active R&D effort in the aesthetics R&D group now that’s looking at next-generation toxins. Two in particular that we highlighted in the comments earlier are we had a short-acting toxin that’s in development that’s progressing very nicely, and we have a true long-acting toxin that’s in development as well. And we believe that those will help grow the market. But, if I look at the market now, obviously, we’ve seen significant acceleration in the market since we’ve activated many of the strategies that we put in place after acquiring Allergan. But if I look at our overall share, overall share has stayed very steady, in fact, might have ticked up one point in the latest set of data. So, that tells you that we’re not only growing the market very rapidly but we’re continuing to compete quite effectively against the alternatives that are out there. So, I’m not overly concerned about what I see on the horizon. I think, we have the opportunity to build the market even larger with some of the next generation toxins that we’re working on when we bring those to the marketplace. So, I feel good about our position in toxins and in fillers as we move forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities.
Vamil Divan: So, a couple. I always appreciate all the guidance. You guys gave both near term and longer term. Just a couple of questions I have related to more of the longer-term guidance you’ve given. In the past, you had talked about your HemOnc franchise sort of in peak sales or sales I guess in 2025 of around $13 billion. When you updated some of your numbers earlier last month, I don’t think you updated that one. So, I’m just curious if you still think that that’s a reasonable sort of 2025 expectation? And then, the other one is around Ubrelvy, where you’ve sort of stayed with this guidance of sort of more than $1 billion in peak sales. But you’re already guiding to $800 million of sales just in this current year, pretty early in the launch. So, I’m just wondering if you can maybe give a little better sense of how you’re viewing sort of the longer-term opportunity for Ubrelvy and maybe if you want to mention Qulipta, I know that’s early, but at least for Ubrelvy, do you think there’s significant upside to that $1 billion number you’ve mentioned before? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Vamil, this is Rick. So, I’ll cover the first one, and then I’m going to have Jeff cover the Ubrelvy question that you’ve asked. So, it’s a good question. Obviously, the HemOnc market in the areas that we participate in, in particular, I would say CLL has changed over the last several years. I think one of the -- certainly, one of the things that was not ever anticipated in that guidance was the impact that COVID would have on the market and the reduction that we saw in the number of new patients, which was quite sizable. And that obviously wasn’t contemplated in it. And the second thing is we are seeing certainly more competitive pressure, both from price and some volume than we anticipated in that time frame. Having said all of that and -- well, I’d say a third item is, certainly, Venclexta is performing well as well. And I’d say, it’s tended to exceed some of our expectations, at least at this point within the launch trajectory of the brand. So, all of those have factors in what we’re describing here. I’d also say we have done a nice job of building out our HemOnc portfolio from an R&D standpoint. When I look at some of those assets that I described in my opening comments, I think they’re going to have a very significant opportunity. As an example, one that I didn’t mention there would be Venclexta and the t(11;14) multiple myeloma population. That could be a very significant opportunity, we feel good about that. We should get a readout on that. And we think that could be a significant contributor to both improvement in in-patient therapy, but also a significant improvement in the overall revenue in the franchise. And then, you have things like Navitoclax and epcoritamab and 383, those are all significant opportunities to be able to drive growth. So, I still feel confident in the overall ability for us to grow our HemOnc franchise. Having said that, I would say, Imbruvica is under more pressure than we anticipated. When we put that guidance out, at that point, we didn’t even contemplate a follow-on BTKs in any meaningful way. But we do see more competitive pressure there. But overall, I’d say, I still feel very confident in our ability to be able to grow that, that will be a growth franchise for the Company over the long term.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Hi Vamil, it’s Jeff. So, just to answer your question on Ubrelvy in the overall market. Certainly, we’re very pleased, as I mentioned in my remarks, over the momentum on Ubrelvy. We continue to lead in that acute space. And the early results for Qulipta are also very strong. Now, a lot of it is going to depend on how that CGRP market develops. So, if you think about it in this way, and this is how we think about it is, is it’s about in terms of new patient capture for the total Ubrelvy market, where we also compete with another player from Biohaven. It’s about 18% to 19% of the market. And the market is also with the expanded triptan market, of course. So, if you look at that, the payers certainly like you to step through one or more triptans. When you look at the population that may not be eligible for a triptan or fails a triptan, the estimates are typically up to 30% to 35%. And so, the market has potential room to sort of double into that epidemiology. So, you can kind of run the numbers there. I mean, we often get the question, is it over $1 billion? Is it closer to $1 billion or is it closer to a higher number. But nonetheless, we’re pleased. Certainly, it’s exceeded our expectations so far, and Qulipta has as well. So, I think there’s more room for the market to run, but we’ll have to see. I mean, there are payer pressures in the market, as I mentioned, in terms of the step-through therapy.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: I have a couple of questions. At a high level, I struggle to understand why 2022 won’t be a stronger year than the guide on the earnings line. Skyrizi and Botox are doing phenomenally. Rinvoq is holding its own. Humira will still be exclusive in the U.S. for the whole year and should be at peak profitability and the pandemic less an obstacle. So, why won’t 2022 look more like or even better than 2021 in terms of earnings power? And secondly, there was no mention of the CF program even in the upcoming milestones. Any thoughts on the timing of the triplet data? In the past, I would describe AbbVie confidence as being no more than moderate. Has it changed one way or the other?
Rick Gonzalez: Steve, this is Rick. Maybe Rob and I will tag team your first question, and then Michael will cover your second question. I think if I look at 2022 and I look at our overall performance coming off of a strong year in 2021, it’s pretty impressive performance. When I look at the EPS growth, certainly, do we have an opportunity to drive it harder? I can tell you, every year, we endeavor to drive it as hard as we can drive it. And when I look at all of the businesses individually, and I look at their ability to be able to perform, I’m extremely confident in the trajectory that we have going forward. Specifically, we’re assuming as an example, in HCV that there’s still a COVID impact in HCV. So, I wouldn’t say the pandemic is completely gone in 2022. But, I’d say, overall, the brands are performing well. We’re investing in the business to ensure that we continue to be able to drive long-term performance. And so certainly, that obviously drives some expectations around what the EPS growth will be year-over-year. I don’t know, Rob, anything you’d like to add?
Rob Michael: I mean, I think it’s a good point and that we are fully investing to support the long-term growth. If you think about we’re launching AD, that’s a new area for us. Qulipta and Vuity, we’re also going to fully invest there. Aesthetics, we’ve seen that the strength of the investment in aesthetics in the way we’ve been able to grow the market. So that’s really important. At the same time, we’re expanding operating margin. We’re exceeding our expectations for synergies. And so, you’re seeing us deliver another year of operating margin expansion. So, I’d say, we’re top tier in operating margin, very healthy P&L profile. And then, the other thing that you probably have to factor in here is that we’ve assumed half year Restasis as well. We don’t really have visibility to the generic until we make an assumption every time we update guidance six months out. So that’s something that if you look at year-over-year that you should figure into your comparisons. But overall, we’re very pleased with delivering double-digit growth in earnings and seeing another year of very strong operating margin expansion while fully investing to support the growth of the business.
Michael Severino: And this is Mike. I’ll take the question on CF. I think, it’s important to keep in mind that this is a pre proof-of-concept program that doesn’t contribute in any meaningful way to our long-term outlook and doesn’t factor into our thinking about the long-term potential in the pipeline. And the way we have discussed it is consistent with that view. We’ve always said that it represents significant upside if it were to hit, but it’s an early program. With respect to the timing of the data, we continue to track towards the timing that we’ve described previously. We would expect to have data from the triple, sufficient to enable a go/no-go decision later on this quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: A couple of questions. I’m guessing that as we move through 2022, investors are going to start to have some concerns about 2023 earnings, what the impact from Humira could be, and you talked about having more visibility on Humira contracting later this year. My question is, is it possible you’ll actually give us 2023 earnings guidance sometime this year, like at Q3 results as an example? And then, my second question, just going back to CF data. You said in mid-November that you would actually have that data in-house by the end of the year. So, here we are four weeks later, we haven’t really seen anything. My question is, do you actually have that data in-house? Did you hit that timeline of end of year, if not, what’s going on? And what changed in that short window?
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Tim, this is Rick. I’ll cover your first question. Mike can address the second one. We certainly are in a position now to be able to commit that we would give earnings guidance in the third quarter. I think clearly, we’ll be able to give a better feel for what that erosion curve looks like. And could that ultimately end up being at least a pretty good perspective for us to be able to build off of what earnings guidance would look like. It might. I think if we’re in a position where we can confidently provide that guidance, we would provide it. But I certainly think we’ll be in a position where we have very good visibility as to what that erosion curve will look like. And at that point, we can tighten it a bit and be able to provide a higher level of specificity. We understand it’s an important issue for investors. As far as EPS is concerned, in 2023, we have said that we expect EPS to decline in 2023. So, I don’t think any investor is -- that would be a surprise to any investor. But obviously, it’s important for us to be able to frame it as accurately as we can for the investment community and be able to provide direction around that. And at the point at which we think we can do that in a reliable way, we’re committed to be able to do that. So, let’s see how it plays out. And certainly, as we get to the third quarter call, that would be the position at -- the point at which I think we’d be in a position to be able to provide more clarity. Mike?
Michael Severino: So, on CF, what we said towards the end of last year is that data would begin to come in-house around the end of the year, and we would have sufficient data to make a go/no-go in the first quarter. And we’re still tracking to that overall timeline. There were some challenges towards the end of the year, where a number of patients were expected from Australia, for example, and Australia shut down because of COVID and we had to shift that enrollment. So, we perhaps have slightly less data than we would have hoped to have had at this point in the year. But again, we’re still tracking to be able to make that go/no-go decision by the end of the year, because it’s important to keep in mind that these are short studies. And so once you get those patients in, you can turn the data around and make a decision pretty quickly. But the overall timing hasn’t changed substantially from what we described at the end of last year.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.
Mohit Bansal: Congrats on the quarter. Maybe a question on Rinvoq and other oral competition and competitors in IBD, where do you see Rinvoq fitting versus other orals such as SNP [ph] inhibitor? I mean, now they are more than -- there could be more than one. And KOL, I mean they kind of suggested some kind of induction with one drug in maintenance with other drugs, a kind of treatment paradigm in IBD. Do you think it is even a possibility in any of these diseases? Thank you.
Michael Severino: I think -- this is Mike. I’ll take that question. If you look at the performance of Rinvoq and inflammatory bowel diseases, both in UC where we have the full data set and in Crohn’s disease, where we have an important component of the induction data set, the performance across the board is very, very strong. Not only in terms of just overall response rates that are measured, but particularly when one looks at deeper measures of response, clinical remission, mucosal healing, major clinical response, which is the combination of remission and endoscopic improvement. And across the board, we’re driving very high levels of disease control. And we think that feature of the drug, combined with the overall benefit risk position us to compete very effectively against not only oral competitors but many competitors, all competitors in the field. When we look at those data to our eye, given the limitations of cross-study comparisons, we see response rates that just aren’t paralleled in the field. And so we think that there is a very real opportunity for Rinvoq and our view of its role in IBD reflects that. With respect to mixed induction and maintenance regimens, it’s important to keep in mind that there are no data to support those sorts of regimens. All of the programs look at induction, followed by maintenance, which is usually a step-down in dose from the induction dose. And that’s the data set that physicians will have. Now, it’s important to keep in mind that in the long term, patients often lose control and then they need to be reinduced with a new agent. And one of the very strong features of Rinvoq and quite frankly, Skyrizi also shares this characteristic, is it has very durable response. So, it does maintain response for a very long period of time in the studies that we have continued to follow, including our long-term extensions from Phase 2 and our Phase 3 program. So, we think those are also very strong attributes to the products.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets.
Gary Nachman: Aesthetics has been a big source of upside in 2021. So, I’m curious, did you see any real impact from Omicron in the fourth quarter? Do you see a tailwind maybe from that further recovery this year? Is that baked into the aesthetics guidance of $5.9 billion that you have for 2022? And you’ve talked about high-single-digit long-term aesthetics guidance, but this year should be double digits. So, should we be thinking more along the lines of double-digit growth maybe for the next few years if you’re still investing a lot in that space? And then, just one other quick one on Qulipta for the chronic migraine prevention indication. That data is coming soon sometime this quarter. So, just talk about how meaningful you think that indication will be and how that’s factored into the peak targets that you talked about. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Gary, it’s a good question on Omicron in new studies because it is something we track very carefully in every major geography around the world as well as by state here in the United States. And I will tell you that at least as far as the U.S. is concerned, there has not been much of an impact on aesthetic volume, unlike what we saw when there was an actual shutdown. And obviously, you would think shutdown, you’re going to see the volume go down. But I’d say here, we’re seeing very little impact on the volume. So, we have factored in that we don’t expect a major disruption going forward. And I think the data would clearly support that that’s a reasonable position to take. And as far as the business overall, I mean, I can tell you, we’re very pleased with how the business is performing. I think that group is executing at a very high level. And certainly, the resourcing and the dedicated structure that we put in place, I think, are helping a lot in major geographies like the U.S. and China. We’re obviously comfortable with the guide that we provided. It is an area that we’re going to continue to invest in and continue to drive. And I think it’s a market that I think is extremely attractive. And it’s going to require both us to continue to execute and invest in it appropriately to grow the market, but also to build out more assets that meet patients’ needs to be able to expand the market. And so, we’ve almost doubled the R&D investment that we have in aesthetics since we took it over. And we have a number of programs that I think are very exciting programs. Some of the biostimulatory and regenerative fillers that we’re working on now, I think, could be exciting opportunities like tropoelastin to be able to stimulate tropoelastin in patients using fillers is an exciting program that continues to advance. And so, it’s going to require both. It’s something that we’re absolutely committed to continue to drive. And I think this can be, as we indicated in our comments, I think this can be a strong business for AbbVie over the long term. Jeff, do you want to cover Qulipta?
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Thanks Gary for you question on Qulipta. It’s an important new indication if we see -- when we see the data and it were to be approved. And I’ll give you some perspective. Obviously, we’ve talked about how much we really like our portfolio of migraine. You got Botox on chronic with the injectors. Obviously, you have Qulipta right now in episodic and of course, Ubrelvy in acute. So, the Qulipta chronic gives us quite a bit of flexibility, and it’s a nice catalyst. Even though episodic is a bigger market in terms of patients, obviously, chronic patients do consume a lot of medication. Largely, if you think about the market structure, you’ve got injectors, meaning they inject Botox or you have non-injectors. So, to bring in the first oral that -- for people that don’t choose to have a Botox-injectable practice, that’s quite attractive. And we think it builds in our story over the strength of Qulipta first-in-class designed specifically for these indications. So, it’s a very nice catalyst if it were to be approved. And so, we’re anxiously looking forward to that. The other thing I would note, which is further off and it’s obviously something that would have to play out through the studies in Mike’s organization, was chronic migraine is so difficult that the potential for patients to have combination treatment. So, in other words, a Botox Therapeutic plus a simple oral drug like Qulipta could bring this concept to that segment of the market called migraine freedom where you’re really trying to get the headaches down to as low as possible. And so, again, it’s further off, but it shows you the flexibility that we have as we continue to build out Qulipta across our migraine portfolio. So, we’re pretty excited about the potential for CM.
Operator: Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.
Geoff Meacham: I just had a couple of quick ones for Rick -- or for Rob. The first one is when you look at your our modified 2025 guidance for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, were there any changes to your assumptions on duration of therapy or the pricing environment? I’m just thinking about the payer landscape with many more biosimilars coming up and what impact that could have on switching or price increases. And then, the second question is on the BD front. We’ve obviously seen valuations come down quite a bit in SMID cap biotech in the past six months. And I know you’ve usually talked about $2 billion earmarked for BD, but does the current environment make things like bringing new TAs or newer technologies in-house more attractive? Thanks so much.
Rick Gonzalez: Rob?
Rob Michael: Yes, Geoff. So obviously, when we go through our long-range plan, we consider the various dynamics of the pricing environment. So, we factor that into our 2025 guidance. I would not say that there’s really been an assumption change for duration of therapy. But we did -- we certainly took into account the impact of label on RA, AD and SpA, but then that was offset by the stronger performance at OUS as well as the stronger IBD data that we saw for Rinvoq and just the overall performance of Skyrizi in psoriasis. It was all factored into that updated guidance, but we did not make an assumption change for duration of therapy, and we certainly factor in various pricing assumptions as we go through our long-range plan.
Rick Gonzalez: Yes. And maybe Mike and I will tag team number two. I mean, certainly, as we -- you’ve seen us pay down debt at a very significant pace. We’re continuing to commit to pay down significant debt this year. And we’ll certainly be in a position where we could do larger opportunities if that was something that we desired and we thought it was the right kind of opportunity as we move forward in ‘23 and ‘24. Certainly, the $2 billion that we’ve allocated has been sufficient to be able to cover the things that we’re looking for. Mike has responsibility for business development. So, I think it’s probably a little closer to the valuation question. Mike?
Michael Severino: Well, what I would say is that valuations have certainly come down, and that brings opportunities into the focus that might previously been outside of that range of $2 billion a year that we had contemplated. And as Rick said, as we pay down debt, we have some more flexibility. But we’re going to continue to look at BD in the same way that we always have, which is that it is an important component of adding innovation to our pipeline and needs to be coupled with our internal innovation. So, we’re going to match what’s out there. The innovation we see, the therapeutic areas that are most promising with what’s going on in our early pipeline and use that to make sure that, overall, we have a very strong and very innovative pipeline. And you can see that, for example, in the way that we have built our HemOnc franchise, where we have a nice blend of internally discovered and partnered programs from Venclexta and Imbruvica, obviously, our lead programs to the significant programs behind that, things like Navitoclax, epcoritamab, 383 and now Teliso-V demonstrating extremely strong data in non-small cell lung cancer. So, that’s a blend of internal and external innovation. And we’re going to continue to look at areas in that same way. And it’s principally going to be the fit for our overall situation, the strength of the innovation and that balance between internal and external innovation that we look at.
Operator: Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer from Evercore.
Josh Schimmer: First, I’m a little surprised the contingent consideration adjustment is not higher considering your recently revised Skyrizi forecast. Am I not understanding that line correctly, or should we be expecting a more meaningful revision in the first quarter? And then, you mentioned a couple of times the novel biostimulatory dermal fillers you have in the aesthetics pipeline. Can you elaborate on how you expect those to differentiate versus the current offering and whether you expect those to expand the market for fillers?
Rob Michael: Josh, this is Rob. I’ll take your first question. So, we did actually record in Q2 of last year, additional accretion for higher sales forecast for Skyrizi, and that was really tied to both our long-range plan as well as because it’s a fair value measure. You have to take external forecast into account. And obviously, Street numbers had moved up as well. We came out with publicly with the updated guidance in December, but we already contemplated that in our contingent consideration accretion in Q2 of last year. So, that’s already accounted for.
Rick Gonzalez: So, on the biostimulatory fillers, I think the way to think about it, there are multiple programs, but I’ll talk about two areas specifically. Certainly, one of the areas that you want to be able to look at is your ability to be able to stimulate collagen so that your own body can produce collagen to be able to provide support and filling in a specific area that you desire. And there are some products on the market today that provide that. One of the negatives of those products is you don’t get the immediate filling effect that you normally get with a filler, where you get physical filling immediately upon the procedure. You get a little bit of swelling that occurs. So, for a very short period of time, you will get what looks to be filling, but then that swelling goes down. And then for a period of time, the patient has to wait in order for them to get the collagen impact, and that takes a significant period of time. So we have a technology in-house that we acquired, and we’re further developing that combines both physical filling and collagen stimulation in one product. So, you get the immediate filling effect of a normal filler. And then, as that starts to resolve over time, you get the collagen impact that’s building over that same period of time to provide long-term filling. So, I would say that most of these technologies that we’re working on are market expansion opportunities, so that’s one example. The second example would be one of the areas that is important for patients is what we describe as skin quality, the smoothness of your skin essentially. And one of the things that provides smoothness of your skin is the elasticity of the skin. So, tropoelastin is an example of a product that we have in development that will allow the body to be able to produce more elastin. So, you can inject this product and it will provide, we believe, we have to prove this in the clinical studies, that would provide not only some level, not a dramatic level of filling but an ability to be able to provide elastin information along those areas and be able to smooth the skin out. That would clearly be a market expansion opportunity, today there really aren’t fillers that do that. They can stretch the skin with the physical filling, but they don’t really provide smoothing of the skin. And so, those are two examples of what we’re working on.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.
Chris Raymond: Just two questions. First on the migraine franchise. I noticed that you have a Phase 3 trial looking at Qulipta in Botox in a combo therapy for migraine -- for chronic migraine prevention. Our doc checks indicate actually growing interest, docs sort of highlight that as proactively is something they’re interested in. I guess, was this trial in response to that feedback or maybe just talk about the rationale and how you’re looking at combo in the space? And then, just a question on a drug that doesn’t come up that you just launched, Vuity. Presbyopia represents a huge TAM. Maybe just talk about initial uptake trends and what is it about this market, I guess, that you’re seeing that you’re not making a bigger deal out of this launch? Thanks.
Michael Severino: So, this is Mike. I’ll start with the question on Qulipta and Botox combo use and then Jeff may want to add and take the second question. With respect to that combination, it really goes back to what Jeff said before, this concept of migraine freedom. If you think about chronic migraine, these are patients who have 15 or more migraine days a month. That’s a migraine every other day, and these are debilitating attacks. So a substantial reduction in that is great. But, what patients and physicians are really seeking is an elimination of the migraine so that they can be free to go across their daily lives, to go about their daily lives. And given the options that are out there today to really get to that level in those most severely affected patients. Combination therapy is an obvious place to go, particularly when it’s complementary approaches that work through different mechanisms. And so you would expect their effects to be independent and additive. And where you have a treatment like Botox, it has a long track record, is infrequently administered and has a long duration. So, it’s that thinking that led to that combination trial. And I do think we would also agree that there is significant interest in treating physicians around these approaches.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Just to add to that, that’s exactly right, is the -- it’s so logical and there’s so much unmet need, to Mike’s point, in chronic migraine with half a month, sometimes these migraines last for days. And so there’s a lot of desperation. And when the thought leaders and the headache specialists see the impact of Botox and how simple Qulipta is and how strong that is, they go right there. So I think we are encouraged, as Mike mentioned, to sort of see the outcome of those studies for migraine freedom. It would -- if it works, it would be a real advance for patients.
Rick Gonzalez: And so on Vuity, you’re right, we didn’t comment on this meeting. You typically wouldn’t comment on a product that’s -- of this size. And I mean, it’s a very interesting product. I think it clearly has a unique fit in the market. I’ll have -- I’ll let Jeff talk a little bit about the total available market, what we see as far as the size of that market going forward. But the reason we didn’t highlight it is, like I said, if we look at what we think peak sales will be here, it’s not a product of the magnitude that we would typically highlight.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. And what we see is that there is excitement about Vuity. I mean it’s different than the -- obviously, the market is basically over-the-counter or prescription high glasses or readers, right? So, this is the first ever product that basically is a drop or a reading drop, right? So, when we start to break down the data and you take a really, really big market, tens and tens of millions of patients with presbyopia. But we also largely see from the clinical study, it really works the best for moderate to severe younger people, not older people. So, as we basically make the cuts, it’s still a substantial market size, but it’s not as large as you might think if you just look at all the presbyopes that are better in the United States. But nonetheless, it’s early days where we have a sales force that’s calling on our optometrist, also ophthalmologists. What we see from the early results is significant interest. We haven’t started our big consumer push, which will come later, later in this quarter. It is an older glaucoma product that’s been reformulated. So, there’s a little bit of learning from the ophthalmologists who really understand glaucoma products. But overall, the early results are it works, it works as anticipated. It works quickly within 15 minutes. It lasts for 6 to 8 hours. And so, again, when we look at the price point, it’s not a reimbursed product. It’s a cash pay product. We have, to Rick’s point, fairly modest expectations. And we’ll continue to watch the trajectory here over the next quarter or so.
Rick Gonzalez: I think the big assumption that you have to look at here is, what is the utilization per month the patient would actually use it for. I mean, as an example, I keep bugging the guys that I have to go get a prescription for it. Now, what do I want it for? When I go to a restaurant, I have trouble reading in low light. So, I’ll use it for that purpose. And so, it’s very difficult to come up with what the frequency at which it will be used. If it’s used in a high frequency, it will obviously be a bigger product. If it’s used at a relatively low frequency, it will be smaller product. So, we’ll have to see how it plays out.
Liz Shea: Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley.
Matthew Harrison: Thanks for fitting me in. I guess, two for me, if I may. So first, on epco, could you just comment around your confidence around accelerated approval here in DLBCL and how you’re thinking about that opportunity in the near term? And then, on Vraylar, maybe just comment on what FDA conversations are ongoing there and how you’re thinking about the potential for an AdCom or not.
Michael Severino: So, on epco, we have a high degree of confidence in epco overall. It continues to deliver very strong results, high overall response rates, very deep responses, good complete response rates across a number of indications, DLBCL and follicular lymphoma both. With respect to the confidence in accelerated approval for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, when we look at the data, we think it clearly exceeds the benchmarks of available therapies in highly pre-treated refractory patients. So, we would think that accelerated approval should be supported by those data, will allow the data to continue to mature from the expansion cohorts and have our final regulatory discussions later on this year to set up that accelerated approval submission. So, it certainly is in our planning, and we think it’s very supportable based on the data. With respect to confidence in Vraylar and MDD, we’re confident in that -- we’ve been confident. We were confident when we saw the data and looked at the strength of those data and looked at the relevant precedents for molecules that have achieved indications, not only in depression, broadly speaking, but in adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. We’ve completed all of the regulatory discussions that we need to have for the submission, and we’re planning the submission shortly as we described in my prepared remarks. In terms of potential for an AdCom, it’s really too early to comment on that. We typically start to have those conversations with the agency a few months into the review process. But, based on the data and based on the precedence, it’s not something that we would anticipate. However, if the agency were to have one, it wouldn’t concern us either. We think the data package is very strong and would hold its own.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Matthew. That concludes today’s conference call. If you’d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-29 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be on a listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator instructions]. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may proceed.
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President.

Before we get started, some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for Allergan.  For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast to conform to AbbVie's revenue recognition accounting policies, and exclude the divestitures of ZENPEP and Bio case. References to operational growth further exclude the impact of exchange. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I will now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our third quarter performance and outlook and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie continues to perform very well. We once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.33, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.13. Total adjusted net revenues of more than $14.3 billion was up 10.8% on an operational basis, with balance growth across each of the major growth platforms. We continue to see double-digit revenue growth in immunology, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq have established very strong launch trajectories. These 2 assets are either approved, under regulatory review, or in late-stage development across all of Humira's major indications. And we remain confident that they will both be significant contributors to AbbVie 's long-term growth. Aesthetics is also demonstrating impressive double-digit operational sales growth. Our dedicated global aesthetics structure and increased investment are driving accelerated category growth across both toxins and fillers, where there is substantial room for additional market penetration. Our strategic investments and targeted field force expansions have improved overall our customer retention rates and significantly increased the number of first-time patients to our leading brands. We are once again raising our full-year guidance for aesthetics this quarter. And we view these portfolio as an extremely attractive growth opportunity over the long term with high single-digit compounded annual growth rates expected through the end of the decade. Our Neuroscience business drove robust double-digit revenue performance again this quarter. And we added a compelling new product to our migraine portfolio with the approval of Qulipta, a once-daily oral medication for the preventative treatment of episodic migraine. Our Hematological Oncology portfolio delivered operational sales growth of approximately 8% this quarter, despite a protracted market recovery in CLL, which remains below pre -COVID levels. Beyond the significant contributions of Imbruvica and Venclexta, we have an exciting oncology pipeline with several promising programs in development for blood cancers and solid tumors, to support sustainable long-term growth. These include Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, Epcoritamab for B-cell malignancies, ABBV383 for multiple myeloma, lemzoparlimab for AML and MDS, as well as Teliso -V for non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer.  Lastly, we continue to make excellent progress with the integration of Allergan. Our financial results show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse Company with numerous products across our newly combined portfolio, delivering robust growth. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our momentum and we are once again raising our full-year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.63 to $12.67, reflecting growth of nearly 20% at the midpoint. Additionally, as noted in our news release, today, we are announcing an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, from a $1.30 per share to a $1.41 per share, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. Since our inception, we've grown our quarterly dividend by more than 250%. In summary, we're demonstrating strong execution across our portfolio. We've assembled an impressive set of diversified assets with significant growth potential giving us a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook for our business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, Jeff.
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. We continue to demonstrate strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with Immunology, where we remain well-positioned for sustained leadership with a portfolio of best-in-class medicines. Total immunology revenues were approximately $6.7 billion, up 14.9% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales were more than $5.4 billion up 5.2% on an operational basis, with 10.1% revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 16.7% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI is performing extremely well. Global sales of nearly $800 million were up 18.1% on a sequential basis, reflecting continued market share gains. In the U.S. SKYRIZI's leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients, is now roughly 36% more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. SKYRIZI total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now nearly 20%, second only to HUMIRA. Internationally, SKYRIZI continues to ramp nicely, having also achieved in-play patient share leadership in more than a dozen key markets. This compelling share performance will be further supported by 2 important near-term enhancements. The availability of more simple delivery forms for SKYRIZI, as well as the potential indication expansion in psoriatic arthritis. First, we recently launched the new and convenient SKYRIZI single-dose, 150 milligrams, self - injectable pen and syringe in major territories around the world. The market response has been very favorable, and the approval now makes SKYRIZI the only quarterly dosed brand that is available in a single self - injectable pen for patients. Second, we are preparing for the global launch of SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis, as we near approval decisions in both the U.S. and Europe. We received a CHMP positive opinion earlier this month, with anticipated approval in Europe by year-end. And we continue to expect FDA approval early next year. The addition of this indication, once approved, will round out Skyrizi's dermatology label, and give patients with PSA access to a new compelling therapeutic option. We're also making excellent progress with Skyrizi's development in Crohn's disease, which was recently submitted for U.S. regulatory review, with commercialization expected next year. Rinvoq also continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of more than $450 million were up nearly 20% on a sequential basis. Total in-play RA share remains strong and now reflects approximately 17% patient share in the U.S., as well as leadership in a half a dozen key countries around the world. Internationally, RINVOQ share continues to ramp in RA. And we're making excellent progress with the recent commercial launches of PSA, AS and atopic dermatitis, where we have secured strong labels for each of these indications.  As many of you are aware, the FDA issued a safety communication regarding new and updated warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ in early September. While we do not yet have an updated label, we are closely monitoring prescription trends and feedback from the field. And we have not observed a significant impact to RINVOQ utilization at this time. That said, should the updated label restrict to use the TNF inadequate responders, we would certainly expect a near-term impact to new patient starts in RA. Based on the robust data we have generated across our development program against multiple biologics and later lines of RA therapy, we do expect that RINVOQ will ultimately attain higher share growth in the second line-plus setting, as most patients ultimately fail TNF therapies over time. Overall, we continue to feel very good about the performance and profile of RINVOQ and remain confident this asset will be a major contributor to AbbVie's long-term growth.  In Hematologic Oncology, global revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 8.1% on an operational basis. Imbruvica and Venclexta have a strong position across multiple heme -indications, including CLL, where AbbVie's combined portfolio remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Global Imbruvica revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 0.3%. In the U.S., performance continues to be primarily impacted by a slower-than-expected market recovery in CLL, as well as some modest share erosion from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. New patients starts in CLL remain below pre -COVID levels, and it is difficult to predict when this dynamic may fully recover. Venclexta sales were up 38.7% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications, including a strong AML launch trajectory in the international markets.  In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.6 billion up 25% on an operational basis. I'm particularly pleased with the results and outlook for our emerging migraine portfolio, where we are now the only Company to have a portfolio of distinctive therapies to address the spectrum of this common complex and debilitating disease, including Botox Therapeutic, a unique foundational treatment for the prevention of chronic migraine, which is performing very well. Total sales of $645 million for all the Therapeutic Botox uses were up 22.5% on an operational basis. Ubrelvy, our leading oral CGRP treatment for acute migraine is also demonstrating rapid growth. Total sales of a $162 million were up nearly 30% on a sequential basis. Based on Ubrelvy's competitive profile, continued strong new patients starts, and a rapidly expanding market, we remain confident that Ubrelvy represents a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity. And now we're just launching Qulipta, the only oral CGRP specifically developed for the preventative treatment of migraine, which is already off to an excellent start. Early feedback from our physicians has been very positive given QULIPTA 's strong efficacy, safety, and convenient dosing profile relative to the current standards of care. The QULIPTA launch is being supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly through the first half of 2022. QULIPTA also represents a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity.  Now we believe having 3 distinct and competitively positioned therapies across the spectrum of migraine conditions with Botox Therapeutic, UBRELVY and QULIPTA, which each have been optimized for a specific migraine indication, enables physicians to tailor treatment for the broadest range of patients. Our portfolio of migraine therapy puts us in a very strong position to capture growth in this dynamic market. Turning to psychiatry, we also see robust performance with Vraylar, which remains the fastest-growing atypical anti-psychotic. Total revenues of $461 million were up 29% on an operational basis, with continued strong demand across schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar depression. Lastly, in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $871 million up 2.9% on an operational basis. Mavyret sales were $426 million up 2.9% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes still remain suppressed compared to pre -COVID levels. And we saw double-digit growth operationally for both Creon and Lupron. So overall, I'm pleased with our continued execution across the Therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike.
Michael Severino: Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology, where we had several regulatory updates and data readouts for both Rinvoq and Skyrizi across therapeutic areas. Following successful completion of the registrational programs for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis, and Skyrizi in Crohn's disease, we submitted our regulatory applications for each asset in their respected indications. We saw a very strong data for both Rinvoq and Skyrizi as induction and maintenance treatments in UC and Crohn's respectively. And based on these results, we believe both drugs have the potential to become a highly effective, differentiated therapies in these indications. We anticipate approval decisions for both in 2022. Earlier this month, we announced positive top line results from our Phase 3 SELECT-AXIS 2 program for Rinvoq in axial SpA, which included data from 2 standalone studies. One for ankylosing spondylitis patients who had an inadequate response to biologics. And another for patients with non-radiographic axial SpA. In the ankylosing spondylitis biorefractory study, RINVOQ performed very well, demonstrating significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms, as well as physical function and imaging endpoints compared to placebo.  We saw levels of efficacy in this difficult to treat refractory population similar to those more typically observed in bio-naive patients. These results will be added to our submission package for RINVOQ in AS which is currently under review by the FDA. In a non - radiographic axial spot study, RINVOQ also performed very well, meeting the primary and key secondary endpoints. We plan to submit our regulatory applications in this indication later this quarter as well.  RINVOQ's safety profile in these actual spot trials was consistent with previous studies, and there was no evidence for increased risk of DVT, PE, MACE events, or malignancies in either study. Based on the data generated in the select access program, we believe RINVOQ has the potential to improve care for patients suffering from Axial SpondyloArthritis by providing sustained disease control and rapid and durable pain reduction as well as improving function. As you're likely aware, in September, the FDA communicated that they will require new warnings for JAK inhibitors, including RINVOQ and their use will be limited to certain patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate anti - TNFs. We continue to work with the FDA regarding updated labeling language for the RA indication, while simultaneously engaging with the agency on our files for atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. We remain confident in our submission packages for these 3 new indications and continue to expect approvals following completion of the RA label update.  In the area of oncology, we continue to make good progress advancing all stages of our pipeline. We're nearing completion of several indication expansion programs for VENCLEXTA. In our study in previously untreated higher-risk MDS patients, which recently received a breakthrough therapy designation, we expect to make a data cut early next year to include 6-month follow-up data for duration of response. Based on this data cut, we plan to submit our regulatory applications to the FDA in the first half of 2022, for an accelerated approval. We continue to make good progress with Venclexta in the Canova trial, which is evaluating Venclexta in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients with a t(11;14) mutation. VENCLEXTA has shown strong anti - myeloma activity in this biomarker-defined population and if successful, has an opportunity to play an important role in the treatment paradigm for multiple myeloma. We expect a data readout from this event-driven trial next year. In our early to mid-stage hem/onc pipeline, we continue to expand the cohorts in the aducanumab Phase 1 2 studies in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.  And we're evaluating aducanumab as both a monotherapy and in combinations. We expect to see data from both the monotherapy and combo studies next year. And we will discuss the monotherapy data with regulators regarding a file for accelerated approval. We also recently began the dose escalation stage of the Phase 1b studies for [Indiscernible] in AML, MDS and multiple myeloma. And ABBV -383, our BCMA-CD3 bispecific antibody, is currently in the expansion stage of its Phase 1 study in multiple myeloma patients. And we expect to begin registrational phase 3 studies next year. Moving to Neuroscience, where we had several notable pipeline events since our last earnings call. In September, we received FDA approval for Qulipta, the only oral CGRP specifically designed as a preventative treatment for migraine. We're very pleased with the label, which reflects Qulipta a strong benefit risk profile, and is supported by a robust clinical development program. In our registrational program, which evaluated Qulipta in nearly 2,000 patients suffering from episodic migraine, treatment with Qulipta resulted in a significant reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared to placebo. And approximately 60% of patients achieved at least a 50% reduction in the migraine days. We think these data compare favorably to other preventative migraine treatments on the market, and believe our new oral treatment option will be competitively positioned in the prevention market. Our migraine portfolio now includes Ubrelvy for acute treatment of migraine, Qulipta for preventative treatment of episodic migraine, and Botox for preventative treatment of chronic migraine. With this distinct portfolio, AbbVie is uniquely positioned to address the full spectrum of this complex and debilitating disease. This morning, we announced top-line results from two Phase 3 studies evaluating Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. In the 301 study, a 1.5 milligram a day Vraylar dose met the primary endpoint demonstrating a clinically meaningful improvement in total MADRS score compared to placebo at Week 6 with a highly statistically significant p-value of 0.005. In this study, the 3 milligram Vraylar dose did not reach statistical significance, but it did show a clear trend toward improvement with a nominal p-value of approximately 0.073 at Week 6. In the second phase 3 trial, the 302 study, neither Vraylar doses met the primary endpoint of change in total MADRS score at week 6. But both the 1.5 and 3 milligram doses demonstrated clear trends toward a clinically meaningful benefit at weeks 2 and 4, with nominal P values less than 0.05 for a number of comparisons. Additionally, as a reminder, we had 1 prior positive registrational Phase 2B study where Vraylar demonstrated efficacy in MDD when added to ongoing antidepressant treatment. Based on precedent in the field and the totality of the data, we believe we have a viable regulatory pathway for Vraylar as an adjunctive treatment in major depressive disorder. We plan to engage with regulatory agencies to discuss these results and expect to spend our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of next year. We also recently announced positive top-line results from a phase 3 study comparing our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system, ABBV -951 to oral levodopa/carbidopa in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. In this pivotal study, treatment with 951 resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in on time without troublesome dyskinesia, as well as similar improvements in normalized off time compared to oral Levodopa or Carbidopa. We're very pleased with these results, which we believe support our view that 951 has the potential to become a transformative improvement to current treatment options for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We plan to submit our regulatory application next year with approval decisions anticipated in the U.S. and Europe in early 2023. And in Eye Care, we announced the partnership with REGENXBIO to develop and commercialize RGX -314, a potential gene therapy for the treatment of wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy, and other chronic retinal diseases. RGX-314 is a very attractive addition to our pipeline, and complements our Eye Care portfolio with a potential flagship product in retinal disease. REGENXBIO recently presented initial data from 2 Phase 2 studies evaluating RGX -314 in wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy, using in-office suprachoroidal delivering. While early, these results are encouraging, with RGX -314 demonstrating efficacy at the lowest dose. And the study showing that the drug and delivery method both appear to be well tolerated. Also, in eye care, we continue to expect approval for [Viewty] (ph) shortly, formerly known as AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with Presbyopia. This once-daily eye-drop was developed to help address presbyopia that is often corrected through reading glasses. And once approved via convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild-to-moderate presbyopia who may not want to wear reading glasses. This has been a very productive year thus far for our R&D organization, and we anticipate several additional milestones in the coming months. We expect this momentum to continue into next year, which is looking to be a milestone filled year for AbbVie as well. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob.
Rob Michael: Thank you, Mike. As you have heard from Rick, Jeff, and Mike, we once again delivered outstanding performance this quarter, while also advancing our strategic priorities. Our results demonstrate the strong momentum of the business, and support AbbVie's long-term financial outlook. Turning to third quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.33 up 17.7% compared to prior year, and $0.13 above our guidance midpoint. This includes $0.05 from accelerated synergies, and $0.03 from mark-to-market equity gains. Total adjusted net revenues were $14.3 billion, up 10.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51.1% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 20.6% of sales. Net interest expense was $585 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6% as Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.63 and $12.67 reflecting growth of 19.8% at the midpoint.  Excluded from this guidance is $6.34 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance continues to contemplate full-year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange at a 0.7% favorable impact on full-year comparable sales growth. This implies a full-year revenue forecast of approximately $56.2 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full-year assumptions. We now expect Aesthetics global revenue of approximately $5.1 billion. We now expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $3.3 billion. For IMBRUVICA, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion, reflecting slower recovery of the CLL market. For Mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. And we now expect Allergan expense synergies of approximately $1.8 billion. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $15 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.24 and $3.28, excluding approximately $1.14 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $17 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year, and our cash balance at the end of September was $12 billion Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we announce an 8.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2022. And we remain on track to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paydown by the end of this year, with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.3 times by the end of 2021, and approximately 2 times by the end of 2022. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I will turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we'll take the first question.
Operator: Thank you Ms. Shea. Our first question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Your line is open, sir.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. Rick, I guess I'll jump in with the big one that I think is still the overhang for the stock, which is the RINVOQ outlook. You have $15 billion out there for 2025 in combined SKYRIZI, RINVOQ forecast guidance. And I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of the puts and takes. SKYRIZI doing really well but some overhangs for RINVOQ. Is that $15 billion still achievable, do you think you're trending above that, or do you have to make up a shortfall. Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Geoffrey, this is Rick. It's a great question. What I'd say is the following: If I look at SKYRIZI, I would say that SKYRIZI performance is very, very impressive. Jeff outlined what the in-play share is and what the total TRxs are and it's very close to the passing HUMIRA now, which in this short period of time is frankly a surprise, how quickly it has ramped. I think that's a very positive case. If I look at RINVOQ, actually the in-place share looks very good. Now, we would expect if the label gets changed and restricts the label to behind TNFs, that that will have some impact on the front line patients -- the naïve patients that we're capturing now. And so we will see that impact. Having said that, I would say that when I look at RINVOQ's performance overall and how durable it's been throughout this situation, we'll obviously shift more towards second line patients and beyond, which was originally in the plan, but the emphasis would have occurred a year or 2 later than this, where we would have driven that. We have very good data to be able to support that.  The other thing I'd say is if you look at the indications that we have coming out for these two assets, we have AD, which is a very significant opportunity for us. We have PSA and is a very significant opportunity. But next year we have the IVD indications that are coming out. And I'd say there, when we gave the $15 billion forecast, the performance that was in our TPP or our target product profile that we had assumed, we have outperformed that in the clinical trials that we've submitted. And so I think that's a very significant opportunity for us, and a significant opportunity for us to outperform. Having said all of that, we don't want to reconfirm the guidance yet. We want to see what the final label looks like from the agency. And then we'll be in a position, I think, to come out and tell the investor community exactly what we think. The only other thing I'd say is, I think if you go back 5, 6 years ago, what we're trying to accomplish with the Company, we were basically trying to accomplish with the Company, build a set of assets that could ultimately significantly replace HUMIRA in the marketplace and be superior to HUMIRA. These 2 assets already are at $5 billion and growing very rapidly. So I think everything I know about these 2 assets, they'll be able to do exactly what we expect of them. Even in the most negative outcome from a label standpoint that we would expect. Second thing is we built a significant heme/onc portfolio, that when I look at the pipeline behind IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA I think there's a significant opportunity to drive significant growth in that portfolio. And then with the Allergan acquisition, I couldn't be more pleased. Aesthetics franchise is performing at an outstanding level, the neuroscience franchise is performing an outstanding level. I think migraine is a very significant opportunity for us to be able to drive, and eye care is another one. And so we now have multiple assets, and multiple portfolios to be able to drive the growth. And our goal is still what we described to the analysts early on, we expect to see the impact of the LOE on Humira in '23, and immediately be able to grow beyond that starting in '24, return to growth, sales growth at that point. And regardless of what happens with RINVOQ'S label, I have a high-level of confidence we can continue to do that. Rob, anything you’d add?
Rob Michael: I would just add that obviously with the confidence we have and the dividend increase we announced today, we feel very strong about the long-term outlook. We haven't backed off on the high single-digit growth on 25 and beyond. You look at the portfolio we've assembled, you look at the assets we have today, you look at our pipeline, you look at the BD work we've been doing over the last couple of years, that was some nice licensing deals and we still feel very confident in the outlook for this business.
Geoffrey Porges: Great. Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks Geoffrey. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open sir.
Andrew Baum: Yes, thank you. Can you flip back to the other side of RINVOQ, SKYRIZI and just talk HUMIRA. Could you talk to your comfort level with where consensus currently has HUMIRA pegged and the anticipated scale and scope of the erosion? And then second, in relation to your ongoing Alvotech pending court case, could you just confirm whether if they prevail that would effectively invalidate the signed settlements with the other biosimilar players, meaning that you would have a number of players coming that much quicker onto the market with anticipated pricing volume impact. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Andrew, this is Rick. So I will cover the second one, the Alvotech one. I'm going to have Rob cover the first one.
Rob Michael: We've seen movement in terms of consensus numbers since we've given just some direction on how to model it. I think right now, consensus in '23 sell-side consensus has about 41% erosion in the U.S. in '23. And we've said, think about it in terms of 45% based on what we saw in Europe in year 1, plus or minus 10% given the differences in the payer landscape in the U.S. versus other markets. So we have seen the Humira consensus move. Today, it's at 41%, so it's a lot closer than it was a year ago.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay, Andrew, this is Rick. I'll cover the Alvotech situation. As you know, we're in litigation with Alvotech. I think it's important to understand the nuances behind that litigation. In this first set of litigation, this first wave of litigation, we are basically applying 10 patents in HUMIRA. And as you know, we have a very robust patent portfolio around HUMIRA, but these 10 patents are both formulation patents and indication patents. Many of these patents were challenged through the IPR process and upheld by the patent office. I'll give you some idea of the strength of these patents. The first thing I'd say to you is, we have a high level of confidence that we will prevail in this litigation. There will be a second wave of litigation that occurs after that, which will bring into the portfolio the rest of the patents that we think Alvotech infringes. So there could be another phase of litigation that occurs after this one, but I can tell you we're highly confident that we will prevail in this first set of litigation based on the strength of those patents. To specifically answer your question, if they were to prevail, which I don't believe they will, then it would accelerate the other patent settlements. Yes, that is correct.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Andrew. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. It comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir.
Chris Schott: All right, great, thanks so much. Just one quick follow-up on RINVOQ and the upcoming indications. I guess do you see a scenario where you are unable to get the drug approved in these pending indications particularly AD over the next few months, or is your review based on all the interactions, etc. that this is largely, I guess, a label and maybe a line of therapy discussion and decision with the agency? And my second question was on Botox aesthetics, a very healthy growth we're seeing here, we're now coming up against even some more normalized comps and you're still seeing the growth rate very, very healthy. Just -- are we still seeing catch-up usage in this, or is this just really underlying demand at this point. And just a little bit more color about just how you're thinking about the near-term growth trajectory. I know you talked about high single-digits over time, but just as you maybe look out to 22-23, could this remain a mid-teens type of growth rate product over that window. Thanks so much.
Rick Gonzalez: Mike.
Michael Severino: Okay. Thanks, Chris. This is Mike. I will take the first one, and then Rick will take the second part of your question. With respect to RINVOQ in the 3 new indications. So psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. We remain very confident in those files, and we remain very confident in approval decisions. The gating factor here is really getting to the specifics of the language around RA, which is a process that is well underway. And we would expect to be in a position to gain approvals after that is completed. And again, we hope that's completed in the near future, certainly this year. The psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings, we would expect to follow fairly closely on the heels of that RA decision for ankylosing spondylitis. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we rolled in a new study, which is a positive study and a very strong study in ankylosing spondylitis into that submission. And so that one might be on a slightly different time-frame, but we remain very confident in that approval as well.
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick. On Botox, I think one of the things when we first went through the integration process that was compelling to us was the amount of penetration in these markets and Allergan's ability to be able to reach out and touch consumers and activate those consumers. And that's part of what drove our decision globally to go with this fully integrated, totally dedicated Aesthetics organization.  Because in many other markets around the world, although the data is not quite as good as it is here in the U.S., but in China as an example you see is very similar kinds of dynamics. And so focusing that team purely on Aesthetics was part of the effort here to be able to drive accelerated growth. The second was, when we looked at the ability to be able to use various methods to be able to activate consumers. We believe that the business was being underfunded in a way, both in the way it was being funded and the total amount that was being funded. And so we did some early work to determine whether or not that funding could drive incremental market growth, and it showed a positive result. And then when we saw that, we applied significantly greater funding to it. And what you're actually seeing now, I think, is we are driving the market. We're bringing more patients into the category, and obviously because we have the leadership position from a market share standpoint, we get the vast majority of those patients. Is there still some pent-up demand? I would tell you it's hard to believe at this point that there can be a lot of it, but there has to be some of it. Remember those practices reopened in the U.S. in the summer of 2020. That's a long time to have pent-up demand, but it's impossible to tell one way or another. I would say the majority of it is certainly being driven by us activating patients and retaining more patients. One of the other things we saw was the retention rate was relatively low once you activated a patient. And so we spent some time working with the team to figure out how could you retain those patients at a higher rate, meaning they repeat their procedures. They don't just do it once and then disappear, but they come back for a second procedure or plus going to fillers as an example. So the data is very clear. If you look at the U.S. as an example, toxins and fillers are growing high 30% of the market. We're growing at about the same rate, maybe a little bit lower on fillers but about that rate on toxins. When we look at globally, the overall brands are growing at about that rate. And so, I think this is a business that is sustainable over the long term. When we say across the decade high single-digits, obviously, if we keep this growth rates. The business is getting bigger and bigger. So therefore, the percentage will come down a bit. But I'd tell you, I'm very optimistic about this market, and our ability to be able to bring new assets into this market. They can change the standard of care going forward and us being able to drive market growth at the same time. It's a very good business.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. That comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.
Tim Anderson: Thank you. I wanted to ask a question on HUMIRA in 2023, I'm just really trying to nail down what's in that erosion guidance of 45% plus or minus 10. That's sales erosion, not volume, correct? I'm trying to think through what happens to the U.S. rebate stream in 2023, which is likely in the billions of dollars. Do you think you'll retain favorable formulae positioning even with biosimilars, in which case you keep paying that rebate, but you also would have less volume loss, or do you think it becomes disadvantage on formulary, in which case you pull back those billions of dollars in rebates, and that flows through the bottom-line. To me, I just wonder if your guidance on aversion is frankly too conservative or, I should say too aggressive because those rebate dynamics in the U.S., they make us a more durable market than ex-U.S. for those rebate dynamics don't exist.
Rick Gonzalez: Tim, this is Rick, maybe Rob and I will tag team this one. I'll start. I think the guidance we laid out of 45% or 48%, whichever is the latest number plus or -10%, is still guidance that we feel pretty comfortable with. To your point about, is the bulk of it priced? It is. Even if you look at the international market it's about 1/3, 2/3, or maybe slightly higher than that. I mean, 2/3 of its price, 1/3 of it is volume. And I would expect that we will maintain a significant part of the volume. Obviously, we don't talk publicly about what our manage care strategy is, but what I would tell you is we're close enough now to that 23 time-frame that you would expect us to be starting the work to ensure formulary access on all of our products, and certainly HUMIRA is one of those for 2023. And I think it is logical to assume that we will maintain that formulary position. And we've been pretty effective at doing that historically, so I believe will be pretty effective at doing it again. Rob, anything you want to add?
Rob Michael: Just as a reminder. I mean, so we gave that and we're using Europe as an analog, but keep in mind that the U.S. system is very, very different. This is why we gave you a range. And so as we get closer to '23, obviously we'll give more specific guidance on the U.S. But we are communicating as more directional information based on the experience we saw with Europe. Keep in mind there were 4 biosimilars that came in the market at that time, and there will be more biosimilars coming to the U.S. markets. So there's a different level of competitive intensity, but also it's a very different payer landscape. So it's something to keep in mind.
Tim Anderson: Okay. Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Tim. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. It comes from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.
Gary Nachman: Thanks. Good morning. A couple on neuro that had some recent wins. So first on Vraylar the Phase 2 studies and MDD. In 1 study, you hit on the 1.5 milligram dose, but not the 3 milligram dose, it was close, but not statistically significant. Will that matter to the FDA, maybe you could remind us what those who sit in the previous Phase 3. And now that you have the full dataset, how do you think Vraylar will stack up competitively at the NDD space? And then just quickly on migrating, a little bit more how the initial launch has gone to lift, and how has that been rolled in to the Botox in UBRELVY offering, and just your confidence about the reimbursement you said going into the first half of next year. Thanks.
Michael Severino: Okay. This is Mike. I'll take the first part of your question, and then Jeff will take the second part of your of your question. With respect to Vraylar MDD, in the study that you described the 1.5 milligram dose medicine point and met it with a highly statistically significant P-value of 0.005, so 0005. And that's important in terms of strength of evidence overall and weight of evidence overall. And then as you point out, in the 3 milligram arm in that same study, we didn't hit significance, but we had a P-value that was very small.  The nominal P-value is 0.073, if we around. When you look at that overall study to RA clearly shows an effect in NDD. Now, the second Phase 3 study that we just read out did not reach statistical significance for either dose group, but there were favorable trends and across a number of comparisons, there were nominal p-values that were quite small and many of them were out lower than 0.05. And I'll just remind the listeners that it's very common in depression studies, even with classes of medicines that have firmly established efficacy to have some study that read out positive and some studies that are negative. And so we think that overall package that we announced today is very strong. And it's also important to keep in mind that we did have a prior study that was conducted several years ago that was also positive that demonstrated a statistically significant effect. And that study -- look at different dosing, there were dose ranges that were studied in that trial with titration.  It was the upper 2 of the dose ranges that was significant, but it did show both a clinically meaningful and significant benefit. So we have 2 positive studies and that's important because the way these studies are typically looked at is an overall weight of evidence, do you have a convincingly positive phase 3 study? And is there other evidence within the overall data package that is supportive and we feel comfortable that that is the case here.  And lastly, what I'd say is, if you look at the precedent, and you look at other approvals, findings like the ones that we described on not a long time, and, in fact, that's the very common amongst approved agents in this space, including some of the more recent approvals in adjunctive NDD like resulting. So overall we think it is a strong package that has a viable regulatory pathway. And we will stack up very nicely to competitors. So we're going to begin those regulatory discussions shortly. So without I'll turn it over to Jeff.
Jeff Stewart: Yeah, thank you, Mike. Look, it's a meaningful opportunity for sure. When we look at the market sizes, about 60 million total prescriptions for the adjunctive MDD market. And that's very similar to the bipolar market that we operate in now, so it's a very meaningful opportunity for us. If you think about the -- what Mike was saying in terms of the competitive profile, I think we have to remember that while it's got a fairly low share, the -- Vraylar is very attractive, which is why it's the fasting growing agent. So the efficacy is viewed very, very nicely overall, and I think that if approved, this also has competitive efficacy of very gentle metabolic profile, minimal weight gain, very tolerable, and also very simple dosing for the psychiatrists and the primary care doctors that look at this. So when you start to see the potential for an agent like Vraylar that's got the full spectrum across bipolar disease in terms of mania, mixed episodes and depression. And then the adjunctive depression indication, if approved, it will be very attractive. So we anticipate a nice catalyst here and certainly a nice add to Vraylar's overall profile.
Gary Nachman: If you want to cover the second question.
Jeff Stewart: Yeah. Perfect. The second question you had was QULIPTA. And QULIPTA, its very early, we just introduced the product with our full commercial promotion. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have now as of this quarter, a dedicated migraine sales force which shows you how important we think that this franchise is and what we can do with this franchise. So we have an entire sales team out there that is launching QULIPTA and now also focused on UBRELVY. And the early feedback has been very strong. What we hear qualitatively from our field and certainly from our research in the first few weeks of launch is, first, the simplicity and strength of QULIPTA for prevention.  We see very, very nice response to our efficacy data, which is -- Mike has said before, and I've said before is on the very high end of preventative performance. So 60% of patients in our trials achieved greater than 50% reduction in migraine days, which is viewed as very significant. And almost 30% have a complete control. A 100% decrease in their migraine days. That's very compelling in terms of this Qulipta power. Also, physicians like the simple, everyday dosing, once a day.  And so things are quite strong in terms of our early qualitative feedback. So we do obviously anticipate that the majority of our prescriptions will be bridged prescriptions until are -- we get the full ramp of our market access, which as I mentioned, we're quite confident by the first half of the year, we should ramp similar to Ubrelvy, where ultimately, as you remember, we achieved about a 90% access in the U.S. So quite good early feedback on the launch, and again we think that the 3 assets together are unique competitive positioning for AbbVie.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Gary. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, sir.
Matthew Harrison: Great, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two for me. 1. If I could just follow up on CGRP, I'm curious, obviously, you have a different strategy than your competitor when it comes to the prophylactic market. I'm just wondering how you think where your source of the patients are going to come from. Are you expecting more transitions from injectables or do you think they're going to be more de novo patients, and if you could just talk about that a little bit. And then secondly, on REGENXBIO, could you just talk about your confidence in the data there. Obviously there was some inflammation there though it did seem self-limiting. I'm just curious how you think about that impacting the profile, because obviously in other gene therapy products in the eye inflammation has sometimes proven to be pretty significant as a long-term sequelae. Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Jeff lunge.
Jeff Stewart: Yeah, I'll take the first one, thanks. So in terms of the source of business, we think that QULIPTA is going to source business from 2 primary areas. First is, the big headache specialists, the big neurologists. We think absolutely from our research and feedback that you'll start to see an early trade-off of the injectable MABS in favor of the orals and certainly in favor of QULIPTA. I think that this is viewed as very attractive. In many cases, some people have spontaneously highlighted wow it looks like a very strong MAB in a single oral pill. So that's a source of business in terms of market share trade-off. I think the other insight that we have from the market is that we are going to a -- calling on a substantial amount of high prescribing primary care physicians who don't write a lot of MABS, but they certainly write a lot of generic topiramate and some other older agents. And so we also see that we have a unique opportunity in a wider audience to source from physicians that really don't lean towards the MABS because of the injectable nature of those, etc. So we think we're going to have a good balance between those two sources of business and that's quite attractive for us right now.
Michael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take the question regarding REGENX. We're very encouraged by the recent data. If we take a step back and look at the program overall, they have very strong efficacy data already demonstrated with sub-retinal delivery and that's in a lot of procedure. But it gives us clear proof-of-concept for the approach, and shows that we can get durable control. And that component of the program is already in Phase 3. And then the more recent data that were presented just about a month ago, several weeks ago, looked at suprachoroidal delivery. So that is a delivery method that can be done in-office. It's a specialized form of injection, but it is a form of injection. And that is also showing very good promise. We're already seeing signs of efficacy in the first cohort, which is the lowest dose cohort, which quite frankly is sooner than we expected to see them before that study had started to deliver results. And the tolerability is very good. If one looks at the inflammation that has reported in the [Indiscernible] trials, it's very different in its nature and its [Indiscernible] than that, that has been seen with other agents. It's principally anterior, chamber is exclusively anterior chamber, there's no vasculitis, no more significant inflammation.  It is readily treated with topical steroids, and generally resolves without any difficulty, and in fact, quite rapidly. And it's also important to remember that there's no prophylactic steroids being used here. Other approaches have required that. So these are patients who have no prophylaxis upfront in responding to what's often a brief course of topical steroids. And the reason why there's no prophylactic steroids, given as they're just not felt to be needed given the very mild nature of the inflammation that's being observed. So we're very confident with it. And again, we feel it's qualitatively very different than what has been seen in other agents. And we've obviously talked to retinal specialists as well who are quite familiar with the program, and the views we've heard from them are supportive of what I just described.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Matthew. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open, sir.
Steve Scala: Thank you. I have a few questions, a couple of follow-ups. How would you describe the nature and the tone of conversations with FDA regarding RINVOQ's new label in RA, would you say you're pleased with how things are going, is the outcome unclear to AbbVie at this juncture, or is the outcome obvious sending in line with what the FDA had an it's statement in September? That's the first question. Second question: To my knowledge, Vraylar has shown superiority to placebo but not generics in MDD. How would AbbVie establish it as a leading MDD agent given the presence of lower cost alternatives? And then lastly, any thoughts on Soliton acquisition relative to its closing? Thank you.
Michael Severino: Okay. This is Mike. I'll start And then Rick will take the question regarding Soliton. With respect to the tone of conversations with the FDA for RINVOQ, I would describe them as productive. With respect to your question specifically about the RA label, those discussions are productive as well. I would assume the base case is what they announced conceptually back in early September, but we are working through the specifics of how that translates into labeling language. And I would characterize the discussions around the other indications as being very productive and very positive as well. And so as I mentioned earlier in this call, we remain very confident in the files for those new indications for all three of them. With respect to Vraylar, head-to-head superiority studies are not typically done in this space. They are very challenging. It is challenging to show an impact even with established classes period in major depressive disorder and particularly in this space, because this is the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. So these are patients who aren't responding to the current therapies, and require an add-on and atypical antipsychotics with pharmacology similar to Vraylar, our one of the most commonly used agents in this space. So we think the very strong data that we have from the study that we described, and the fact that we have prior supportive evidence as well from the earlier study, will position it very well to be competitive in that marketplace.
Jeff Stewart: And Steve, it's Jeff. Just to build on Mike's point, if you think about the size of Vraylar now approaching $1.8 billion it has a 2.5 share in terms of the anti-psychotic market. It's a low share, high-value in growth area. When you think about most of our business is already stepped through in some cases one or two of the generics. The problem is that these patients are so fragile, they just don't respond well. We would still anticipate that with the new approval for MDD, you're still going to have step therapy and other approaches in the marketplace, but there is still a very nice commercial opportunity. That's just the way the markets work today.
Steve Scala: Alright, thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: So this is Rick, Steve. On Soliton, as you know, we obviously announced the -- our intention to acquire the Company and submitted it for approval. We did receive a second request. Maybe just to frame a bit why we're interested in this area. We tend to look at this market where the third major leg of the stool in a stage is body contouring. And this is a good fit with CoolSculpting, and CoolTones. Obviously, CoolSculpting is focused more on reduction of fat in targeted areas, and CoolTones more focused on the area of enhancing muscle tone in specific areas.  This particular asset is designed to reduce cellulite. We don't have a position in cellulite now so there's not any kind of competitive overlap in that area. Having said that, we are responding to the FTC's inquiry. We believe that's going reasonably well, so we would expect this to be resolved at some point here in the future. I can't tell you a specific date, but I would expect it to have a positive outcome over a period of time here.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thank, you, Steve. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Vamil Divan: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. So just maybe 1 more just on Vraylar following up on the other comments. I think before you talked about it being as maybe sort of multi-billion-dollar type opportunity in MDD. Is that still the lines you're thinking now that you've seen the data that you've disclosed today? And then the second one, just going back to RINVOQ and obvious sounds like you're still pretty confident on that products outlook. But I'm just curious if that's changed any of your priorities hitting about business development, specifically in immunology? The need for maybe look at other oral agents that might be in development there, just so how you're thinking about the broader BD landscape there. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Yes, Jeff.
Jeff Stewart: Yeah. I think if you look at the -- as I highlighted, that the market sizes are roughly the same. However, the competitive context is quite a bit different and the competitive set is a little bit different. So we view it again as an important incremental opportunity that even with low incremental share, that we can drive Vraylar to the -- that multibillion dollar guidance that we look at it. We do think it's an incremental catalyst, and an exciting approach if it were to be approved.
Michael Severino: So this is Mike. I'll take the Rinvoq question. So as you pointed out, yes, we are very confident in Rinvoq as a molecule overall. We've talked about the progress on the RA indication, and our confidence in the new indications, both those that are under review. And indications where we have data, but have not yet submitted like the IBD indications. And so we feel that it's going to be an important part of our portfolio, and the treatment armamentarium going forward. So having said that, immunology is always an area where we are scouring the landscape to look for the best opportunities.  So I wouldn't say it's changed our focus in any way or changed our approach, but we will continue to look for novel therapies that can raise the bar on the standard of care. Across a number of areas, the current indications where we are already playing and new indications that have fewer treatment options, areas like lupus and scleroderma. So the RINVOQ situation has not changed that strategy in anyway.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. It's from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open, sir.
Ronny Gal: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I've got a clarification and then a couple of questions. First, Rick, you mentioned regarding Alphatec about the acceleration clauses. And I just want to clarify if this is on District Court decision or appeal, given the timing it actually makes quite a bit of difference. Then the two questions I have first are interchangeability for HUMIRA. Do you think this will matter in the marketplace? We are hearing different things from the large payers. What is your take here and what is going to be AbbVie's position about this? And the second question is, the last draft we've seen from this year regarding the infrastructure bill does not include a reduction of out-of-pocket costs in Medicare. We're still hearing from context, this still might be the case if it's still included. If you can comment on this issue, do you expect it to be included, and the impact it might have on AbbVie's business.
Rick Gonzalez: So Ronny, this is Rick. On Alvotech, obviously these agreements that we have with the other biosimilar players are confidential, I'm not going to delve into some of the specifics around those. What I can tell you is what I said before. I mean, we are highly confident in our position with this IP. This IP has been challenged multiple times and we have a high degree of confidence that we will prevail.  So I think it's obviously a hypothetical scenario, but I don't -- I wouldn't give it a lot of merit. Second on interchangeable HUMIRA s as we've discussed previously, when we built the erosion model that we described a couple of years ago, or certainly a year-and-a-half or so ago, we did assume at that point that they were going to be 2 interchangeable biosimilars. It does matter from a pricing standpoint to some extent. So I think it will have an impact but it's consistent with what we had assumed. And so we've essentially taken that into consideration in the forecast that we provided you, and the estimates that we provided you. On drug pricing in the U.S., I would say it's a very fluid situation. It's a little difficult to truly understand exactly where we are. You are correct, if you look at this framework that came out yesterday [Indiscernible] talked about repeal of the rebate rule being eliminated. And it didn't talk about much else. Look, the things that we're focused on and things that we think would make a difference on our out-of-pocket costs for patients, and making them lower for Medicare patients, making them something that they can spread over a period of time -- a 12-month period of time to make the cash flow easier to deal with. And as we've said before, we think industry will play a role in that as one of the participants. And we would hope that we will get back to that, because I think -- we think that is the most fundamental issue is reducing the out-of-pocket costs for these patients.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Ronny. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.
Geoff Meacham: Great. Hey guys. Thanks so much for the question. I just have 2 quick ones, and probably for Mike. The follow-up on Rinvoq. I know it's been asked a lot, but you have a number of labeling scenarios that could play out just with respect to dose, or TNF requirement, or language on black box, or any maybe -- any limit on duration. Is there one of those items that has more of an impact than the others. I'm just trying to think about what informs your assumptions. The second question on cystic fibrosis. When you look to the upcoming proof-of-concept data readout, is there a minimal effect size, or profile that you're looking for that would justify moving to a larger scale Phase 3. Thanks so much.
Michael Severino: I will take the RINVOQ question first and then make some comments on CF. What I would say about RINVOQ is our assumptions around the labeling at a base case are based on what the agency announced in their safety communication in September. That principally updates to the black box warnings that all of these agents have in fact all agents in immunology have some degree of this. They treat similar conditions to RINVOQ, for example, the TNS have some of the same but not all of the same warnings. Updating that section label is part of our base case and then the restriction that the agency described for certain patients around TNF inadequate response forms our base case. And those are the two factors that we're considering. We would not anticipate any limit into ration of therapy, for example. And the question those principally applies to the atopic dermatitis file, because we have just a single dose in the other files, in the files that are in the rheumatology space. And we feel confident about both doses in terms of the benefit risk that we've demonstrated in that atopic dermatitis program. It's really those two dimensions and how those translate into specific language in RA. And then of course, how they translate to the other indications, because TNFs are not the standard of care in all indications, they are not used in atopic dermatitis. So then it's how do those concepts get translated into the label in other indications. Those are the principal dimensions that we're looking at when we think about those programs. And again, we feel very confident in the files that we've put forward, and feel very good about how discussions have gone to date. With respect to CF and what we're looking for, we're looking for something that has demonstrated benefit compared to what's already out there, what will be out there at the time our agents come to market. Obviously the principal competitor, the only group with a marketed product right now in this space is Vertex so that's what we would be benchmark ourselves against.  I would say at an absolute minimum, you'd have to have efficacy that was just as good with other meaningful advantages. But what we're striving for is something that has an efficacy advantage of a small number of absolute FEV1 points. A small number of absolute FEV1 points might not sound like much, but it can translate into real benefit for patients in this disease.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Jeff. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open, ma'am.
Luisa Hector: Thank you. Good morning. And sorry. I still have a couple more on RINVOQ. I just wanted to understand whether the label updates in RA and then the approvals in the new indications can essentially all happen on the same day? Or is the gating item the RA update? And then there's still a bit more work to be done for the new indications. And then looking on to the UC filing. Is the acceptance of that filing in any way dependent on the RA label being resolved first or that's free to be accepted as a filing while the label update is still outstanding? Thank you.
Michael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take those 2 questions. So with respect to the ongoing reviews, what I would say is the discussions around the RA label update, and the new indications that are under our review are going on simultaneously. And there is some level of interdependence. In other words, we need to understand where the RA label will land, because some of those elements, like the warnings and precautions, will translate over to the other indications because in the U.S. you get 1 label for the molecule that applies across all of the indications. So there's some interdependency, that's why getting the RA label update resolved is a gating factor. Whether it could happen on the same day or in close succession, I think it's too early to call with that fine level of detail, but we would expect the psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis filings to follow in a very reasonable time-frame after that label update. As I mentioned, we're adding new data to the ankylosing spondylitis submission, which is the smallest of the three indications. And so that one might be on a slightly different time-frame as the agency reviews those new data. With respect to the SEC filings, the RA label update is not on critical path to file acceptance. What the agency looks at when they look at file acceptance is, have you provided sufficient data for them to evaluate the file, is it in an appropriate format that they can review, are there any significant deficiencies. And of course, we're very confident in the file that we've submitted, so we would not in any way anticipate any challenges there. And the RA safety label update is not a gating factor for that file acceptance.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Luisa. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Allie Braculon: Hi, good morning. This is Allie Braculon for Chris. Thanks for taking the question. So on ABBV -951 and Parkinson's, we're just hoping you could put some of those safety findings from the Phase 3 trial in context, particularly the imbalance in hallucination psychosis and the 22%, I think, treatment discontinuation rate. Basically, just how did that safety profile stack up against your expectations and how could this translate into real-world use of 951. Thanks.
Michael Severino: So this is Mike. I'll take that question. With respect to the data for 951, we're very pleased with the data. There is very strong efficacy, and the safety is within our expectations, it matches our expectations across essentially all important areas. What's important to keep in mind is this agent delivers transformative benefit to patients who have extremely difficult to control Parkinson's disease through other measures, and to have a very, very difficult time controlling their disease. For example, with orals or with other approaches. And so the overall picture has to be looked at in that context. With respect to treatment discontinuations, what I would say is the treatment discontinuations, The rate of that overall is very similar to what you see with similar devices with insulin pump like devices used across a range of conditions. Most of these were driven by either local tolerability issues like injection site reactions, which were principally erythema or technical usability issues because these are older patient populations with limited mobility and dexterity in many cases, and there's always a subset of patients who find that they have difficulty using any device under those circumstances. Again, those rates of discontinuation are very similar to what you see with similar insulin pump-like devices. And keep in mind this is a very, very large population. This advanced Parkinson's population, only a very small proportion of which currently get advanced treatments because it's so limited in how that can be delivered. We think there's a big opportunity here and that treatment discontinuation rate doesn't change that and is in line with our expectations. With respect to hallucinations. We know that that is on mechanism. Or Levodopa and Carbidopa and it's essentially evidenced that we are delivering Levodopa and Carbidopa in a way that's more effective than can be done through other methods. And it's something that can be titrated and something that can be managed. And what I would point to is in the other direction. The oral group, the control group that got oral Levodopa and Carbidopa had more falls. And that to our eye shows a lower degree of control, which matches the clinical efficacy data, because we know falls are common in Parkinson's disease patients. So we need to keep that in mind. And with the efficacy that we've delivered, we think these are all very attractive profiles and ones that will translate into significant real-world use. When we look at how this will impact overall use, again and keep in mind that the very broad population, only a very small segment which can access the therapies that they need to control their disease. Therapies like DUOPA, which is transformative, that takes us surgical gastric tube actually threaded into the small bow to get deep brain stimulation and other types of measures. This is a much less invasive approach that delivers very strong efficacy and we think that will translate very, very effectively into the real world.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Allie. Operator, we have time for 1 final question.
Operator: That will come from Josh Schimmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.
Josh Schimmer: Thanks for squeezing me in. Can you talk about the current contracting season with payers for Humira, and whether you think you'll be able to lock in multi-year contracts either now to extend to 2023, or next year to extend to 2024. And then I'm surprised you're not more bullish with your guidance for the migraine franchise, given the strong trajectory it's on already. Any reason to think there's going to be a significant plateau in the years ahead. Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. So typically, when -- we start to negotiate with the payers in the spring of the year for the following year. And typically those contracts can be multiyear contracts, maybe 2-year contract. So really that's the season where we'll have as Rob and Rick said, we'll have probably some more guidance over how things are shaping up for '23 and possibly '24 depending on the posture of the payers and how those things work out. So we're not quite there yet. I think that what I can say is we're quite confident based on the timing that I described in terms of general cycles, in terms of where we're going to be for our portfolio certainly in '22. In terms of QULIPTA, look, we are off to a very good start.  I can tell you that UBRELVY continues to run a pace, that total oral CGRP market is upwards of maybe 18% of new prescriptions. And it's still early and that would be us and neurotech in the acute segment. And at a theoretical peak level, you could see maybe 30% or 40% based on cardiovascular issues with Triptan's or some other issues. But we still have clear -- clearly some runway to go. It's probably a little early to sort of determine how that preventative segment will really grow because you've only seen really the MABS so far.  They certainly tripled the market size. How will both of these orals and particularly in oral like QULIPTA in terms of the market development run a pace? It's encouraging for sure, particularly, if you have all 3 of these agents in the market and the investment behind it. Right now though we feel quite comfortable with the billion-dollar opportunity for both of the orals.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Josh. And that concludes today's conference call. If you would like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors. abbVie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great rest of your day.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AbbVie's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma’am, you may proceed.
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for Allergan. For this comparison of underlying performance all historically reported Allergan revenues has been recast to conform to AbbVie’s revenue recognition accounting policies, and exclude the divestitures Zenpep and Viokace. References to operational growth further exclude the impact of exchange. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our second quarter performance and outlook. And then Jeff, Mike and Rob will do our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. AbbVie delivered another excellent quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $3.11, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04. Total adjusted net revenues of nearly $14 billion were up 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, approximately $375 million ahead of our expectations. These results demonstrate our strong and balanced performance across each of our major growth franchises, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, hem/onc, neuroscience and aesthetics. Looking at the most recent trends, the vast majority of our portfolio is well into the recovery phase from the pandemic. In immunology, we continue to see strong recovery across the room, derm and gastro segments with positive trends across all key indicators, including new patient starts. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ continue to ramp nicely in their initial indications, with both products demonstrating robust double-digit sequential revenue growth. In neuroscience, Vraylar is demonstrating strong new prescription volume in the atypical antipsychotic market and the launch of Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine continues to exceed our expectations. Aesthetics continues to perform well above pre-COVID levels exceeding our internal expectations. We're pleased with the rapid market growth in both toxins and fillers, driven by our increased promotional resources globally, brand strength and COVID-related pent-up demand. Rapid global market demand is expected to remain well above historical levels in the near to medium-term and we are raising our full year guidance once again for aesthetics. While the recovery across the AbbVie portfolio is going very well in aggregate, in certain disease areas like CLL and HCV, we continue to see a residual impact from the pandemic. We expect these specialty areas to further recover as the year progresses. One of AbbVie’s greatest strengths is the dedication and engagement of our people. Across AbbVie, the majority of our employees have safely returned to the workplace. And our field teams are now predominantly conducting live engagements with physicians and customers, where protocols and guidelines permit. I'm extremely proud of the teamwork and collaboration our people have demonstrated throughout this pandemic, to bring our medicines to patients and keep our business performing at a strong level. As an organization, we have also made a tremendous amount of progress with the Allergan transaction and integration. We just recently completed our first full year as a combined company, which I'd say has gone exceptionally well. We're tracking well against the operational and financial commitments we outlined at the time of the transaction, with a crucian performing above our original projections. But I'm particularly pleased with the robust revenue performance that we've been able to drive since acquiring Allergan. With 2021 sales tracking to grow significantly faster than legacy Allergan’s historical performance. Our results continue to show that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with numerous products within our newly combined portfolio delivering robust growth. Based on the continued strong momentum of our business in the quarter and our progress year-to-date, we are once again raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $12.52 to $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Our strong performance allows us to continue to fully invest in the business for long-term growth. As you'll hear from Mike momentarily, we continue to make excellent progress across all stages of our research and development programs. In closing, I'm extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter and with our continued strong momentum of the business, which has positioned as well for the remainder of 2021 and many years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you, Rick. I'll start with immunology, which delivered global revenues of more than $6.1 billion, reflecting growth of 13.8% on an operational basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ continue to have significant impact on AbbVie’s growth and performance, contributing more than $1 billion in combined sales this quarter. SKYRIZI global revenues were up 17.4% on a sequential basis, reflecting increasing market share globally. In the U.S., SKYRIZI continues to perform well and has maintained its leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at approximately 34%. SKYRIZI’s total prescription share capture is now approaching 20%, second only to Humira. Internationally, SKYRIZI has achieved in-play patient share leadership in 13 markets, including Canada, France and Japan. RINVOQ is also demonstrating robust growth with global sales up nearly 25% on a sequential basis. We continue to see in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market, where physician and patient feedback remain very positive on RINVOQ’s strong benefit risk profile. Internationally, RINVOQ access and share continue to ramp nicely in RA, with in-play market leadership now in half a dozen key countries. We are also making excellent progress with the regulatory approval and commercial launch of PSA and AS across several OUS countries. And we look forward to the approval and commercialization of RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis later this year following the recent CHMP positive opinion for both the 15-milligram and 30-milligram doses. Humira global sales were approximately $5.1 billion, up 3.6% on an operational basis, with continued high single-digit revenue growth in the U.S., offset by biosimilar competition across the international markets, where revenues were down 12.6% on an operational basis. In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.8 billion, up 13.2% on an operational basis. AbbVie maintains a strong leadership position in CLL with a combined portfolio, including both Imbruvica and Venclexta, new patient share of approximately 42% and total patient share of approximately 72% across all lines of therapy. Imbruvica global revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 7.2%. In the U.S., performance continues to be impacted by lower new patient starts in CLL, which remain below pre-COVID levels as well as increasing competitive dynamics from newer therapies, including Venclexta and other BTK inhibitors. Venclexta sales increased 38.3% on an operational basis with strong demand across all approved indications. We're particularly pleased with the performance in AML with robust share in the U.S. and increasing momentum internationally following recent approvals in the EU and Asia.  In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.4 billion, up 29.6% on a comparable operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum with Vraylar, which recently achieved multiple all-time highs in weekly prescriptions and market share. Vraylar revenues of $432 million were up more than 25% on a comparable operational basis. And Ubrelvy once again delivered robust results. Sales of our leading acute migraine treatment were $126 million, exceeding our expectations. Feedback from physicians remains very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy’s rapid and sustained pain relief, safety, convenient and flexible dosing profile and overall commercial access. Ubrelvy is now capturing roughly 9% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market, with more than 1 million cumulative total prescriptions since the launch. We continue to believe there is substantial room for long term growth in this rapidly expanding acute market based on unmet need and strong patient demand. In migraine prevention, we've also been planning and preparing for the forthcoming regulatory approval and commercial launch of Atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine. We're very encouraged with the efficacy profile of Atogepant, including reduction in migraine days versus placebo, as well as the overall percentage of response rates in patients. Now the launch of Atogepant will be supported by our existing migraine sales force with commercial access expected to ramp strongly, we remain on track for a U.S. regulatory decision in September. Botox Therapeutics continues to perform well across nearly a dozen medical indications, with a total sales of $603 million, up more than 38% on an operational basis. In chronic migraine, Botox Therapeutic remains a foundational prevention treatment, and the clear branded leader in new patient starts. Lastly, in our other therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eyecare, which had revenues of $919 million, up 24.1% on a comparable operational basis. Mavyret sales were $442 million, up 13.9% on an operational basis, although treated patient volumes remain suppressed versus pre COVID levels. And we also saw double digit comparable operational revenue growth for both Creon and Linzess. So, overall I'm pleased with the momentum of our therapeutic portfolio, which is demonstrating a strong recovery as well as our progress with new recent product launches. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Jeff. I'll start with immunology where we had several notable pipeline events in the quarter. In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, we reported positive top line results from the Phase 3 maintenance studies for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis, and SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease. In the RINVOQ UC maintenance study, both the 15 and 30 milligram doses met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 52. In the induction portion of the program, RINVOQ demonstrated a very strong impact on the disease. And the results from this maintenance study demonstrate that patients continuing treatment with RINVOQ maintain high levels of clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement at the one-year mark. In fact, maintenance treatment with either dose of RINVOQ resulted in some of the highest rates of remission and endoscopic improvements seen in UC clinical studies. With the 30 milligram RINVOQ dose 52% of patients achieved clinical remission, 62% achieved endoscopic improvement, 49% achieved histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement, and 68% achieved steroid free remission. We are very pleased with how RINVOQ performed from a safety perspective as well. In this maintenance study, the exposure adjusted event rates for overall adverse events including serious and severe events were higher in the placebo group than in either RINVOQ dose group. Additionally, the exposure adjusted rates for MACE, VTE and malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer were comparable between RINVOQ groups and placebo. These results provide further evidence that RINVOQ has the potential to become a highly effective therapy for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We're also nearing completion of the Crohn's disease program for RINVOQ and expect to see data from the first Phase 3 induction study later this year. Results from the second induction study and the maintenance study are expected in the first half of next year, with regulatory submissions also anticipated in 2022. We also saw very impressive results from SKYRIZI in the maintenance phase of our Crohn's disease program, particularly with the 360 milligram maintenance dose, which met the co-primary endpoints of clinical remission and endoscopic response versus the withdrawal arm at week 52. Importantly, when we look at the most stringent endpoints, we see strong separation between SKYRIZI 360 milligrams and control with the response rates of 39% for endoscopic remission, and 29% for deep remission, compared to 13% and 10% for the withdrawal group at week 52. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in UC and SKYRIZI in Crohn’s in the coming months. In the quarter, we also announced updates regarding our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. In June, RINVOQ received a positive CHMP opinion in Europe recommending both the 15 milligram and 30 milligram doses in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This CHMP opinion puts us on track for European approval in August. When approved atopic dermatitis will be the fourth indication for RINVOQ in Europe. Regarding our supplemental NDAs in the U.S., we recently announced that we were notified by the FDA that they would not need our PDUFA action dates for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis, which were in late June for psoriatic arthritis and AS and mid-July for atopic dermatitis. The agency cited their ongoing review of the tofacitinib ORAL surveillance study indicating that they needed more time to complete their reviews of the data. The FDA has not requested any additional safety analyses for RINVOQ since the PDUFA dates were missed. While there are no new action dates, based on our discussions with the agency, we expect decisions on our regulatory applications in the next few months. Following completion of the agency's review of the tofacitinib ORAL surveillance data. We remain confident in the benefit risk profile for RINVOQ across all indications. And we'll continue to work with the FDA to bring RINVOQ to market in these new disease areas. In our early-stage immunology pipeline, we recently began two new trials for ABBV-154 our TNF-steroid conjugate. We initiated a definitive dose ranging study in patients with RA and also started our Phase 2 study in polymyalgia rheumatica. Later this year, we expect to begin the Phase 2 study for 154 in Crohn's disease. Also in the quarter, we completed the induction stage of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis patients. While this CD 40 antagonists demonstrated greater efficacy compared to historical control, the efficacy results did not meet our prespecified criteria. As a result, we will not be advancing ravagalimab in ulcerative colitis. In oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our pipeline. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings, data were presented from the GLOW and CAPTIVATE studies evaluating a Fixed Duration Imbruvica and Venclexta regimen in CLL patients. Results from these two studies demonstrated that the all oral Fixed Duration Imbruvica plus Venclexta regimen has the potential to provide deeper and more durable remission and extends progression free survival as a frontline treatment across the spectrum for the age and fitness status for CLL patients. We plan to submit these data to regulatory agencies and look forward to bringing this new Fixed Duration treatment option to CLL patients once approved. Earlier this month, we received a breakthrough therapy designation for Venclexta in combination with azacitidine for previously untreated higher risk MDS patients, based on the strong data demonstrated thus far in our ongoing Phase 1b study. We expect to see final results from this study in the coming months and plan to discuss the data with regulators regarding the potential to support an accelerated approval for Venclexta in MDS. Also in the quarter, we saw interim results from a Phase 1 study evaluating the BCMA CD3 bispecific antibody TNB-383B in multiple myeloma patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy. 383 performed very well as a monotherapy in these heavily pretreated patients, demonstrating an objective response rate of nearly 80% and a very good partial response or better rate of 63% and a complete response rate of nearly 30% at doses greater than 40 milligrams in the dose escalation cohort. Based on these promising results, we exercise our right to acquire TNB-383B from Teneobio. We expected the transaction to close in the coming months, and we’ll provide more information on our development plan for 383 in multiple myeloma later this year. This is a highly competitive area. But based on the data to-date, we believe this BCMA CD3 bispecific has the potential to be differentiated on efficacy, safety and dosing interval and could be best in class as both a monotherapy and combination therapy across lines of treatment in multiple myeloma. We continue to make good progress with navitoclax program in myelofibrosis, which consists of randomized Phase 3 trials in both the frontline and relapsed refractory setting, as well as a single arm Phase 2 study. Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to submit our regulatory application with randomized Phase 3 data together with the Phase 2 trial results. We expect the Phase 3 data readout and regulatory submissions in the second half of 2022 with navitoclax approval in myelofibrosis anticipated in 2023. In neuroscience, we recently completed the Phase 2 proof of concept studies for two assets, elezanumab in multiple sclerosis and ABB-8E12 in Alzheimer’s disease. In the respective studies either assay meet the efficacy endpoints of the trial. And we will be discontinuing the development of elezanumab and MS and 8E12 in Alzheimer's disease. Given the enormous unmet need in Alzheimer's disease, we remain committed to finding disease modifying therapies. And we continue to pursue a range of approaches. We have several additional programs that are either in the clinic today or are in preclinical development. These include programs that modulate the neuroinflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease, such as our TREM2 and CD33 programs that are both in clinical development and programs that target pathologic tau through novel mechanisms, such as approaches that target intracellular aggregates for clearance that are in preclinical development. Following the accelerated approval of aducanumab in the U.S., there has been an increased focus on a-Beta directed programs. We have monitored this area closely over the last several years. And based on all of the available data, we believe there is a continued opportunity for an a-Beta directed monoclonal antibody that clears plaque more rapidly than existing agents with a reduced risk of amyloid related imaging abnormalities or area. We have profile the number of a-Beta antibodies preclinically. And we have a candidate with the potential to meet these requirements. We expect to introduce this candidate into the clinic by the end of this year or early next year. Also in neuroscience, we're nearing completion of our registrational program for a ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease. We recently completed an interim analysis in the first of two Phase 3 studies where our subcutaneous Levodopa Carbidopa delivery system demonstrated safety and efficacy, comparable to DUOPA after six months of treatment. The primary objective of this trial was safety, but efficacy was also evaluated as secondary endpoints. In this analysis, 951 performed very well, demonstrating a 52% reduction in normalized off time, and a 41% increase in normalized on time without troublesome dyskinesia. Patients also benefited from 915s 24 hour continuous Levodopa Carbidopa infusion, with patients experiencing substantial benefits in sleep and reduction in mourning off time. Full data from this six month interim analysis will be presented at a medical meeting later this year. Data from a second Phase 3 study are expected in the fourth quarter with our regulatory submissions anticipated later this year, or early next year. And lastly, in eyecare at the recent meeting for the American Society for cataract and refractive surgery, we presented results from the Phase 3 Gemini 1 study evaluating our topical eye drop AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. In this study, 584 demonstrated improved near vision without impacting distance vision, with a rapid onset of action within 15 minutes, and sustained vision improvements for up to six hours. 584 has the potential to be convenient, on demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia, and we look forward to an approval decision later this year. So, in summary, we've made great progress with our pipeline in the first half of this year. And we look forward to several additional data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Mike. Starting with second quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.11 up 32.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were nearly $14 billion 19.3% on a comparable operational basis, excluding a 1.6% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.7% of sales, an improvement of 260 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $606 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 12.6%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.52 and $12.62, reflecting growth of 19% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $6.48 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 10.7% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange have 0.9% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $56.3 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect aesthetics global revenue of approximately $4.9 billion, including approximately $2 billion from Botox Cosmetic, and approximately $1.4 billion from Juvederm. We now expect Restasis sales of approximately $1.1 billion and assume no generic competition in 2021. For Ubrelvy, we now expect sales of approximately $500 million. For women's health, we now expect global revenue of approximately $900 million. And for Mavyret, we now expect global sales of approximately $1.9 billion. Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are now forecasting adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.7 billion and adjusted SGA expense of approximately $11.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenue of approximately $14.3 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have 0.5% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.18 and $3.22, excluding approximately $1.64 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We are exceeding our revenue expectations in several areas, including Botox, Vraylar, Ubrelvy and eyecare. We've also delivered expense synergies of almost $800 million during the first half of this year, and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. And we have already paid down $12 billion of combined company debt. We expect to achieve $17 billion of cumulative debt paid down by the end of this year, with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4 times by the end of 2021. And approximately two times by the end of 2022. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance. And we are very pleased with the strong momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please.
Operator: Thank you, Ms. Shea. Our first question is from Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open, sir.
Vamil Divan: Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So maybe two if I could. So one, Rick, you mentioned some of the Allergan products, maybe doing better than your expectation. Can you maybe, I mean, I know you don’t want to share your secret sauce. But in terms of what is it that you've noticed that has helped to drive those products? Because it seems like it's pretty much across the Board, from an aesthetic to Vraylar, Ubrelvy. So, is it around promotion efforts? Is it around some payor dynamics? Or anything you could share would be helpful there? And then the second one on Imbruvica. I just want to confirm, I think you guys said that the new patient share across all indications now is 42%. So, I just want to see you guys are in line with what you expect at this point. Obviously, there's been questions around some like competitors that have entered the market. And maybe you can just talk about the patients who are not studying on Imbruvica. So, what are you seeing as the reasons why they might be choosing a competitor? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah, Vamil, this is Rick. I'll cover certain part of the first question, and maybe I'll ask Jeff to jump in and cover any additional thoughts that he might have. I think as you look at this business, one of the things that I think AbbVie is sort of known for is that, we tend to operate in a very focused and disciplined way, especially across what we consider to be growth franchises. We expect every one of our major businesses to develop plans, to be able to maximize the value of their assets, both from a strategic long-term basis, but also from a short-term tactical basis. And I'll use aesthetics as the example. Early on, we made the decision that we were going to fully integrate the aesthetics business to make sure that it had the focus and attention there it needed because we believe this business had a significant opportunity to be able to grow. We did that globally. So, if you look at Allergan in the past internationally, those people representing those products also had to represent eyecare and other therapeutic products. So, we moved those out into the therapeutic areas of AbbVie internationally and solely dedicated the aesthetics group internationally to just their products. And then in the U.S., we operate with a similar structure and a fully integrated R&D organization is totally committed to just developing aesthetics products and reports directly to Mike and then the Head of the Business for aesthetics reports directly to me. And we had them develop a plan that they are now executing against to be able to deliver against that. So, I think it's really three aspects of it from my perspective. It's one the structure we put in place. And that was a thoughtful, planned out structure. Two, it's the discipline processes that we use to be able to execute across all of our businesses. And then third, I'd say we have consistently invested and we do invest in businesses that we think have the opportunity to be able to drive long-term growth and performance in a way that we can drive that at maximum speed. And certainly, as you look at aesthetics, we've increased the investment in SG&A and we've increased the investment in R&D. Jeff, anything you'd add?
Jeff Stewart: I think, Rick, the – I would agree, I think, big piece Vamil, was the - is the level of the investment. So, as we looked at the - particularly the neuroscience compounds, Vraylar and Ubrelvy, we were able to structure the sales forces a little differently, which was important from commercial execution and also really upgrade and drive some of the investment around patient activation. So, I think that all of these brands are spectacular brands leadership position. And when we got that investment profile right, we've seen the response, so nothing that beyond that. Going back to your question on the hematology share, the 42% that I referred to was the combined AbbVie shares. So that's Imbruvica plus Venclexta across all lines of CLL. So, if you take a look - if I give you a little bit more color on the latest data that we have, for example, in frontline, we have 35% total AbbVie share, which is made up around 24% for Imbruvica and 11% for Venclexta. For second line share, for example, we have a 48% total AbbVie position, which is approximately 33% for Imbruvica and 15% for Venclexta. So, both of these brands are now operating at a very significant share level across CLL. I'll give you some more thoughts as you ask for in terms of color in the market. Beyond that leadership level that we have across the CLL indication, we do see that the CLL market is still suppressed. So, for example, patient starts year-to-date are down in the high single digits. And even within the quarter, they were down in the low single digits. We see that improving. And so that outlook looks to improve over the second part of the year. In terms of overall share dynamics, over the last several quarters, we have lost a few share points to Calquence, within the range of our expectations as they've ramped with their CLL ramp. But also interesting, we've seen that there's been some share increases in monotherapy CD20, which we think is also a COVID type of effect that will ultimately revert back to normality as we go along through the pandemic. So overall, the franchise is performing very, very well. And as you heard from Mike, we're tremendously excited about the future of the hem/onc franchises as we move forward.
Rob Michael: And Vamil, this is Rob. I'm going to come back to your first question. Just one more thing we should mention is, we've been able to really leverage our international infrastructure. And so, we set up this business. We have the aesthetics franchise, focus fully internationally on that business whereas Allergan had combined with therapeutics. So, we've been able to bring that focus and the level of investment. I think we've also been able to leverage our market access prowess. So, we’re very strong across the globe. And so, when you think about the opportunities for us going forward, I think, international certainly plays a big role as we leverage the Allergan business.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much. Just another one on aesthetics. Obviously, some incredibly strong numbers here. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on sustainability of this growth? So, I guess I’m just trying to get a better sense of how much of what we're seeing right now is catch up as we exit lockdowns versus a more sustained step up in sales going forward? Just any color on that would be appreciated. My second question was RINVOQ in UC. Can you just put some of this data into context as you think about the competitive landscape, and particularly relative to what you had anticipated in your long-term guidance for this indication? I think you’re about $1 billion in IBD sales by 2025. And is that we've seen more of this data set, just how comfortable are you feeling with that target and ultimately the role RINVOQ’s going to play in this space? Thanks so much. 
Rick Gonzalez: Hey, Chris, this is Rick. I'll take the aesthetics question and then Mike can maybe cover the second question that you had. So, it's a great question. And it's one that we have been looking at very carefully. I mean, if you just step back and you look at the performance of the business, we've done a number of things to drive the business. We believe this business is significantly underpenetrated when you look at the available patient population here and your ability to drive long-term penetration is tremendous. And so, that's why we've done the things that we've done to try to drive that demand. Globally, the aesthetic sales were up 31%. If we look at the U.S. toxin and filler business, the markets up about 40% versus 2019. So, but it's hard to evaluate, I can tell you the vast majority of it is driven by fundamental demand. And we can see that through the funnel that we see patients coming in and how many of them are activated to go get procedures. But we just conducted a fairly robust market research study to try to understand how much of it was COVID related. And we looked at things like how many of those patients got stimulus checks, how many of them were affected from an employment standpoint, and are now back at work? I'd say that study, if you looked at the data in that study, the conclusion that you withdraw from that is very little of it is COVID related. Now, I think the flaw is this, most patients are not going to say they use stimulus money for these kinds of procedures or other kinds of things. So, I think to the best of our ability, what I would tell you is about two thirds of the performance, I think, is fundamental demand, and maybe one-third of it is pent up demand. We're going to need a couple more quarters, I think to see how that plays out. But I'd say that's our best assessment right now. So, very robust growth either way, and it could sustain a little bit better than that. But I think, you can pretty well count on two thirds of it being fundamental demand at sustainable longer term. Mike?
Michael Severino: I'll take the question on RINVOQ UC. What I would say is the data that we've seen from RINVOQ UC has exceeded our expectations from an episode perspective, and the results they are very strong. UC has been very difficult to treat pharmacologically and getting high rates of permission. And this response has been challenging and both has delivered those now account just across number of studies. And I think from a safety perspective, it's also performed very well. I commented in my remarks, fact that overall rates of these serious AEs are actually lower with RINVOQ [ph]. Now the reason for that is that many of these AEs are driven by self and with the improvement in the ease to use UC then improve as well. And with respect to events of interest, the safety profile has worked very, very well with their segment A, segment B and other events rates have been comparable to controls. And so overall, we feel very confident in the long term guidance that we put out. But one thing that's important to keep in mind is that long term guidance is 2025 guidance. And our IBD assets will be in relatively early stage of launch by that time. But the profiles that I've talked about not only for RINVOQ, but also for SKYRIZI bode well, not only 2025 guidance, but for the long term growth of that aesthetic as opportunity there as well.
Liz Shea: Thanks Chris. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question will be from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. You may ask your question sir.
Ronny Gal: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. First one is on ABBV-951. You've mentioned the efficacy rates. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about the skin safety profile as compared to the neogen product or the apomorphine IV from Europe, especially when it comes to the some more severe effects like Abscess and Okta? The second question is staying with a pipeline is a little bit of budget a-Beta. Didn't take long for you guys to walk into that. I was kind of wondering if you can talk a little bit about the science that you're discovering, is the right approach to get to the best effect with minimal side effects to try to remove as much flak as possible in a very targeted manner? Or should the approach be to go after soluble [indiscernible] and approach to removal of plaque indirectly?
Michael Severino: Okay, so this is Mike, I'll take both of those questions. With respect to 951 we’ll publish full data from the Phase 3 study that I described at a medical meeting and then ultimately, in peer reviewed journals as well. But what I can say is the skin safety has looked good to our eye and is within our expectations well within our expectations. As one would expect with a cutaneous device, there are some local reactions, but those have generally been mild and resolved with continuing treatment. We've not seen significant issues with more severe types of skin about the safety profile, and we think the patient friendly aspects of subcutaneous delivery that has some parallels to an insulin pump like device will be a real advantage here because it allows patients to get that to open like efficacy that's transformative without the need for placement of a gastric tube that's unthreaded in the small bowel and very, very difficult to manage. And so, we feel very good about the potential for 951. With respect to a-Beta, I think if one looks at all of the data, it's quite clear that if you can remove plaque rapidly, then there will be a benefit, and the key parameter that we would need to see is deep reductions in level of plaque and rapid reductions in the level of plaque, because you won't start to see a cognitive benefit, we believe until you get to that amyloid negativity level bypass, which is 20 centroids, until you reduce patients to that level. So, the goal would be to get them there as rapidly as possible. And to do that, while minimizing the impact of area. And we think that that can be done through epitopes selection. There are slight differences in the amyloid forms that are present in vessel wall compared to plaque. And with appropriate epitopes selection, we believe that our preclinical data would support that you can do that with reduced risk of area. And of course, we now need to see whether the clinical data supports that as well. But those are the basic principles that we're following. We've obviously had these candidates before the aducanumab approval, because as I said, we've been monitoring this area quite closely. But we think this is a good time to advance those candidates and to determine whether the science I described plays out in the clinic. But our approaches with respect to a-Beta are based on plaque, not soluble forms of [Indiscernible].
Ronny Gal: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Ronnie. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum with Citi. You may ask your question.
Andrew Baum: Many thanks. A few question, Jeff. Firstly, on the outlook for rebaiting and oncology, this is somewhat of a novelty, at least historically. I know that yes, excluded Calquence from their formulary, there's obviously increased therapeutic competition in the space. How should we be thinking about the rebaiting outlook and oncology going forward more broadly? Second, on the U.S. paybacks through COVID and now in the recovery stage, could you outline the magnitude of which you've had to increase and then decrease the Medicaid components in the patient assistance programs? Or whether you're seeing that improvements, some sense of scale and direction there? Many thanks.
Michael Severino: Yeah, thank you, Andrew. And to start with oncology. I mean, largely, as you know the rebaiting has been done through the sort of the GPO channel. And particularly with the physician in office dynamics that are in that sector, we don't see significant rebaiting happening at the PDM level. And if it is, it's quite modest. I think the certainly from the ESI standpoint that you highlighted, that was an ESI decision. That was not certainly something that AbbVie approach that particular payer with any sort of deal. Our philosophy is that these drugs are very important for oncologists to have basically open access for all of these agents. So, I think it is something that we've seen some of these lights that have started to turn on. But they've been quite modest. And I don't think that they're going to be a super accelerant that we should be overly worried about. That's my position on that. I think this the second approach in terms of sorry, that was the question on the magnitude of the Medicaid. Yeah, this has been quite interesting. We've seen, certainly on all of the data, the fact that the enrollment in Medicaid has gone up. When we look across our businesses at let's say, acute channel shifts in terms of the utilization, they're relatively modest. They're there, so we don't see massive movements around our channels shifting that link to the magnitude of what you might see in terms of the enrollments. So it's relatively modest, certainly manageable. And I think, certainly, as we see the jobs positioned come back and that could be quite strong, I think we'll see any modest movement will be corrected over the next several quarters.
Rick Gonzalez: And this is Rick. Going ahead I'd add to the second question is so we have a very extensive and I would say generous PAP program in place that's really designed to ensure that patients who can't afford our medicines, have the ability to be able to access those medicines free of charge in many cases. As an example, 99% of the applications we get for uninsured patients we approve we actually just increased the program to 600% of the federal poverty level across all of our brands. And so, it's a program that I think is designed to fulfill the mission that I just described. And that is that patients who need our medicines can get them from us if they can't afford to pay for them, or whatever system that they operate in. And but we have not seen and much to our surprise, we have not seen that program increased dramatically, even through COVID. And we advertise directly to patients that if they lost their job during COVID, that we would provide our medicines to them. But I wouldn't say, as I said, much to our surprise we didn't see the volume go up dramatically.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges with Leerink. Your line is open, sir.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. Lots of questions. But I'll focus first on RINVOQ. Rick, you've given the long term guidance of recall $7 billion in revenue by 2025. I think and by means correct me if I don't recall correctly. But if you only get the 15 milligram dose approved, if that's the outcome of the deliberations of the FDA, but you get the approvals in Europe, can you achieve that revenue guidance? You’re confident enough in the 15 milligram program? And then secondly, for Mike. You'll see us development program seems to have been sort of reactivated. And could you talk a little bit about your conviction, a little bit more detail on a 119? We don't know much about that. Are you confident that it can be active see through correct that matches up to your competition? Because clearly that's a big revenue opportunity that we have reflected in. Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: So, Jeffrey, this is Rick, on your first question. Yes, the guidance for RINVOQ is $8 billion. And I would say we're confident that even with a 15 milligram, we will sustain that guidance. If you look at the performance of the 15 milligram is quite remarkable. And so, we feel good about the performance of RINVOQ, we continue to see strong uptake of RINVOQ, and physician interest and is consistent with what we would expect. So, I think we're fine now.
Michael Severino: This is my context, a question on the CF program. When we restructured the collaboration with Galapagos. A few years ago, to take direct operational control of that program, we had a couple of goals. One is we wanted to make sure that we're optimizing the potentiator in C1 components of the regimen. We felt we had a best in class, C1 in Q2. But we believed we needed to make a switch in the potentiator to one that we already had in hand. And we've done that. We also believe that we needed a C2 corrector. That’s in that time period a few years ago did not exist. So, we needed a C2 corrector that had the potential to be best in class. And so, what we did is we put a significant internal chemistry effort to come up with a number of compounds. 119 is the most advanced and a very promising one that we believe fit that bill. And based on all the preclinical profiling, we think 119 can be a best in class C2 corrector. And with the other components of or triple, we think we can deliver best in class efficacy with appropriate pharmacological properties, dosing, low DDIs, et cetera. And so, we are now in a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study in the clinic to determine whether those preclinical data will in fact spare out. What I would say here is the preclinical assays are good. They're much more predictive than they are in other areas because we fundamentally know what the defect is in CF, and we can study it in appropriate tissues in human tissues in vitro. But ultimately, we're going to need to see the clinical data. By right around the end of the year, we'll see internally proof of concept results for that triple. We'd probably be in a position to announce them externally early next year, and those will be data that will include impact on FET1 with a triple. And so that will tell us whether we can be best in class. And I agree if we are best in class, I think it's a very significant opportunity and we will progress it rapidly. Now, it's a proof-of-concept study. So, if it's successful, we'd have some additional dose ranging to do. We're studying the highest dose of 119, to determine whether it can have that effect we'd have to do some additional dose ranging to determine the optimal dose of 119, but that can be done rapidly. And then we would, if successful move into Phase 3 development.
Geoffrey Porges: All right. Thanks Mike.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from 6 Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.
Geoff Meacham: Morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just had a few quick ones. Another one on JAK safety. And Mike you mentioned you expect regulatory action in the next few months? Can you just give us some perspective on that? Is there any data that you're still waiting on to submit? And is there still the potential for an advisory panel? And then the second one is on Ubrelvy. Maybe just give us some color on the on the new start dynamic? What are the patients recapturing? What share are you getting from and maybe just help us with kind of the -- what other wins do you have to make with respect to formulary access and share? Thank you.
Michael Severino: I'll take the first question and then Jeff will take the second question on Ubrelvy. So, with respect to JAK safety, we have indicated that we believe that an action is possible in the next few months. That's based on our discussions with the agency and what timing we think is reasonable. It's not a specific action date, like the PDUFA dates that had been set in the past. So, we will continue to monitor it as the process continues to move along. But the rate limiting factor, as we understand it is the agency's review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance data. And I think once that is completed, we will be able to move forward with Goodspeed with arm review. But there are no additional data from a safety perspective or no other substantial analysis that the agency is waiting on for us. We provided our updated benefit risk quite some time ago, as we announced publicly. And the agency has not requested any additional data. So, it's really that review of the tofacitinib oral surveillance is gaining as we understand it. With respect to an advisory panel, the agency always has the authority to call one if they desire to have one. But what I would say is, if they were planning on having an advisory committee. I would expect them to already be preparing for that and already have that process in motion. And we would know that, and there's no indication that that is underway at this time.
Jeff Stewart: Right, and I'll take the Ubrelvy question. As I mentioned, we're very, very pleased with Ubrelvy and really our overall migraine portfolio that we're rapidly developing here. To give you some sense, it's quite remarkable. I mean, if you look at the total acute oral CGRP category, so that's us and the competitor. It's about 18% of all new prescriptions, and it continues to grow very, very quickly. So again, it shows you how hard patients and physicians are. Are looking for the adoption of these particular agents, even though you have to step through a Triptan, some cases two Triptan. So, the market demand is very, very substantial. When we look to the overall performance, we can see that roughly the two agents are sort of splitting the acute indication. Some of the more weeklies are now being a little confounded by the new preventative episodic approval from Neurotech. But nonetheless, I think that's a small piece of the story. When we sort of peel out some of their new preventative scripts, we still have the leadership position for the acute market. But I really think the bigger picture is how fast that segment will expand over time? And we anticipate that will continue to lead that based on Ubrelvy’s overall profile. Our overall access dynamics are quite good. So, we really have roughly a 90% access. Again, some of that access demands a step through a Triptan. But overall, when you look at how fast that category is going, we don't really anticipate that there's major new plans that we need to achieve any sort of incremental access position. And so, basically our commercial strategy continues to be how hard can we drive this acute segment and lead that acute segment. And as I mentioned in my prepared remark, anticipating the arrival in the late third quarter for Atogepant, which has just a spectacular profile for episodic migraine. So, thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks Geoff. Operator next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question.
Tim Anderson: Thank you. It's well known that AbbVie rebates heavily on Humira in the U.S. So, when biosimilars launch, won’t you potentially have room to pull back on those rebates, which could mean, basically the meaningful offset to last Humira volumes. It seems like it could end up being in the billions of dollars that you could pull back in house. And I realized there's RINVOQ and SKYRIZI dynamic to consider. And related to that line of questioning how does the prospect of interchangeability biosimilars impact your thinking on this front? If interchangeable, generics are allowed or not allowed? How does that impact what you might do with those rebate dollars? And then second question, quick one, just the range of outcomes for when Imbruvica might face generics in the U.S. Is it in the realm of possibilities that AbbVie enters into settlement agreements with legal challengers that could push out generic timing?
Rick Gonzalez: Hi Jim, it’s Rick. So, I'll cover the first two questions that you have there. I would say let me start with interchangeability. We've outlined now over the last year or two, I think pretty specifically what we view the biosimilar impact in the U.S. to be and we are assuming that there will be two interchangeable biosimilars. And that's in the thought process of the erosion models that we have described many, many times now. So, we are assuming there will be interchangeability. We're certainly not in a position where we're going to talk about what we're going to do from the standpoint of rebates. We've always competed very effectively in these markets. Certainly, the focus for us going forward is the next generation assets, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And you can see now, those two assets this year will do $4.6 billion. So, call it $5 billion. They're rapidly growing. And they're doing exactly what we had hoped they would do. They have higher levels of efficacy, and they're ramping dramatically. And they will buffer the impact of biosimilar impact in the U.S. And so, what I'd say is the strategy is going exactly the way we had hoped it would go. We'll fill out the range of indications on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And continue to drive those assets into the marketplace effectively. On Imbruvica?
Laura Schumacher: Yeah, hi. This is Laura Schumacher. Our Imbruvica composition of matter patent expires in May of 2028 assuming that we get the pediatric extension. We do have later expiring IP covering methods of use formulations, crystal forms, and the like. Our long-range plan currently assumes the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in May of 2028 when the composition of matter of patent expires. There is litigation ongoing with one remaining and a filer. And we're awaiting a decision on that.
Tim Anderson: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Great, thank you Tim. Operator next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
Matthew Harrison: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow up question on CFP, I guess first two parts here. First, are you confident that you have a potentiator that's active and improve versus the Galapagos compound? Because I think we've seen a lot of issues with people trying to develop potentiators. They're as good as Kaleidoco. And then, second, I know you talked about FPV 1, have you looked at sweat chloride at all? Obviously, you need a larger patient sample size to get a good directional view on FPV 1. I'm wondering if we looked at smaller patient numbers on sweat chloride. Thanks.
Michael Severino: So, this is Mike. I’ll take that. With respect to the potentiator, we are convinced that we have a potentiator that has activity and we've changed the potentiator from some of those prior combinations that were pursued earlier on in the Galapagos collaboration. We think that, that potentiator it has clear signs of activity, we think the C1 character is very good and probably best in class based on the data that we have seen that were generated earlier in the collaboration. We put this up, the principal piece that was missing was that CTO and we think we have a good one. With respect to the endpoints while it does take a larger sample size, to look at FPV 1 we feel like FPV 1 is what really matters here. That's what's going to translate into clinical benefit for patients. And so, our proof-of-concept study will show us FPV 1 and that's the primary measure that we are going to use to determine whether to advance the triple or not.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Matthew. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open, sir.
Steve Scala: Thank you, a couple questions. Many of the questions so far suggests concerns around RINVOQ. But I'm wondering if this could all turn into be a positive. So, to what extent do you believe RINVOQ prescribing might be being held back by competitor product concerns? So, once those concerns are resolved and or RINVOQ emerges unscathed, if it does. RINVOQ could even do better. And we could be looking at a sharp acceleration in share gains and prescription trends in Q4. So that's the first question. And secondly, on Humira contract renewals that will be signed in coming months for 2022. What is the typical duration of those contracts? Are they typically 12 months? 24 months, 36 months? If you can give us an idea of that that would be helpful. Thank you.
Michael Severino: Yeah, it's a very good question. And this question we fought a lot about, let me give you some perspective on RINVOQ. So, if you look at our, let's say, our demand performance, and I think I mentioned my prepared remarks, we've been very consistent about 15% in place share in the large RA market, which is just under Humira, which has grown a little bit over the COVID times and since January to about 18%. So, we're very, very stable. And I do believe that there is some overhang on certain segments of prescribers that have, let's say, going back a little bit to the TNF, really our own product, Humira. So, it's not outside of the realm of possibility as this resolves and really largely, as you probably heard, or seen Xeljanz has lost in play share over that period. So, I do believe there's a little overhang in certain, probably significant segments of Rheumatology. So, we are anxiously awaiting the resolution here of oral surveillance, which obviously has delayed our regulatory submissions. But it's not outside of the realm of possibility, given the very significant and differentiated data that we have in our packages, that we can see an acceleration as things resolve. But we're going to anxiously be monitoring. And certainly, be prepared to anticipate any outcome there.
Rick Gonzalez: And see, this is Rick. On the contracting question, I'll handle that one. It varies quite a bit based on product and by managed care organization, but I'd say typically, so it can be some of them can be as short as 12 months, it's probably more common to be in a 24 month range from a contracting standpoint.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator next question, please.
Operator:
Q - Chris Raymond:
Chris Raymond: Thanks. Just on the a-Beta program and you answered a few questions. But I think I heard you describe the product that you're targeting the plaques and not the cybil forms of a-Beta. Just kind of maybe if you, wonder if you can give a little bit more color on the driver of that have gone forward with that. Did you guys -- does your science sort of tell you that amyloid beta oligomers, for example, are not a driver of the disease or this is more of a decision that's driven by the regulatory precedents of approving targeting the a-Beta plaques. And then maybe also, if you can get a little more detail on this molecule is likely an IV, or possibly subcue delivered antibody? Thanks.
Michael Severino: So, this is Mike, I'll take that. With respect to the focus on plaque, I think when one looks at all of the data, you can conclude that if you can reduce plaque rapidly, from that point forward, you can see a benefit. So, in other words, getting the majority of patients to a level where they are amyloid negative by PET, so below 20 [ph] centoloids. And doing that rapidly is what's required to see a benefit emerge over time. And part of the importance of speed is that you're not going to see that benefit until you get to that level. So, if you spend the entire period of a trial, getting to that level, you don't then have an opportunity within that trial to see an improvement in cognition. And of course, for patients, if you don't get to that level fast enough, they're not going to drive benefit for a period of sometimes too many years. And they need really faster than that. So, that's our focus on plaque. With respect to different components and the role of oligomers. I think it's hard to tease that apart right now, what we know from the data is what I said that getting patients to amyloid negativity, but reducing plaque is what seems to drive a clinical benefit, whether there are upstream steps that one could try to impact to achieve the same result. I think it's an open question. And we're going where the science tells us to go today. With respect to IV or subcue, I think it's early to answer that question. It's going to relate to ultimately the delivered dose. And then dose forms that can be delivered. So, for example, there are on body injectors and other things that can deliver more than the traditional one or two and those of a solution containing a monoclonal antibody. So, there are approaches that could be IV or subcue, but I think it's a little bit early to make predictions on how that will all play out.
Chris Raymond: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. It comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open.
Luisa Hector: Hello, thank you for taking my question. Sorry, going back to RINVOQ again, but I just wanted to check that the approval of the pending indications isn't a particular gating item for your filing in UC. And then I see that you haven't changed your guidance for RINVOQ for this year. And I know previously, you've stated that maybe would only ever be a small contribution this year. But rather than self, I just wonder whether there's any particular savings on your launch costs this year due to the delay? And then maybe on TMB-383. Again, I think I've understood this is now 100% belonging to you. So just to check, no impact from the Amgen acquisition? And then when might we see a Phase 2 start looks like you have a dose data very compelling. So how soon could we be looking out for that trial starting data? Thank you.
Michael Severino: Okay, this is Mike. I'll start with the RINVOQ question and pass it to Rob. And then I'll come back or the 383 question. With respect to the UC filing, the UC filing is not dependent on the approvals in the other indications. And obviously, the timing of release of review of the UC filing would carry it out to a point where those matters where I think, based on any reasonable expectation be resolved.
Rob Michael: Yeah, and your question regarding the guidance for RINVOQ. So you're right, we did give guidance to $1.7 billion early this year, assuming we would have a new indications approved. We said that would be a minor contribution, think of it in that couple of hundred-million-dollar range. But given the strong performance out of the RA indication, we've maintained that guidance, despite the fact that those approvals are delayed. There is some level of savings in terms of SG&A related to approvals being delayed. But at the same time, we're investing the business you'd look at, we're doing the aesthetics. Obviously, other parts of Allergan business, there's opportunity to invest more broadly. So overall, SG&A is up because we are investing for long term growth, but there is some level of savings associated with the RINVOQ delays.
Michael Severino: With respect to 383, the BCMA, CD3 bispecific, you're correct, there is no impact of the Amgen acquisition of Teneobio on that. The asset would be ours and it would be unencumbered by anything related to the Amgen acquisition. In terms of Phase 2 timing, we plan to move forward very rapidly, not only with Phase 2, but with Phase 3 studies. With this asset, we think the data that have been generated are very strong, very high levels of response, good levels at the DGPR were better thresholds with a very good safety profile as well and a profile that would fit well with combination therapy and move to earlier lines of therapy. So, we'll advance the program aggressively and we'll update on the specifics a little bit later on in the year.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Luisa. Operator next question, please.
Operator: Our next question will come from Daniel Busby with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.
Daniel Busby: Good morning. I've got two questions. First, a bigger picture question on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. You've got to do peak sales for both products in the early 2030s. There's been a lot of focus on near term regulatory hurdles, particularly for RINVOQ. But there's also a lot that could happen competitively between now and then. So, with that said, what do you view is the biggest potential longer term competitive threats for both of those drugs, and particularly given the ongoing emergence and maturation of new drug modalities? And second, can you talk a little bit about the assumptions you've built into overall guidance relating to the Delta variant, and whether that's changed at all the way you think about the second half recovery? Thank you.
Michael Severino: We go through a fairly rigorous and by that I'd say a very rigorous long range planning process where we evaluate what we think the comparative alternatives might be and the profile of our assets versus other assets. And I would say as we look at RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, and the clinical data that has been generated is certainly achieving or exceeding the expectations that we had for those assets. I don't see anything on the horizon, that would make it in a timeframe that would have a material impact on those assets based on the guidance that we provided, or even longer-term guidance out to typically do a 10-year long range planning process. So yes, there are certainly many, many modalities that are available today across many of these therapeutic areas. It's having the right kind of asset, and the right kind of clinical performance. And then everything else that wraps around that market access and all the other things you have to be effective at in order to achieve the level of performance that these assets are achieving. And so, bottom line is, I think we feel very confident in our assumptions here. As it relates to the Delta variant. I think as we look at the guidance that we are providing in the second half, it certainly is reflective of what we assume -- we don't assume dramatic changes in the U.S. or other major markets around the world and where we are today. We're assuming major levels of recovery in certain markets, either that are currently in lockdown, like Australia as an example, or in many of the Asian markets outside of outside of China and Singapore. So, I think we've properly represented it. I think the healthcare system in the U.S. in particular has experienced that we have last year tells us that the healthcare system can much better treat these patients. And we're not assuming that we see anything that would be significant in this shift in the U.S. from a lockdown standpoint.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Daniel. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: It will come from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, sir.
Gary Nachman: Hi. Good morning. And thanks for squeezing me in. Sorry, but one more RINVOQ first. Curious why you think Europe doesn't seem as concerned with JAK class the way the FDA has been since you got the positive opinion on atopic derm for both doses there? And how you see uptake in Europe versus the U.S. overall? Is there a difference in perception, you think in those regions with the class? And then regarding Vraylar for MDD? How are the Phase 3 studies gone overall? Did you change anything with respect to enrollment numbers or sites during the course of the pandemic since these Phase 3 data are coming soon? And have you done any more work sizing up the potential market opportunity, where you think it would be used most for MDD? What types of patients? Thank you.
Michael Severino: So, this is Mike, I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Jeff for some initial additional comments. With respect to RINVOQ and the regulatory environment in the prescriber perception prescriber environment, between Europe and the U.S., we do see differences. And the European authorities, and the European prescribing base seems to place less emphasis on these signals and view them more specifically to the molecules that generated the data then the EU have. Why that is? I can't give you a single reason other than these are both very large, competent jurisdictions that have come to their own impressions of the data. And those impressions have different somewhat. As you've said, for atopic derm we got the positive opinion from the CHMP for both the 15 and 30 milligram doses. We think the data are very supportive of that decision. And we look forward to launching that indication in Europe. And we think it's going to be an important additional indication, as it will be in the U.S. when we do get to approval. With respect to uptake in Europe, Jeff, I don't know if you want to comment?
Jeff Stewart: Yeah, as I mentioned in my remarks, the uptake on RINVOQ in many major markets is very, very strong. Now, as you know, waiting for reimbursement takes a little bit more time than the U.S. but as I highlighted, we have in play leadership and this is including the TNF to biosimilars in Germany, France, Canada, for example. So, it's quite strong. I think another point that I'd like to make, and we certainly see it in some of the early launch countries with PSA and AS. There appears to be a synergistic effect which makes some sense from a commercial standpoint. As countries like Germany start to introduce PSA and AS, the entire RINVOQ molecule starts to accelerate and move faster. And so again, given the last question I answered, we're actually anxiously awaiting the approval of those extra room indications there. So it's quite strong. And as I highlighted again and Mike mentioned, our label here in atopic derm is going to look quite strong in the European markets. Mike, maybe you can hit on MDD and then I'll address the market structure there.
Michael Severino: With respect to Vraylar and MDD, we did a deep dive on the Phase 3 studies shortly after closing the acquisition of Allergan. And what I would say is, we found that the studies were very well designed. We were comfortable with important considerations like patient selection, selection of sites that we believe would give quality data. We looked at the blinded aggregate characteristics of the population roles. You look at the baseline characteristics, and you don't know who's on active or placebo, but you can just see if you're enrolling the right patient population, and we believe we were. All of the measures are designed and seem to be behaving appropriately. And so, we feel good about the design characteristics of that study. And we did not feel that it was necessary to make any changes. But we did do that deep dive to be sure of that as I said, what we found was in fact reassuring. With respect to the market opportunity, I'll just make a couple of comments. And I'll hand it off to Jeff, for some more detail. But what I would say is, depression obviously is a substantial indication. And it's one that is very difficult to treat with existing agents. About 50% of patients don't achieve adequate control with monotherapy with frontline agents like SSRIs, or SNRIs. And so, there is an important opportunity for adjunctive therapy. And obviously, this is an adjunctive MDD indication. So, that would be the population that we would be looking at. Jeff, do you want to comment in more detail on that?
Jeff Stewart: Yeah, I mean, if we look at the market structure, obviously, you have schizophrenia, which is a relatively modest market, and we have a good growing position there with our existing indication. And then you have the prescriptions and really the different bipolar segments. And what I would say about not the big depression market, but the adjunctive MDD market that Mike spoke about. It's about the same size in terms of a prescription value to the bipolar segment. So, adjunctive MDD, if the studies were to progress as we see is really gives us a chance to access a market that's equally sized for the one that we're competing in today. So, it's quite attractive as we continue to look for the final readout of those trials.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Gary. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great rest of your day.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-04-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question and answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star, one on your phone. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Liz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today’s conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full current year and historical results for Allergan. For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast to conform to AbbVie’s revenue recognition accounting policies and exclude the divestitures of Zenpep and Viokace. References to operational growth further excludes the impact of exchange. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll take your questions. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I’ll discuss our first quarter performance and outlook, and then Jeff, Mike and Rob will review our business highlights, pipeline progress and financial results in more detail. We’re off to an excellent start this year, delivering strong top and bottom line first quarter performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.14. Total adjusted net revenue of $12.9 billion was up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis, nearly $250 million ahead of our expectations. These results include strong performance across each of our core therapeutic areas, including double-digit comparable operational revenue growth from immunology, neuroscience, and esthetics, as well as high single digit operational growth from hematological oncology. Additionally, we continue to see robust sales from our key and newly launched products. Skyrizi and Rinvoq contributed nearly $900 million in combined revenues this quarter, more than double the sales versus the prior year as both products continue to ramp in their initial indications. Imbruvica and Venclexta delivered combined sales of approximately $1.7 billion, reflecting continued leadership in CLL and other hematological malignancies. Vraylar, which remains one of the fastest growing medicines in psychiatry, delivered more than 20% comparable operational growth. Ubrelvy, the leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, generated revenue growth of approximately 25% on a sequential basis, and within our leading esthetics portfolio, which is performing well above pre-COVID levels, Botox cosmetics and Juvederm are demonstrating robust performance. Both of these brands grew more than 40% on a comparable operational basis. The integration of Allergan also continues to go very well. As illustrated by our balanced results this quarter, we are clearly demonstrating that we have created a stronger and much more diverse company with the scale and flexibility to fully invest in the business for long term growth. While the pandemic has categorically impacted our day-to-day lives, we are encouraged by the latest recovery trends. We see market growth and new patient activity increasing overall, especially in March, although certain markets continue to remain below pre-COVID levels, including CLL and HCV in particular. We expect that increasing vaccinations globally will continue to support a fully recovery across our therapeutic areas as we progress through the remainder of this year. Based on our robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year 2021 EPS guidance and we now expect adjusted earnings per share between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of more than 18% at the midpoint. I’m also extremely pleased with our R&D prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities especially within our late stage pipeline. We’re on the cusp of the potential commercial approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including five total expected approvals in 2021. This includes Atogepant, a novel oral CGRP for episodic migraine, adding to our already attractive migraine portfolio; a new eye drop for the treatment of presbyopia, as well as expanded indications for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and atopic dermatitis, and we expect more than half a dozen new product or indication launches in 2022, including Navitoclax for myelofibrosis, ABBV-951 for advanced Parkinson’s disease, Skyrizi for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease, Rinvoq for ulcerative colitis, Vraylar for major depressive disorder, and initial indications for Imbruvica and Venclexta. With these collective new growth opportunities and the continued momentum of our underlying portfolio, our long term outlook remains very strong. In closing, our focus remains on strong commercial and operational execution as well as pipeline advancement. I’m pleased with the financial results for the quarter and the overall pace of the recovery across our portfolio. We’re off to another excellent start in 2021. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Thank you Rick. We demonstrated strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. Our immunology portfolio delivered global revenues of more than $5.7 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 12% on an operational basis. Humira sales were approximately $4.9 billion, up 2.6% on an operational basis with continued high single digit growth in the U.S. offset by biosimilar competition across our international markets, where the unfavorable impact was more moderate than expected in the quarter. Our new immunology agents, Skyrizi and Rinvoq, are both demonstrating robust prescription growth well above all comparable launches. Skyrizi sales were $574 million, reflecting 34% in-play patient share, which includes new and switching patients. This is more than double the share capture of the next nearest biologic competitor. Skyrizi total prescription share in the U.S. psoriasis biologic market is now approximately 15%, second only to Humira. Additionally, we recently received approval for a single dose prefilled pen for Skyrizi which will reduce the number of injections per treatment. Skyrizi is now the only quarterly dose psoriasis treatment available in an auto injector, further improving the patient experience. Rinvoq sales were $303 million with strong in-play patient share of approximately 15% in the U.S. RA market. Physician and patient feedback remains very positive on Rinvoq’s level of efficacy, speed of response, and strong benefit-risk profile. Internationally, both of these new assets delivered strong double-digit sequential growth with ramping access in share. Skyrizi has now also achieved in-play patient share leadership in the EU 5 psoriasis market, exceeding Tremfya and Cosentyx and at parity with Taltz. As Mike will discuss momentarily, we are also making considerable progress to expand the uses of Skyrizi and Rinvoq in several immune-mediated diseases with half a dozen additional indication approvals expected later this year and in 2022. In hematologic oncology, sales were approximately $1.7 billion, up 7.3% on an operational basis. Imbruvica continues to perform well across multiple indications, including CLL, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Imbruvica sales increased 2.9% on an operational basis this quarter with performance impacted by lower new patient starts within CLL, where the market remains below pre-COVID levels. Imbruvica growth was also unfavorably impacted by the COVID-relating stocking benefit that we saw in the first quarter of 2020. Venclexta sales were $405 million, up 24.5% on an operational basis with increasing share in frontline CLL and continued strong performance in AML. In neuroscience, revenues were more than $1.2 billion, up 10.9% on a comparable operational basis. Vraylar once again delivered strong growth. Sales of $346 million were up 21.2% on a comparable operational basis, reflecting a nearly 2.5% total prescription share of the U.S. atypical antipsychotic market. Within migraine, the launch of Ubrelvy is exceeding our expectations with $81 million of revenue in the quarter. Feedback from physicians has been very positive, highlighting Ubrelvy’s efficacy, safety, convenient dosing profile, and overall commercial access. Ubrelvy is the number one branded acute treatment for migraine based on both new patient share and prescription growth. The oral CGRP therapies, including our leading Ubrelvy, now represent roughly 16% of new prescriptions in the large acute migraine market. We believe there is substantial room for long term growth in this rapidly expanding segment based on unmet need and strong patient demand. We also look forward to the expected commercial approval of Atogepant, our oral CGRP for episodic migraine later this year. Botox therapeutic is seeing a very nice recovery in chronic migraine as well as its other indications, with total sales of $532 million, up 7% on a comparable operational basis. Lastly in our other key therapeutic areas, we saw significant contribution from eye care, which had revenues of $817 million. Mavyret sales were $450 million, down 28.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID levels, and we also saw double-digit comparable growth from Linzess, the leading branded prescription medicine in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with IBSC, or chronic idiopathic constipation. Overall, I’m extremely pleased with our execution across the therapeutic portfolio, including the progress we are making with recent new product launches. We remain on track to deliver very strong revenue growth in 2021. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Mike Severino: Thank you Jeff. I’ll start with immunology, where we continue to make good progress with Rinvoq and Skyrizi in new disease areas, as well as in our early and mid-stage immunology programs. We recently reported positive top line results from the second induction study for Rinvoq in ulcerative colitis. Similar to results from the first induction study, in this Phase III trial Rinvoq demonstrated a very strong impact on disease activity as measured by clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement. The 45 milligram induction dose was well tolerated and the safety profile was consistent with previous Rinvoq studies. In these induction trials, we saw no DVT, PE, MACE events, or malignancies in the Rinvoq groups, and the rates of serious adverse events were numerically lower than placebo. We believe these induction data compare very favorably to other UC treatments on the market or in development and based on the data generated to date, Rinvoq has the potential to become one of the most highly effective therapies for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. We expect to see results from the UC maintenance study this summer with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of the year. The Rinvoq program in Crohn’s disease is also progressing very well, and we expect to see induction data from the first of two Phase III trials in the fourth quarter, followed by induction data from a second Phase III trial and maintenance data in the first half of 2022. We’re also nearing completion of our pivotal program for Skyrizi in Crohn’s disease. Earlier this year, we reported positive results from the two Crohn’s induction studies and we expect to see maintenance data this summer. Our regulatory submissions for Skyrizi and Crohn’s disease remain on track for the second half of 2021. Following completion of our registrational program for Skyrizi in psoriatic arthritis, we recently submitted our regulatory applications in the U.S. and Europe with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2022. We’re very pleased with the level of activity we saw with Skyrizi on both joint disease and skin clearance in our Phase III program and look forward to providing this new treatment to patients suffering from psoriatic arthritis. Our regulatory submissions are currently under review for Rinvoq in three new indications in the U.S.: ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. As we’ve previously announced, the FDA recently extended the review periods for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis following a request for an updated assessment of the benefit-risk profile for Rinvoq in these indications. In response to the FDA request, we provided updated data from across Rinvoq programs in RA, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. Based on the review extensions, we now expect approval decisions for psoriatic arthritis in June and for atopic dermatitis in July. The regulatory action date for Rinvoq in ankylosing spondylitis is unchanged and remains on track for June. We remain confident in the benefit-risk profile of Rinvoq across all indications and will work with the FDA to bring Rinvoq to market in these new disease areas. Earlier this year, we received European approval for Rinvoq in psoriatic arthritis and AS. Our European regulatory application for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis is under review and we remain on track for a CHMP opinion this summer with an approval decision anticipated in the third quarter. We also recently saw results from a four-week Phase Ib study evaluating our novel small molecule RORγT inverse agonist, ABBV-157, in patients with psoriasis. By targeting RORγT with an inverse agonist rather than an antagonist, we believe we can more effectively inhibit IL-17 production, thus resulting in a greater impact on skin inflammation. In our Phase 1b study, 157 showed promising activity as an oral psoriasis agent and we plan to move the asset forward to a larger Phase IIb dose ranging study in the second half of this year. Moving now to our oncology portfolio, we continue to make very good progress with our late stage programs for Imbruvica, Venclexta and Navitoclax, as well as with our early stage oncology assets. We remain on track for several key regulatory submissions, data presentations, and phase transitions this year. At the upcoming ASCO and EHA meetings, we will be presenting more than 40 abstracts, including results from the Imbruvica plus Venclexta CAPTIVATE trial fixed duration cohort in treatment-naïve CLL patients. The Imbruvica-Venclexta combination is an important element of our hema-on strategy to provide a differentiated fixed duration treatment that offers deeper levels of response. Data from our Imbruvica-Venclexta combination studies will support regulatory submissions in frontline CLL later this year. We will also be presenting four-year follow-up data from Venclexta’s CLL14 trial in frontline CLL as well as updated efficacy and safety data from a Phase Ib study evaluating Venclexta plus azacitidine in treatment-naïve, high risk MDS patients. We expect this MDS study to complete in the second half of this year and, if positive, it could support a submission in the first half of 2022 to seek an accelerated approval. In the area of solid tumors, at the recent AACR meeting we presented Phase II results for Teliso-V in non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, Teliso-V demonstrated promising response rates in heavily pretreated patients, particularly in patients with highly expressed c-Met where we saw a 54% objective response rate. c-Met is an attractive target across multiple tumor types, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer where approximately 30% of patients have over-expressed c-Met. Approaches in this area have historically focused on small molecule kinase inhibitors and anti c-Met antibodies, both of which have shown only limited efficacy in this patient population that has not been sufficient for approval. In contrast our c-Met antibody drug conjugate is a novel approach that we believe will have broader applicability and will provide enhanced efficacy compared to previous approaches. We recently began the second stage of our Phase II study which has the potential to support an accelerated approval in second line plus metastatic non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer. We also plan to evaluate Teliso-V in the frontline setting, including in combination with other agents, as well as in other c-Met positive tumor types. We also have a next-generation c-Met ADC program that will be entering the clinic later this year. Our new c-Met ADC, ABBV-400, utilizes a topoisomerase inhibitor payload which we believe will provide greater anti-tumor efficacy against both amplified Met and over-expressed c-Met subtypes, thus providing deeper responses with broader applicability than other anti c-Met targeting agents. In neuroscience, we recently presented data from several key programs at the American Academy of Neurology annual meeting. A total of 33 abstracts were presented, including data from the Phase III ADVANCE study in episodic migraine prevention, showing that Atogepant has the potential to be a highly effective, safe and well tolerated oral treatment option with a rapid onset of action. The FDA recently accepted our NDA for Atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine and an approval decision is expected in September of this year. We also presented results from an open label Phase III study evaluating Ubrelvy in perimenstrual migraine which showed that Ubrelvy has potential as a safe and efficacious treatment of migraine attacks that occur during or near menstruation. Menstrual-related migraine attacks can be more difficult to treat because they are often longer in duration, more severe, and often resistant to treatment. We presented data from a Phase I study demonstrating that ABBV-951 subcutaneous infusions maintain an equivalent Levodopa exposure to Duopa in advanced Parkinson’s patients. Results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 are expected this summer with the regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of this year. We also remain on track for readouts in the fourth quarter from two Phase III studies for Vraylar in adjunctive major depressive disorder and, if successful, we would anticipate regulatory submissions in the first half of 2022. In eye care, we submitted our regulatory application in the U.S. for AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. 584 is a once-daily eye drop being developed to help address symptoms that are often corrected through reading glasses. This new technology represents a complementary product to reading glasses and would be a convenient on-demand solution for patients with mild to moderate presbyopia. An approval decision is expected in the fourth quarter of this year. In esthetics, we are investing to accelerate key next generation toxins and filler programs. By combining the esthetic team’s deep expertise with AbbVie’s breadth and scale of resources, we’ll be able to bring novel products to market significantly faster. Looking across our portfolio, we’ve identified a number of programs to accelerate, including our short acting and long acting toxins, as well as our next generation bio-stimulatory tropoelastin and collagen fillers. Acceleration of these programs is expected to drive significant long term growth for the esthetics franchise. In summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline to start the year and we look forward to many more data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals throughout the remainder of 2021. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you Mike. Starting with first quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, up 21.9% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint. Total adjusted net revenues were $12.9 billion, up 5.2% on a comparable operational basis excluding a 1.1% favorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 51% of sales, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 11.6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 21.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $622 million and the adjusted tax rate was 12.3%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.37 and $12.57, reflecting growth of 18.8% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.10 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of 9.8% on a comparable operational basis. At current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This implies a full year revenue forecast of approximately $55.9 billion. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect international Humira revenue of approximately $3.1 billion and we now expect Botox cosmetic sales of approximately $1.9 billion. All other full year assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $13.6 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09, excluding approximately $1.78 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, we continue to make great progress on our Allergan transaction commitments. We realized over $360 million in expense synergies in the first quarter and are on track to deliver synergies of approximately $1.7 billion in 2021 and greater than $2 billion in 2022. We have already paid down $10.4 billion of combined company debt. We continue to expect cumulative debt pay down of $17 billion by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. This will bring our net leverage ratio to 2.4 times by the end of 2021 and approximately two times by the end of 2022. In closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interests of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please?
Operator: Our first question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Chris Schott: Great, thanks so much for the questions. The first one from me was on Rinvoq and dose. As we think about FDA balancing lowest effective dose versus incremental efficacy and safety risks, what would the impact of only having a 15 milligram versus a 15 and 30 milligram approval have on your view on the atopic derm opportunity, which I think you talked about is about a $2 billion sales potential previously? Then my second question was just a little bit more color on the esthetic dynamics. Is there anything we’re seeing with the results we’re seeing--very, very strong here, is there any catch-up type event as the world reopens that we’re seeing with these results, or are these sustainable underlying trends that are kind of coming in above expectations for that business? I’m trying to get a sense of just how to think about that progressing as we go through the rest of the year. Thanks so much.
Mike Severino: Thanks Chris, this is Mike. I’ll take the first question and then Rick will take the second question that you asked. With respect to Rinvoq, we feel very confident in the benefit-risk profile across indications and across the doses that we study. Having said that, both the 15 and 30 milligram doses have performed very well, both from an efficacy and a safety perspective, and so if you look at the efficacy results that we drove with 15 in atopic dermatitis, we drove high levels of response, very rapid response, and had a very prominent impact on itch, which is one of the most bothersome symptoms, with 15 as well as with 30. With the 15 milligram dose, for example, we saw statistically significant and clinically significant reduction in itch after only two days, which is really quite remarkable in this disease. Again, that’s really one of the most bothersome symptoms to patients. We think we could be successful with either dose, to answer your question specifically, but we also remain confident in the benefit-risk of both doses.
Rick Gonzalez: Chris, this is Rick. I’ll cover the esthetics one for you, as Mike said. I think if you look at the underlying performance of the esthetics business, in particular the market growth in the U.S. and in China, it’s driving the fundamental growth that we see through the business. Certainly there is some impacts still from COVID, so we’re seeing some impact there, but I think the majority of it is when we took over Allergan, we made a decision to really invest in promotion at a much higher level than they were investing in it prior, and they had an approach that was more of an episodic investment approach where we have basically made a decision that we’ll fund across the entire year at a relatively significant level to drive demand, because the data clearly supports that you can grow this market. I think the best comparison is to start to look at what it looked like versus 2019, because you obviously had the COVID impact in 2020, but you take for example Botox - Botox versus 2019, cosmetic Botox versus 2019, it’s up about 27%. The market’s growing very robustly. Some of that is probably COVID-driven - these are U.S. numbers I’m describing right now. Some of that is probably COVID-driven, but I wouldn’t say a lot of it at this point is COVID-driven in the U.S. China continues to grow very well - in fact, I’d say China is back to the level of growth, and we have expanded the sales force in China once, about four or five months ago. We’re in the process now of going through a second expansion in China and we expect that China will continue to drive significant growth going forward. The one area that still is being impacted in a fairly significant way from COVID is the European market. We still see it--we see it starting to emerge in areas like the U.K., but there are other areas in Europe that are still in lockdown. I would expect that Europe and Brazil as well will hopefully start to see some recovery as we get into the second half of this year and they can start to contribute, which would add additional growth to the overall business. But I would tell you I’m very pleased with the decisions we’ve made around driving more promotion, and I’m pleased with the execution of this team. This team has done extremely well in executing and driving the kind of share position that we want and the growth that we want, so I think it is sustainable going forward.
Chris Schott: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks Chris. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much, appreciate the couple questions. First Rick, something we don’t talk about a lot, which is the neuroscience portfolio, and you’ve started reporting it combined. I know there’s four products in there, but adding them up, the long term guidance you provided previously was about $8.3 billion, I think, and you’re already annualizing it close to $6 billion. Could you give us a sense of how much upside that portfolio has, given the trends that you’re seeing? Then on a related question, I hate to harp on the JAK question, but obviously there’s a lot coming to us from what this impact might be, so if you were confined to the 15 milligram dose not because of any signal but because of the regulators’ view of the safety of the class, how much impact would that have on the $8 billion long term guidance, and do you have other levers which you could pull to fill whatever shortfall that would cause? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: On the neuroscience portfolio, it is an area that we’re very excited about, so maybe Jeff and I will tag team here. But I think when you look at the two major growth franchises there, being the migraine franchise and the anti-psychotic franchise with Vraylar, both of those, we think, have significant opportunity to continue to grow. You’re obviously seeing Ubrelvy now perform extremely well in the marketplace - I think Jeff can probably give you a little more color on that, and Vraylar is continuing to perform very well as well. I think if we are able to achieve one positive study on MDD, I think that will give us significant growth going forward. This is a franchise that we’re excited about. I think it will be a meaningful franchise for us over the long term scenario where we continue to look at assets that we could potentially add to it, and I think it will be a nice growth driver for us. Jeff?
Jeff Stewart: Yes, I think just to reiterate, as I mentioned in my comments, the oral CGRP market is moving very nicely. It’s hit, I mentioned 16% for the quarter, but now on the weeklies it’s 17% or above on just the penetration of that segment, so we see a lot of runway in that segment over our long range planning. Certainly the availability of another oral CGRP, in this case for episodic migraine, allows us to compete in a much larger segment beyond the acute, and to Rick’s point, remember we have the big anchor asset with Botox therapeutic in migraine on the back end for chronic migraine and we have plans in place to expand that upstream also into episodic migraine. This is actually in some ways non-overlapping because we have a big injector base for Botox and then we can have the neurologist and primary care base for Atogepant, and so when you look basically really across the waterfront - you know, leading acute agent, oral, very, very potent and active oral agent in the middle with episodic, and then on the back end with Botox, it’s a very nice portfolio for us that will drive growth. As Rick mentioned, we are encouraged on the potential for adjunctive MDD, and that segment itself when we do the market analysis is about as large, the adjunctive MDD segment, as bipolar depression, and so this basically has the opportunity for us to really double the potential penetration over our long range plans, so we’re very encouraged over this set of assets.
Rob Michael: And Geoff, this is Rob. I would just add, if you can take the pieces we’ve given in terms of long term guidance, for Vraylar we’ve talked about approaching $4 billion with the current approved indications. For migraine, both Ubrelvy and Atogepant, we’ve talked about peak potential greater than a billion for each of those assets, and then we have Duopa plus we have 951 in the pipeline, that I think can drive significant growth in addition to our early stage pipeline in neuroscience, so I do see that as a therapeutic area that will drive long term growth for the company going forward.
Geoffrey Porges: Great, thanks. Then the JAKs?
Rick Gonzalez: On the JAKs, we’ve obviously evaluated carefully the positioning of the product. I think if we look at where we are today, one, we’re confident in the high dose that has a good risk-benefit profile, but I would tell you it wouldn’t change our guidance going forward. The assumptions that we have made in areas like atopic dermatitis, we believe we can get to those assumptions without the high dose. That doesn’t mean that we don’t want the high dose, but at the end of the day I believe we will maintain the guidance that we have based on that.
Jeff Stewart: The other thing that I would point out is that we’ve had additional data on upadacitinib Rinvoq across a number of areas since that guidance, including IBD, so we’ve had the UC data that have come largely since that guidance, and those have exceeded our expectations, and so we remain confident overall in the performance of Rinvoq.
Geoffrey Porges: Great, thanks Jeff.
Liz Shea: Thanks Geoffrey. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.
Andrew Baum: Many thanks. A couple of questions, please. There’s not much bipartisan agreement in the U.S. over drug price reform but there seems to be a lot when it come to antitrust in relation to the pharmaceutical industry. Perhaps Rick could comment, following last night’s House Committee on the Judiciary, where there was lots of pointed talk from both sides focusing firstly on patent thickets, second on having a presumption of anticompetitive behavior in terms of assessment of large scale in particular M&A, meaning that it would impact future business development for the industry, so that’s the first question. Then the second question, rather more positive, in terms of the JAK, when I look at consensus, the forecasts for Rinvoq are about $6 billion. When you look at the size of the opportunity in RA alone, let alone psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, UC, and the other indications you have, is it conceivable to you, short of this drug effectively or the class being heavily limited or pulled from the market, that that $6 billion looks like an incredibly conservative estimate for what this drug could do?
Rick Gonzalez: Andrew, this is Rick. I’ll comment maybe on your point of view around the antitrust discussions. Clearly I’ve accepted the invitation to be able to testify to the Committee on May 18. We certainly feel absolutely comfortable and confident in the way we operate in this market. This is a highly competitive market where Humira competes, and certainly as we look at the patents that were issued for Humira, they went through a rigorous process in order to be issued. They represent true innovation to the product. They were challenged by competitors, just like every competitor has a right to challenge a patent if they don’t believe it’s valid or appropriate, and those patents were challenged and the vast majority of those patents survived that challenge. What I’d say is when we look at our behavior in this market, I think our behavior was absolutely pro competitive. We had patents that went all the way out to 2034 in that portfolio and yet we chose to license every single biosimilar player in 2023, literally 11 years before the last patent would have expired. I feel highly confident in the position that we have taken in this marketplace, that we have operated totally appropriately. Your next question on Rinvoq--I’m sorry, I was thinking about the first one. Can you repeat your question?
Andrew Baum: I will. Just finishing on the first, so you reference your future testimony. I guess it was more general rather than just AbbVie-centric, how it would impact BD and the ability of the industry to operate if pricing can’t get resolved. But moving onto the second question, my question was whether consensus forecasts for Rinvoq look unrealistically conservative given the scale of the opportunity and given in RA alone, looking at the size of that market, it’s a progressive disease, that you don’t actually need atopic dermatitis to get in excess of where consensus currently pegs forecasts, which when look, about $6 billion.
Rob Michael: Andrew, this is Rob. I’ll start and then I’ll hand it over to Jeff. I think we agree with you - we do think consensus is conservative. We’ve given 2025 guidance of $8 billion for Rinvoq, and we would expect it to grow beyond 2025. When I look at the current consensus, obviously as you quoted, it’s a little bit--just a little bit above $6 billion from the numbers that I’m looking at, and I look at the growth beyond ’25, it’s nowhere near what we’re expecting, so we feel very good about the opportunity there. I think what we covered with you in December still holds as we’ve broken out the contribution by indication. We still feel very good about that, but we would agree that consensus is very conservative right now.
Jeff Stewart: Yes, thanks Rob, this is Jeff. Agree - these are spectacular assets with incredibly dynamic market, so we see across the rheumatology markets, the atopic derm market, we see the IBD market which with both assets we think is underappreciated. I mean, even expansion in second and third lines as new assets come in that are really breakthrough assets with higher levels of efficacy, and so we clearly believe that consensus is conservative here. Just a comment on atopic derm - this is an explosive market. I mean, it is significantly underdeveloped in terms of the penetration, so it’s going to grow substantially, and even if you look at conservative assumptions on where we source business - you know, the growth of the second line, that’s not to say that we’re not going to be very competitive in front line. It’s a very, very attractive space. Again, I think the performance that we’ve seen, the clinical performance that we’ve seen right now, primarily on the induction trials for Skyrizi and Rinvoq, Skyrizi in Crohn’s, Rinvoq in UC, is very, very encouraging, so we see that cascading over our long range plans as well. We are very, very bullish and agree that consensus is conservative.
Andrew Baum: Many thanks.
Liz Shea: Thank you Andrew. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.
Vamil Divan: Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe a couple, if I could, on the migraine side. First on Ubrelvy, you mentioned it looks like the class is doing very well and gaining share. It also looks like over the last few weeks or so, you’ve been gaining a little share within the class relative to Nurtec, so I’m just wondering if you can share your perspective on what you think is driving that. Some of us thought it might be due to pricing and access, but based on our calculations, it looks like your gross to net is actually lower than what it is from the Biohaven side, so any perspective would be helpful. Then on Atogepant, maybe just a little more, if you could talk to your go-to-market strategy, assuming approval in September, especially given Nurtec will likely have an indication for both treatment and prevention. How do you see coming in with two separate drugs - you know, could be two co-pays, could be just a different message relative to a single drug, so just any perspective on how competing with that would be helpful as well. Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: It’s Jeff. In terms of the acute market, as I mentioned, the penetration of the overall segment is increasing very, very nicely, as I highlighted. If you look at the mix between Ubrelvy and Nurtec, we have gained a little bit over the last few weeks, but it’s very close. We typically run at 51%, 52%, 53% of the new prescription basis. I think you are quite perceptive over the value creation that’s taking place there, and I clearly don’t have full insight into the Biohaven fall through, but we’ve been quite disciplined. We have over 90% commercial access, so we’re quite comfortable where we are from an overall access perspective, and our team remains quite disciplined in terms of making sure that we both drive the right type of volume with our positioning but also the right type of profitability over time. We’re encouraged with our continued momentum with Ubrelvy. In terms of Atogepant, I think what’s quite impressive about our program there is just the sheer level of efficacy that we have, and I think this is very important in terms of sometimes the narrative over simple or easy versus, look, how do you think about the best drug for episodic prevention, particularly when you choose an oral, so we are at the very, very high end of the migraine freedom or the days of migraine control with this new asset, and we think that frankly you need to take care of the migraine and Atogepant will be very well positioned to do that. We also think that we’ll have nice synergies. Obviously we have a fairly significant sales force that is promoting Ubrelvy to both neurologist and high prescribing general practitioners, and it will fit in very well as we put Atogepant into that sales fleet, so we’re set up well, we think, for our go-to-market.
Vamil Divan: Okay, thank you very much.
Liz Shea: Thanks Vamil. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Tim Anderson: Thank you. A couple of questions please. I haven’t heard really any drug company this reporting season talk about future potential austerity measures in ex-U.S. geographies, meaning broad-based price cuts following the impact of COVID. As a company, as one of the few companies that’s given detailed long term financial guidance, I’m guessing you have been thinking about this, and I’m wondering how you are currently viewing this in terms of its likelihood of occurring, what the magnitude could be and what the timing might be. Then second question just on an early stage pipeline asset, your TNF-steroid antibody drug conjugate, I believe you have in-house probably a fair amount of data that the markets haven’t seen yet. I’m wondering when we might see additional human data and what your current level of enthusiasm is towards that platform.
Rick Gonzalez: Tim, this is Rick. I’ll cover the OUS austerity measures. Certainly if we go back to 2008, we saw that kind of an impact, so as we were building out our long range plan, we have made some sets of assumptions around that. I would expect that we will see some pressure outside the U.S. going forward over the next couple of years. It’s certainly manageable within the expectations that we have built for the business going forward, certainly based on that level of experience that we’ve seen historically - it’s manageable. It is something that we have contemplated and I would frankly expect to see some level of pressure going forward.
Mike Severino: This is Mike, I’ll take the second question. With respect to the TNF-steroid conjugate program, we’re obviously advancing ABBV-154. We have a large Phase IIb RA study that will start this quarter, and then we’re starting studies in additional immune-mediated conditions as well over the course of the year. With respect to publication of the data from 3373, which is the closely related compound from the same platform that we top line results some time ago, I think you can expect to see more detailed data over the course of the summer.
Liz Shea: Thanks Tim. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with Cowen. Your line is open.
Steve Scala: Many thanks. First on Rinvoq, I’m curious what additional safety data has FDA been provided that it did not have previously, and has all of it been previously presented and if not, what was the conclusion of what now has been submitted, so that’s the first question. Secondly regarding Imbruvica, to what extent can AbbVie tease out COVID impact on new patient starts versus competition from new frontline agents? Thank you.
Mike Severino: This is Mike, I’ll take the first question, and then Rick will handle the second. With respect to Rinvoq, the additional safety data that were presented to the FDA or provided to the FDA are essentially a roll forward of the analysis that we did at the time of the NDA submission. Obviously our database continues to grow, we accumulate patient years experience, and so there weren’t fundamentally new analyses but we did an updated assessment with the additional data that have accrued in the time between submission and when we submitted those responses. What I would say is the data that we reviewed have not changed our impression of benefit-risk in any way. I think they’re very consistent with all of the data that have been publicly presented. Obviously since they represent data that were current up to the time that we submitted just a few weeks ago, not all of these data have been presented in the public domain, but I would say that our response is very consistent with what we have described publicly in the past.
Rick Gonzalez: On your second question - this is Rick, we get data on new patient starts, so we have relatively, I think, accurate data. It’s offset by a couple of months - I’ll have Jeff maybe talk about it in a little more detail, so we know any CLL patient, when they start, regardless of therapy, we can measure that, and obviously we can measure again what type of therapy they start on, so I think the level of data integrity that we operate with from a market standpoint here is pretty good. It’s offset by a few months, and maybe Jeff can speak to the time offset.
Jeff Stewart: Yes, so Steve, it’s Jeff. We have pretty good visibility to what’s happening from the share perspective versus the market start perspective. I’ll give you some flavor. With regard to Calquence, we can see the impact of the approvals in the front and second line CLL, and it’s largely consistent with what our expectations were, so they’re ramping in a similar fashion to what we saw in the MCL or NHL, so we know that there’s some impact on Imbruvica there. The largest impact has been, unfortunately, into the market, and unfortunately I mean for the patient. I’ll give you a little bit of the numbers. Typically the CLL market, which is the largest driver, it grows sort of at a population level, like 2% every year. If you look at the impact from COVID, we can see almost three different waves - we can see a wave where the new patient starts in the market, we’re down in the high teens in the first part. Then it started to claw back a little bit into the single digits down, and then it got hit again into the teens in the August period and we saw it down again in early January, about 18%. We can see what’s happening, and as I mentioned in my remarks, the biggest impact here has been on continued market suppression due to COVID.
Rob Michael: Steve, this is Rob. I would just remind you also on the first quarter that we had the stocking impact from COVID last year, so if you adjust for that, it’s about a four point impact on Imbruvica’s growth year-over-year due to the prior year comp with the stocking impact.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks Steve. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
David Risinger: Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on the results and updates. I have two questions. First, just to follow on, on that comment, could you just help us understand a little bit more about why Imbruvica is such an outlier in the cancer market, why the pandemic is hitting Imbruvica very hard whereas the pandemic is not hitting other cancer agents so hard? Then second, with respect to esthetics, it’s obviously booming, and it is validating your acquisition of Allergan. But I think that you updated guidance for the year for Botox cosmetic to $1.9 billion, and that implies flat sequential sales from the $477 million that you booked in the first quarter, so if you could explain that please. Thank you.
Mike Severino: This is Mike. I’ll take the first question and then others will comment on your second question. With respect to why Imbruvica is being hit harder than other anti-cancer agents in the pandemic, I think it has to do with the underlying rate of progression CLL. CLL, while it is a very significant limiter of long-term function and survival, in the short term there’s a sense that therapy can be delayed if necessary because the rate of progression is relatively slower than other forms of cancer, for example certainly much slower than AML, another indication that we are very active in, in the hema-on space. I think in the setting of the pandemic, that’s why you are seeing more deferrals for start-up therapy and, in some cases, longer time to switch a therapy, which would explain why Imbruvica dynamics are different than other anti-cancer agents that treat other diseases.
Rob Michael: David, this is Rob. On your question regarding Botox cosmetic, we did see in the first quarter, if you just look at toxins market growth, it’s over 30% in the first quarter. There is some impact from pent-up demand as we come out of the pandemic, but we feel very good about the forecast we put forward. We obviously took it up $100 million, so it’s essentially pass through to beat in the quarter. I’d say your math on flat sequentially, I think it’s up a little bit, but really if you consider that we did have some level of pent-up demand come through in the quarter, you’ve got to back that out to truly understand the underlying demand dynamics.
David Risinger: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks David. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Ronny Gal: Hi everybody. Congratulations on a very nice quarter, and thank you for fitting me in. Two questions, if I may. First, there was data presented from Richter about negative symptom improvement using Vraylar. I was wondering what was your take on the data in terms of your ability to use it in the United States, is it something that you’re considering doing with [indiscernible], could this potentially be added to the label, and so forth. Second, the growth in Botox neurology is really impressive. It seems relatively odd that there was such a big jump in the middle of a wave of the epidemic in January-February for a physician-administered product. Can you just give us a flavor of what’s the underlying trends there, is there just a lot more success that you’re having in pushing first patients who failed [indiscernible] into Botox? How should we think about this?
Mike Severino: This is Mike. I’ll take the first question and then others will comment on your second question. With respect to negative symptoms and the treatment of those negative symptoms in schizophrenia, it’s a very challenging area, it’s a very important area because they’re responsible for much of the long term loss of function in patients who suffer from schizophrenia. It has been a very difficult are to approach in general, and we believe Vraylar has a good profile there and has a good overall impact on the disease, a very strong overall impact on the disease, but it’s also one that’s been very challenging from a labeling perspective in the U.S. It’s been a very difficult claim to get in the U.S. It’s not clear that there is a specific path to negative symptoms in the label, but I do think the overall profile of Vraylar in schizophrenia, both with respect to symptom control and benefit risk, are viewed very positively by treating physicians, and I think the overall benefits are well understood by treating physicians and I think that is reflected in Vraylar’s overall strong performance.
Jeff Stewart: It’s Jeff. In regard to Botox, it’s insightful because we are seeing some robust activity, particularly in migraine. I think there’s a couple reasons for that. One, Rick highlighted the sales force dynamics in China. We’ve definitely focused our sales team on the migraine component. The other thing that’s taken place is a little bit, I think, of an investment approach. We’ve had more consistent consumer investment since we had the integration than previously at the legacy Allergan, so I think the combination of the consumer investment, new waves where if patients access an injector at a neurologist, they can get a sample of Botox right at their first appointment rather than wait for many months. There are various commercial reasons, we think, that give us a lot of encouragement on the therapeutic Botox performance, again specifically and particularly in migraine.
Ronny Gal: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks Ronny. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Terence Flynn: Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe two for me. I recognize there are still a lot of unknowns here, but how are you thinking about the potential headwind from any changes to corporate tax rates and guilty? Then given the progress you outlined on debt pay down, you’ll be back to about a two times leverage ratio, you mentioned. How are you thinking about capital allocation into the end of this year and into 2022? What types of assets are you focused on for BD and M&A? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick. I’ll cover the tax. As you said, it’s certainly early in the process and we obviously know what’s being proposed, but we don’t necessarily know where we will end up. I think one of the important things that we need to continue to think through is if we go back to--you know, one of the reasons why back in 2017 tax reform was passed was to make sure that two things happened: one, that U.S.-based companies were competitive with their foreign competitors, and two, it encouraged companies like ours to invest in the United States. I can certainly talk about the AbbVie example. I think it’s pretty compelling when you sit back and look at--you know, we were able to go out and acquire a Irish company, re-domicile it back to the United States. AbbVie today has 24,000 jobs in the United States. We’ve also increased investment significantly in the U.S. since tax reform. Over the last three years, we’ve invested $1.5 billion, we committed that we’d do $2.5 billion over time. We’re going to exceed that commitment. We’ve added about 1,500 jobs over that period of time. Companies like ours clearly took the benefit of tax reform and that has allowed us to be able to be more competitive and certainly in the acquisition of a company like Allergan, I think that was clearly demonstrated, but we also have invested much more aggressively in the U.S. I think going forward, one of the things that important for policymakers to balance is to make sure that we don’t go back to where we were, and that is where U.S. companies aren’t as competitive against their foreign competitors. The current proposal would make the U.S. have the highest rate of all developed countries - I’m not sure that’s the position you’d want to be in, so hopefully as we go forward, there will be a balance that’s looked at in raising taxes but also making companies maintain a competitive position and continue to be incented to invest in the U.S.
Rob Michael: Terence, this is Rob. On your question regarding capital allocation, I’ll start and then Mike will add more color in terms of BD. We’ve said all along that we will continue to de-lever through 2023, so think about that net leverage ratio getting to two times in ‘22, the balance sheet would be in very good shape, but we want to continue to pay down the debt through ’23. During that period, we’ve allocated $2 billion of capital for business development. You’ve seen us do some very nice deals, whether you look at Genmab, I-Mab, we’ve done a number of nice transactions in this space with that amount of capital. I’ll let Mike speak to future opportunities as well.
Mike Severino: In terms of the areas in which we would expect to be active between now and the end of 2022, we’ll continue to be active in oncology, both in hematological oncology and in solid tumors. That has been an area of focus for us, and I see that continuing as an area of focus. We would certainly like to add to the esthetics franchise - we’ve talked about how we will invest and continue to drive that franchise, and from a business development perspective, I think there are a number of opportunities there that could present themselves in that time frame. There are other areas that opportunistically we would certainly like to add to - I would point to neuroscience, if we could find the right opportunities, and eye care as additional areas where we could be investing.
Liz Shea: Thanks Terence. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Daniel Busby with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Daniel Busby: Hi, good morning. I’d like to ask a follow-up on esthetics and your high single digit annual growth target for that business over the next decade. Broadly speaking, how much of that growth is dependent on bringing new products to market, such as long and short acting toxins, versus driving continued growth from the esthetics portfolio that you have today? Second, as we near the one-year anniversary of your acquisition of Allergan, can you provide updated thoughts on your appetite for potential divestitures of non-core products or therapeutic areas now that you’ve had about a year to digest that transaction? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick. I’ll cover that, and maybe Rob can tag team along here. I think if you look at our overall estimate of high single digit growth on esthetics, it’s not heavily reliant on a large number of new products. There will be new products that come in - they’re probably closer towards the back end of the long range plan so they don’t have a significant impact on that overall growth rate, so I think we fundamentally believe that the market dynamics are such and the brands are competitive, highly competitive in this market, that we have the ability to grow the market and continue to maintain our share position in that market, and that will allow us to be able to drive that level of growth or higher.
Rob Michael: This is Rob. I would just add that if you look at the esthetics business, we’ll see significant growth not just from toxins and fillers, but also in body contouring, so as we think about the potential for that leg of the stool, we think we’ve got really three key drivers of growth within esthetics that will help us get to that high single digit long term expectation. Again, as Rick mentioned, we’re not counting on a significant contribution to the pipeline, although we will continue to drive innovation particularly with toxins and fillers, and of course as you’ve heard before, it’s important within body contouring to continue to drive innovation there as well, so we feel very good about that outlook and we’re not counting on a ton from the pipeline there.
Rick Gonzalez: And your second question, I would say even before the Allergan acquisition, we constantly looked at our portfolio and determined whether or not there were areas of our business that we ultimately though we were interested in divesting. I’d say that’s a process that we go through on a fairly consistent basis to ensure that we’re maximizing the value of the assets that we have within our portfolio, and so we will continue to do that. When we find opportunities where we think that’s the right strategy, then we’ll execute against that strategy.
Liz Shea: Thanks Daniel. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Gary Nachman: Thanks. A couple more from me in Rinvoq. Are you hearing anecdotally any physicians that may be switching patients from Xeljanz to Rinvoq in RA, if there is a perceived safety benefit with Rinvoq as a more selective JAK, are you able to take advantage of that at all? Then secondly, if Rinvoq gets approved for atopic derm, how will you look to build out your presence with dermatologists? Will you leverage your current footprint on the esthetics side, or will you have a completely different medical derm team? Just talk about how you go after that opportunity and how you’re preparing for it, given your clear level of excitement there. Thank you.
Jeff Stewart: Hi, it’s Jeff, and I’ll take both of those. We’re actually not hearing physicians, from our intelligence, from our field teams, actively thinking to switch patients from Xeljanz to Rinvoq. I mean, that’s a big decision for a physician. What we have heard is when we do some of our research and our ear to the ground, we clearly see that oral surveillance is perceived as a Xeljanz issue, so typically what will happen is you may see people take their foot off the gas on some new starts, but we don’t see or hear certainly any widespread news of active switching, so that’s basically our intelligence on your first question. In terms of your second question, we will not be using the esthetics sales force. We will basically leverage our existing infrastructure that we have with some expansion we’ve taken place for Rinvoq in atopic dermatitis. I think as you know, in terms of our reputation amongst the medical derms is extremely strong. We have the number one reputation because of the years of Humira in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and HS, and obviously we have a very, very strong impression and launch from Skyrizi, so we’ve basically designed a sales force that through our management, which has been connected to these derms for more than a decade, and existing reps with some new reps in there, we are building--we have built a sales force that will work seamlessly with our Skyrizi teams to give a very nice offering to those dermatologists. An important fact is that basically the overlap of those dermatologists that drive basically the atopic derm market is about 90% between the atopic derm market and the psoriasis market, so we feel we’re well positioned in terms of how we’ve set up our go-to-market approach with the segment.
Liz Shea: Thanks Gary. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
Gregg Gilbert: Thank you. Mike, I was interested in your oral psoriasis commentary. Are you assuming that a new bar has been set by deucravacitinib in terms of efficacy versus Otezla, and is that something you’re very mindful of as you consider your own programs? Secondly for Rick, I realize AbbVie was born out of a company that had devices and pharma under one roof, but clearly you’ve embraced esthetics, for example, that good franchise building could involve drugs and devices or drugs that need to be delivered by device. Does that apply as you think ahead about ophthalmology or other areas when you consider long term BD? Thank you.
Mike Severino: This is Mike. I’ll take the first question. With respect to oral psoriasis agents, we would want to come in from an efficacy perspective with something that clearly exceeded the threshold that existed in the past with Otezla, and I think coming in a range that is Humira-like or better would be our goal. I think if you look at BMS’ Tyk2, they sort of come in at that Humira-like efficacy, and so I think that is generally the range that we’re talking about. I think when one talks about a direct comparison in terms of where a bar is set, we have to look not only at efficacy but at safety and at the totality of the data. Obviously it’s extremely early for our RORγT agent, but we think it is a molecule, because it impacts very well understood biology with a good understanding of where to go from an efficacy perspective and a good understanding of safety, that we can get in a range that’s very competitive there, so I think we’d be looking for that Humira-like efficacy or greater as something that we would like to use to enter the space with in oral, obviously coupled with a strong safety profile.
Rick Gonzalez: On your second question, this is Rick. I think the way we approach the markets that we operate in is we look for areas where there is significant unmet need and then we ultimately try to come up with solutions for those needs. Sometimes it’s drug only - in fact, I’d say the majority of our historical experience as AbbVie has been drug-only, but as an example, 951 is a good example of where it’s a combination product, right - a device and a drug. Certainly as we look at ophthalmology, we have implantable devices that were part of the Allergan acquisition that are important therapeutic options, that are available for physicians and patients. I’d say we tend to go at it and we’re certainly not opposed to devices being part of it if they can add to the ability to be able to provide for an advancement in the standard of care. In esthetics, as Rob indicated a moment ago, we’re looking at what is that big third leg on the stool, and we believe that is body. I would say in the area of body, devices are going to play a much more critical role, and so that’s an area where I think you’ll see us embrace even device-only kinds of strategies because they provide the right solution for that particular improvement. It’s an area that historically many of us know well because of our experience, as you pointed out, in our previous life, but I’d say also the teams in the organization itself tend to look for broad-based solutions that can meet the unmet need.
Gregg Gilbert: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks Gregg. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Navin Jacob with UBS. Your line is open.
Navin Jacob: Hi, thanks so much for squeezing me in here. A couple if I may, if we have time. Just on Vraylar, you have strong long term guidance of $4 billion with just the existing indications, but the script trends at least seem to have slowed down, obviously in part because neuro has been weak as an overall therapeutic area during the pandemic. But just wondering--and just given that the quarter itself was a little bit weaker, I think, versus expectations, can you talk about the broader neuro market? Is that weakness there, because we do see strength with Ubrelvy and with Botox therapeutics, so just wondering if there’s something going on specifically with Vraylar? Has the bipolar depression opportunity been tapped out for some reason, and what can you and need to do to accelerate growth for Vraylar with the existing indication? That’s number one. Number two on Rinvoq, I think understands the rates around DVTP and MACE, but if you could give a little bit more clarity, based on the updated data that you’ve filed with the agency, what the rate of malignancy is across the indications, and whether that’s any different between the strengths and how that compares to the background rate. Thank you so much.
Jeff Stewart: Hi, it’s Jeff. I’ll take the Vraylar comment. The macro prescription market has been down a little bit versus historical trends, but we really think it’s simply a timing issue, and I’ll give you some numbers that support that. Before COVID hit, right in the first quarter of last year, the new to brand, or NBRx for Vraylar was about 3,500 new to brand prescriptions a week, and what we saw is during COVID, that dropped down all the way to about 2,700 - that was the nadir, and then it’s consistently come back up. Towards the end of March, we started to hit or recover that pre-COVID historical rate, so progress is there, and ultimately the way we see these markets function, as you recover your NBRx momentum, the TRx’s will start to come, so we’re encouraged on the latest trends. But your point is right - it has been a little bit soft on the market, and certainly as a brand Vraylar dropped because of COVID, but is now really fully recovered and so we should see continued recovery of the momentum there. Hopefully that helps.
Mike Severino: This is Mike. I’ll take your second question. With respect to the rates of malignancies, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer because that’s the way these rates are typically reviewed, I recently described a rate across Rinvoq studies with roughly 10,000 patient years experience of 0.8 events per 100 patient years experience, and that compared to an expected rate that was 0.9 or higher, depending on the estimate, so we’ll call it in the range of about 0.9 events, so not different from that expected rate and without any difference between doses, so no evidence of a dose response, and nothing that we’ve seen in the recent work that we’ve done changes that view in any way.
Liz Shea: Thanks Navin. That concludes today’s conference call. If you’d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you for your participation. Participants, you may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-03 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; and Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Commercial Operations. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AbbVie's operations and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable basis, which includes full year -- full current year and historical results for Allergan. For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast to conform to AbbVie's revenue recognition accounting policies and exclude the divestitures of Zenpep and Viokace. References to operational growth further excludes the impact of exchange. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 performance as well as our expectations for 2021. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our pipeline, and Rob will discuss the quarter and our 2021 guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.92, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08. Fourth quarter total net revenues were up nearly 7% on a comparable operational basis. This performance was driven by robust double-digit sales growth from our immunology, hem/onc and neuroscience franchises, as well as 9% comparable operational sales growth of Botox Cosmetic, which is demonstrating a rapid recovery. Our fourth quarter performance topped off another excellent and truly transformational year for AbbVie, which included the successful acquisition and integration of Allergan, creating a stronger and much more diverse AbbVie with leadership across numerous attractive high-growth markets. Significant contributions from our two new best in category immunology medicines, RINVOQ and SKYRIZI , which combined for more than $2.3 billion in 2020 sales, their first full year on the market. We expect the combined contribution from RINVOQ and SKYRIZI to nearly double in 2021 to approximately $4.6 billion based on their continued strong uptake in RA and psoriasis as well as RINVOQ’s anticipated approvals in PSA, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis later this year. We delivered continued robust growth from our leading hem/onc portfolio, with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA contributing more than $6.6 billion in combined 2020 sales. We expect our hem/onc franchise to grow double digits again in 2021. We also added two compelling oncology pipeline assets, Epcoritamab, a potential best-in-class CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody in development for B-cell malignancies and lemzoparlimab, an anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody being studied in multiple cancers. These two assets will further support the growth of our hem/onc franchise across our long-range plan. The acquisition of Allergan brought us a substantial neuroscience portfolio with compelling therapies for migraine and psychiatric conditions augmenting our already existing neuro franchise. The newly combined neuroscience franchise delivered nearly $4.9 billion in comparable 2020 revenue and is expected to grow double digits in 2021. We also added the leading global Aesthetics franchise, a largely cash pay portfolio with roughly $3.5 billion in comparable 2020 revenues. As I previously noted, this portfolio has demonstrated a rapid V-shape recovery and we view Aesthetics as an extremely attractive long-term growth opportunity. And importantly, we made excellent progress in 2020 with our pipeline. We expect our R&D pipeline advancements to lead to the approval of more than a dozen new products or indications over the next two years, including a total of six additional indications for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which will cover all of Humira's major indications plus new significant disease areas, including atopic dermatitis, expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and Vraylar and several new product approvals, including Atogepant for episodic migraine, Navitoclax for myelofibrosis and ABBV-951, a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. These new opportunities will collectively add meaningful revenue growth in advance of the U.S. Humira LOE. We've entered 2021 in a strong position, which is reflected in our revenue and earnings per share guidance. Based on the recent outperformance of our business, we expect full-year 2021 comparable operational sales growth of approximately 9.4% with total AbbVie sales expected to be approximately $1.7 billion above current consensus, and we anticipate 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $12.32 to $12.52, representing growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. This level of guidance represents impressive performance with nearly all aspects of our business expected to perform at or above current consensus for 2021. The Allergan integration continues to go very well. The transition has been seamless despite the size of the transaction and the timing of the COVID pandemic. While we're making excellent progress against our expense synergies, which Rob will cover in more detail here momentarily, it remains increasingly clear to us that there are significant opportunities for long-term revenue contributions across numerous Allergan growth platforms. As we recently disclosed, we believe UBRELVY , the first-to-market in leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. Atogepant, a potential once-daily oral treatment for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine also represents a $1 billion-plus peak sales opportunity. We expect Vraylar's peak sales to approach $4 billion within its currently approved indications of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder and bipolar depression with major depressive disorder or MDD, representing a potentially significant incremental growth opportunity. Aesthetics, which is poised to regain its growth trajectory this year is expected to generate high single-digit revenue growth over the next decade. We continue to closely monitor the COVID dynamics, which will have an impact on our business again in 2021, predominantly in the first half of the year, but significantly moderated from the 2020 impact. And despite the recent COVID resurgence within select geographies, we feel the global healthcare system is much better equipped with COVID treatment protocols in PPE to safely see and treat patients throughout the current year. That said, some therapeutic areas continue to be more impacted than others, like CLL, HCV, certain hospital-based procedures, among others, which we have contemplated in our 2021 guidance. Overall, we've been pleased with the rate of recovery across our business, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and our commercial execution. So in summary, we've assembled an impressive set of growth assets and the outlook for AbbVie's business remains strong. With RINVOQ and SKYRIZI expected to contribute more than $15 billion in risk-adjusted sales by 2025 and our expectations for continued robust growth across hem/onc, neuroscience, and aesthetics, we have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to successfully absorb the Humira LOE impact in 2023, support an immediate return to total sales growth in 2024 and produce compelling high single-digit compounded annual total sales growth in 2025 through the remainder of the decade with the diversified portfolio and pipeline that we have today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. We've clearly made significant progress with our pipeline over the past few years, particularly our late-stage programs in hematologic oncology with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, and in immunology with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. Since inception, our R&D organization has delivered an impressive set of new products, which collectively contributed approximately $11 billion in revenue in 2020. We also continue to see significant evolution of our early and mid-stage clinical programs with many assets expected to transition to late-stage registrational studies over the next several years. We will continue to replenish our late-stage pipeline with innovative assets that have the potential to drive additional growth for AbbVie in the second half of the decade. At our recent immunology investor event in December, we provided a detailed overview of our immunology programs, highlighting the robust data generated to-date for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI across approved and pipeline indications. Included in this event, we presented positive topline data from two new Phase 3 studies for RINVOQ . Results from the first induction study in ulcerative colitis and results from the head-to-head study versus dupilumab in atopic dermatitis. We expect to see results from the second Phase 3 UC induction study later this quarter, and from the UC maintenance study in the middle of this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. Our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis are currently under review and we expect an approval decision in the US in the second quarter based on priority review and in Europe in the second half of the year. We recently received European Commission approval for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and expect approval decisions for those indications in the US in the first half of this year. I want to take a moment to address the topic of safety, specifically MACE and malignancies following the results from tofacitinib's post-marketing safety study. At present, there are no data to suggest the safety outcomes from their study applied to a specific JAK1 inhibitor such as RINVOQ. We are not aware of any signal for an elevated risk of MACE or malignancies with the RINVOQ or any JAK inhibitor other than Xeljanz. We conducted a pooled database analysis across our clinical trials for DVT, MACE and malignancies at the time of RINVOQ’s regulatory submission and have updated it periodically including up to the present. Rates with RINVOQ have not been elevated relative to competitors or to expected baseline rates. Importantly, there has been no increase or meaningful change in those rates over time. Additionally, we adjudicate events for MACE and DVT, which is considered the highest standard of evidence. If we look across our long-term database in RA, a population that is at increased risk for MACE events, our rates remain low. At the approved dose in RA, we have followed more than 3,700 treated patients totaling more than 9,000 patient-years' experience. Our rate of MACE events is 0.4 per 100 patient-years, which compares favorably to the expected rate of 1.0 to 1.7 events for 100 patient-years. In addition, there is no evidence of a dose-response between the 15 and 30-milligram doses. Similarly, the rate of malignancy, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer with similar follow-up is 0.8 events per100 patient-years. This rate is also consistent with the expected range of rates of 0.86 to 0.94 per 100 patient-years. And again, we see no evidence of a dose-response between 15 and 30-milligrams. Moving now to SKYRIZI; we also recently reported top-line results from the Phase 3 programs for SKYRIZI in Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. In the two Crohn's induction studies, SKYRIZI demonstrated significant improvements in clinical remission and endoscopic endpoints compared to placebo with symptom improvement seen as early as week four. Based on the data generated to date, we believe SKYRIZI has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We expect to see results from the maintenance study in Crohn's disease later this year with regulatory submissions anticipated in the second half of 2021. We're also very pleased with SKYRIZI’s results in the Phase 3 studies in psoriatic arthritis, where we saw significant improvements in disease activity across both skin and joint endpoints compared to placebo. We believe that the activity we have seen on joint disease and the impressive skin clearance that is a hallmark of the SKYRIZI program make it a compelling offering for patients with mixed joint and skin involvement. We plan to submit our regulatory applications for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis in the first half of this year. We're making good progress with our early and mid-stage immunology programs as well where we expect several data readouts and phase transitions in 2021. We expect to begin three new studies for ABBV-154, our TNF steroid conjugate including a Phase 2b dose-ranging study in RA as well as Phase 2 studies in Crohn's disease and polymyalgia rheumatica. And we'll see proof-of-concept data in the second quarter for ravagalimab, our CD40 antagonist in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, and for ABBV-157, our oral ROR-gamma T inhibitor in Phase 1 for psoriasis. Both of these programs experienced slight COVID-related delays with results now expected for both in the second quarter of this year. In oncology, we continue to make significant progress advancing our pipeline with numerous data readouts and regulatory milestones last year. As well as the addition of several new assets brought in through our in-licensing efforts, including Genmab's CD3xCD20 epcoritamab and I-Mab's anti-CD47 lemzoparlimab. We showcased new data from several programs at the recent ASH meeting where we presented nearly 40 abstracts from eight different assets. Notable presentations included data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE trial evaluating IMBRUVICA plus VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL, which showed patients who achieved undetectable MRD following this combination maintain their deep remission at the one-year mark after stopping therapy with a 95% rate of disease free survival. We also presented new five-year data from VENCLEXTA’s Murano trial demonstrating the benefits of fixed duration VENCLEXTA combinations and helping patients achieve sustained progression-free survival. The latest results from Murano in the relapsed refractory CLL setting showed a median progression-free survival of 54 months in the VENCLEXTA and rituximab group, compared to 17 months in the bendamustine-rituximab group, three or more years after stopping treatment. Updated dose-escalation data from a Phase 1 study evaluating epcoritamab in B-cell malignancies were also presented at ASH. Epcoritamab is a subcutaneously delivered bispecific CD3xCD20 antibody being developed in collaboration with Genmab. In the Phase 1 study, epcoritamab demonstrated encouraging single agent anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with a consistent and favorable safety profile showing no Grade 3 or higher CRS events as well as limited neurotoxicity. We believe epcoritamab has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy across a number of B-cell malignancies including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. The Phase 3 trial in relapsed-refractory DLBCL recently began and we will provide updates on epcoritamab as its development program progresses. Initial results were also presented from a Phase 1 study evaluating TNB-383B in relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma. TNB-383B is a novel bispecific T-cell engaging immunotherapy targeting BCMA and CD3 being developed in collaboration with TeneoBio. These Phase 1 results demonstrated that the BCMA/CD3 bispecific provided overall response rates of 80% with a large number of patients achieving a very good partial response or better despite having received multiple prior lines of therapy. TNB-383B was well tolerated at all doses tested with a few off-target toxicities and no Grade 3 or higher CRS observed. With its safety profile efficacy and the convenience of once every three-week dosing, this agent has the potential to become a promising treatment option for myeloma patients. And our partner I-Mab published an abstract with initial results from a Phase 1 study evaluating lemzoparlimab in AML and MDS. These results demonstrated encouraging activity in relapsed-refractory AML patients and lemzoparlimab was well tolerated with no serious hematological adverse events reported today. Based on these promising initial results, we plan to begin new studies this year for lemzoparlimab in AML, MDS and in multiple myeloma. We also recently saw data from an interim analysis of a Phase 2 study evaluating Teliso-V in heavily pretreated non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer patients. The encouraging results from Stage 1 of this study met the criteria for advancing the program. With Teliso-V demonstrating a 54% objective response rate in patients with wild-type EGFR with highly expressed c-MET. In EGFR wild-type patients with over-expressed c-MET, which includes both high and intermediate expression, the objective response rate was 35%. Based on these results, we believe that there is an important role for Teliso-V in this target population, which represents roughly 25% of the non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer population. We will be opening the second stage of the study and are planning discussions with regulators regarding the potential of this study to support an accelerated filing. We expect 2021 to be another important year for our oncology pipeline with several regulatory submissions as well as data readouts across all stages of development. This year, we expect to see data for IMBRUVICA in the Phase 3 SHINE study in frontline MCL with regulatory submissions expected in the second half of the year. Data for IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA in second line or greater MCL and frontline CLL with regulatory submission for frontline CLL expected in the second half of the year. We also expect to see data from registration enabling studies for VENCLEXTA in high-risk MDS and navitoclax in relapsed-refractory myelofibrosis. And we expect to see data from numerous programs in our early-stage oncology pipeline. In addition, the programs under collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. Our partnered effort is comprised of a strong pipeline of novel targets, which includes more than 20 active programs in discovery or preclinical development. Importantly, we currently have programs, which have advanced into clinical development in two areas immuno-oncology and neurodegeneration. The lead Calico program in oncology is focused on PTPN2 inhibitors, which act at multiple steps in the cancer immunity cycle and have potential applicability in a broad variety of tumor types. The discovery of novel orally bio-available PTPN2 inhibitors represents a significant breakthrough and a target class that has historically been considered un-druggable. We currently have two assets in Phase 1 development ABBV-CLS-579 and 484. We've seen evidence of immune activation in the clinic with this pathway and we expect to see proof-of-concept data from this program in 2022. The lead Calico program in neuroscience is an eIF2B activator, which targets a key regulator of the highly conserved integrated stress response pathway. Inhibition of this pathway has the potential to prevent pathology and restore function in a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Parkinson's disease as well as in traumatic brain injury. Our lead eIF2B activator ABBV-CLS-7262 is currently progressing through Phase 1 and we plan to begin a study later this year in patients with ALS. In other neuroscience updates, last year, we completed our registrational program for atogepant in episodic migraine prevention and we recently submitted our regulatory application to the FDA. We expect an approval decision by the end of the third quarter. The data generated in our Phase 3 programs support a strong benefit-risk profile and we believe that atogepant has the potential to offer meaningful benefits to patients as a safe, effective, oral treatment option for the prevention of episodic migraine. In 2021, we expect to see data from several late-stage neuroscience assets, including results from two Phase 3 studies for Vraylar in major depressive disorder and results from the pivotal program for ABBV-951 in advanced Parkinson's disease with regulatory submissions for 951 expected in the second half of the year. We also expect to see proof-of-concept data for Elezanumab in a Phase 2 study in multiple sclerosis and ABBV-8E12, our lead anti-tau antibody in a Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease. In addition to 8E12, we have a number of promising approaches in Alzheimer's, including our neuroinflammation programs aimed at TREM2 and CD33, currently in clinical development, as well as other tau approaches in preclinical development. These include tau antibodies with different epitope specificity as well as approaches to clear intracellular tau. In Aesthetics, we continue to make excellent progress with our portfolio of facial toxins and dermal fillers with several regulatory submissions, data readouts and pivotal study starts expected this year. Our programs include new indications for Botox as well as innovative toxins such as new liquid formulations and both the long and short-acting toxins. We also have programs to develop new indications for the Juvederm Collection as well as novel dermal fillers such as HArmonyCa, which will be entering registration enabling studies in the U.S. And in eye care, based on the positive results from the Phase 3 studies evaluating our topical eye drop AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. We plan to submit our regulatory application later this month and expect an approval decision in the fourth quarter of this year. So in summary, our R&D productivity remained high last year despite multiple COVID-related challenges and we were able to maintain steady continuity and minimize delays. We're entering 2021 well-positioned for continued success and we expect significant program advancement across all stages of our pipeline, again this year. This includes five new asset or major indication approvals, half a dozen regulatory submissions, more than 10 pivotal study readouts, and more than 15 data readouts from early and mid-stage programs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our fourth quarter performance and our 2021 guidance. Rob?
Robert Michael: Thank you, Mike. Starting with fourth quarter results, we once again delivered strong top and bottom-line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.92 above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total net revenues were approximately $13.9 billion, up 6.8% on a comparable operational basis and ahead of our expectations. Immunology global sales were approximately $6 billion, up 14.8% on an operational basis. Within immunology, Humira sales were approximately $5.2 billion, up 4.4% on an operational basis with continued high single-digit growth in the US offset by biosimilar competition across international markets. SKYRIZI sales were $525 million and RINVOQ sales were $281 million with both products demonstrating strong sequential growth above expectations. Hematologic Oncology delivered another strong quarter with revenue of approximately $1.8 billion, up 15.5% on an operational basis with solid growth from IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. Aesthetic sales were more than $1.1 billion with Botox Cosmetic and Juvederm both experiencing a rapid recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience revenues were nearly $1.4 billion, up 14.9% on a comparable operational basis, led by Vraylar and our migraine portfolio. We also saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had sales of more than $900 million. Turning now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 12.6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.3% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.9% of sales, an improvement of 230 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $618 million and the adjusted tax rate was 11.6%. As we look ahead to 2021, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.32 and $12.52, reflecting growth of 17.6% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $5.63 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We expect adjusted net revenue of approximately $55.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on full year comparable sales growth. This forecast comprehends the following assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect immunology global sales of approximately $25 billion, including US Humira growth of approximately 8%, internationally Humira revenue of approximately $3 billion at current exchange rates, SKYRIZI global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, and RINVOQ global sales of approximately $1.7 billion. We expect hematologic oncology to grow double-digits with IMBRUVICA global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion and VENCLEXTA global sales of approximately $1.8 billion. For Aesthetics, we expect global sales of approximately $4.5 billion, including approximately $1.8 billion from Botox Cosmetic and approximately $1.3 billion from Juvederm. For neuroscience, we expect global revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, including Botox Therapeutic sales of approximately $2.3 billion, Vraylar sales of approximately $1.8 billion, and UBRELVY sales of approximately $400 million. For eye care, we expect global sales of approximately $2.9 billion, including approximately $550 million from RESTASIS, which assumes no generic competition in the first half of 2021. For women's health, we expect global revenue of approximately $1.1 billion. For remaining larger products, we expect global sales of approximately $2 billion from Mavyret, $1.2 billion from Creon, $1 billion from Linzess, $800 million from Synthroid, and $750 million from Lupron. Looking at the P&L for 2021, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 83% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of approximately $6.6 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $11.8 billion. This guidance includes approximately $1.7 billion in expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales, which represents an improvement of roughly 200 basis points versus 2020. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.5% and our share count to be roughly flat to Q4 2020. As we look ahead to the first quarter, we anticipate net revenue approaching $12.7 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% favorable impact on comparable sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 50% of sales. And we model a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.3%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.79 and $2.83, excluding approximately $1.32 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $8.4 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $21 billion in 2021. This fully supports a strong and growing dividend, which we have more than tripled since inception, as well as rapid debt repayment where we expect to pay down $17 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021, including the $8.6 billion that was repaid in 2020. We expect to achieve a net debt to EBITDA ratio just below 2.5 times by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. We anticipate that our net leverage ratio will be approximately 2 times by the end of 2022. Our strong cash flow also allows for continued business development with approximately $2 billion allocated annually to augment our pipeline with the most promising external technologies and innovative mid to late-stage assets. In closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2020. We've driven top tier growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and we expect to deliver robust performance in 2021 and over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. And as usual, appreciate all the detail in the guidance, and congratulations on the results. A quick question on SKYRIZI and one on RINVOQ. First, one of your competitors had a negative result of a post-marketing study recently. I'm just wondering if you've had any discussions with regulators about conducting any other studies for RINVOQ or updating the label for RINVOQ as a result of that negative signal? And then, secondly on SKYRIZI, a commercial question. Your current price for the 150-milligram dose is about $85,000 and you're using 4x, the dose for ulcerative colitis. Could you just tell us how you can manage that? And is it feasible to have sort of different prices despite the big difference in dosing? Thanks.
Michael Severino: Okay, this is Mike. I will take your second question first and then we can cover the SKYRIZI question. With respect to RINVOQ, I assume you're talking about the tofacitinib safety study, which top line results fairly recently in the last several days and showed in that program that they were unable to exclude a risk of MACE or malignancy based on the criteria that were used to analyze that data sets. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've kept a very, very close eye on our data, both at the time of the NDA and in an ongoing manner since that time and we've not seen a signal. Our rates have not been elevated with respect to comparator or baseline rates and the rates overall remain low. With respect to your specific question about whether we've had discussions with regulators, regulators have not asked us to do long-term safety study in the way that Pfizer was asked. So that has not been discussed with regulators and we have not had any contact with regulators around labeling updates up to the present time.
Geoffrey Porges: Great.
Michael Severino: And with respect to SKYRIZI?...
Jeffrey Stewart: Yes. Hi, it's Jeff. It's Jeff Stewart on the commercial question. We have anticipated the different markets and how we will approach the pricing. Now, it's important that we're just starting to see the SKYRIZI data. We saw the induction data, we'll see the maintenance data. I think it's important that as we look at our strategy that we're honing is for SKYRIZI, you're going to -- for Crohn's, you're going to have an induction dose, which is an IV at a different dose and we know that based on the form and some things we can believe we can price that to market. And also, we are coming with a unique approach for the maintenance as well depending on where that dosing falls out. And we would be using at that point, which is known as on-body injector. So the combination of the forms as well as basically the ways that we will deliver the medication when we get there, we believe that we can price effectively to the market and manage it across the indications.
Richard Gonzalez: So this is Rick. So I think the bottom line is, we've contemplated that. It's a good question, Geoff, but I think we have a strategy that will allow us to deal with that and impact the market in an appropriate way.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: And our next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities.
Vamil Divan: Hi, great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. And maybe two if I could. So I want to appreciate the long-term guidance you've given recently on the top line. I'm just wondering how we should maybe think about the margin progression as we think about the Humira LOE in a couple of years? And then as we sort of get past that and your sales touch ramp up again, if you could maybe give us some sense of where you think your margins could sort of come back to? And then, the other one I have is just on Vraylar. Again, appreciate the guidance you've given there. I think one of the big events for you guys this year will be the Phase 3 data in MDD. I’m just curious kind of what gives you confidence that maybe you can just talk about whether it's around the drug or the study design, sort of, what gives you confidence or why should we be confident sort of going into that data readout? Thanks.
Robert Michael: Vamil, this is Rob. I'll take your question on margin progression. I think when you consider the greater than $2 billion expense synergies from Allergan by next year and the P&L leverage that will come from the sales growth, we also expect for next year, you should expect that our operating margin will continue to expand through 2022. Upon the entry of U.S. biosimilars in 2023 and given Humira's profitability, it is reasonable to expect operating margin pull back. We've indicated before the 45% range based on our current LRP, I think it'll be a little bit higher than that. But then we've returned to growth immediately – in 2024, we'll return to revenue growth, a very strong revenue growth starting in 2025, you can expect then operating margins once again expand. We've had a long history of expanding operating margin by leveraging the P&L. And I would expect that to continue as we start to see very strong revenue growth starting in 2025 and beyond.
Richard Gonzalez: Yes, Vamil, this is Rick. Mike and I'll cover the second question on Vraylar. It's important to recognize that what we've communicated in long-term guidance on Vraylar is based on the three currently approved indications. So it doesn't count on the fact that MDD would be successful. Now having said that, I think we do have -- I'd say, we're cautiously optimistic about the MDD indication and I'll let Mike kind of walk through how we look at it and what gives us that level of confidence. But in the event, it weren't to play out, that doesn't impact the guidance that we gave.
Michael Severino: So, this is Mike. I'll pick up from here. I think that our optimism and I think that's the right way to express it in a disease like MDD, which is a challenging disease to work and is based on a couple of features. One is based on the basic pharmacology of Vraylar, which has a unique mix of D3, D2 specificity and other features that lead clinically to what's been described as a brightening effect, which seems to be beneficial in a number of settings. It's also driven by the results that we have from the MDD study that is positive that we already have in hand. So with one positive study, we would need only one -- at least one or, of course, both of the next two studies to read out positive, either of those outcomes would support a filing. We've done a deep dive into the study design and the patient population. We think it's a well-designed study. And we think the patient characteristics with respect to baseline factors and other elements are all very appropriate for this sort of study and we can assess that in a blinded aggregate way in a way that's completely consistent with the study rules for the conduct of the study. And so all of those things make us feel optimistic that it's a molecule with a good chance to work, well-designed study, well-conducted study, and we look forward to seeing the results. But as I mentioned, MDD is a challenging area. And for that reason, we didn't build into our deal model and we didn't factor it into our guidance, as Rick said, so we view this as upside.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.
Randall Stanicky: Great. Back to RINVOQ in atopic derm, how quickly do you guys expect that launch to ramp? And maybe just help us with expectations given coinciding JAK competition from abrocitinib , the timing to payer ramp and coverage. And then we sense of a lot of patient warehousing, maybe if you could help quantify your thinking around that opportunity within the $1.7 billion outlook for the year, that would be helpful? And then a quick follow-up, Rick. You don't get asked about eye care a lot. It's a $3 billion global franchise. You have some pipeline behind it. It could be a good growth business, but it's declining. Any appetite to strategically add to that business or reposition it? Or should we view it more as a mature cash flow generator? Thanks.
Jeffrey Stewart: Yes, hi. It's Jeff Stewart. I'll start off with the atopic derm commercial question. We're very encouraged with the market that we're about to enter and I'll give you some context there. So when we look at the population, we see that just on the moderate to severe atopic derm patients that the market size or the potential is at least 2 times and probably closer to 3 times the size of the psoriasis market. And so this is very, very encouraging in terms of our ability to enter. It's also significantly under-penetrated. I mean if you look at the psoriasis market, you're talking about far greater than 10% or 12% penetration and in the single-digit, the low-single digits, where we are right now with the one biologic dupilumab. So it's very, very attractive. The other thing that I would say is that we see from our go-to-market approach that we know the HCPs very intimately. So about 85% of the market is driven by the derms, we know the derms very well and there is a 90% -- roughly 90% overlap with the big prescribers of dupilumab and drugs like SKYRIZI and our Humira. So we are very, very encouraged at the ability for this segment to rapidly expand, despite the fact there will be multiple new entrants coming in. To get to your specific question about the access ramp, we have a very strong position, as you know with RINVOQ right now in the existing indication of RA. We had greater than 95% commercial access, that's the dominant channel for atopic derm and our anticipation is we will have very strong access that we'll build to that level over the course of '21. Obviously, it's going to take some time, once we get the approval to go through the final approvals on the big commercial plans and so we see it's starting off slow, but then building into the middle of the year and certainly getting to a significant level at the end of the year. So the combination of the market, the asset itself, which looks very, very strong, as you've seen from the data and the way that we will play in our derm segment as well as the allergy segment give us a lot of confidence for a strong ramp in '21 and beyond.
Richard Gonzalez: The only thing I would add to Jeff's comments, I mean if you look at RINVOQ did $731 million last year. Obviously, if you look at the running rate out of the fourth quarter had [ph] strong running rate coming out of the fourth quarter but that's a $1 billion worth of growth from '20 to '21. The majority of that growth is going to come from continued performance in RA. I think where you will see the most significant impact from atopic dermatitis will be as we flow into '22, much like as you saw what happened in the RA market, it takes time for physicians to start to get adapted. Once they do, their momentum picks up. So, I don't remember the specific number. I'm not sure we gave that guidance anyway, but I would be thinking about it more than its continued penetration and growth in RA which drive in the bulk of that growth. Rob, anything you want to add?
Robert Michael: Yes, I just -- on your question regarding warehouse patients who have a very modest amount of warehouse patients assumed [ph] in the forecast. So we're not count -- the $1.7 billion doesn't really count on that. And keep in mind that RINVOQ was of the product that was lesser impacted by COVID and so there's not really significant how warehousing in that forecast.
Richard Gonzalez: And then, Randall, on your second question; I would say we absolutely agree with your point of view. I think eye care is a very attractive market. The kinds of markets that I think we look for and that we are the very best at is where there are specialized physicians who really drive the use of medications based on the clinical data and being able to restate markets and improve standard-of-care in those markets, and certainly, eye-care, I think it fits that description. And so we would have a strong appetite to look for opportunities and we are looking for opportunities now that we could add to that eye care business to be able to drive growth. Obviously, RESTASIS, as Rob indicated in his formal remarks, we've built in a half a year that's still an unknown of when that product will go generic or if it will go generic. But I think even aside from that regardless of what happens with RESTASIS longer-term, this is an area that we would have interest in and if we could find the right kind of assets to add to it, we would enthusiastically do that.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Randall. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: And our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on Aesthetics and maybe some of the learnings you've had in that franchise since you've acquired it? Have there been changes in the way you think about approaching the business commercially in your levels of investment? I'm just trying to get my hands around that high single-digit growth over time does seem healthier than the street have been anticipating. I'm just trying to get a little bit more color of what you're seeing in the market that gives you confidence in that. And then, my second question was just on IMBRUVICA, the growth has slowed here a bit. Can you just elaborate a bit more and how much of this is -- is there any COVID related dynamics playing out here? How much of this is competitive? I'm just trying to [ph] sense of just how you're seeing that the health of that franchise over time? Thanks so much.
Richard Gonzalez: Yes, Chris, this is Rick. So I'll cover the Aesthetics question for you. I'd say as we've studied the Aesthetics market and had an opportunity to be able to operate the business now for some time, I think we're even more enthusiastic about the long-term ability to be able to grow this market. I would say some of the areas that were a bit of a surprise to us is the responsiveness of this market to patient activation, and I would say that the strategy that we've put in place is one where we are funding the business on a very -- on a continuous basis at a high level to achieve the level of activation that we're looking for and we think that will, certainly, you can see, the response I guess an example in Botox already, we are seeing a very aggressive response in being able to grow the market, you saw the Botox grew -- Botox Cosmetic grew in the fourth quarter to 9%. I would expect that we can continue to drive that level of growth. And as part of legacy Allergan, I think it was much more episodic in the way this was funded quarter-to-quarter where we basically built a funding plan that will allow them to continue to drive activation over a longer term [ph]. I'd say the second thing that's it's of interest to us is, I think this is a market where you can drive significant innovation. If you fund that innovation in a way, again on a more continuous basis and advance those programs more aggressively, and have a well thought out strategic roadmap as to where you're trying to drive some of these markets. As Mike mentioned in his comments, our goal is to basically try to advance the level of performance of the toxin market significantly over time. And the same with the filler market. There are certainly things that we can do to expand the areas that you could use fillers, both within the US and globally and that's a significant opportunity. But long term, we think there is an opportunity to take some of the biologic expertise that we have here at AbbVie and create more biologically active fillers, and not only do physical filling but also improve collagen, improve elastin, and other kinds of characteristics that will improve skin quality. And we think that will be -- if we're successful, we think that will be a significant opportunity to drive long-term growth. And then, the last thing I'd say is the geographic footprint that AbbVie has. We obviously have a very broad geographic footprint and the structure that we've set up is this totally integrated global unit that we're operating the Aesthetics business really gives them the freedom to go out and expand or more aggressively fund areas around the globe that they think there is a significant opportunity. A good case in point is I believe it was in the fourth quarter, we funded a significant expansion in China to be able to increase the sales force there to be able to drive it more deeply into a broader set of the cities in China to the next level down and we are already seeing the benefits of that, China is already back to growing much like it did pre-COVID. So I think there's a lot of attractive attributes about that. On IMBRUVICA maybe Jeff and I will tag team on that one. What we're clearly seeing is the COVID is having an impact on patient starts in CLL. We're not only seeing it IMBRUVICA, but we're seeing in VENCLEXTA as well. And then somewhat logical when you think about these oncology practices of trying to reduce density and CLL is a disease where you can, in many patients' cases, you can delay therapy for some period of time. I would say that's the vast majority of it. When we look at -- when I look at the overall share. And the reason why I'm talking about the overall share is VENCLEXTA is now gaining a significant level of momentum in this market as well. When I look at our overall shares in first line, second line or third line, we continue to have the dominant share position. And I'd say probably, partially due to your question, if I look at Calico [ph] I'd say it's performing at the expectation we have. I think the first line share is about 12%, slightly higher in second line maybe 14%, and I don't recall the third line share...
Jeffrey Stewart: Very similar, yes.
Richard Gonzalez: So I'd say that's within the range or we saw with MCL, it's within the range of what we had modeled. So it's not really a competitive issue that we're dealing with. It's more a function of getting those patients starts back up to the level they were before. Anything, you want to add, Jeff?
Jeffrey Stewart: No, I think Rick, that's exactly right. The only thing I would say in terms of our forecast, we think that in the first part of the year, the early part of the year, we continue to see some suppression in the new patient starts. But as we hit the second and third quarter, we anticipate that the market will recover.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: And our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.
Nicole Maher: Hi. Can you hear me? This is Nicole Maher on for Tim Anderson. What does your long-term guidance assume for potential austerity measures in the ex-U.S. countries in 2021 and beyond, similar to what we saw in the post-2008 time period except this time around, it would be the fall from the COVID impact?
Richard Gonzalez: Hey, Nicole. This is Rick. I think this is something we've got experience with, if you think about the economic crisis, I thought we saw a similar kind of uptick in price erosion outside the United States and in particular, I'd say in the European Union, we have factored in a reasonable assumption into our guidance for 2021, I feel good about that. I think it is reflective of what we're likely to see. So I think we're covered from that perspective. Anything you want to add Rob?
Robert Michael: No, that covered it.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Nicole. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: And our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: Thank you. Two questions. AbbVie delivered one of the first completely clean and compelling quarters in pharma this cycle, and I have to believe, has something in reserve for upside as the year unfolds. I'm sure you monitor the competition, so beyond the AbbVie management team itself, what about your business do you think is allowing you to execute in this way? Would you attribute it to -- mainly to the products themselves, the payer strategies, geographic mix, or is there something else? And the second question is the ongoing Vraylar Phase 3 trials utilize doses up to 3-milligrams while the successful prior trials were up to 4.5-milligrams, so why were the doses lowered in the first place? And what placebo response mitigation methods are included in the ongoing trials? Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. Steve, this is Rick, I'll cover the first one, and Mike can cover the second one. I would say, first and foremost, we are a very disciplined organization in how we approach execution in the marketplace. We tend to probably, in [ph] some extent, obsessively plan and then go out and try to execute against that plan and I think in times of difficulties that kind of discipline tends to demonstrate itself and that's when you see the biggest differences. So that's not say [ph] other people don't do it like that. I'm not that familiar with how others operate, but I know how we operate and I know how we contingency plan and we look at. Okay, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do and we do that ahead of time, if that doesn't work, what are we going to do. And I think that kind of contingency planning and focus on execution is helpful. I'd say the second thing is, if I look at our business, we put a strategy in place and I feel very good about how the business is performing overall. I mean I would say the business is firing on all cylinders. And you can look at our fourth quarter performance, to your point, and I think it demonstrates that and you can look at our guidance and it demonstrates that almost every single product area is performing at or above, most of them above what consensus was and then I think it's another indicator for you and we have a much more diverse business now. We have four major growth platforms that are helping us drive that level of growth. Our new product launches are doing extremely well. Obviously, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are, but I'd also say UBRELVY and Vraylar are performing extremely well and the pipeline, I would say one of the things gives me the most confidence is when I look at the pipeline behind that. It's designed to be able to drive our long-term growth because one of the things that we focus on is how we're going to make sure that we continue to drive this business to perform at the level its performing over the long term. And so if I look at the SKYRIZI and RINVOQ R&D execution around the follow-on indications, it's been nothing less than spectacular both from a timing standpoint and the kind of data that we have been able to produce. When I look at our hem/onc strategy, we've had a very disciplined strategy there ensuring that we have enough assets to continue to grow. What has become a very large franchise for us. Our franchise is $6.6 billion as we said, we're going to grow in double digits. Over the long term, what's going to allow us to do that? Well obviously IMBRUVICA is going to continue to drive share, VENCLEXTA is going to continue to drive share in CLL but VENCLEXTA has indication expansions in the area of potential, in the areas of T1114 and a broader AML population and several other areas. Then I look at Navitoclax. We should get that product approved and give us an opportunity in myelofibrosis and then you look at Genmab and you look at our CD47, those will all allow us to ensure that we can sustain that growth profile over the long term. In neuroscience, same thing, atogepant will allow us to expand into the broader migraine population. So I feel very good about what we put in place and our ability to execute against that. So I think there is not one silver bullet that I can point to. I think it's all of those things, certainly, our ability in market access has helped a lot in the US. I think we're very good at that, but you have to have the right kinds of assets in order to execute that. You have to have assets that are differentiative like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. So it's the combination of all of that gives you this performance and gives you the long-term sustainable ability to deliver that kind of performance and I feel awfully good about where we are.
Michael Severino: So, this is Mike. I'll take the Vraylar question. I believe you're talking about the ongoing MDD studies and what I would say there is that the dose selection was based on everything we know about dose-response, not only from the prior MDD studies but across the program and we've done a deep dive into that and we're confident that we're at a dose that ought to have optimal effect in these indications -- in this indication. With respect to your question about placebo response rate, managing or controlling the placebo response is extremely important in all studies, but particularly in depression studies and other studies in psychiatry. And I would say that there are many different approaches that are taken that are complementary to each other. The first and most important is appropriate site selection, one has to select sites with an appropriate patient population with experienced investigators who are also experienced evaluators in a clinical trial setting and that's one of the most important things to getting high-quality data to determine whether a drug works. The next element has to do with investigator training, investigator manuals, protocol design and also with respect to inclusion and exclusion criteria to make sure that you have a patient population that is representative of the population that you would expect to treat post-registration if the study is successful. And we've taken a look at all of these things, we've taken a look at the blinded aggregate data and we feel good that the measures that we have in place will effectively control the placebo response and give us a quality readout.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Nachman from BMO Capital Markets.
Gary Nachman: Hi, good morning. Could you talk about how much more you plan on investing behind the neuroscience franchise to accelerate growth there to get to the long-term targets you talked about like the $4 billion in Vraylar even with that MDD, and how you see the long-term potential in Botox Therapeutic? And then how are you thinking about the launch for atogepant later this year? And how will you leverage the work that you've done so far with Ubrelvy? And how do you think that product will take off in the migraine market? Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Well, I'd say, on the neuroscience investment, I mean we obviously have a very broad neuroscience investment. I mean we have a significant investment from an R&D standpoint. And in disease-modifying approaches for a number of different neurological diseases that Mike has talked about and mentioned in his comments earlier. So I'd say we have a significant R&D investment. We obviously are investing in Vraylar to continue to expand that asset. Again, our goal will be to invest in these areas where you can get maximum capture -- market share capture. I think if you look at Vraylar and you look at the projections that we made over time, if you look at the sequential year-over-year dollar growth of that business, that's how you get to that number. And basically, we're going to be able to sustain that, we expect to continue to sustain it as relatively low market share, but that's not unusual. And in this market, because there's a lot of generic products that psychiatrists, cycle patients through and sometimes in combination with patients. So we're going to invest in the business to be able to drive the maximum level of profitable share as we do in any other segment that we're in. Same thing on Botox Therapeutics, obviously, we have R&D programs in there to continue to expand the opportunities in therapeutics. Anything you want to add from an investment standpoint, Rob?
Robert Michael: I think if you look at the overall portfolio, we've detailed out what we expect for Vraylar and that's without the additional indication. We think we can get to approaching $4 billion. When you look at the migraine portfolio, peak sales are greater than $1 billion for both the UBRELVY and Atogepant. We have 951 in the pipeline that we think can be a significant contributor, obviously, Botox Therapeutic will continue to grow. So we feel pretty good about the portfolio we have and that double-digit growth outlook is supported by a number of very promising assets.
Jeffrey Stewart: Yes, hi. And it's Jeff, I'll take the second question on atogepant. I think first, the asset itself is very, very attractive. And when you look at the response on the migraine free days at the 10 to 60-milligram, it's really impressive data, very impressive data as this very strong oral. And so we think that we can come at this in a couple of different ways. Obviously, you highlighted the leveraging Ubrelvy. We've got a dedicated sales force that calls on the specialty organization, the neurologists as well as the headache specialists will actually carry both UBRELVY and atogepant in their call plan to really leverage the knowledge of a very established sales force and as well as focus on the big primary care writers that see a lot of migraine sufferers. So this is -- this is an important dynamic that will, we'll be able to leverage when we get into the market towards the end of the year. Also, we are looking at the ability to see how you look on the back end of the migraine journey so patients are on Botox Therapeutics, for example, which is very substantial. It's the leading in play share for chronic migraine. But many of those patients don't get full efficacy results. So ultimately the combination of Botox plus atogepant as a way to get really migraine freedom in the toughest patients is another area over the long term that we think can leverage these assets across the board, whether it's you UBRELVY on the front end with acute atogepant in the middle, oral for episodic and chronic or Botox on the back end. We think it's a nice portfolio that we can commercially manage over time to hit our ambitions that Rob described.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Gary. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Naveen Jacob from UBS.
Naveen Jacob: Hi Naveen from UBS. Thanks for taking the question. So first on the ADC steroid you see for inflammatory conditions. Just wanted to get an update there, it's been, I believe you said delayed for COVID-19 do you still believe that this approach can lead to success for refractory RA or other inflammatory conditions. Just wondering about your confidence in this technology understanding, it's still early in development. And then secondly, as it relates to your current state of affairs with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, could you remind us of what the current in-play market share for our RINVOQ is in RA and SKYRIZI in psoriasis. Thank you so much.
Michael Severino: Okay. This is Mike, I'll take your first question on ABBV 154 our TNF steroid conjugate has not been delayed because of COVID. There were some delays in other early immunology programs. Our CD 40 and our ROR gamma-T program experienced modest delays but 154 did not. As we said at the time of the COVID peak over the course of last summer, there were a small number of studies that we delayed initiation and delayed enrollment, is the programs that I'm talking about TD 40 and ROR gamma T were impacted modestly in that time period but 154 was not so that remains on-track. We remain confident in it. We have selected 154 as the agent to go forward. Remember that we had two 3373 and 154 and we selected 154 because of advantages it had in linker technology, we're planning to initiate a large Phase 2 B study in the first half of this year and then today, we're now saying that we will also be studying Phase 2 Crohn's disease, as well as polymyalgia rheumatica, and that's an important set of indication that covers a wide range of opportunities, RA and Crohn's disease areas where we are very active, PMR polymyalgia rheumatica is a new area where there is not a lot of therapeutics, unfortunately, it is a well-established area in medicine but there is very little in terms of treatment for these patients, they have considerable pain and suffering from their condition and it's -- and it's particularly steroid responsive. So we think it is a very attractive target for our steroid ADC approach. The 154 remains on track and we continue to have confidence.
Jeffrey Stewart: Thanks, Mike. It's Jeff, I'll take the in-play [ph] share. So if we look at the psoriasis market and SKYRIZI we have on our latest data point 33% of in-play share, which is of course is new patients coming in or newly switch patients. If you look at the total AbbVie share, it's approximately 45%, so very remarkable when you add Humira plus SKYRIZI in the dermatology space. If you look at the RA space, our latest data points are between 15% and 16% in terms of in-play share for RINVOQ in RA and that's basically neck and neck with Humira, so for a total AbbVie share of roughly a third of the RA market.
Richard Gonzalez: This is, Rick. The only thing I'd add on that is when you look at that SKYRIZI 33% in-play share, it's almost double what the next closest competitor is, I mean it's impressive. The gap between SKYRIZI and the number two player and the other thing is, as these brands get more experience in the market, we'll also start to talk about the total TRx share and I think SKYRIZI is at that point now. I think it's total TRx share now is 14% [indiscernible] or something like that. That's right. And that's pretty impressive for this short period of time and it is close to number two in the market in TRx share. So they are both doing very, very well.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Naveen. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: And the next question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler.
Chris Raymond: Hi, thanks. Just a couple of questions. First, on the relationship with BI and SKYRIZI. We had a few inbound questions on the treatment of the royalty and I know you've answered this question a little bit in the past, but also just noticing the big non-cash GAAP charge you took this quarter, you back out a non-GAAP earnings. So I know you have described accounting for this as a business combination. But can you maybe give a little bit more color on the rationale and the accounting behind that non-cash charge and then is there also some threshold number or other event where you'd add this royalty expense back to non-GAAP. And then, on AbbVie 951; we picked up a decent amount of KOL excitement around this asset in Parkinson's. I know Phase 3 is expected later this year, but I wonder if you could maybe talk about the launch -- your launch expectations on this and maybe contrast it to the Duodopa experience just from our feedback, it seems like this could expand the addressable PD population pretty sizably and Rick maybe frame how this sort of factors into your long range $10 billion neuroscience guidance. Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: Yes, Chris, I'll take your question on Contingent considerations and yes, we did account for this as a business combination. So that means each quarter we do a mark-to-market, the fair value of the future milestone royalty payments and you did see us take a fair value write up this quarter. Based on the higher sales outlook as we communicated during the Immunology Day event in December and you see in the guidance provided today, obviously the outlook for SKYRIZI continue to increase. And so we're recognizing that liability going forward. We also take into a consideration because it's a fair value measure what the market is assuming. So it's not just our own forecast. It's also what street expectations are and those have also increased as we've seen a very nice ramp. We are starting to see obviously the confidence from the street increase that's translated into a higher outlook for SKYRIZI which then translates in a higher future potential royalties. One of the reasons I wanted to stress, also on the free cash flow in my remarks today is because there is some confusion over that's how we account for, but it's important to keep in mind that when I talk about free cash flow of $21 billion this year, that accounts for the royalty payments of - to BI. And so you can look at a few different ways, you can look at it from a – if you can track the consideration accretion that we're recording and the liability on the balance sheet as an indicator of the future outlook, but also as we monitor our cash flow pretty carefully what does that contribute to overall cash flow. So we would not be going back, we made a determination as a business combination. We don't -- should not anticipate that we would reverse that but we'll provide obviously more clarity on what those royalties look like going forward given the size of the asset.
Michael Severino: I also say in that time period when we did BI it was an absolute requirement on the account, right. Well, that was really, it wasn't like a judgment call or something thing to desire to do the accounting, said to be accounted for in that fashion. It's since been changed going forward. But the window in which we that occurred that was the required accounting treatment. So number two, Jeff and I will cover number two, sort of a high level look and then Jeff, maybe can give more specificity around that. If you look at Duodopa I mean this is a -- this is a therapy that has absolutely phenomenal efficacy and you can see these patients who cannot move early and you turn on the pump and you start giving them the drug and within a very short period of time, they will gain their motion. The challenge is a very difficult treatment to the patient to basically deal with and the caregiver to deal with on a long term sustainable basis; you have to do surgery, insert a G-Tube, you got to maintain that G-Tube opened, so that does somewhat limit the population is able to use it. And so we view this as a way to significantly expand the market. Jeff is obviously far more familiar with it. So I'll let him, give you a little more specific, but that's the general concept. I think this could be a significant -- wanting to be a significant treatment for these patients who need this kind of therapy. And two, I think we could expand the market pretty significantly.
Jeffrey Stewart: Yes, I think just to add on that. Rick, it's we hear the same thing from our KOLs, they're very, very encouraged and with the perspective you look at Duopa or Duodopa, about $0.5 billion product with a really difficult challenge on on-boarding for these patients. Right. You have to do the J-Peg surgery. You have challenges with the size of the pump. Nonetheless, it's still remarkable that we do get that level of sales. So if I give you some perspective on the market. If you look at the advanced Parkinson disease market, 90% of it is really old generic orals where the patients just have to take more and more oral medication before they can have any -- any relief. And then, they are still in big trouble. So, only a minority about 10% ever get to let's say more advanced device-aided therapy, which is Duopa or Duodopa and deep brain stimulation. So, as we studied the market we agree that as we look at the ability to sort of move from a more convenient way a simple way for neurologists to get a more advanced therapy without doing a procedure, whether it's brain surgery or the -- or the GI surgery we think we can start to move upstream into that 90% of really non-workable oral segment. So, we are encouraged at the recent feedback from our KOLs and our study sites and are anticipating and planning for launch in the coming years.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: And our next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Truist.
Gregg Gilbert: Yes, hi, I was curious if your Botox Cosmetic guidance in the US assumes that as you've always on the market or off the market this year and then longer-term curious about Botox Cosmetic versus therapeutic many years ago Allergan started to explore the idea of separating the two from a reimbursement and pricing standpoint, I believe it involved litigation with the government at one point, but I don't know if that's still ongoing or if you're still thinking through that possibility since it has implications longer-term about keeping those that together possibly spending Aesthetics someday if conditions warrant. Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Yes, so I don't know that we're going to specifically comment on what we've assumed as it relates to [indiscernible]. I just don't think it's probably appropriate. First of all, it's not that large of a product to begin with. So wouldn't have a material impact on Botox Cosmetics. I'd say on the -- on the -- on your second question, I will tell you emphatically we have no interest in spinning off the Aesthetics business. We have a program in place where we manage the differences between the reimbursement associated with Botox Therapeutics and the cash pay portion of the Cosmetics business, it's been in place for quite some time. We're quite comfortable that we can manage it quite effectively. So It's an important thing that you -- that you track carefully, but we have a good system in place to be able to do that, but we have no interest in getting off the Aesthetics business or any aspects of the of the Aesthetics business.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Gregg. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, it's Austin [ph] on for Geoff. Thanks so much for the questions. A couple of quick ones. So -- and within the context of the Xeljanz's data, do you guys have an early view from the field as to whether docs are differentiating RINVOQ and -- sorry, RINVOQ and Xeljanz's safety profiles? And then quickly on the mid to early stage pipeline there's obviously a lot going on in your Heme-onc space but just going to want to get a sense of how strategically important some more newer disruptive technologies are to AbbVie such as cell or gene therapy. Thanks.
Jeffrey Stewart: Yes, I'll take the early view from the field. I think it's important, at least, we've heard from our teams that some of this data is not really new. It was available in the interim analysis that helped -- led to the label that we have and so really the early reports from our -- from our field particularly from the KOLs and the big prescribers is a little bit of a shoulder shrug like not that, not that new news. I would say, from the standpoint of the comparison between RINVOQ and Xeljanz. I mean if you look at the penetration of the jack-class really across the world, and particularly in the U.S., there has been a significant lift that we just talked about with that in play share. And so really what we're -- what we're hearing from the -- from the field and from the prescribers are they view RINVOQ as a differentiated asset in terms of the overall risk benefit and that's why that share is moving so quickly and so that's really what we -- what we hear in the early days from our -- from our teams that are connected to those big rheumatologists.
Michael Severino: So, this is Mike. I'll take the question on the heme-onc portfolio mid stage and newer technologies, but I would say is there is a lot going on in our heme-onc portfolio. Obviously with our late-stage molecules in the mid-stage. I think you'll see a focus on T-cell redirection, which is of course a newer technology. And I think a very attractive approach to harness the immune system to control these cancers and you see good progress with our CD3 by CD20 and our BCMA T cell redirecting therapies. And so, that is clearly an area of focus for us now and I think we'll continue to be in the future. With respect to gene therapy, gene therapy is not a single thing it can be used in different ways. Gene replacement is not an area that we've been focused on. Gene delivery is an enabling technology for other therapeutic approaches like cell-based therapies and we have early programs and cell-based therapies in heme-onc and in other areas. Solid tumor oncology and potentially other areas in the future. And so that's something that we are keeping a close eye on and making sure that we have access to the enabling technologies we need to prosecute those targets. I think that for those sorts of approaches we're probably one generation away from things that are broadly applicable. But we are exploring possibilities that we think can fulfill that next generation need. And so we are keeping up a broad eye and are essentially therapeutically agnostic. What I mean by that is we look for the best tool to do the job. We don't find it tool and then figure out how to use it. And so in each of these cases we're going after strong biology. We're going after things that we think will raise the bar on the standard of care. And I think a number of the newer technologies that I mentioned fit that bill.
Liz Shea: Thanks. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Luisa Hector from Berenberg.
Luisa Hector: Hello, thank you for taking my question and thank you for the guidance on the cost lines. And I just wondered given that we have various layers to consider with COVID and then the Allergan inclusion and the synergies could you comment on the implied cost ratio for 2021 and how representative are the combined entity. And is there anything else we should be thinking about for those cost line as we look out to 22 COVID related savings may be sticky ones that may reverse? And could you tell us the level of synergies you achieved already in 2020? Thank you.
Robert Michael: Hi, Luis. This is Rob. So I think now that we have first full year with combined company and you're looking at these profiles. I think you could assume they're indicative in the range of what you'd expect going forward. And so that is a cleaner guide then say when you have a partial year like we had in 2020 as it relates to the synergies we achieved in 2020 which is about $600 million of synergies about $400 million that was an R&D and $200 million SG&A and you see we've now increased that to $1.7 billion in 2021 with about a little bit roughly half of that coming from R&D about in the 40% range SG&A and about 10% from cost of goods.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Luisa. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.AbbVie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-10-30 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AbbVie’s operations, results and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today’s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth is on a comparable operational basis, which includes full current year and historical results for Allergan and excludes the impact of exchange. For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast to conform to AbbVie’s revenue recognition accounting policies and excludes the divestitures of Zenpep and Viokace. Following our prepared remarks, we will take your questions. So, with that, I will now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will discuss our third quarter performance and highlights, as well as our full year guidance, which we are raising again this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D programs and Rob will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, we will take your questions. AbbVie delivered another excellent quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.83, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.08. When I look at our business and the actions we have taken to position AbbVie for sustainable performance, including the acquisition of Allergan, I feel very good about our long-term outlook. The fundamentals are strong and there is considerable momentum across our legacy and new portfolios, which are both demonstrating robust growth, despite the COVID pandemic and together have the potential for significant long-term value creation. I’d like to specifically highlight our recent progress across several aspects of our business, including the launches of RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which are performing well ahead of all comparable launch analogs in their initial indications and continue to exceed our expectations. Our hem/onc franchise continues to deliver robust performance and is expected to generate more than $6.5 billion in revenue this year, representing strong double-digit growth. New indications and novel combinations, including our recently announced collaboration with Genmab and I-Mab provide opportunities for further revenue expansion. While it is still relatively early in the integration of Allergan, the strategic merits of the combination have never been more evident. We are already demonstrating that we have created a stronger, more diverse company, with robust cash flows and multiple new growth vehicles for the long-term. We now have the leading aesthetics franchise, which is demonstrating a strong V-shaped recovery, as well as a highly attractive neuroscience portfolio which delivered double-digit growth on a comparable operational basis this quarter and has significant momentum with VRAYLAR and our expanding migraine franchise. And our pipeline is advancing nicely, with numerous attractive late-stage programs that we believe will allow us to maintain a growing and vibrant business. We are on track for the approval of more than a dozen new products for major indications over the next two years, which will collectively add meaningful revenue growth. This includes a total of six additional indications for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and several other near-term product -- new product approvals, including atogepant, Navitoclax and 951. Clearly, this is a very exciting time for AbbVie and I am pleased with the progress that we are making towards our long-term strategy for sustainable growth. I remain confident that we will continue to execute as we have in the past and deliver outstanding shareholder value going forward. I’d like to look further at our business performance. I am pleased with the recent trends across our key growth areas. I will start with immunology, where we established strong trajectories for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. As I previously noted, both continue to perform well-above expectations. In their initial indications, these two brands have clearly demonstrated superior efficacy to HUMIRA, as well as other novel agents on the market or in development, resulting in significant in-play market shares, a leading indicator for long-term commercial performance. The in-play share for RINVOQ in RA, which includes both new and switching patients remains strong at approximately 16% and has now reached parity with our market leading HUMIRA. In psoriasis, SKYRIZI has already achieved the leading in-play market share at 33%. This level of share capture at this stage of the launch is unprecedented, and if sustained, will ultimately lead to total market share well in excess of what was contemplated when we communicated our expectations for 2025 sales. This strong performance and trajectory, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a testament to our differentiated product profile and our commercial execution. Our focus since the pandemic has been on driving accelerated patient activation and we remain encouraged by our current prescription trends. Our recent performance continues to give us confidence in the near- and long-term potential for both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, which we now expect will deliver $2.2 billion in combined revenue for full year 2020, well exceeding our original projections for this year. In addition to outstanding commercial momentum, we are also making excellent progress with RINVOQ and SKYRIZI in new indications, which we expect will further strengthen our leadership position. We have already started planning and preparing for the forthcoming approval of three additional RINVOQ indications next year, including psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, giving us complete coverage across the more than $40 billion rheumatology segment. We also expect approval in atopic dermatitis, another large and growing market that has the potential to be multi-billion dollar peak revenues for RINVOQ. In the coming year, we also intend to submit regulatory applications for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis and both agents in the area of inflammatory bowel disease, a more than $20 billion market today with high unmet need. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the progress we are making on both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. I’d also like to take this opportunity to announce that we will be hosting an immunology focused Investor Day in December, where we intend to further discuss our strategy, progress, and expectations for this important growth area. Additional details will be forthcoming. Turning now to hem/onc, which delivered robust double-digit growth again this quarter and remains an important therapeutic area for AbbVie’s long-term performance. IMBRUVICA has a strong position across multiple indications including CLL, where it remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. IMBRUVICA sales increased 9% on an operational basis this quarter, despite lower new patient starts within CLL, where the market remains below pre-COVID levels. VENCLEXTA sales increased nearly 60% on an operational basis this quarter. The penetration across our approved indications remains strong, especially in AML, given the potential aggressive disease progression of that cancer. In the quarter, we also announced a strategic collaboration with I-Mab, further expanding our oncology portfolio with anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, which has potential across a wide range of blood cancers. The I-Mab opportunity adds to our already-attractive oncology pipeline, which includes Navitoclax, Genmab CD3xCD20, expanded indications for VENCLEXTA and several promising early-stage programs. We also now have another high performing franchise in neuroscience, which further diversifies AbbVie’s sources of long-term growth. VRAYLAR sales increased strong double-digits again this quarter on a comparable operational basis, with annualized revenues of more than $1.4 billion. Given VRAYLAR’s benefit/risk profile relative to other atypical anti-psychotics, we remain confident in its long-term growth potential, which we believe is multi-billion dollars across the currently approved indications of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. BOTOX Therapeutics, which has nearly a dozen medical treatment indications, including chronic migraine, is also performing very well. Revenues were up nearly $100 million sequentially on a comparable operational basis, demonstrating a rapid COVID recovery. The launch of UBRELVY, our leading oral CGRP for acute migraine, is exceeding our expectations. Commercial access is ramping strongly and increasing DTC investments have resulted in encouraging new patient starts and market expansion. When you consider our overall scale with BOTOX Therapeutics, UBRELVY’s acute treatment profile and the promising development of atogepant for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine, we see substantial room for long-term revenue growth with this best-in-class migraine portfolio. Within aesthetics, our fourth major growth platform, we are seeing robust demand trends and a rapid V-shaped recovery. Total global aesthetics revenues of more than $950 million were up 70% sequentially on a comparable operational basis, illustrating the significant underlying demand for both BOTOX cosmetics and JUVÉDERM. We remain focused on supporting clinics through the COVID pandemic and expect consistent investment in consumer promotion to expand the aesthetics market, which remains under penetrated globally. Our dedicated R&D and business development are expected to sustain new innovation and rapidly expand our aesthetics portfolio for long-term growth, including the recently announced acquisition of Luminera, which provides us with a complementary dermal filler portfolio and pipeline. Overall, we are very pleased with the momentum that we are seeing with our aesthetics franchise. AbbVie’s business continues to remain resilient and demonstrates strong underlying growth throughout the pandemic. Based on the performance this quarter and our progress year-to-date, we are raising our full year 2020 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $10.47 to $10.49, reflecting growth of more than 17% at the midpoint.  In addition to the excellent progress we are making across the portfolio, the integration of Allergan continues to go very well. Despite the size of this transaction and the timing of the COVID pandemic, the transition has been seamless. We are performing very well against both our synergy and accretion targets, and it is becoming increasingly clear to us that there are also opportunities for revenue synergies across various aspects of the business. We are now six months post-close and the strategic merits of the transaction are extremely evident. Allergan is providing additional growth platforms, robust financial benefits and greater diversity of our business. We remain confident that the newly combined business will generate significant earnings and cash flow to support continued investment in our innovative R&D platform, as well as a strong and growing dividend, while also allowing us to rapidly pay down debt.  To that end, as noted in our news release, today we are announcing a 10.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.18 per share to $1.30 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2021. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 225%.  So, in summary, we continue to demonstrate strong execution across our portfolio and remain encouraged by the overall recovery trends. We have assembled an impressive set of diversified growth assets with significant growth potential giving us a high degree of confidence in the long-term outlook for our business.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mike.
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. We continue to make great progress across all stages of our pipeline and this morning I will highlight key events since our last earnings call. Starting with immunology, where we achieved several major milestones, including submission of our U.S. and European regulatory applications for RINVOQ in ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis. We expect regulatory decisions in the first half of 2021 for both indications, as well as for psoriatic arthritis which was submitted for regulatory review earlier this year. Within the rheumatology segment, both psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are large and important markets and represent a significant growth opportunity for RINVOQ. We will highlight the growing body of data from our rheumatology portfolio and the -- at the upcoming virtual ACR Congress, where we will present 35 abstracts from multiple assets across our portfolio, including six selected for oral presentation. Atopic dermatitis is a new disease area for AbbVie and also represents an important area of growth for our immunology franchise going forward. Based on the data generated in our registrational program, we remain very confident in the benefit/risk profile for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis and believe it will offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. Beyond the Phase 3 studies that support our regulatory submission, we are also evaluating RINVOQ in a head-to-head Phase 3 trial against dupilumab, which if successful, will help further support RINVOQ as a highly differentiated therapeutic option for patients with atopic dermatitis. We look forward to seeing data from this head-to-head study later this quarter. In the area of inflammatory bowel diseases, we remain on track to see induction data later this quarter from our Phase 3 program for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis. We will see data from a second induction study in ulcerative colitis, as well as results from the maintenance portion of these studies next year. We expect to file our regulatory applications in 2021 as well. We are also making great progress with the development programs for SKYRIZI and later this quarter we expect data from several new indications across rheumatology and gastroenterology. We will see data from two Phase 3 studies in psoriatic arthritis and results from the first Phase 3 induction study in Crohn’s disease, supporting regulatory applications for both indications in 2021. Outside of immunology, SKYRIZI will also be evaluated as a potential treatment for COVID-19 as part of the NIH ACTIV program, which is a public private partnership aimed at accelerating potential therapies and vaccines for COVID-19. SKYRIZI was selected through a prioritization process that evaluated immunomodulators with acceptable safety profiles as potential treatments for COVID-19 complications caused by the cytokine storm observed in some patients. SKYRIZI will be included in the ACTIV-5 Big Effect trial, which is a Phase 2 study designed to evaluate a number of drugs that are either approved or in late-stage development as potential treatments for COVID-19. In our early-stage immunology pipeline, earlier this year, we toplined positive results from a proof-of-concept study evaluating our novel TNF steroid conjugate, ABBV-3373 in RA. We recently completed the Phase 1 PK and safety study for our second TNF steroid conjugate, ABBV-154. Based on these data, we have selected 154 to move forward into larger scale trials. We expect to begin a Phase 2b definitive dose ranging study for 154 in RA for the first half of 2021. As Rick mentioned, we will be hosting an Immunology Day for investors in December, where we will provide an update on our immunology strategy and long-term outlook for the franchise. We look forward to providing additional updates on our immunology pipeline at that time. In oncology, we continue to advance our portfolio with several important Phase 3 studies beginning in the quarter, including VENCLEXTA in high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and navitoclax in myelofibrosis. We also recently received full FDA approval of VENCLEXTA in combination with azacitidine, decitabine or low-dose cytarabine in newly diagnosed AML patients, who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. This approval is supported by the Phase 3 VIALE-A and VIALE-C studies. Updated efficacy and safety results from VIALE-A were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine and showed that the combination of VENCLEXTA and azacitidine extended overall survival compared to azacitidine plus placebo. Additionally, following the publication of the VIALE-A results, the NCCN guidelines were updated to recommend the VENCLEXTA and azacitidine combination as the Category 1 preferred treatment for AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. Importantly, the VENCLEXTA combination has the Category 1 designation irrespective of mutational status. Also in the quarter, we announced a collaboration with I-Mab to develop and commercialize the anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, lemzoparlimab. The emerging data for lemzoparlimab is very encouraging and provides AbbVie access to another potentially differentiated asset in the immuno-oncology space. The data generated to date show that lemzoparlimab effectively blocks tumor-specific CD47 interactions, but with much lower binding to red blood cells, potentially leading to a better safety profile. Lemzoparlimab is being studied in multiple cancers with a focus on hematological malignancies. In neuroscience, we recently presented new data from several clinical programs at the virtual Migraine Trust International Symposium, showcasing the breadth and strength of our migraine portfolio and demonstrating AbbVie’s commitment to providing multiple treatment options for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine. In total, 15 abstracts were presented for BOTOX, UBRELVY and atogepant.  Included in the MTIS presentation were the detailed results for atogepant in the Phase 3 advanced study, which demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement over placebo, with all atogepant doses for the primary endpoint of reduction in mean monthly migraine days. Significant improvements were also observed for all secondary endpoints in the 30-milligram and 60-milligram dose groups. Treatment with atogepant resulted in 56% to 61% of subjects achieving at least a 50% reduction in monthly migraine days, compared to 29% for the placebo group. We are very encouraged by the strong benefit/risk profile that has been demonstrated for atogepant in migraine prevention and believe that once approved, this new oral treatment option will be competitively positioned in the prevention market. Together with BOTOX for chronic migraine prevention and UBRELVY for acute migraine treatment, the addition of atogepant creates a market leading portfolio in migraine that represents significant long-term value for AbbVie. In aesthetics, we continue to make good progress with our portfolio of facial toxins and dermal fillers. We have several ongoing programs for new indications for BOTOX and for the JUVÉDERM collection, as well as a pipeline of innovative toxins and dermal fillers, which we expect to reach the market over the course of the next five years. BOTOX has been the leading neurotoxin for over two decades, with R&D efforts in aesthetics primarily focused on the upper face. To support expansion to the lower face region, we have several programs ongoing, including studies in masseter and platysma prominence. We recently had a positive data readout for our Phase 2 study for the reduction of masseter prominence in the lower face. This study met all primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating that the severity of prominence was reduced following a single treatment of BOTOX. Based on these results, we plan to begin Phase 3 development next year, which will support registration in the U.S. and Europe.  We also recently announced the acquisition of Luminera’s dermal filler portfolio led by HArmonyCa, which is an innovative dermal filler developed for facial soft tissue augmentation. Luminera’s assets are highly complementary to our JUVÉDERM filler franchise and we look forward to expanding their development to markets around the world. And in eye care, we recently announced positive topline results from the Phase 3 GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies, which evaluated our topical eye drop, AGN-190584 for the treatment of symptoms associated with presbyopia. In both studies, 584 met the primary endpoint and the majority of secondary endpoints, with data from both studies demonstrating that treatment with 584 resulted in significant near-vision gains in low lighting conditions without a loss of distance vision. Based on these results, we plan to submit our regulatory application to the FDA in the first half of next year. So, in summary, we have continued to make significant progress advancing and accelerating our programs this quarter, and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the coming months and through 2021.  With that, I will turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Mike. Starting with third quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottomline performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.83, above our guidance midpoint by $0.08. Total adjusted net revenues were approximately $12.9 billion, up 4.1% on a comparable operational basis and ahead of our expectations. Immunology global sales were approximately $5.8 billion, up 15% on an operational basis, despite the impact of COVID on new patient starts across the immunology market. U.S. HUMIRA sales were approximately $4.2 billion, up 7.7% compared to prior year, reflecting continued demand growth plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels remain below half a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were $951 million, down 8% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets. SKYRIZI sales were $435 million with leading in-play share in the U.S. psoriasis market and robust sequential growth internationally. RINVOQ sales were $215 million with continued strong in-play share in the U.S. RA market. Hematologic oncology delivered another strong quarter, with sales of $1.7 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. IMBRUVICA net revenues were approximately $1.4 billion, up 9% driven by our leading share in CLL. VENCLEXTA revenues were $352 million, with strong demand across all approved indications. MAVYRET sales were $414 million, down 41.1% on an operational basis, as treated patient volumes have remained below pre-COVID levels. Aesthetic sales were $967 million with BOTOX cosmetic and JUVÉDERM both experiencing a faster than expected recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience revenues were more than $1.2 billion led by VRAYLAR and our migraine portfolio. VRAYLAR once again delivered strong growth with revenues of $358 million. BOTOX Therapeutic continues to experience a rapid recovery from the COVID pandemic, with sales of $523 million in the quarter. The launch of UBRELVY is also going very well with recent direct-to-consumer promotion driving new prescription growth. Sales of UBRELVY were $38 million. We also saw a significant contribution from eye care, which had sales of $840 million. Turning now to the P&L profile for the third quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 11.7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 21.1% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 48.8% of sales, an improvement of 40 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $620 million and the adjusted tax rate was 11.7%. As Rick previously mentioned, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.47 and $10.49, including accretion from the Allergan transaction of 12% on an annualized basis. Excluded from this guidance is $6.58 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates 2020 adjusted net revenue of approximately $45.7 billion, representing an increase of $200 million from our previous estimate. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on fully reported sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated 2020 assumptions. We now expect international HUMIRA sales approaching $3.7 billion. For SKYRIZI, we now expect revenues of approximately $1.5 billion. For RINVOQ, we now expect sales of approximately $700 million. For IMBRIVICA, we now expect revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, as new patient starts in the CLL market remain below pre-COVID levels. For Aesthetics, we now expect post-close sales of approximately $2.5 billion with BOTOX cosmetic and JUVÉDERM both demonstrating a fast recovery. For MAVYRET, we now expect sales of approximately $1.9 billion, as treatments remain below pre-COVID levels. We now expect LUPRON revenues of approximately $750 million, as we work to resolve a near-term supply issue, which has impacted availability of certain formulations. Moving to the P&L, we continue to forecast full year adjusted gross margin just above 82% of sales and adjusted operating margin of approximately 48% of sales. This guidance includes approximately $600 million in expense synergies for the partial year in 2020. We remain on track to deliver greater than $2 billion in expense synergies by 2022. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate adjusted net revenue approaching $13.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest favorable impact on reported sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. We model a non-GAAP tax rate of 11.6% and we expect the average share count to be similar to Q3. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.83 and $2.85, excluding approximately $1.73 of known intangible amortization and specified items. Finally, AbbVie’s strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated $12.7 billion of operating cash flow in the first nine months of the year, and our cash and investments balance at the end of September was $8 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie’s long-term outlook, today we announced a 10.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2021. We also remain on track to pay down $15 billion to $18 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021 and expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of next year, with further deleveraging through 2023. With that, I will turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, first question, please?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions and congrats on the results. I guess just two for me. First, 2021, I know you are not giving guidance yet, but can you just talk through some of the pushes and pulls we should keep in mind as we think about next year’s numbers and it seems like the core business obviously has a lot of traction here. I am just trying to get a sense of from your perspective what are the uncertainties as you think about that guidance number for next year? And my second question was on RINVOQ in atopic derm. Can you just elaborate a bit more on how you are thinking about the size of that opportunity? I know one of your peers has a single indication JAK in AD they think is a $3 billion peak sales opportunity. I know that’s well above your risk adjusted numbers you had a few years ago. It sounds like now you are talking about potential multi-billion dollar opportunity. But just help us flesh out a little bit about how big of an opportunity could this be for the product? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So, Chris, this is Rick. I will talk a little bit about 2021 and then Mike maybe can talk a little bit about how we view RINVOQ in AD and Rob. So when we look at 2021, I think, you have to step back and say, how are we performing this year? And obviously we are performing very well. There’s still some COVID impact built in. It varies a bit by therapeutic areas, some areas are impacted more than others. So as an example, CLL has been impacted more than other areas, HCV has been impacted more than other areas. It’s usually places where the therapy can be delayed without significant consequence for the patient is where we are seeing most significant delays. So as we move through the fourth quarter, we will see whether or not that recovers more and that’s certainly one aspect of it. I would say, even without much recovery, the underlying performance of the business looks good. I think you can look at the dividend increase that we put through and that should give you some flavor for the level of confidence that we have, because obviously, we would want to tie that to what we assumed that we could deliver from an overall performance standpoint. I’d also say that, as we look to consensus, we are comfortable with what we see in consensus in 2021. So we want to see a few other things just play out primarily around COVID, how much improvement we get. We have launched a number of programs over the course of the last couple of months to try to activate patients more, to go to their physicians and seek treatment out. I think those programs, some of those programs will be successful and we will see some of those increase, particularly in immunology, because dermatology is another one of those areas that the new patient starts are still off a little bit. Now, obviously, SKYRIZI is performing extremely well and HUMIRA continues to perform well. So, I’d say that’s the single biggest issue. Rob, Mike, do you want to talk about RINVOQ?
Michael Severino: Certainly. I will start and then pass it over to Rob, if he wants to add a little bit more detail. We view atopic dermatitis as a very attractive and a very substantial opportunity overall. It’s an indication that I think for many years was underappreciated by the industry. Now that’s changed recently and you have seen a lot of focus in drug development in atopic dermatitis. We feel very good about the profile that we have demonstrated, coming out of Phase 2, when we made those statements about the risk-adjusted potential in atopic dermatitis, we felt good about our data and those data were sufficient to get a breakthrough therapy designation. We are in the fortunate and not always that common situation where our Phase 3 results have actually outperformed our expectations based on Phase 2. And if you look at the Phase 3 results, they are really strong across the board. They are strong in total response. They are strong in repeated response and they are strong on components like itch, which is the most troublesome symptom to patients in the majority of cases. And so, when you couple that with the safety profile that we have demonstrated, which we think is very favorable. We see this as something that has very real potential and when we look across studies, we feel very good about our results. And of course, we have a head-to-head study with dupilumab, which is coming up later on this quarter and so that will be important additional information, and we are very optimistic about those results. Rob, I don’t know if you would like to add anything further?
Rob Michael: Chris, this is Rob. So if you think about atopic dermatitis, it’s a $3 billion global market with very strong growth potential. In our 2025 risk adjusted guidance of greater than $10 billion for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, we included $1 billion of revenue for RINVOQ AD, but we feel pretty good that we can achieve that expectation.
Rick Gonzalez: And the only other thing I’d add is, I think atopic derm is a market very similar to several others, in fact, psoriasis, I would say, is a similar type of market. But as you get more competitors in the market driving promotion, it has a very large population of patients. So the question is, activating those patients and getting them to go into the physician’s offices to seek treatment. And so, obviously, when you have one company doing that, they have the capacity to drive a certain amount. When you have more than one company, you are doubling or tripling the amount of promotion activity, particularly here in the U.S. and that tends to activate more patients to seek treatment. I think if you looked at the total available market of patients who would qualify, it’s a huge market, it’s north of $5 billion easily. So the question is, how fast can you activate them and how broadly can you activate those patients? From a profile standpoint of our drug, I think we will compete quite effectively, and I think, in particular, the performance around itch is going to give us an advantage. So it’s a very attractive market and it’s certainly one that we will focus a lot of attention on to drive.
Rob Michael: And Chris, this is Rob again. Just to clarify, I said exceed or achieve, but we expect to exceed that $1 billion risk-adjusted number for RINVOQ AD in 2025.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Thanks. Rick a question to you. With the dividend going up, it looks like you have got about a 6.5% dividend yield. The core business is performing well. And my question is, what are the -- and you are now a $50 billion to $55 billion topline company. What are the pipeline assets that can really move the needle, I know all the new indications for the existing NMEs, but what new NMEs can be really substantial to move the needle on a $55 billion topline, because I think, that’s part of why you have got an industry high dividend yield?
Rick Gonzalez: So, Geoff, this is Rick. I think if you look at the business, you have to look at it in phases, right? So I’d say the phase between now and call it 2025, 2026. That growth is going to be driven by expansion of RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, continued strong growth in the neuroscience pipeline, continued strong growth in the aesthetics pipeline and continued strong growth in the hem/onc. Starting in that 2025 timeframe and beyond, that’s where the earlier to mid-stage pipeline will drive a significant amount of growth. Now there will be assets like Navitoclax, like 951, atogepant, that will come in prior to that and help boost growth right around ‘23 and ‘24. But I can tell you, we are very confident that we have now built a portfolio that can sustain growth and drive growth on the other side of the LOE. In fact, I would tell you that, when I look at RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, and I look at the in-play market shares that we see with those assets today, when we gave guidance of 2025, we assumed that on average, we would achieve high single-digit market share across the indications. So as an example, if you look at SKYRIZI right now, SKYRIZI’s in-play share is 33%, the market leader by a wide margin. The next closest product is at 16% in-play share. And its TRX share is now at 11% and climbing rapidly. So it’s already above what we had assumed the peak would have been out in 2025 from a market share standpoint. And if we maintain that 33% by then, it will have an overall share of about 33%, so it will be three times what we had assumed for psoriasis. So when you look at the speed at which we are bringing the new indications, when you look at the breadth of those indications across the revenue base that HUMIRA has today, we have covered all of the major indications for HUMIRA plus one more that HUMIRA doesn’t have, which is atopic derm. And if we can achieve that kind of market share in each of these indications, then we will obviously double what we assumed that 2025 number was and that gets you pretty close to covering all of HUMIRA in the U.S. So I am very encouraged about that. And I think that, along with the other assets and the four major growth platforms, gives us a tremendous amount of confidence that we can drive growth on a sustainable basis at a very high level.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho.
Vamil Divan: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So maybe just sort of following up on what has been asked. For 2021 on Chris’ question, can you just talk a little bit about how you are thinking about drug pricing pressure, either U.S. or globally just to think about our modeling for next year, I think, that would be helpful? And then maybe building on Geoff’s question, I think one of the other concerns that investors have is around potential tax reform that may come out of D.C. depending on how the election plays out. I know it’s tough to ask just a few days before the election. But I guess based on what you are seeing especially from the Biden side, I guess the Biden plan right now. Is there anything you can share with investors at this point in terms of how your tax rate may change going forward and I appreciate there’s probably not much that you can give, but any insights I think would be helpful, because I think it is investors seem very concerned about at this point? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah. Well, Vamil, obviously, it’s still unclear as to what the landscape will be on the other side of the election, so we obviously have to let that play out. Having said that, I think, we assume that there will be continued pressure on the industry as it relates to drug pricing. As far as what our expectations would be in 2021, I think our expectations in 2021 from a price standpoint will be similar to what they were in ‘19 and ‘20, and is we weren’t reliant on price. I mean, fortunately our business is primarily a volume-driven business. It’s typically in areas that are very serious diseases and have strong value propositions. And so that gives me confidence that we will be able to fare reasonably well even if there are changes. I’d say the second thing is, it’s unlikely that you will get changes that have a significant impact early on in ‘21, because there’s going to be a lot of debate here about what those changes are. What I would hope the debate ultimately transitions to is co-pays and out-of-pocket costs for patients, because that is the fundamental issue and it’s particularly the issue when you look at Part D patients. They have to pay far too much of the burden of the cost from an out-of-pocket cost standpoint. And they are really the only group of patients in the U.S. that have that kind of burden associated with them. If you look at the overall performance from a cost standpoint of Medicare Part D. It’s performed very well. In fact, if you go back to the original CBO estimates over the last 10 years, it’s come in 45% below the original estimates for what it would grow. And if you look at Part D, it’s grown at about the rate of other healthcare services inflation, not significantly higher. And so the affordability problem is really around those co-pays. We have to drive those co-pays.  And then I think the other thing that has to be played in here is, I would hope as this debate goes on, they are going to look very carefully at our industry and the value of our industry both from a societal standpoint, as well as an economic standpoint and this is tremendously value industry. Just look at what we have done as an industry as it relates to this pandemic, whether you are talking about vaccines or you are talking about therapeutics, look at what we have done in advancements with cancer. And then from an economic standpoint, this industry supports directly or indirectly 4 million jobs in the United States, typically high paying jobs. It produces a tremendous amount of economic output for the U.S. And so it’s an industry that you don’t want to damage in the process and I think that has to be part of the debate. But the short answer to your question is, I think, you should -- we should -- we are not assuming we will get a lot of benefit from price in ‘21. We are also not assuming that across that year we would see a significant change that would have a dramatic impact on that calendar year. Tax reform was your next question.
Rob Michael: Vamil, It’s Rob. So based on a very high level of information on the Biden proposal, we would see an increase in our tax rate like most U,S, companies, but it’s really difficult to provide a rate impact without the details. That said, AbbVie would still have a favorable profile versus our peers and we wouldn’t have raised our dividend if we were overly concerned about the implications.
Rick Gonzalez: And the only thing I’d add, Vamil, on that one is, we obviously did flex what we thought the tax rate could be and we just don’t know that much about it, we know what has been said. But we flexed it against this dividend increase and made sure we were absolutely comfortable with payout ratios based on that and we are or we wouldn’t have moved forward with the 10.2% increase.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: Thank you so much, and congratulations on another impressive quarter. I have several questions, but three of them are short. Can you be more specific on where SKYRIZI patients are coming from? I think it’s notable that COSENTYX was a bit light this quarter and Novartis cited competition? Secondly, what was the non-GAAP interest expense number in the quarter? Third, you provided guidance for HUMIRA OUS, but I don’t think U.S. So can you tell us what you think the U.S. guidance would look like? And then, lastly, we have tracked clinical trial activity during the pandemic and it shows AbbVie recruiting trials were up 14% year-to-date. That is industry-leading two times greater than the next closest competitor and much better than the average, which is down, and I am just curious, what accounts for this? Is it a deliberate strategy to capture patients when other companies are taking a wait-and-see approach or is it something else? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah. So, Steve, I will handle your first question. Rob will handle two and three, and Mike can handle number four. So if you look at the in-play share, about 25% of that in-play share is coming -- on SKYRIZI is coming from HUMIRA. The other 75% is coming from competitors. I’d say it’s primarily the 17s but some coming from the other 12, 23s or 23s, but I’d say the bulk of it is coming from the 17s. So that might answer your question about COSENTYX. If you look at the capture of the type of patient that we are getting with SKYRIZI, it’s very balanced. It’s about 50/50 between first-line and then second-line. So that’s a nice balance between IE patients and patients who have failed other therapies. So I think the asset is performing the way you would expect a high-performing, high-efficacy asset to be able to perform, is -- it has quickly become the preferred product by prescribing physicians. It has a great profile. It’s quarterly dosing. It’s got great efficacy. The efficacy improves over time. There aren’t any assets that have that kind of a profile on the market. So I would expect that SKYRIZI will continue to increase its in-play share. It’s jumped about 3 points over the last maybe two months and I would expect it will continue to increase.
Rob Michael: Hey. Steve, this is Rob. On your question on interest expense, for non-GAAP and GAAP, it’s the same number. It’s $620 million in the third quarter. We are no longer specifying any interest expense, because we have now closed the transaction, so that negative carry on the bond is no longer is applicable for the specified. So $620 million is the number for both non-GAAP and GAAP. On the U.S. HUMIRA question, so we did not change our guidance, it continues to be 8 -- for the U.S. HUMIRA 8% growth with a low single-digit price contribution.
Michael Severino: This is Mike. I will take your last question on clinical trial activity. The first thing that, I would say is, the increase in clinical trial activity reflects what’s going on in our pipeline and there’s a lot of activity in our pipeline, and a large number of molecules that we are advancing, and so that’s a big part of it. Another part is that, we made the conscious decision to leave decisions around enrollment in the hands of investigators rather than making them centrally, because they understand the situation in their hospital in their community better than we do. And there was a small group of studies that we paused at the time of the initial COVID impact, but the majority we allowed to continue. That doesn’t mean that there weren’t disruptions from COVID. But it does mean that investigators decided when it was time to pause enrollment and when it was time to resume enrollment.  And I think the evidence shows that they made those decisions better than they could have been made centrally. And that has allowed us to advance our portfolio, to advance our clinical trials with minimal disruption and with safe conduct for patients and the staff at the site, which are also critically important considerations. And so, I’d say, it’s a combination of those factors.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.
Rick Gonzalez: Hi. How are you?
Jon Lim: This is Jon Lim on for Navin Jacob.
Rick Gonzalez: Hi, Jon. Yeah. Sorry…
Jon Lim: We just had a few questions.
Rick Gonzalez: You guys pass along [ph].
Jon Lim: We just had a few questions. First, regarding the HUMIRA question in the U.S., within the markets in which a biosimilar is out there, what percent of the molecule is now brand versus biosimilars? With now almost two years of biosimilar experience, how does that affect things? And next for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, can achieve the type of uptake that you have been seeing in the U.S. and in the international markets? We would appreciate any commentary around in-play market share achieved in markets you have been approved in. And lastly, if we could talk about VRAYLAR MDD timing? Thank you.
Rob Michael: Okay. This is Rob. Just to clarify, the first question was on international HUMIRA, how much of that is now a biosimilar?
Jon Lim: Right. Within the markets where there’s a biosimilar, how much is…
Rob Michael: Yeah.
Jon Lim: … brand versus biosimilar, help us visualize that question…
Rick Gonzalez: I think he wants what’s the molecule…
Rob Michael: [Inaudible]
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah.
Rob Michael: Yeah. We are at about 60% molecule share across the Board. So that’s of all of the international markets, on average, it’s about 60% molecule share.
Rick Gonzalez: And then on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, I don’t have the numbers right in front of me on each of the markets. I would say typically in the international market, it is a slightly slower uptake than it is in the U.S., but still doing very well. So maybe the best thing would be to get back to you with some more specifics around that. But I think you can assume that the in-play share there probably averages between 20% and 30%. But it depends obviously on the country that you are talking about. And then on VRAYLAR MDD timing, Mike?
Michael Severino: Yes. On VRAYLAR MDD, we would expect to have the study’s readout in the second half of next year and be prepared for regulatory submissions shortly thereafter. So it’s possible we would have an approval in ‘22.
Rick Gonzalez: And I think that’s an important point to make here. If we look at VRAYLAR, VRAYLAR is growing very rapidly. And as you know, the atypical anti-psychotic market is very, very large. I think VRAYLAR’s share is something like 3% and it’s tracking at $1.4 billion at 3%. So if we look at the current indications, as we indicated in the comments, of bipolar and schizophrenia, we think we can drive VRAYLAR alone in those indications to a multi-billion dollar product and that’s just driving that market share penetration up to like 5% or so. And I think that’s very doable based on the profile of VRAYLAR. VRAYLAR has a very unique profile in that market. So MDD, if we are successful, obviously, will open up a whole other channel and allow you to increase that market share even more significantly. And so typically, many of the drugs that achieved MDD were drugs that had $5 billion, $6 billion of annual revenues. So this is a nice opportunity. Without MDD, VRAYLAR is still going to be a very important product and a very significant product. With MDD, it becomes a major product. And so we will see how those next two studies play out. The first study was positive and I think we are hopeful that we will be able to get it.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Sriker [ph]. I think that was you. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.
Randall Stanicky: Great. Thanks. Rick, early in the pandemic, you were one of the few to identify or build an impact for potential headwinds from higher unemployment associated with loss of health coverage. What are you currently seeing right now and anything on the patient assistance program numbers that help you inform on that? And then secondly, I just wanted to ask on BOTOX migraine. This has been historically a roughly $600 million high margin product for Allergan. We have been watching CGRP inhibitors now been in the market a couple of years. Do you see this as a growth product or opportunity for you and what are you seeing overall with respect to BOTOX in migraine? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: So on the unemployment, we did identify back, I guess, it was in the first quarter call, that we were going to build in a level of risk associated with patients who would have to move to some type of an assistance program, because they lost their jobs. We have not seen that impact play out to any significant level. We have not seen it in our patient assistance program and right around the pandemic we made a decision to proactively go out and advertise our patient assistance program just to make sure that patients knew that if they couldn’t afford their AbbVie drugs that they could get them from us. So I think we proactively tried to drive it in an effort to make sure that patients were not exposed, but we haven’t seen very much at all. We still have some coverage left in the fourth quarter for it. But I’d say at this point, I think, we are questioning whether or not we are going to see it. Now, I can’t tell you exactly why. But I can tell you we are monitoring it carefully and it’s definitely not happening, at least in our business, because we would see it in the patient assistance program. On BOTOX migraine, if you actually look at what is happening with patients on BOTOX migraine, when the injectable CGRPs came into the market, you did see a tick down in patients, but then BOTOX recovered. And it has roughly the same number of patients that it had back then. It’s slightly lower than it had back then. So what the CGRPs ended up doing was expanding the market to some extent. And we are seeing a very similar phenomenon on the acute therapies as well. If you look at the scripts, the NBRxs for the acute CGRPs, you can see that it’s actually almost doubling every quarter the number of patients. In the last quarter, it was about 90,000 to 100,000 NBRxs. So I think these assets can significantly expand the market. I think two-thirds of our patients are patients that have switched on the acute, have switched from triptans to our agent and one-third of them are naive patients that we are bringing into the category. And again, that’s all about making it visible to patients who have this condition so that they go to their physician and ask for the therapy. It’s all about building markets essentially. And so I think one of the things these assets will do is they will expand the market. Now, I think as you expand the market, obviously BOTOX therapeutics, some of those patients will ultimately if they don’t get the kind of relief that they are looking for on an injectable CGRP or the acute therapy, they would eventually probably try injectable BOTOX. So we could see a little bit of growth there, but the biggest part of the growth that we are going to see in this market is from UBRELVY and ultimately atogepant. It’s a big market and I think these agents will allow us to be able to significantly expand the market and I think this is clearly a multi-billion dollar market.
Liz Shea: Thank, Randall. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger: Thanks very much. Excuse me, so I want to start with a high-level question, Rick. Could you please discuss long-term immunology net pricing and formulary positioning prospects in the face of increasing competition in coming years? And then second, just had a high level question about cash flow, I was hoping that you could discuss prospects for operating cash flow, CapEx and free cash flow? Thank you very much.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah. Thanks, David. I will take the first one. Rob will answer the second one for you. So if I look at long-term immunology, what’s critically important is that you have the kinds of assets that allow that managed care organization or PBM to be able to cover the greatest number of patients. This is a category where not every drug works on every patient. So you have to have multiple options that are available in the formulary and that’s just -- that is the appropriate thing to do to make sure that patients have the drugs that they need to be able to be treated. I would say, we typically do very well with formulary access. That’s driven primarily by the fact that our assets tend to be very attractive assets from a clinical profile. They establish significant market share positions and that’s important for the managed care organization or the PBM. So I don’t see anything significantly impacting that going forward. I would assume we will maintain very high levels of formulary access. Net pricing, there’s always some level of impact on pricing when you renegotiate the contracts. I don’t anticipate that you will see a significant change going forward. So I think it’s more of the normal kinds of competitive activities that we see in the marketplace.
Rob Michael: And David, this is Rob. I will answer your question on cash flow, so if you look at AbbVie and Allergan in 2019 on a combined basis, generated about $19 billion almost $20 billion of operating cash flow. CapEx runs close to $1 billion, and so if you look at this year, again, we have a partial year of Allergan, we are probably trending towards the $16 billion operating cash flow number with a little bit less than $1 billion of CapEx. So you need to annualize that and also consider the fact that we are going to generate earnings growth going forward, but that should give you a good number to work with.
David Risinger: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering first, maybe on the IBD front, I know you have a number of readouts coming up for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI here. Maybe you could just outline what current usage of targeted drugs in IBD is on a percentage basis and how that compares to rheumatology and dermatology? And what you see is a potential here to boost that uptake in IBD further? And then to your TNF steroid conjugate program, what were the criteria that were key that led to your choice of 154 as a go-forward asset? And then lastly, on the Allergan integration, I know you said everything is on track there. It’s going really well. You talked about some revenue synergy opportunity, Rick, and I know you have laid out your expense synergy target of $2 billion in 2022. Maybe you could just talk about some of the puts and takes for 2021 as we think about the Allergan synergies on both sides? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Great. On IBD usage, if you look at the penetration, I’d say, IBD is an area where you have reasonable levels of biologic penetration, because the disease particularly Crohn’s is the disease is a pretty severe. I think the challenge in IBD is that, with the current therapies that are available, you still get sub-optimal clinical efficacy for these patients and durability of that efficacy. And so what physicians tend to do is they rotate patients through various treatments to try to maintain them in control for a longer period of time. So it is a market that is right for higher efficacy agents and a market that is right for more agents to be available to allow for better treatment of those patients and that’s the key driver in that segment of what gives significant uptake. So when we see the data around IBD that will be important for us, obviously the early data looks good. And ultimately I think these assets, along with HUMIRA, will be able to provide the market with a significant new alternative and I think that uptake will be good based on that.
Michael Severino: This is Mike. I will take the question about 154. So, 3373 and 154 represent our TNF steroid conjugate molecules that are in the clinic. They are very similar, similar to the extent that we view the biology as being translatable between the two. But 154 includes some improvements in linker technology that relate to manufacturability and ability to formulate at high concentration, ease of formulation. And so those can be very important advantages for a successful molecule. We previously toplined the positive results from 3373. We wanted to see that 154 gave us the PK performance and the exposure to achieve the pharmacodynamic coverage we think we need in the next stage of development. And as I said, we viewed the biology as translatable between the two. So once we saw that PK performance and it matched our expectations and showed that 154 would give us the coverage that we were seeking at acceptable doses in the clinic, we made the decision to advance that molecule into larger scale trials.
Rob Michael: Hey. Terence, this is Rob. I will take your question on synergies. So while we are not providing guidance for 2021 today. I think a good way to think about the expense synergies is to run rate the $600 million in partial year synergies, which gets to about $1 billion. And then, as you think about that ramp to greater than $2 billion by 2022, I think it’s reasonable to straight line that. So if you think about what’s going to drive the ramp? It’s things like systems integration, leveraging procurement spend, will result in more synergies over time, as well as network optimization. In the near-term, it’s really driven more from immediate redundancies like corporate infrastructure and R&D portfolio optimization. As it relates to the revenue synergies, look, as we have now had a few months with the combined company, we see opportunities as we think about investment in aesthetics, where we have really amped up our DTC investment for JUVÉDERM and BOTOX cosmetic, it give o the ability to invest more in aesthetics. Similarly, invest more in neuroscience, whether that’s VRAYLAR, BOTOX therapeutic. And then we look internationally given the infrastructure we have, the integrated brand team approach, we think there’s opportunity to really leverage our market access capability, our international affiliate structure to really drive that international growth for the company going forward for those Allergan brands as well.
Rick Gonzalez: Terence, the only thing I would add, maybe to give you some perspective on the investment side. Allergan tended to what I would describe as pulse invest in particularly DTC, but even in social media. So they didn’t -- and typically what we do with brands when we want to drive maximum speed of market penetration is we invest at a steady state and continue to do that for an extended period of time. So they might have invested heavily in one quarter and then gone dark in the next quarter and then invested again and gone dark again. We don’t use that kind of a strategy. We tend to invest for the full year. And in our experience, what that does is it gives you, the fact that you have constant coverage, gives you maximum speed of penetration. So we clearly think that’s going to be an advantage, particularly in areas like aesthetics and neuroscience.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Truist.
Gregg Gilbert: Thank you for getting me in. Good morning. Rick, it sounds like you think the neuroscience franchise might be one of the sleepers of the Allergan deal and you have already framed the potential for VRAYLAR particularly if depression hits. But I was curious if this development in neuroscience has taken on sort of a new sense of urgency given the heft that you have now in that franchise or whether you think you have enough going on there already? And for Mike, I was hoping you could let us know when we will see Phase 3 data for 951 in Parkinson’s and give us a sneak preview of what you are looking for there profile wise? And lastly, can you frame for BOTOX therapeutics, Mike, what you have decided to pursue in terms of indications versus ones that you have taken off the table now that you have had some time to work with that? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: I’d say on neuroscience, the way to think about it is or at least the way we are thinking about it is, there’s a significant opportunity to drive VRAYLAR to be a very large product, I mean, doubling or more depending upon the ability to get MDD. And I’d also say in migraine, when we get the full portfolio of migraine assets. The migraine market is a big market. If you look at the acute market today, it’s probably about $1.5 billion. We believe it can grow to $4 billion or $5 billion by 2025 with the right kinds of assets and the right kind of promotion. And then if you look at the preventative market, it’s about $3 billion, so we believe that one in real high-single to low-double digits with the right kinds of assets and the right kinds of promotion. So the first phase of neuroscience is nothing more than taking the assets we have now, getting atogepant to the marketplace and then we have a full portfolio of migraine products, and then maximizing the market share position of those assets in the market, that’s sort of Phase 1. But I would say now that we have infrastructure in place, Mike’s BD team has been now been starting to look at assets that would be complementary to that. And we didn’t in the past because for a single anti-psychotic, we wouldn’t have wanted to build-out the infrastructure, it just wouldn’t have made sense for us. But now we can basically add those kinds of assets to the infrastructure we have. So it does give us another opportunity from a BD standpoint to be able to build the business longer term.
Michael Severino: I will take the second question and agree with everything Rick said, the only thing I’d add on BD in neuroscience is neuropsychiatry is now clearly an area of strength for us and can be an area of interest and that can go beyond the anti-psychotics as well. There’s tremendous potential and unmet need in areas like generalized anxiety disorder, still in depression despite there are many agents on the market, many, many patients remain inadequately treated, so we would look broadly across that space. With respect to 951 and data timing, we would expect to see results from our Phase 3 study in the second half of next year. And what we are looking for is really DUOPA like efficacy, because DUOPA is a transformational product but it’s also a product that is challenging to administer, and the nature of that product, the fact that it requires the placement of a gastric tube that’s then threaded into the small bowel and has to be maintained limits the size of what’s effectively an addressable market. Not the market by the labeled indication, but the proportion of patients within that population that would consider a therapy like that. And 951 has the potential to substantially expand that. It has an insulin pump-like device, subcutaneous delivery device. We think it will broaden the number of patients within that labeled population, who would consider such a therapy and this is really a very substantial market. So for example, if you look at DUOPA, despite all of its challenges, it does about $0.5 billion in sales. If you look across similar therapies for advanced Parkinson’s disease, the market is probably $1.5 billion or more and that probably represents only a small part of the potential because much of it remains untapped. So we think that 951 can address that and we think the profile that it will take to address that is DUOPA like efficacy with a more patient-friendly subcutaneous delivery device. With respect to BOTOX indications, there are a number of indications, both for BOTOX and for other toxins, for novel toxins that we are considering in the therapeutic space. I think there’s more work that we can do in the migraine space. Although, that has been an area of strength, episodic migraine has patients that may benefit from a therapy like BOTOX and there’s still much more to do on the neurology side with respect to specificity disorders that might be secondary to stroke or other conditions where there is still room to expand those indications. When we look more broadly, there are a number of potential interesting indications for neurotoxins. They might not be BOTOX. They may be novel toxins. Those could be things like prevention of afib, for example, and we are continuing to explore indications beyond that.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Gregg. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: Thank you. A high level question for Rick, despite Allergan being a very reasonable solution to upcoming U.S. HUMIRA LOE in 2023, the multiple on AbbVie is lower than it’s ever been. The entire drug group is out of favor, but your multiple is about half of the peer group average. To me what that multiple says is that investors remain worried about what AbbVie looks like past 2023. So two questions related to this, the first is why not give updated granular extended guidance that goes beyond 2023? You have given long-term guidance in the past sometimes and that’s resonated well with the market. So can we expect you might do this at some point soon? And second question, why not go do more M&A in the near-term, we just saw Bristol do a $13 billion deal not far after closing Celgene and layering more product into your pipeline would help give investors assurances that there’s life beyond 2023. And by virtue of how you answered an earlier question, you yourself basically said there’s not much new NME flow until 2025 and beyond? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah. I think if you look -- Tim, this is Rick. If you look at the PE of the whole sector, obviously, the sector is under pressure from the political environment and concerns about the political environment. And you are correct, we are at the lower end of that PE and I think that is driven by uncertainty about what the growth rate will be on the other side of the LOE. What I would tell you is obviously, we have a 10-year LLP, so we know what we think that growth rate is on the other side of the LOE. And I can tell you that when I look at that growth rate, it’s robust.  Now, the market has to come around to that point of view. I’d say, we haven’t always been right, but in total revenue, we have always been right. In fact, we have always beat for the most part what our expectations were. And so we obviously challenge it pretty hard and we have knowledge of what we believe the erosion curve will look like. We have knowledge of what we think our pipeline will deliver and what the additional indications will deliver. And look, I remember there was a tremendous amount of skepticism about when we gave it was either $10 billion or $11 billion of risk adjusted revenues for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI back a year or two ago, something like that. There was a tremendous amount of skepticism, that’s impossible. I don’t hear very much of that now that these two assets are $2 billion and growing like rockets. So I’d say our ability to assess what we can do with our assets is pretty high.  Now, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go out and get more things and we constantly look and where we find opportunity, we will clearly go pursue those. They have to be opportunities that make sense and fit into our portfolio. You have seen us do transactions to continue to build the long-term future of our hem/onc business with Genmab and I-Mab. And those two assets combined with what VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA can continue to do, I think it is going to give us a very robust long-term performance in that franchise. I think in immunology, we are in pretty good shape between our internal pipeline both the additional indications on SKYRIZI and RINVOQ and then what we have earlier on that we think will play out in a positive way. When we look at neuroscience, we just talked about that we have the ability to be able to grow that. Certainly, we are going to invest heavily in aesthetics. We have a tremendous amount of assets, new toxins that we are working on and we are going to accelerate many of those, new fillers and other kinds of opportunities that will build that aesthetics business to be able to grow rapidly. And so I feel pretty good about where we are. In fact, I’d tell you I feel very good about where we are six months into the Allergan transaction. Certainly Allergan has given us more growth as we mentioned a moment ago. When we look at neuroscience, neuroscience has clearly been I think a nice positive upside for us and one that I think we can execute very well. As far as guidance is concerned, I am not saying, we will never give guidance, but we want to give guidance when we are able to do it with a high degree of certainty. Because the last thing we want to do is provide a level of guidance that you don’t have a high degree of certainty and you know it’s going to, it has some variability to it. You probably remember, we did that on the international biosimilars and we were off by not that much, but we were off by some and the market didn’t like the fact that we were off. So you need to be awfully careful about how you provide that guidance in a way to make sure that you meet or exceed the guidance, and at the point which we have that level of confidence, we may go out with longer term guidance.
Tim Anderson: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next -- we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore.
Josh Schimmer: Last question. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a couple of quick ones, can you provide any color on the SKYRIZI royalty and can you comment on what you see as the incremental markets for the lower face toxins, the new dermal filler and presbyopia, if you view any of those as material? Thank you.
Rob Michael: Yeah. Josh, so on the SKYRIZI royalty, well, keep in mind that we account for this as a business combination, so it comes through consideration so you don’t see it on a non-GAAP P&L. We don’t disclose our royalty rates but a good way to think about it is reasonable royalty you would pay for a late-stage asset is probably a good way to think about what the royalty burn would be on -- the cash royalty burn will be on SKYRIZI.
Rick Gonzalez: And I’d say the lower face toxins and the lower face fillers that we are working on, probably the best way, rather than trying to characterize individual indications for toxins or fillers is, we are trying to build a portfolio and a market activation strategy that will allow us to grow the aesthetics business at a consistent double-digit rate. And it is both that internal pipeline and activating more patients, and some BD effort that will give us that. So, certainly those lower face toxins and fillers are designed to be able to support that growth going forward. The eye care product, I would call that product sort of a modest product. I don’t remember the specifics. Do you, Rob?
Rob Michael: Yeah.
Rick Gonzalez: I’d call it sort of a modest size product.
Rob Michael: Yeah.
Josh Schimmer: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Josh. That concludes today’s conference call. If you’d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-07-31 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. And thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also, on the call with me today are, Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; and Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AbbVie's operations, results and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2019 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Please note that, the second quarter financial results and guidance provided on today's call for sales EPS and line items of the P&L reflect a full period of legacy AbbVie operations and a partial year of contribution from the Allergan portfolio since the transaction closed in early May of this year. In addition, we have provided a quarterly comparable historical trend analysis for key product revenues of the newly combined company, as a supplemental table in our earnings release this quarter. This table supports the comparison of sales growth on a comparable operational basis, including full quarter current year and historical results for Allergan on a pro forma basis. Comparable operational percent changes are presented at a constant – at constant currency rate. For this comparison of underlying performance, all historically reported Allergan revenues have been recast informed to conform to AbbVie's revenue recognition accounting policies, and exclude the recent divestitures of ZENPEP and VIOKACE. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I will now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter performance and highlights. And for the first time, I'll provide our 2020 outlook for the newly combined company. Mike will then discuss recent advancements across R&D programs. And Rob, will review the quarter and our updated guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions. I'd like to start off by recognizing all of our employees, including those joining AbbVie from Allergan for all of their hard work and dedication during this pandemic. The AbbVie team has been working diligently and carefully, within our facilities and remotely, to ensure that our business continues to operate properly and our patients continue to receive their medicines. Before I speak to the strong financial performance this quarter, I'd like to characterize the state of the recovery of the business from the COVID crisis. Let me start with the legacy AbbVie side of the business, which has demonstrated robust performance leading into the pandemic and has remained resilient. The impact on continuing patients for HUMIRA and new patients for RINVOQ, SKYRIZI and VENCLEXTA, were not as pronounced as we had previously anticipated. While patient flow has not recovered, in most therapeutic segments we're encouraged by the level of stabilization, and the recent positive demand trends. Overall, the legacy AbbVie business continues to perform very well, with stand-alone revenue growth in the second quarter of approximately 8.5% on an operational basis, excluding the negative impact from COVID. On the legacy Allergan side of the business, we saw significant COVID-related impacts on BOTOX Therapeutic and our aesthetics business in the second quarter. Both businesses are seeing a rapid recovery and are now performing near pre-COVID levels. Other key brands, such as, VRAYLAR and UBRELVY were impacted in a manner similar to the AbbVie-based business. And we're pleased with the recent trends and progress. Overall, COVID had a substantial impact on second quarter reported revenues with an estimated net unfavorable impact of more than $900 million. However, by the end of June the total business had recovered to more than 90% of pre-COVID levels. So I'm pleased with the resilience and the rapid recovery across our portfolio. And I'm confident in the continued strong underlying demand and performance of the combined new company. Despite the impact from COVID, we delivered a strong second quarter performance. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 were well above our expectations. The $0.21 beat included $0.11 of net accretion from Allergan, as well as $0.10 of favorable performance versus the midpoint of our stand-alone guidance. Total revenues were $10.4 billion, including approximately $8.4 billion of legacy AbbVie sales significantly above our expectations for the standalone portfolio with continued robust performance in both hem/onc and immunology, despite the impact from COVID. Hem/onc revenues of approximately $1.6 billion were up strong double digits again this quarter. IMBRUVICA sales grew approximately 17% on an operational basis, reflecting continued strong performance in CLL, where we remain the clear market leader. VENCLEXTA sales were up more than 80% on an operational basis with strong growth in CLL and AML. During the quarter, we also announced a strategic collaboration with Genmab to further build our oncology portfolio with a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody. It has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy across B-cell malignancies. Our leading immunology business delivered revenues of more than $5.3 billion, reflecting growth of more than 8.5% on an operational basis. U.S. HUMIRA revenue growth remained strong, up 5% with continued demand from the large installed patient base, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19. International HUMIRA biosimilar dynamics in the quarter were better than our expectations. SKYRIZI continues to perform well and has maintained its leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at more than 30%. As expected, we saw modest delays to new patient starts during the quarter, as a result of the COVID-19 dynamics. However, recent prescription trends and increasing enrollment in our ambassador program two leading indicators demonstrate a strong growth trajectory and support our full year guidance of $1.4 billion. We're also seeing very encouraging trends for RINVOQ, where rheumatology office visits are approaching pre-COVID levels. RINVOQ revenues were up more than 70% on a sequential basis and currently reflect 15% in-play RA patient share, which is now nearly at parity to HUMIRA, the market leader in in-play share and above all other agents in the segment. We're also making excellent progress with our immunology pipeline, which Mike will discuss further momentarily. As I noted during the quarter, we successfully completed the acquisition of Allergan creating a stronger and a more diverse AbbVie. The transaction significantly expands and diversifies AbbVie's revenue base and complements our existing leadership positions in immunology and hematological oncology with additional growth franchises in aesthetics and neuroscience. We have growth opportunities in neuroscience with BOTOX Therapeutics, VRAYLAR and UBRELVY. And we have the leading global aesthetics business with flagship brands including BOTOX Cosmetics and JUVÉDERM. I'll start with neuroscience, which had sales of roughly $735 million to AbbVie in the second quarter. VRAYLAR continues to demonstrate rapid growth and is well on its way to surpassing $1 billion in annual revenues. Underlying demand has remained resilient despite the COVID-19 pandemic with strong double-digit growth again this quarter. We see significant room for continued expansion within VRAYLAR's existing indications bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Major depressive disorder or MDD represents another potential large indication with two Phase 3 trials well underway. Also within neuroscience, we now have a portfolio of migraine therapies that have the potential to support long-term growth in a highly attractive and underserved market. Our migraine portfolio is anchored with BOTOX Therapeutic, which had revenues of roughly $300 million to AbbVie in the second quarter. Despite multiple new competitive entrants, BOTOX Therapeutic has largely retained its total treated patient base, a testament to its efficacy, safety and brand recognition. Like many physician-administered products, BOTOX Therapeutics saw a significant impact from COVID-19 in the second quarter with global sales down approximately 20% on a comparable operational basis. However, we're pleased by the recent data trends, which demonstrate a fast recovery and performance is now close to pre-COVID levels. The launch of UBRELVY, the first-to-market in leading oral CGRP for acute migraine is off to an excellent start. Feedback from physicians has been very positive given UBRELVY's efficacy, safety and convenient dosing profile relative to current standards of care. Commercial access for UBRELVY is now at 70%, which along with increased consumer promotion will further support the product's launch trajectory. We're also developing atogepant for the prevention of episodic and chronic migraine. We recently disclosed positive top line results from a Phase 3 study in episodic migraine, which will support regulatory submission early next year. As a fourth pillar of growth we now have the world's leading global aesthetics franchise, which generated sales of roughly $480 million to AbbVie in second quarter. As anticipated, we saw a decline in year-over-year comparable operational growth with aesthetics health care providers closed during the initial phase of COVID. It's now been roughly two months since most major geographies have begun to reopen. And we're pleased with the strong recovery trends we're seeing. As of the end of June, the vast majority of our aesthetics accounts have reopened in the U.S. and we're seeing considerable pent-up demand. Current U.S. aesthetic revenues have recovered and are approaching 95% of pre-COVID levels. Outside the U.S., we're also seeing steady recovery trends in China and Western Europe. Current international aesthetics revenues have recovered to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels. Overall, we're very pleased with the momentum we're seeing on our aesthetics franchise. More broadly, we see aesthetics as a durable cash pay business with an opportunity for significant market growth, as well as continued new innovation driving long-term performance. While strategically important, the acquisition of Allergan will also drive strong financial benefits. Integration has been relatively seamless and we're impressed by the caliber of talent that we've welcomed into AbbVie. We remain on track with our synergy target of more than $2 billion in expense rationalization by the third year from transaction closing, which Rob will discuss further in his prepared remarks here momentarily. When you take these synergies into consideration along with the continued P&L leverage from our expected sales growth, we expect further operating margin expansion over the next couple of years. While the COVID crisis remains a fluid situation, our business continues to remain resilient and demonstrate strong underlying growth. Although we continue to carefully watch COVID-related events in the U.S., we're pleased with our recent business trends and the progress we're making towards recovery. And we expect performance will continue to ramp to normalized levels over the course of the second half of 2020. With these current assumptions and based on our recent outperformance of our base business, today we're issuing full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance for our new combined company of $10.35 to $10.45, reflecting growth of 16.3% at the midpoint. This guidance assumes $0.70 of net accretion from the Allergan transaction in 2020, which represents 11% accretion on an annualized basis ahead of our initial projections for the transaction despite the COVID impact that I outlined earlier. Overall, we continue to see good momentum across our total portfolio and across our pipeline. We reported a very strong second quarter performance and remain encouraged by the recent recovery trends, which are faster than we expected. We continue to expect the COVID pandemic will have a transient impact on our business with further recovery continuing through the second half of 2020. With the closing of the Allergan transaction, AbbVie is well-positioned for enhanced long-term growth potential, a growing dividend, rapid debt repayment and strong investment in innovation across our therapeutic categories. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you Rick. We had a very productive quarter with continued progress across all stages of our pipeline. Additionally with the recent closing of the Allergan acquisition, we added promising pipeline assets in the areas of aesthetics and neuroscience. We look forward to sharing updates as those programs progress through development. In immunology, we continue to advance our programs for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI in several new disease areas. This year, we intend to submit regulatory applications for three additional indications for RINVOQ. In June, we submitted applications for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis. And we expect to file applications for atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis later this year. We also recently reported topline results from our three registrational trials for RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis. Two of these Phase III studies Measure Up 1 and Measure Up 2 evaluated RINVOQ as a monotherapy for the treatment of adolescent and adult subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis for candidates for systemic therapy. In the Measure Up one and Measure Up two studies, both doses of RINVOQ met all primary and secondary endpoints, demonstrating significant improvement in skin clearance and itch compared to placebo. In Measure Up 1, roughly 70% of patients receiving the 15-milligram dose and 80% of patients on the 30-milligram dose achieved a 75% or greater improvement in skin lesions by week 16. We saw a similar rates of skin clearance in the Measure Up two study, with roughly 60% of patients receiving the low dose and 73% of patients on the high dose, achieving a 75% or greater improvement by week 16. We also saw very rapid responses in these studies with clinically meaningful reductions in itch observed as early as one day after the first dose in patients receiving 30 milligrams and two days after the first dose in patients receiving 15 milligrams in both studies. We also saw very strong results in our third registrational trial, the AD Up study which evaluated RINVOQ in combination with topical corticosteroids. Similar to the results from the two Measure Up trials, RINVOQ met all primary and secondary endpoints in the AD Up study with patients who received RINVOQ showing significant improvements in skin clearance and reduction in itch compared to patients receiving placebo plus topical steroids following 16 weeks of treatment. Treatment with RINVOQ also led to a significant increase in the number of steroid-free days. And more patients receiving RINVOQ were able to stop topical corticosteroids altogether. We're very encouraged by both the level of efficacy and the safety profile we've seen across all three Phase III atopic dermatitis studies. And we remain very confident that RINVOQ has the potential to provide a strong benefit-risk profile in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In addition to these three registrational studies, we are also evaluating RINVOQ in a head-to-head Phase III trial against dupilumab and expect to see data from this study later this year. In the area of inflammatory bowel disease, our Phase III program for RINVOQ in ulcerative colitis is progressing ahead of schedule. And we now expect to see topline data from the first Phase III induction study later this year. We also recently reported topline results from a proof-of-concept study, evaluating our novel TNF steroid conjugate ABBV-3373 in RA. In this study, our goal is to drive a greater reduction in disease activity beyond the levels that can be achieved with HUMIRA or other high-efficacy agents such as RINVOQ. To achieve adequate statistical power, we used preplanned historical HUMIRA data in combination with in-trial data when comparing ABBV-3373 to HUMIRA. The study used two analyses for the primary endpoint which evaluated improvement from baseline in DAS28 score. The first analysis used a propensity matching strategy to compare 3373 with historical HUMIRA data. This analysis showed a greater change in DAS28 from baseline to week 12 for 3373 compared to the prespecified HUMIRA data. The second analysis used the Bayesian approach to compare 3373 to a combined in-trial and historical HUMIRA data set. And this analysis predicted with a 90% probability that 3373 was associated with a greater improvement in DAS28. Based on these encouraging results, we plan to advance the TNF steroid conjugate program in RA with a Phase IIb dose-ranging study expected to begin in the first half of 2021. We also plan to begin clinical studies next year in other immune-mediated diseases. Also, in the area of immunology we're making good progress advancing the programs for SKYRIZI in new disease areas. We expect to see data from Phase III studies in psoriatic arthritis later this year and in Crohn's disease at the end of this year or early next year, with regulatory submissions for both indications expected in 2021. In oncology, we continue to advance our hem/onc strategy with several important data readouts and study starts occurring this year. We've established a leading hem/onc portfolio with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA in areas such as CLL and AML. And we will continue to generate data to demonstrate the utility of both drugs across a wide range of patient populations and cancer types. At the recent EHA Congress, detailed results from the Phase III VIALE-A study were reported which showed the treatment with a combination of VENCLEXTA plus azacitidine resulted in a 34% reduction in the risk of death compared to azacitidine plus placebo in AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The median overall survival for patients in the VENCLEXTA arm was 14.7 months versus 9.6 months in the placebo arm. Patients in the VENCLEXTA arm also showed more than double the rate of composite complete remission compared to those treated with azacitidine alone. This filing is currently being reviewed by the FDA under the real-time oncology review program in Project Orbis. To-date, the AML program has focused on VENCLEXTA's use as a frontline treatment in transplant-ineligible patients. This year, we are expanding the program into other patient segments with the goal of establishing VENCLEXTA as a gold standard across the AML patient spectrum. Earlier this year, we initiated two Phase III studies, evaluating VENCLEXTA as a maintenance therapy in AML. One trial in fit patients with AML who have received stem cell transplant, but remain at high-risk for relapse; and a second trial, in patients with AML who are in first remission after receiving conventional induction and consolidation chemotherapies. In addition, building upon the survival advantage observed in the transplant-ineligible population, we are planning to initiate a new randomized study later this year testing VENCLEXTA in combination with intensive chemotherapy in patients who are eligible for more intensive induction regimens. Our comprehensive development program will position VENCLEXTA as a foundation for combination therapies in AML across all patient segments We also recently announced a broad oncology collaboration with Genmab to jointly develop and commercialize three next-generation bispecific antibody products and establish a discovery collaboration to create additional differentiated antibody-based therapeutics for cancer. The lead asset in this partnership epcoritamab a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody has demonstrated a strong efficacy profile, favorable safety and a more convenient dosing regimen in early phase trials. We believe epcoritamab has the potential to become a best-in-class therapy across a number of B-cell malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. And we are rapidly advancing it to Phase III trials. And lastly a few updates from other areas of our pipeline. We previously presented positive progression-free survival data from two Phase III studies for veliparib in frontline ovarian cancer and BRCA breast cancer. Based on developments in the field and additional discussions with the FDA, we will not be submitting regulatory applications without mature overall survival data. We will continue to follow patients in the ongoing trials as overall survival data mature. In Eye care, we recently announced receipt of a complete response letter from the FDA for the abicipar BLA. The CRL indicated that the rate of intraocular inflammation observed in the Phase III program, resulted in an unfavorable benefit-risk ratio. We are currently reviewing the abicipar program to determine next steps and will provide updates as they become available. In women's health, in the quarter we received FDA approval of ORIAHNN as the first nonsurgical oral treatment for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women. This new nonsurgical treatment represents an important therapeutic option for women suffering from uterine fibroids. And in neuroscience, we recently reported top line results from a Phase III study evaluating atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine. In this study all three doses of atogepant met the primary endpoint evaluating the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days across the 12-week treatment period. The two higher doses, 30 milligrams and 60 milligrams also met all secondary endpoints, while the 10-milligram dose met four out of six of the secondaries. Allergan had previously reported positive results from one registration-enabling study. And following this second positive study, we plan to submit our regulatory applications in episodic migraine prevention in the first quarter of 2021. In summary, we've seen tremendous progress across all stages of our pipeline in the first half of the year and we remain on-track for further advancements in the remainder of 2020. With that I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance and financial outlook. Rob? 
Rob Michael: Thank you, Mike. Starting with second quarter results, we delivered top and bottom line performance ahead of expectations. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 above our guidance midpoint by $0.21. This includes $0.10 of stronger performance from legacy AbbVie and $0.11 of accretion from Allergan. Total net revenues were $10.4 billion, including $2 billion in sales contribution from the Allergan portfolio. Legacy AbbVie was approximately $300 million ahead of our stand-alone sales guidance driven by RINVOQ, SKYRIZI and HUMIRA. COVID-related inventory stocking for the first quarter largely reversed as expected. U.S. HUMIRA sales were approximately $4 billion ahead of expectations due to the lower impact from COVID on continuing patient prescriptions. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below 0.5 month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were $863 million, down 17.4% operationally reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and ahead of our expectations. SKYRIZI global sales were $330 million with continued strong U.S. in-play market share. We also continue to see robust demand for RINVOQ with sales of $149 million in the quarter and a rapid increase in U.S. in-play market share. Hematologic oncology global sales were nearly $1.6 billion, up 25.8% on an operational basis with continued strong performance of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were approximately $1.3 billion, up 17.2% driven by continued strong performance in CLL. VENCLEXTA revenues were $303 million with strong demand across all approved indications. Global MAVYRET sales were $376 million down 51.4% on an operational basis as treated patient volumes have declined during the COVID pandemic. Allergan Aesthetics contributed sales of $481 million in the quarter. BOTOX Cosmetic with sales of $226 million and JUVÉDERM with sales of $113 million are both seeing a faster-than-expected recovery from the COVID pandemic. Neuroscience global revenues were $734 million. These results were led by BOTOX Therapeutic VRAYLAR and UBRELVY with combined sales of more than $500 million. We also saw a significant contribution from our eye care business which had global sales of $417 million. Turning now to the P&L profile for the second quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 82.8% of sales adjusted, R&D investment was 12.8% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 47% of sales including a negative impact of 70 basis points due to the reversal of COVID-related inventory stocking from the first quarter. Adjusted net interest expense was $484 million and the adjusted tax rate was 11.4%. Today we are issuing combined company guidance for the first time. As Rick previously discussed, we are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID pandemic and have factored the latest trends into our updated forecast. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $10.35 and $10.45 including $0.70 of accretion from the Allergan transaction. which represents an annualized contribution of 11%. Excluded from this guidance is $6.23 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue of approximately $45.5 billion. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 30 basis point unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth. Included in this revenue guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect U.S. HUMIRA sales growth of approximately 8%. We now expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $3.5 billion. For RINVOQ we now expect global revenues of approximately $600 million. For global HCV, we now expect sales of approximately $2.1 billion as treatments remain below pre-COVID levels. For aesthetics, we expect global sales of approximately $2.4 billion, including approximately $1 billion from BOTOX Cosmetic and approximately $650 million from JUVÉDERM. For neuroscience, we expect global sales of approximately $3.5 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion from BOTOX Therapeutic and approximately $950 million from VRAYLAR. For eye care, we expect global revenues of approximately $2.1 billion, including approximately $700 million from RESTASIS, which assumes no generic competition in 2020. And for women's health, we expect global revenues of approximately $700 million. All other full year product guidance assumptions remain unchanged. Moving to the P&L. We now forecast adjusted gross margin just above 82% of sales, adjusted R&D investment to be approximately $5.8 billion, adjusted SG&A expense to be approximately $9.9 billion, and adjusted operating margin of approximately 48% of sales. This P&L guidance includes approximately $600 million in expense synergies for the partial year in 2020. We remain on track to deliver greater than $2 billion in expense synergies by 2022. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2 billion, which includes the cost of financing the Allergan transaction. We now model a non-GAAP tax rate of just above 11% for the newly combined company. Finally, we now expect our full year average share count to approach 1.7 billion shares, including the equity issue to finance the Allergan acquisition. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate adjusted revenue of approximately $12.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on reported sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of just above 48% of sales. We model a non-GAAP tax rate of 11.6%, and we expect the average share count to approach 1.8 billion shares. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.73 and $2.77, excluding approximately $1.59 of known intangible amortization and specified items. AbbVie remains well positioned to execute on our capital allocation priorities, including rapidly paying down debt, supporting a strong and growing dividend, and pursuing additional innovative mid to late-stage pipeline assets. We generated $6.9 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of the year. And our cash balance at the end of June was $6 billion. We are on track to pay down $15 billion to $18 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021, of which nearly $7 billion has already been repaid. We expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. In closing, AbbVie's performance and financial condition remain strong. We are very pleased with the momentum of the business heading into the second half of 2020. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks Rob. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.
Randall Stanicky: Great. Thanks guys. I just have two one for Rick and one for Rob. Rick, a bigger-picture question a huge part of the AbbVie story is…
Liz Shea: Randall, sorry to interrupt. We can't hear you very well. Is there any way you can turn up your mic or speak up?
Randall Stanicky: Great. Is that better?
Liz Shea: Quiet clear. Yes.
Rick Gonzalez: It's okay.
Randall Stanicky: Great. Rick I wanted to ask a big part of the AbbVie story is growth on the other side of HUMIRA in 2023. There's still some trepidation with -- from investors in getting comfortable with the step-down. What would you say to those investors to get people comfortable that there's a growth story on the other side of HUMIRA? And what do you need to do specifically between now and then strategically to position the business for that?
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Randall, did you have a second question? Or is that…
Randall Stanicky: Yes. The second question I'll ask it upfront for Rob. Just if you could help us understand the steady state the run rate for R&D. I think you said $5.8 billion for this year that will go higher on an annualized basis. But you're also pulling $1 billion of R&D synergies out of that as well.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. I'll cover your first question, Randall, and then Rob can jump in and talk through the R&D funding question that you had. So, look, I think it's a great question. It is one that obviously the vast majority of investors are interested in. We have described I think to investors the rationale of why we were excited about doing the Allergan transaction. It obviously gives us a tremendous amount of ability to be able to manage our way through the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. of HUMIRA. It provides us with two more major growth franchises for the company to help drive growth. And it allows us to continue to invest aggressively both in internal R&D as well as external. And so I think it provides the framework to allow us to continue to perform, as we have performed over the last number of years. I mean, clearly, we have -- we certainly have a track record of showing that we can grow this business and we can build on this business. We've demonstrated that since 2013 when we spun out. So what makes me excited and what makes me comfortable that I can ultimately grow the business through the LOE? I think it starts with, look, we have six, yes, six major growth assets in our business today, if you step back and you look at them, six medicines that have tremendous opportunity to be able to grow: SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA, VRAYLAR, UBRELVY. We'll probably have atogepant here in the not-too-distant future. So we'll have a seventh asset all in markets that have a significant opportunity to be able to grow. When I look at our R&D productivity both in the indication expansion area as well as new assets, and I'll talk about that here in a second, I'm very comfortable with our ability to be able to continue to drive the pipeline. When you look at the projections that we made for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI as an example, when we made those projections a year or two ago, those peak projections for 2025, we based those projections on the fact that those assets had to achieve roughly high single-digit market share positions. As we mentioned right now if you look at SKYRIZI, it's achieving in-play share of 30%. RINVOQ has really stood up and rapidly started to capture share. It's at 15% and growing at a very aggressive clip. I would predict that it will quickly become the in-play market leader above HUMIRA here in the not-too-distant future. But they're already significantly above what those estimates were. The longer you stay at in-play shares that look like that obviously the greater you're going to exceed that. If you get to 20% instead of high single-digits, obviously, the revenue will be approximately two times what we had originally projected. So that gives me a high level of comfort. When I look at VENCLEXTA as an example there's still a significant opportunity to grow there. If we get an indication expansion both broadening AML as well as the t(11;14) in multiple myeloma those are two significant opportunities that we'll continue to be able to drive growth. IMBRUVICA still has significant opportunity to be able to drive growth. When I look at VRAYLAR as an example, that's a very interesting asset, has a great profile in that market, the drug does. It's obviously growing significantly. I mean it's been growing now at the rate of about 80% to 90% year-over-year. There's still plenty of room to grow in bipolar and schizophrenia. And if one of those two Phase III studies plays out effectively, MDD will be a very large additional indication which will allow us to be able to drive significant growth there. And then there's the migraine franchise. I think migraine is something that's underappreciated. If you look at the penetration right now of oral agents in the acute area, it's running about 12% to 14% of total scripts. So, obviously, there's a significant opportunity to be able to continue to expand that market. We think we have the asset to be able to do that. And obviously, we think we have the promotional ability to do it. So, I think we have the tools right now to be able to drive significant growth through the LOE. On the other side of the LOE, obviously, our pipeline will continue to play out with the additional indications. You're starting to see assets like our TNF steroid. Of all I think the Genmab collaboration is an important collaboration to continue to build out. Our hem/onc can potentially sell two more platforms. And so there's a lot of exciting opportunities. So, I feel very confident in one how the business is running now despite all of the disruption associated with COVID. But I look at the part of the business that we control directly I feel very good about how the business is running. And so I believe we will navigate our way through it. And I think as we get a little closer investors will gain an even greater appreciation of that. 
Rob Michael: So, Randall this is Rob. On your question on R&D, so if you think through the partial year synergies the $600 million, about $400 million of that comes from R&D. And by 2022, about 50% of the greater than $2 billion in synergies will come from R&D. So, while I would expect the expenses to annualize obviously with the partial year close we'll also see those synergies ramp up. So, the best way to think about it is a steady-state R&D level in the $6 billion range.
Randall Stanicky: Great. Thanks.
Liz Shea: Thanks Randall. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.
Navin Jacob: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to expand on some of the opportunities that Rick had just mentioned.
Liz Shea:   Again Navin, can you speak up a little bit? 
Rick Gonzalez: Well, let's see if we can turn our end up.
Navin Jacob: Sure. So, is this okay? Can you hear me okay? 
Rick Gonzalez: That's better.
Liz Shea: Better. Thank you. 
Navin Jacob: Okay. I will yell. So, with regard to--
Rick Gonzalez: We turned our end up. So, you don't need to yell.
Navin Jacob: All right. Fair enough. With regards to the VENCLEXTA opportunity in multiple myeloma the CANOVA trial wondering if you could give us an update there and how large could that potential opportunity be. Obviously, relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma is pretty competitive. So, just wondering what sort of -- how we should be thinking about that where that excitement is coming from. And then if you could remind us also about your subcutaneous version -- pump version of DUOPA that's supposed to read out in the first half of 2021. How should we be thinking about that opportunity? Could that be a blockbuster opportunity? 
Michael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take those. With respect to VENCLEXTA we see very real potential in the t(11;14) multiple myeloma population. If we look across our trials early phase trials and then some set analyses of later phase trials where we have data from t(11;14), we see very consistent responses. We see high response rates and we see long progression-free survival in the t(11;14) population. And that makes sense because that t(11;14) population has a transformed cell that has a B-cell-like phenotype and it's BCL-2 high. So, it would be expected to be uniquely sensitive to VENCLEXTA and to BCL-2 inhibition. So, we have the Phase III study well underway now. It's an event-driven trial. But we would hope to have data in the near future in 2021. And that study is designed to confirm those earlier observations. In terms of how large an opportunity it can be, the t(11;14) population is about 20% of multiple myeloma. And multiple myeloma is a big indication. So, 20% of that is a lot. Now, as you mentioned it's becoming a competitive space. But one of the advantages of having a biomarker-driven therapy is that we can identify and physicians can identify in practice what patients are likely to respond to VENCLEXTA. So, we'll know what a VENCLEXTA patient looks like. And we think that will be a real opportunity and a real advantage. So, we're very optimistic about that aspect of the program and we think it represents an important additional role for VENCLEXTA. With respect to 951, that is a program that's designed to deliver DUOPA-like efficacy through a subcutaneous insulin pump-like device. And so to do that we had to develop two novel prodrugs. These are NMEs that are rapidly converted to the active agents in circulation. And they allow delivery of levodopa and carbidopa ultimately through this insulin pump-like device that you just can't do with the parent compounds because of their physical properties and chemical limitations and local tolerability limitations. So, it really does represent a real breakthrough. What we know about the efficacy of DUOPA is that it is very, very strong. It really is transformational. But it takes a lot to get that efficacy. Patients have to have a gastric tube placed to then thread it down into the small bowel. They have to maintain that. So, this is a much more patient-accessible patient-friendly if you will way to deliver the same sort of efficacy. And so we think that has a potential to really expand the number of patients who would be willing to consider a therapy such as 951 and it's a big market. If you look at DUOPA despite all the limitations, it's doing about $0.5 billion in sales. If you look at deep brain stimulation, there's also considerable use. In aggregate, this market today is well over $1 billion, probably $1.5 billion. And not all patients who would qualify by their patient profile are willing to undergo these therapies. So, we think that 951 can be a very real opportunity and can be quite substantial.
Liz Shea: Thanks Navin. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. 
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. So, just two for me. The first can you just elaborate a little bit more about how you're thinking about the size of the opportunity for RINVOQ in atopic derm now that we have the Phase III? I guess just a little bit more just how you see this fitting into the treatment paradigm. And then my second question was on the 2020 guidance. If I back out the $0.70 of Allergan accretion, it seems like the base AbbVie numbers are unchanged despite what looked like very, very strong results in the first half of the year. So, just help me understand a little bit the dynamics that are happening with that kind of underlying AbbVie set of assumptions. Thanks so much.
Michael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take the first one and then I'll hand it over to Rick for the second one. With respect to atopic dermatitis, we're very pleased with the results that we demonstrated across the Phase 3 trials. They actually exceeded our expectations based on the Phase 2b results. And those 2b results were very strong and had earned us a breakthrough therapy designation. And we're pleased not only with the efficacy, but also with the safety profile. We've said for quite some time that one needs to look at the safety of a drug in the intended population. Because things like background therapies, risk factors in the population can have a substantial influence on what that profile looks like not only for the active agent, but for the comparator or for placebo. And if you look at the profile in the AD studies, it looks very favorable to our eye. And these were substantial studies and a substantial program overall. This wasn't a quick study to get an indication expansion. We ran a Phase 3 program for atopic dermatitis that could standalone for an additional submission. So we think that very strong data package will be a real advantage when we bring this indication to market. If you look at the size of the market overall, I think, it's been underappreciated for years. Now that's changing now. There are a large number of patients who would be eligible for systemic therapy. Obviously, dupilumab is off to a good start over the past several years in that indication. But if you look at their efficacy only about half of patients achieve an adequate response if you consider that adequate response in EASI 75. And so in our study we drove very good numbers there higher than that roughly 50% albeit there through cross-trial comparisons. So we think that there is a real opportunity for a high-efficacy agent in this space. And so it really can play on both ends of the spectrum. Patients who don't achieve an adequate response with earlier therapies this is an obvious choice. But with the efficacy and the safety profile that we've observed, we see no reason why it wouldn't be used upfront as well. And of course, we'll have head-to-head data against dupilumab later on this year as we said in our prepared remarks. 
Rob Michael: So Chris, this is Rob. I'll take your question on guidance. So if you take that $0.70 of accretion and you back-off the midpoint of $10.40 it gives you a standalone of $9.70 EPS, which is $0.04 higher than our previous guidance. And it's really driven by the sales changes that we've made today. So for U.S. HUMIRA we took that up 1%, which equals about $150 million because we're seeing less impact of COVID on continuing patients. HUMIRA OUS we've taken up $100 million. We're seeing less erosion than we initially had planned. On RINVOQ that's up $100 million as well really driven by the rapid in-play share that we're seeing. And that's partially offset by MAVYRET as we've seen the market really decline during COVID. But net-net revenue is up about $150 million EPS up $0.04 versus our previous guidance for stand-alone AbbVie. 
Rick Gonzalez: And the only thing I'd add on that is obviously we were more favorable on base AbbVie in the quarter than the $0.04. But there's still uncertainty as it relates to COVID. And so we're keeping some coverage there to see how things play out in the third quarter. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. 
Steve Scala: Thank you. First congratulations on delivering ahead of expectations in the midst of a major integration, new launches and a global pandemic. It's really impressive. Rick you stated that the impact of the pandemic was less than expected. That certainly hasn't been the case at other companies. You also said that you're seeing recovery in the aesthetics portfolio, which sounds as though it snapped back faster than the legacy AbbVie. So I'm just curious to what do you attribute these dynamics? And do you expect the second half of the year to look more like the first half or more like May and June relative to patient volumes, clinic traffic and so forth? And then secondly, you stated that you expect margin improvement over the next few years. Could you provide some parameters around that expectation? Thank you. 
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So this is Rick. I'll take the first one. Your observation is correct. So I think the way to think about it is that both in the second quarter many of the assets didn't drop as far as we expected. That was part of the favorability. I'd say that was particularly, the case in a number of areas in the legacy AbbVie portfolio associated with the business. On the aesthetics it is pretty much the way you're describing it. What we saw happening in the aesthetics business and to a very similar extent to BOTOX Therapeutic is that we saw a rapid drop in the case of aesthetics as those practices virtually closed. I'd say almost all if not all of the practices had closed. So aesthetic revenues dropped significantly for a period of time in that mid-April time frame. As we started to see geographies remove the shelter-in-place orders around the U.S., we saw the aesthetics practices quickly put in place safety measures to be able to allow patients to come back into their offices. And I'd say the vast majority of those practices ramped back up and went back into doing procedures fairly quickly. As we approached that mid-May time frame we actually saw -- let's take BOTOX as an example. And BOTOX would be the leading indicator because it's the procedure -- BOTOX Cosmetic it is the procedure that people would go to first. It ramped back up went well over 100% of pre-COVID levels to around 120% 125%. And then it and that was obviously pent-up demand that was coming back into the channel so patients returned quickly. And then as that pent-up demand started to burn off as we got through June, you started to see it drop back down. And now it's settled in sort of in the mid-90s right now. We think it will reach -- it will stabilize back up over the course of third quarter back close to pre-COVID levels and then start growing again. And so I can tell you I'm extremely pleased with how both aesthetics and BOTOX Therapeutics had returned. I think it's a testament of those brands and those patients. As far as the assumptions we made in the second half obviously, we're assuming the second half performs a lot better than the first half. We're not assuming any kind of a broad-based shelter in-place activity. And we'll continue to see more and more patients come back into physicians offices. On the AbbVie side of the business, we are monitoring those patients by individual practice. It's appropriate for our particular businesses. And I'd say for the most part they are returning close to pre-COVID levels. They do vary a little bit by specialty. As an example, rheum and GI have come back faster than medical derm has. But medical derm has returned as well to some extent and we're continuing to see it return. Oncology practices in certain conditions we've seen -- we saw some tailing off of CLL treatment in the second quarter. That's now returning back to normalized levels. So I think the second half will, obviously, be much better than the first half. And I think we should return to normalized levels as we proceed through the second half of the year. Rob anything you want to add on that?
Rob Michael: I can answer the question on margin. Steve this is Rob. On operating margin, I think when you think about we have a partial year of synergies and a top-line that's been pressured by COVID we have a 48% operating margin profile. As you think about 2021 and 2022, we're going to obviously run -- we're going to ramp those synergies as well as we'll see top-line growth and where you'd see the P&L leverage that we've demonstrated in past year. So, I would expect to see our operating margin expand in 2021 and 2022. With 2023 with the U.S. HUMIRA event, obviously, we would see operating margin pulled back. But I would expect it to be in the 45% range, which still puts us top tier in the industry.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much. Hi, Rick congratulations. Very helpful to get the guidance. Could you talk a little bit about atogepant? Particularly what's the size of the addressable opportunity for the full portfolio of oral migraine medicines? And perhaps how much of an issue is the constipation data that you've seen? And then Rick look there's a massive economic disruption going on. And I'd be interested in your commentary about how consumers and payers are reacting to that disruption and how that's factored into your guidance. Are we seeing switches from IV to oral from generic to brand? How is that playing out in your experience and observation? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: All right. Great. So maybe we'll have Mike talk a little bit about the profile of the drug. And what I'd say is I think we probably want to come back at a later date once we've had a little better opportunity to analyze the chronic migraine market. And it's going to depend to a great extent on the profile of the drug obviously. But it's a very large market a very significant market. And -- but Mike maybe if you want to talk a little bit about constipation and then I'll come back and talk about the payer dynamics.
Michael Severino: Sure. I'll talk about atogepant. We're very pleased with the data we've seen. And of course this fits into an important part of our migraine portfolio with UBRELVY for acute migraine now with atogepant with two data readouts in episodic migraine and an ongoing program in chronic migraine. And, of course, there's BOTOX Therapeutic in chronic migraine, so it really rounds out our portfolio. The efficacy that we saw was very strong. As we said in our prepared remarks, we hit the primary and all secondary’s across the two upper doses and the primary and four out of six secondary’s for the lowest dose studied. So that is an efficacy profile that I think exceeded our expectations going into the study. With respect to the safety, our view of the safety profile looks very favorable. The constipation that was observed in the overwhelming majority of cases was mild or moderate. It didn't limit treatment. So patients stayed on treatment. They could be managed easily with interventions like stool softeners or fiber supplementation. So we don't see it as something that is limiting particularly in light of the very strong efficacy that we have demonstrated. And the only other point I'd add is that we have a good understanding of it and it's on target. So it comes with the efficacy you get a very strong efficacy and you have this manageable tolerability profile that I described.
Rick Gonzalez: Geoff on the -- on your second question, you probably recall back on our first quarter guidance when we outlined that we had built in to our forecast for the remainder of the year some impact for some channels shifting that we thought could occur due to the high unemployment. And essentially we haven't seen much of that at all. In fact I would tell you, we haven't seen any of it to any material effect right now. And one of the things that we do to watch that carefully is our PAP program. We've been advertising extensively to consumers to make sure that they know if they lost their insurance or they lost their jobs and they don't have insurance coverage and they can't afford their AbbVie medicines to come to us. We have a very extensive patient assistance program. And we're not seeing any significant increase in those requests. It could be because of the furloughs. We're not 100% sure yet. And potentially we could see some increase as we go further here depending upon what happens with stimulus programs going forward. We have still maintained some level of coverage in our forecast that we're providing now. So we believe we have sufficient coverage to deal with it and we'll just have to see how it sorts itself out.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Geoffrey. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho.
Vamil Divan: Hi, great. Thank you so much for taking my question. Maybe just to continue on the migraine question. You mentioned UBRELVY and the potential there. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about the net pricing that you're thinking about in that space? I guess, maybe relative to the injectable antibodies that are helpful for prevention already there's only the two players it sounds like here between you and Biohaven -- or on the injectable side. So just trying to get a sense how you see this pricing dynamic play out? We're getting a lot of questions on that front. And then maybe for Rick I'm just curious around some of the executive orders we've seen on the drug pricing side for the administration. I don't know if I may have missed your comments earlier but just curious if you have any additional thoughts about what you heard from some of your peers on this issue this week on their calls. But every company, obviously, has a different product mix and maybe some different perspectives. So curious what your views are especially as it relates to the rebate rule order? Thanks so much.
Rick Gonzalez: Right. Okay. I'll cover both of those questions. So on migraine, I mean obviously we don't publicly talk about our net price. We have fairly significant managed care coverage on the asset already. I think it's about 70%. And obviously it had to be priced in a way that was appropriate to be able to get that level of coverage. This is a market where market expansion is important. As I said, I think if you look at the penetration right now of acute migraine products against the -- or at least the oral CGRPs against the total migraine acute market, it's about 12% penetrated right now. So there's a significant opportunity to be able to grow that market. And it gives you some idea of the magnitude of this market. So you certainly want it to be in a position where it can have access to be able to allow patients, to be able to use the products. These products certainly have demonstrated that they have strong demand from patients to be able to provide them appropriate levels of relief. And so I would just tell you that that's an important aspect of the overall strategy here is to be able to grow this market over the long term. On the executive orders as you have probably seen they're pretty high level at this point and they provide some high-level direction. So I think, until we see them, sort of, start to sort out I think it's a little difficult to give you a lot of specificity around what they look like. Now I will say, if I look at them in the backdrop of AbbVie's business, I would say, I don't think they will have a significant impact on our business. If you look at Part B as an example, we have a very small Part B business. I think it's around 2% to 3%. 3%, I guess, is the right number now. So it's a very insignificant part. If you look at the importation bill or executive order, it's very similar to what's already been given out to the states. And it excludes biologics, which obviously is an important part of our business. If you look at the third one, it's insulin and EpiPen. We're not in that business. And then the rebate rule. Certainly, as we look at rebates, we're absolutely supportive of patients being able to get the benefit of the discount associated with the rebate or discount. As we've said many times before for us whether it's a rebate or a discount is not very material to us. What I would say is when I look at that executive order it does say that you have to be able to implement it without increasing premiums. And everything I know about how rebates are redistributed, I would say that I think that that will be difficult to do. So I don't know how that will ultimately play out. So -- I mean at a high-level look at what we think about them right now. But I think right now, I wouldn't anticipate that they have a significant risk associated with AbbVie. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. 
David Risinger: Great. Thanks so much. And congrats on all of the encouraging updates. So first Rick, could you please discuss maybe in a little bit more detail the most significant revenue synergy opportunities you see as a result of the combination with Allergan? I know that the combined company can do more with certain franchise, but if you could put some finer points on that that would be very helpful. Then second with respect to next year's readouts, AbbVie has a very large pipeline of Phase 2 candidates with proof-of-concept readouts in 2021. But could you point us to the ones that have the biggest commercial potential? So if there is validation in 2021 what are the biggest product opportunities that we should be paying attention to? And then one little tidbit. The UBRELVY number was $22 million in the quarter. That was strong. How much stocking was in there? Thank you. 
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So I'll cover the first one and then I'll have Mike cover the second and Rob can cover the third. So if I look at the business overall I said that the integration has gone very seamlessly. And I think that's a tribute to all the planning that we did. We had some extra time to be able to do it and I think that benefited us. And so I think the two organizations have come together in a way that's been quite good. Now I would say, I think, the places where we have an opportunity to be able to provide some synergy and benefit certainly when you look at our therapeutic businesses, when you look at our -- many of the tactical kinds of execution techniques that we use in the marketplace I think many of those are applicable to the Allergan therapeutic portfolio. Certainly when you look at managed care that's an area that we have demonstrated that we're quite skilled at being able to effectively manage our way through that. And then the third area, I'd say is if I look at aesthetics, aesthetics is a very attractive market. It has a significant opportunity to be able to grow that market, which I mean by bringing in more people into the market more quickly. You can do that several different ways. Obviously, some of it is driven by promotional activity. I'd say Allergan is very skilled from a social media standpoint. And I think that's an area that's probably been underfunded. Historically, it's an area that we have a high level of interest in funding to a greater extent. And we obviously have the financial wherewithal to be able to do that. The second thing is being able to bring more new innovation more rapidly into that market. And I think that's an area that we'll also be able to provide a benefit both in the way we operate R&D and the ability to be able to rapidly innovate. I think that will be a benefit to the overall business. And I think we have an opportunity to be able to accelerate the growth of that business in a meaningful way over time. And it's a market I like a lot. I think both based on demographics the cash pay aspects of it and how it responds to appropriate innovation in that market. So that's an area that I think over time you can expect us to continue to make sure that we're doing what we know how to do to be able to ultimately grow that market over the long term. Those would be some of the things I'd tell you at a high level. Mike? 
Michael Severino: I'll take the second question. So we do as you point out have a number of data readouts from Phase 2 studies or other proof-of-concept studies in 2021 and also in the following years in 2022 and beyond. And a number of these are very large opportunities. I'd point to our oncology programs. We have a number of immuno-oncology programs that would be large opportunities, if they hit. Our GARP program I think is a very good example of that. Our bispecifics I think are a very good example of that. We just brought in through the Genmab collaboration epcoritamab, which is a large opportunity. Obviously, that's post proof of concept. But there are two additional molecules there that are just a little bit earlier in development that could be large opportunities. We have bispecifics in BCMA more than one program that could be very large opportunities, if they were in fact best-in-class. And we think they have the potential to be best-in-class. The last thing, I would point to in oncology is our novel so targeted ADC technology with ABBV-155 being in the lead in non-small cell lung cancer. That is a BCL-XL warhead targeted by a B7-H3 antibody. If that were to hit and we'd see those data next year that would be a large opportunity. Obviously in immunology we're advancing our TNF steroid program. But I think those are data that we've already reported out. And then the last thing that, I would mention is in our neuroscience portfolio. Obviously, Alzheimer's disease if those programs were to hit they would be a very large opportunity given the enormous unmet medical need. Now obviously, in Alzheimer's disease it's higher risk higher reward. But if we got favorable data it would be a very, very meaningful opportunity. 
Rob Michael: And David, this is Rob. On UBRELVY, if you look at just the full quarter revenue of $27 million it really follows the prescription growth on a sequential basis. So there's really a negligible stocking impact. And we'd expect to see continued sequential growth for that product.
Liz Shea: Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler.
Chris Raymond: Thanks. Just back to atogepant in sort of a competitive setup. So Rick I heard your comments on how this is underappreciated. We've done some checks to see, if it indicated that that's the case. And I know this – it's not approved yet. So pardon if you don't mind the commercial question here. But there's been some chatter out there especially from some Biohaven bulls that placebo-adjusted migraine days maybe don't matter as much as absolute days. And so just maybe you're in the field with UBRELVY from a rep-to-doc dialogue perspective, what do you guys see as the most important attribute especially as you'll be positioning this in the prevention setting versus subcus and the other oral therapies – or the other oral therapy that happens to be a dissolving tablet?
Michael Severino: Well, this is Mike. I'll take the first part of that and then Rick may want to add. With respect to efficacy, the most important attribute is the placebo-adjusted migraine days. If one were solely to look at the total days one could conclude that placebo is in fact a good therapy for these patients, because we see reductions. And so you have to account for that. And there are differences from study-to-study based on design, population enrolled and what that placebo difference is. So it absolutely has to be taken into account. And when you look at our placebo-adjusted results, they're very strong. They range between 1.2 and 1.7 days, which in this disease area is a very meaningful response rate. And it's higher than what has been reported with other oral agents obviously with the caveat of a cross-trial comparison. So we think that on the most important efficacy parameter we performed very, very well. And of course we've hit all the secondaries across two of those three doses as I've described. And as we get the data out into the public domain you'll get more color on that.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah. I would just reiterate what Mike says. I mean, physicians are well skilled in understanding what placebo rates are. And I just don't even think, it's appropriate not to represent a product's efficacy without looking at the placebo rate. So, I mean, I think that will be the way doctors look at it. And I think that is the way the products will be marketed. And certainly, if I had a lower rate, I may have an interest in that. But at the end of the day I think that is the appropriate way to look at it.
Chris Raymond: Thank you.
Liz Shea : Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. 
Tim Anderson: Hi. Thank you. A few pipeline questions please. On the TNF steroid conjugate some KOLs have a mixed view of that approach. For those that are skeptical what's the most common reason that you hear? Second question on VRAYLAR, what are your odds of regulatory success in depression? Even just qualitatively is this a high-risk, medium-risk or low-risk endeavor? And then can you clarify why your Genmab CD3xCD20 would be best-in-class?
Michael Severino: Okay. I'll take those questions. With respect to the TNF steroid conjugate what I would say is, it's important to keep in mind that this is an early phase trial and this was intended to be a proof-of-concept trial. One can't do a fully powered head-to-head against an active competitor like HUMIRA in Phase I or Phase II because that typically requires or always requires essentially a large Phase III study. Head-to-head studies are often amongst the largest studies in a Phase III program. So what we were looking for was evidence to support the profile that I described which is that we had a high probability of success in those trials downstream. If folks have a mixed view then what we hear is they'd like to see those later data. And what I would say is, we're well on the path to generating them. We're pleased with the results that we've seen and we think it's a very promising platform and we're going to be advancing into larger-scale trials and people will get the data that they're looking for. With respect to VRAYLAR in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder, I think the question was how would I characterize the risk there? There already is one positive study in hand. And so of the two studies that are underway, we would need one additional study to read out positive to support the indication. I think that historically this has been a challenging indication. But I think the -- both the rationale and the data from earlier studies in the VRAYLAR program are strong. So I would probably put it in the moderate probability range. We didn't build it into our model. Our success with VRAYLAR was not dependent on it. But we think it represents a very attractive upside opportunity if in fact it hits. And with respect to why Genmab CD3xCD20 has the potential to be best-in-class? I would point to two things. One is the efficacy data reported from the early phase trials, particularly in DLBCL, which is a very difficult-to-treat tumor type, puts it at the higher end of efficacy. And the safety profile has been very favorable in terms of what's been observed to date both with respect to cytokine release syndrome and the lack of occurrence in the early phase trials of higher-grade CRS and also with respect to the neurological symptoms that can accompany this class of therapy. So it seems to have threaded that sweet spot between achieving very strong efficacy with a good safety profile. It also has subcu administration with its existing formulation. Others are working towards that. But Genmab already has the data in hand. And the dosing schedule fits very well into the regimens that will be used in the diseases that we'd study particularly DLBCL and follicular lymphoma. So we see aggregate of that that we think gives it a very, very strong profile. 
Tim Anderson: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, we have time for one final question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the Allergan integration. You mentioned in your comments that RINVOQ uptakes accelerating here was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on that. Is that being driven by COVID and maybe teleprescribing having an advantage over some of the injectables? And if so, do you see that as being a durable change here as we come out of the pandemic? And then the second one I had was just on VENCLEXTA. I noticed you're running some trials for solid tumors. Maybe just remind us of the rationale here behind that approach. And how optimistic are you there as you move into later stages? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Thanks. I'll take the first question. Mike can cover the second one. So RINVOQ clearly has started to ramp in a fairly significant way. I think it's associated with two things. One is any time you see a pro -- it's about eight months into its launch, you typically start to see that inflection point on successful products. As you go out and you present the data to physicians and start to educate physicians and they start to get some use, you tend to see that inflection point start to happen around six months. So I think it's the natural inflection point that we would have expected if the product was being successfully accepted into the marketplace the way we hoped as a high-efficacy agent. I think there is some benefit that we're seeing during the COVID crisis that it is an oral, so it's a little easier to prescribe than an injectable might be. So we're probably getting some collateral benefit associated with that. But I don't think that's the fundamental benefit that we're seeing. Mike?
Michael Severino: Right. So I'll take the question with respect to VENCLEXTA in solid tumors. I think there's two different lines of evidence. In breast cancer, there are -- there is an investigator-sponsored study that showed promise in breast cancer. And so there's a follow-up study there to confirm that. And if that were confirmed, it would be obviously a substantial opportunity given the unmet need there. And then there are other solid tumors such as both small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer where there's preclinical rationale that warrants exploration. And so I would characterize the solid tumor program as higher risk but high reward worthy of exploration. The solid tumor program in VENCLEXTA has not been baked into our thinking and isn't necessary for any of the success that we have talked about with the molecule. But if something were to hit there represents very nice upside. And I think there's enough rationale to warrant the exploration. 
Liz Shea: Okay. Thank you. So that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also, on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; and Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Before we get started, I'll remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AbbVie's operations, results and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2019 Annual Report and Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks we'll take your questions. So with that I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'd like to start my remarks by acknowledging the tragic nature of the COVID-19 crisis, which has touched all elements of our -- in our lives in ways we never thought possible. The human toll that this pandemic has inflicted is unprecedented and the suffering unimaginable. During this very challenging time, I want to assure you that across AbbVie we are working carefully to ensure that our business continues to operate properly, our employees remain safe, our patients continue to receive their medicines and we are providing aid including product donations and financial assistance to address some of the critical needs of health care systems and underserved communities across the globe. As a matter of priority, we continue to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to ensure that our patients receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Our manufacturing sites remain operational. And we have implemented additional measures at these facilities to ensure the safety of our employees and to protect our supply of API and finish medicines. We have adequate supplies in inventory to meet the expected demand for all AbbVie key medicines including KALETRA and NIMBEX, two therapies that have experienced a significant increase in demand directly related to COVID patient treatment. And we currently do not anticipate any product supply issues. AbbVie is also committed to supporting clinical research efforts for COVID-19. We have provided product donations to many health authorities and institutions globally so that AbbVie products may be further evaluated externally as potential treatments for this difficult disease. In times of crisis, it is our nature as individuals and our culture as a company to give back in any way we can. We recently announced that AbbVie has donated $35 million to help meet some of the critical needs around the world. We've partnered with several non-for-profit organizations who are on the front lines of the battle against COVID-19. And our donations have helped to support several important initiatives including the creation and operation of 20 mobile field hospitals in U.S. cities most impacted by the pandemic; the procurement and delivery of oxygen concentrators ventilators and personal protective equipment to health care systems in Europe; and various other essential programs including a donation to Feeding America to provide food and household supplies for those most in need including the elderly. We have donated a significant portion of AbbVie's own personal protective equipment supplies including N95 and surgical masks to hospitals near our facilities throughout the U.S. and Europe. We have also converted some of our own facilities including a pilot plant and several research laboratories to manufacture culture media and provide COVID-19 patient testing to supplement several public health departments. We are honored and committed to do what is in our power to help with this devastating pandemic and we will continue to look for ways where we are able to help. Now turning back to our business. I want to further discuss how the crisis is impacting our performance and expectations for the full year 2020. Today, I'm pleased to report strong results. For the first quarter, AbbVie's total revenues were up more than 10.5% on an operational basis and adjusted earnings per share of $2.42 was up more than 13% versus the prior year. These metrics were significantly above consensus and our initial expectations. Fortunately, we had very robust demand across our product portfolio heading into the COVID crisis. As the U.S. and other major countries around the world started implementing stay-at-home orders and social distancing strategies in late February, AbbVie as well as most of our customers started restricting face-to-face interactions resulting in reduced physician and patient contacts. These limitations which are still in effect for most major countries created two fundamental impacts on our business in the quarter. First, patients and pharmacies built up some additional inventory of our medicines to ensure they had adequate supply. And second, we saw fewer new patients visiting physician's offices, which had a modest impact on the number of new patient starts. Adjusting for COVID inventory dynamics, AbbVie's first quarter underlying operational sales growth was roughly 8.3%, significantly above expectations with double-digit underlying performance in both hem/onc and immunology, demonstrating the strong underlying performance of our business. Within hem/onc IMBRUVICA the market-leading treatment for CLL grew strong double-digits, driven by increased demand in the frontline setting where we recently received another important label update which Mike will discuss momentarily. VENCLEXTA also performed very well in the quarter with global revenues of $300 million, roughly double the first quarter of last year, following share expansion in both CLL and AML. Turning to our immunology business. HUMIRA continues to generate significant revenue. HUMIRA benefits from a substantial installed patient base, representing more than 80% of current demand. Globally, HUMIRA revenues were up nearly 6.5% on an operational basis in the quarter including strong double-digit growth in the U.S. The international biosimilar trends and dynamics remain largely consistent with our expectations. SKYRIZI Global revenues of $300 million were also significantly above expectations. Since the launch late last April, we have quickly established and expanded our leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients and now exceeds 30%. This launch trend is truly remarkable and a testament to SKYRIZI's strong efficacy compared to other novel agents in the psoriasis category including HUMIRA and COSENTYX. RINVOQ is also performing at a very high level in the RA segment with global revenues of $86 million in the quarter. We estimate more than 17,500 prescriptions were filled including both paid and bridge, which is more than double the activity we saw in the prior quarter and now reflects approximately 11% in-play RA patient share. As demonstrated by our first quarter results, the underlying performance of our business remains very strong. We've now also begun to return to ordinary operations in select geographies around the world, where health authorities have deemed it safe to do so. And although early, we are seeing those countries ramp towards a normal operation and expected performance. This is obviously a challenging time to forecast, given the unique nature of the COVID pandemic including its global scope and unknown duration, and it is difficult to predict precisely when major countries around the world will return to normalcy. Despite this uncertainty, we believe it's important to provide a clear set of updated assumptions that reflect the latest view of our full year performance. We based our forecast on the best estimates we have at this time. And we will make updates if necessary on our next quarterly call. As I indicated earlier, our business was performing robustly, above expectations and above our guidance prior to the COVID-related impacts. We have spent considerable time, carefully evaluating the COVID dynamics from late March and April. Based on this analysis, COVID appears to be having two fundamental impacts on our business. First, there has been a variable impact on new patient starts due to physician's offices restricting patients' visits and patients adhering to stay-at-home orders. As an example, many dermatology offices are currently closed. AbbVie has a strong frontline position in dermatology with HUMIRA and SKYRIZI. And here we see new patient starts for these two brands were lower by approximately 30% to 40% over this time frame. Once these offices reopen, patient volume should return back to normalized levels. Second, we've also seen lower new patient utilization of hospital-based treatments, such as VENCLEXTA and HCV internationally, due to many hospitals limiting access to non-emergency, non-COVID patients. We have carefully modeled these COVID-related dynamics and incorporated the expected impact on our full year results. Our current forecast now assumes the following: Stay-at-home orders will be gradually lifted starting in May across Europe and the United States. 60 days after geography lifts stay-at-home orders, we expect physician offices and hospitals will reopen for more routine patient diagnosis and care and we expect patients will start returning to physicians' offices for routine treatment in that time frame. We have also factored in a modest increase to our patient assistance programs as well as a shift in our U.S. payer mix due to increased unemployment. Based on these specific assumptions, we are confident we can maintain our current full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance. We will learn more as the second quarter progresses and we will continuously evaluate our current assumptions relative to how the environment evolves and the updates will be provided on our next quarterly call. On a related note, while we have not yet completed the Allergan transaction we have also been actively working to assess the impact of the COVID crisis on the Allergan business. It's important to highlight that Allergan has both a therapeutic business which is similar to the AbbVie business and represents approximately two-thirds of their revenues and profits; and an aesthetics business which represents roughly one-third of their revenues and profits. Based on the differences in the nature of these two portfolios, we expect them to be impacted differently as a result of the COVID pandemic. We expect Allergan's therapeutic business except for BOTOX Therapeutics to be impacted and recover from the COVID crisis in a manner very similar to the AbbVie business I outlined earlier. We expect BOTOX Therapeutics, which has a substantial hospital base to experience a more significant impact given that patients are being discouraged from going into the hospital for non-emergency procedures during the pandemic as I mentioned earlier. We also expect to see a more pronounced impact on Allergan's aesthetics business as many of their customers including plastic surgeons med spas and dermatology offices are closed and therefore not performing procedures. However, after carefully analyzing the aesthetics business performance during the 2008-2009 recession, which experienced a rapid V-shape recovery, the recent trends we are observing in China as clinics have reopened locally and procedures have started to ramp significantly and taking into account the household income and employment status of the aesthetics patient base, we remain confident that the expected near-term impact while likely substantial will be transient with the aesthetics business quickly ramping back to normalized trends following the relaxation of quarantine restrictions in the U.S. and major European markets. As it relates to the closing of the Allergan transaction, we have completed all requirements with the FTC and they are in the final stages of their review process. Following the FTC process, the last step is the Irish High Court approval. Based on everything we know today, we continue to expect the transaction should close in May. We remain confident that the AbbVie-Allergan combination will generate significant cash flows which will support our strong and growing dividend and rapid debt repayment and we remain highly committed to both of those priorities. So, in summary, we reported a very strong first quarter performance. The COVID crisis is truly unprecedented and we expect it will have a transient impact on our business, primarily affecting our second quarter performance. However, based on our analysis of the situation as well as reasonable timing assumptions for the return to a more normalized environment, we are confident in maintaining our full year adjusted earnings guidance which speaks volumes about the strength of AbbVie's business momentum entering the COVID crisis. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for some additional comments. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. Let me begin by echoing Rick's sentiment about how proud I am of our colleagues as our teams work to ensure our business continues with minimal disruption and our patients receive their essential medicines. The entire organization including our colleagues deemed on-site essential who continue to come into work every day and the individuals who have effectively adapted to working remotely have demonstrated resiliency, dedication, and compassion throughout this time of crisis. It's a testament to the culture we've built at AbbVie. Today, I'll focus my commentary on the ongoing efforts within AbbVie's R&D organization, to address COVID-19, and provide updates regarding our key development programs. As a leading global biopharmaceutical company, AbbVie is committed to supporting relief efforts for the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to the efforts highlighted by Rick, we have deployed our scientific and medical resources to help fight COVID-19 on several fronts. There is an urgent need to increase testing capacity within the United States. Public health authorities are actively working to address the issues that have limited capacity to-date including instrument availability, availability of diagnostic kits and reagents, and CLIA-certified lab capacity. Given the unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the need to significantly increase access to testing, AbbVie is working with health authorities here in Illinois, where we are headquartered and in Ludwigshafen in Germany, where we operate a major site, to create a clinical COVID testing capability. This will allow us to use our laboratory expertise to expand the COVID-19 testing capacity in both jurisdictions. We have also used our GMP capabilities to manufacture viral transport medium, which is necessary to preserve swabs prior to lab testing for the Illinois Department of Health and a number of academic medical centers. Like many companies in our industry, we recognize the extreme burden being placed on our hospitals, public health systems and medical professionals by this crisis. And in response, we have created programs to allow our employees, who have relevant medical, scientific or public health expertise to volunteer to support the fight against this pandemic. AbbVie has tremendous resources and we are doing everything we can to make these resources available in the fight against COVID-19. In addition to the efforts, I just described, our R&D team is looking at our existing medicines and pipeline assets to assess their potential for the treatment of COVID-19. AbbVie is collaborating with health authorities and academic institutions globally to support clinical trials of KALETRA, a protease inhibitor approved for the treatment of HIV infection to determine whether it has potential use in COVID-19. Two notable ongoing trials are the solidarity study being run by the World Health Organization and the discovery study being led by a consortium in France. We expect to see data from these studies very soon and we'll continue to monitor and update as information becomes available. We have also initiated a Phase II study of IMBRUVICA in patients with COVID-19 infection. The goal of this study is to determine whether IMBRUVICA is able to improve outcomes by blunting the overly exuberant immune response often referred to as the cytokine storm that contributes to the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Lastly, we are also collaborating with a number of groups to screen our internal libraries for compounds with activity against COVID-19. Clearly, this is a rapidly evolving situation and we will provide updates as additional information becomes available. Turning now to an update on the status of our clinical development programs. Our top priorities in the R&D organization are ensuring the safety of patients, investigators and our employees around the world maintaining the integrity of our clinical studies and continuing to advance our pipeline. We are carefully monitoring the situation and taking appropriate precautions to protect the safety of our study participants, clinical site staff and our employees. We understand that health care systems are under extreme pressure because of the need to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In many instances, hospital-based research staff have been redeployed to other duties and aren't available to address clinical trial-related matters. AbbVie is doing everything possible to avoid creating an additional burden to our clinical trial sites. Given the current environment, we have delayed on-site start-up activities for new clinical studies. Start-up activities that can be performed remotely will continue and we will resume on-site activities and new study initiations on a case-by-case basis as local conditions allow. We also paused screening of new patient recruitment for a small minority of non-critical ongoing studies representing approximately 15% of our clinical trials, but are already in the process of reactivating screening in some of these studies again as local conditions allow. The remainder of our studies continue to enroll, although we have seen decreased screening rates in the short term as would be expected in the current environment. At this time, we expect limited impact to clinical trials that are already fully enrolled. Across our portfolio, we've implemented measures to ensure study continuity and minimize delays. These include actions such as shipping study drug directly to patients to avoid unnecessary study visits; conducting virtual study visits and remote data collection wherever possible; and shifting enrollment to geographies and clinical centers that are either less impacted or are already entering recovery. Based on these efforts, we currently expect minimal impact to the overall timing of our critical programs and to our key regulatory submissions. In immunology, we expect limited impact to the programs for RINVOQ and SKYRIZI in new disease areas. We are on track to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis in the second quarter and our filings for atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis are planned for the second half of this year. The data from our Phase 3 studies evaluating RINVOQ in atopic dermatitis are also expected in the middle of the year. The programs for SKYRIZI in new disease areas are also advancing very well. We continue to expect to see data from Phase 3 studies in both psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease in the second half of the year, with regulatory submissions for both indications expected in 2021. We continue to make good progress with our early-stage immunology pipeline as well and we expect to be able to share results from the proof-of-concept study, evaluating our novel TNF steroid conjugate in RA patients very soon. We recently completed the Phase 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating ABBV-599 in RA patients, where our JAK-BTK inhibitor combination demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo, but the efficacy results did not prove differentiated from monotherapy with RINVOQ. Based on these results, we are discontinuing development of ABBV-599 in rheumatoid arthritis. We plan to continue development in other autoimmune diseases where there is a greater B-cell contribution, such as lupus and systemic sclerosis in which dual JAK-BTK inhibition could provide superior benefit over current standard of care. In the area of oncology, we continue to make good progress with our hem/onc programs where we achieved several important milestones in the first part of the year. We recently received a label update for IMBRUVICA based on results from the E1912 study, which demonstrated the superiority of IMBRUVICA to FCR in frontline fit patients with CLL. For patients who could tolerate it the FCR regimen had been considered the gold standard for efficacy in frontline treatment for more than a decade. Demonstrating a strong progression-free survival benefit over FCR and incorporating these data into the label is another important addition to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA use in frontline CLL. Continuing with our hem/onc programs, we recently announced positive top line results for VENCLEXTA in the Phase 3 VIALE-A study in AML. In this study, VENCLEXTA, in combination with azacitidine, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival and in composite complete remission rate versus azacitidine alone in patients with previously untreated AML, who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. The VIALE-A study was stopped early due to positive efficacy results at the first interim analysis of overall survival, demonstrating VENCLEXTA's clinical benefit to these patients, for whom there are a few treatment options. We also announced the results from a second smaller Phase 3 study in frontline ineligible AML patients, the VIALE-C trial, which evaluated VENCLEXTA in combination with low-dose cytarabine. While the study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival, treatment with the VENCLEXTA combination showed an observed 25% reduction in the risk of death compared to low-dose cytarabine alone. We believe that the failure to hit statistical significance on the survival endpoint in this trial was due to limitations on the sample size of the study. With an additional six months of follow-up in the VIALE-C study, the VENCLEXTA combination demonstrated a median overall survival of 8.4 months, compared to 4.1 months for low-dose cytarabine alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.7 and a nominal p-value of 0.04. All secondary endpoints were in favor of the VENCLEXTA combination as well, including higher rates of response, earlier remissions increased transfusion independence and longer event-free survival. The data from both Phase 3 studies in AML will be submitted to the FDA and global health authorities in the coming months with regulatory approvals beginning later this year or early next year. We also remain on track to start several additional Phase 3 studies in Bcl-2 driven diseases later this year, including VENCLEXTA in fit patients with AML and in high-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome, as well as navitoclax in frontline and second-line myelofibrosis. So in summary, we've continued to make good progress with our development programs, despite the challenges associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Once the situation is stabilized, we will work to restart paused clinical studies and evaluate the impact to our portfolio. But at this point, we do not expect the global pandemic to have long-term or significant impacts on our R&D programs. Our pipeline remains very robust and we expect many important milestones over the course of the next several years, which will support AbbVie's strong growth over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Mike. Starting with our first quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottom line performance. Total net revenues were $8.6 billion, up 10.7% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. These results include approximately $190 million of inventory stocking related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.42, reflecting growth of 13.1% compared to prior year and above our guidance midpoint by $0.13, including $0.04 from underlying business strength and $0.09 related to COVID-19 inventory stocking. Several key products contributed to growth in the first quarter. U.S. HUMIRA sales were $3.7 billion, up 13.7% compared to prior year, reflecting double-digit volume growth plus price. These results include approximately $65 million of COVID-19 inventory stocking. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were $1 billion, down 12.8% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and ahead of our expectations. These results include approximately $35 million of COVID-19 inventory stocking. SKYRIZI is performing extremely well and above our expectations. Global sales were $300 million with U.S. in-market -- in-play market share now exceeding 30%. We also continue to see robust demand for RINVOQ with sales of $86 million in the quarter. Hematologic oncology global sales were more than $1.5 billion, up 32.3% on an operational basis, driven by continued strong performance of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were $1.2 billion, up 20.6% driven by strong share in all lines of therapy in CLL. These results include approximately $45 million of COVID-19 inventory stocking. VENCLEXTA revenues were $317 million, driven by continued share gains across all approved indications. Global HCV sales were $564 million, down 30.2% on an operational basis, driven by lower treated patient volumes in select international markets and increased competition within the U.S. Managed Medicaid segment. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for Creon and Duodopa. Turning now to the P&L profile for the first quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 82.7% of sales ahead of our full year guidance due to sales mix and currency hedges in place. Adjusted R&D investment was 14.3% of sales, supporting our pipeline programs in oncology immunology and other areas. Adjusted SG&A expense was 18.6% of sales, reflecting continued investment in our on-market products and newly launched assets. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 49.8% of sales, an improvement of 170 basis points versus prior year, including a 70 basis point benefit from inventory stocking. Adjusted net interest expense was $284 million and the adjusted tax rate was 9.7%. As Rick previously discussed, we are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the momentum of the business heading into the pandemic and our current assumptions regarding timing of the recovery, we remain confident in our previously communicated full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of between $9.61 to $9.71 for stand-alone AbbVie. Excluded from this guidance is $2.01 of known intangible amortization and specified items. This guidance now contemplates full year revenue growth of approximately 7% on an operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have a 70 basis point unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect U.S. HUMIRA sales growth of approximately 7%. For SKYRIZI, we now expect global revenues of approximately $1.4 billion. And for global HCV, we now expect sales of approximately $2.3 billion. Moving to the P&L. We now forecast adjusted gross margin approaching 82% of sales SG&A expense to be approximately 19% of sales and adjusted operating margin approaching 49% of sales, an improvement of 140 basis points versus 2019. All other full year 2020 guidance assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate adjusted revenue of approximately $8.1 billion for stand-alone AbbVie. This guidance assumes reversal of inventory stocking from the first quarter as well as slower new patient starts due to COVID-19. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have an 80 basis point unfavorable impact on reported sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 47.5% of sales, including a reversal of the 70 basis point benefit from inventory stocking in the first quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.10 and $2.16 excluding approximately $0.53 of known intangible amortization and specified items. AbbVie remains well positioned to execute on our capital allocation priorities. We generated $3.8 billion of operating cash flow in the first quarter. Our cash balance at the end of March was $41 billion, including funding designated for the Allergan acquisition. The robust cash flow generation of the combined company will be used to rapidly pay down debt, support a strong and growing dividend and pursue additional innovative mid to late-stage pipeline assets. We have committed to paying down $15 billion to $18 billion of combined company debt by the end of 2021 of which nearly $7 billion will be repaid by the end of May 2020. We expect to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2021 with further deleveraging through 2023. In closing, AbbVie's performance and financial condition remains strong. Given the nature of the important therapies in our portfolio and the ongoing efforts of the people within our organization, our business is well positioned to navigate the current COVID-19 related challenges. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks Rob. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho.
Vamil Divan: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions and all the color that you've provided in your comments. And maybe just a couple if I could. One, you talked about the Allergan deal and obviously some of the assumptions there. I'm just thinking big picture -- and I guess this is for Rick just in terms of your -- kind of where you see the value of that deal. I know you -- obviously some of the assumptions in the near-term have changed and you mentioned the esthetics impact is probably more transient. But just to confirm for investors, do you see any changes over the longer term value of this transaction? We're obviously getting a lot of questions just given the nature of the esthetics business right now. And then second one on the dividend. You mentioned, obviously, your support for a strong and growing dividend. Is there also just any change as to how you think about dividend growth going forward given the current environment? Obviously you've still been growing but is there maybe growing at a lower rate, or any change at all there just – it would be great to clarify. Thanks again.
Rick Gonzalez: Vamil this is Rick. I mean, I'll take those two questions. Let me do the second one, because it will be shorter first. So we don't see any changes in the assumptions we're making from the standpoint of the growth of the dividend based on everything that we have analyzed and I would say the robust performance of our business going into the COVID crisis and how we view the COVID crisis being a transient situation that, although difficult to predict exactly when all the geographies will reach some level of normalcy, we know that will occur at some point. And so we don't view any significant change there. On the value of the Allergan transaction, I would tell you that we don't see any change, fundamental change in the long-term value of the transaction. The benefits that we were trying to derive by acquiring the Allergan business are the same. And the long-term valuation I believe is the same. Now I think what some of the investors are probably concerned about is, obviously, the esthetics business is an important franchise as I indicated before represents about one-third of the revenues and about one-third of the profits. And it's an attractive franchise. And so I think the question that investors have, is how is it going to recover? And how long will it take to recover? And I think look those are reasonable questions. And as you can probably imagine, we have been doing a tremendous amount of work to try to evaluate not only the impact of COVID on our business, but also the impact of COVID on the Allergan business. And specifically I'd say, we've spent a considerable amount of time looking at the esthetics business. So I'm going to take a couple of minutes here and walk you through what that data looks like, so that you have a good perspective of at least the data that we're operating against to make the assumptions that we're making. Now what I am going to say is because of the Irish takeover code, we can't talk about the specific financials of Allergan until they are public and they're not public right now. So I'm not going to talk about their financial performance in any way. But I think, I can give you a pretty good characterization as to the work that we've done here and the conclusions that we've drawn. So I think if you step back and you look at the situation, it is clearly a situation, one, it's a complex situation. And two it's not a situation that any of us have ever experienced before meaning that this has both an economic disruption factor built in and it has a supply and demand disruption factor that's built in. We've certainly seen economic impacts on this business before and we know how it behaved in those circumstances. So as we try to approach understanding what the recovery will likely look like, we've essentially looked at four fundamental issues. Number one is, are there any analogs that would tell us what that recovery curve's going to look like? Number two, what is it going to be -- what is it going to take in order for the supply side? And when I say supply side what I mean is plastic surgeons, med spas, dermatology offices, which are the primary providers of those procedures. What is it going to take for the supply side to get back to where it was? And then number two -- or number three rather, what is going to be necessary on the demand side? And demand, I mean, consumer’s users of these procedures. And then finally, will there be a change in the situation from a competitive standpoint? Those are the four fundamentals that we looked at. We've looked at this both in conjunction with Allergan and we also have done an independent analysis with the same consulting firm that we used when we were considering acquiring the Allergan business. So we did two independent work streams to come to our conclusions. So let me start with the analogs. There are two right? There is the 2008, 2009 recession. And as I've said in my comments, there we saw a very sharp D-shaped recovery. And in fact the business recovered and actually grew faster on the other side of that The second analog is China. China has reopened most of its geographies not all, but most and they've been open for approximately seven or eight weeks now. If we look at the data from China what it says is 86% of the clinics have reopened. Patient traffic is back to about 55%. Volume is just under 50%, like 45% to 48%, slightly lower because those clinics are also burning off some of their inventory. So it doesn't outdate. So, I'd say the two analogs that we came up with looked pretty encouraging. Now let's look at the supply side. So, on the supply side, what we're trying to understand here is, what is the intent? And what is the preparation for these offices to reopen? And I think there's a couple of important facts here that help support and guide us to what that might look like. First the major medical societies like the plastic surgery society, the aesthetic society and others have now issued guidelines to these practices on the procedures that they should use to restart. And they include things like temperature checks, masks, gloves, face shields, lower densities in their offices. So why is that important? Well, why that's important is, this gives those offices a guideline as to how they should reopen. And probably more importantly, it gives them confidence on how they should reopen. Allergan has worked with their customers. A number of their customers, a large percentage of their customers requested the U.S. government stimulus funds. And so what we do know is that a significant portion of those practices should be in a position where financially they can reopen fairly quickly. And finally, Allergan has done a number of surveys with a large group of customers that show that the demand to reopen upon lifting of the stay-at-home orders and implementation of these patient safety guidelines is very high. And we anticipate that they will start reopening in May, and that's what our data told us, and the survey data told us. I'd say if anything, it seems to be moving faster than what we originally anticipated, because some states in the U.S. have opened up more quickly. So, then the next question is the demand side, what's that going to look like? And here I'd say, again, Allergan did some very good work. If you look at the brilliant distinctions database, which has about two million active members, represents about 70% of Allergan's users, it shows that 70% of the growing distinction consumers have household incomes of greater than $100,000, and 50% have incomes -- household incomes of greater than $150,000 a year, and it shows that 60% of those consumers work for corporations not small businesses. Allergan also conducted a recent user survey that had just under 450 consumers that they interviewed. And it showed that 80% of the consumers said that the COVID crisis would have no or little impact on their household incomes. 94% of those consumers said, they would reschedule an appointment for procedures in the next 90 days, and two-thirds of them said upon restrictions being lifted they with schedule an appointment in 30 days. So now you turn to the competitive environment. Allergan competes mostly against smaller less financially strong companies. I'd also say that, Allergan has done an excellent job. I give a tremendous amount of credit to Carrie Strom and Bill Meury. They responded quickly and aggressively to this crisis with their customers. They extended payment terms. They converted credits to checks to help with cash flow at these offices. They protected the customers' volume discounts. They facilitated online sales of Allergan skin medical products, again to get those offices some cash flow. And they changed the product return policy so the customers are protected from any product outdating. I'd also say from a competitive standpoint, Allergan didn't have any layoffs. They maintained or accelerated their R&D programs. And you have to remember Allergan has the largest commercial footprint by a significant margin compared to anyone else in this business. So what the data tells me is this, the analog show the business bounces back and it's resilient. The supply side should ramp quickly when the environment allows. Consumers have a strong desire to restart treatments, and they have the financial capacity to do so. And I think Allergan did a nice job of creating loyalty with these practices, and should come out of this in a very strong competitive position, maybe even stronger than they were before. The independent analysis that we did also surveyed customers and providers. And I would say, it looks very similar to what the Allergan analysis looks like. So, look, we can't predict is exactly how long it will take in every state and in every country around the world, but I think we can predict with a pretty high degree of certainty that the business will bounce back. So, those are some of the keys that I think make us feel confident in the valuation.
Liz Shea: Thanks Vamil. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much for taking the question. First, there are a number of things that are obviously affecting the environment right now Rick and I just want to ask about SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. You've previously given some longer-term aspirational revenue targets. I'm just wondering how you'd feel about those targets. Now we've seen a few quarters for each product. And also I understand you're going to have a little bit of COVID disruption. And then could you just talk a little bit more -- I think that's very helpful coverage of the plastic surgeon context. Can you just talk a little bit more about the other specialties and products where you're expecting impairment in Q2 and how quickly they could bounce back? Thank you. 
Rick Gonzalez: Yes. So fundamentally I would tell you we don't have any change in the long-term forecast for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. I think one of the things that's impressive when we look at both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ is both the speed and acceleration of the ramp that we're seeing in the share capture of these assets. So let me give you a perspective on it. If you look at SKYRIZI as an example SKYRIZI within about three months achieved the number one position in psoriasis in-play psoriasis share. And then the rate of capture has actually accelerated from there. It achieved it at about 20%. If you look at the January data which is the most recent independent data that we have we have internal data that we also use to project. But the January data showed that it's at 31% and the slope of that line is accelerating and accelerating at a pretty good clip. And it is widening the range between it and the number 2 player in a significant way. And so this thing has tremendous momentum. Yes obviously the COVID crisis has created a disruption. As I mentioned in my comments if a dermatology office is closed obviously they're not prescribing anything including SKYRIZI. But that's a temporary phenomenon and we'll see these offices start to open back up. And I have no reason to believe that that momentum won't come back as patients feel comfortable to go back into their offices. RINVOQ obviously launched -- SKYRIZI launched in April and RINVOQ launched in August. So it launched later. But I'd say we've also seen on RINVOQ now a similar acceleration of its capture rate of share in -- in-play share in RA. And it too is accelerating going into this. It's about 11.3% on the last data point. And I'd say based on once things settle back out from COVID, it would take it probably three months to pass. There's a whole group of players at number two. HUMIRA is number one, but it would take probably three months for it to pass that group that's in number two. And I would expect it moves into the number two -- position shortly after that, after the disruption has subsided and we have a chance to continue to drive it. And so I feel very good about both of those assets and what the long-term performance of those look like, I think as I look at the R&D programs for both of them and the ability to expand the indications much like we did with HUMIRA, these assets have tremendous opportunities. So I feel good about it. Other -- by other specialties I believe what you're asking is what's going to happen to the other aspects of the business? Because what I was referencing on aesthetics really covered the range of supply side. So it was plastic surgeries derms and med spas. So again, we can't talk about the numbers, but as I indicated in my comments, I would expect the therapeutic side of Allergan to recover very similar to RSI a temporary disruption. There is likely to be a more significant impact on BOTOX therapeutic because about half of its volume comes from hospitals. And -- but we would expect that to bounce back once those hospitals start accepting non-emergency non-COVID patients. So we don't see anything in the data as we analyze it that would suggest that there's anything that's happening to any of their products that would impair the original assumptions we made about those products.
Liz Shea: Thank you. Next question please, operator.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: Thank you. I have a couple of questions. But first congratulations on a very strong quarter under very difficult conditions. So the first question is even pre-pandemic AbbVie seem to have embraced digital marketing. I think the company previously said that pre-pandemic 40% of commercial activities were already virtual. What does AbbVie do differently than peers? And does this expertise explain in part the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in the first quarter? And then the second question is just a housekeeping question. Just curious do you expect that Allergan will publicly report its first quarter? Thank you. 
Rick Gonzalez: I mean on the digital marketing, I mean obviously we have a significant expertise in that area. And I honestly can't tell you how differentiated that is versus other competitors because I think many companies like our have gone to a significant portion of their commercial messagings through digital marketing. I mean, I think we're very effective at it. I don't think that is what's driving the RINVOQ SKYRIZI performance. I think what's driving it is really, two fundamental things. One is obviously these assets have very strong clinical profiles. They fit a need in the market an unmet need that's in the market that was consistent with what we originally assumed when we were trying to develop replacements for HUMIRA. And I think we're all extremely pleased that these assets are doing a very good job of demonstrating superiority to the gold standard HUMIRA. The second thing is I think obviously, this is a market we know how to execute in at a very high level. We have a tremendous level of experience in this market, a tremendous reputation in this market. And I think our commercial organization executes at a very high level in this market. I think that's what's driving the performance and it makes me feel good about what the future looks like for these assets. As far as Allergan is concerned, I don't know if they're going to -- well think of it with this way. I don't think I should comment on when they're going to publicly report their first quarter results. I think that's something they should probably respond to not us.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.
Navin Jacob: Hi. Navin from UBS. Thanks for taking the question. So I heard the $1.4 billion for SKYRIZI an upgrade versus the $1.2 billion. Just wondering if you had an update on RINVOQ as well. I think you had said $500 million for the full year. Maybe I missed it, but just wondering if you could provide an update on that guidance as well. And then with regards to the slight lowering of the full year HUMIRA guidance, wondering if there's any color on what's driving that, obviously COVID-19 impacting things. But is it because of -- any color as to whether it's COVID-19 specifically or if it's increased in gross to net or if it's an increase in the switching to SKYRIZI and RINVOQ? Any of that would be helpful. Thank you so much.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Thank you. So let me talk about it at a little higher level and I'm going to hand it over to Rob to give you more specifics. I think the way to think about this is we came into this first quarter. If you look at our first quarter performance had COVID not happen, we would have been sitting here contemplating how we raised guidance. But because of the uncertainty of what's going to happen in the second quarter, we obviously had to make an assessment of what we thought that impact would be. And that's why I outlined what those assumptions are. So you can think about it this way. We're essentially assuming the business is overperforming and the data clearly supports the business is overperforming. We're going to have somewhat of a negative impact in the second quarter that we're basically saying, we can overcome. And we had to estimate where that would occur. We're raising SKYRIZI, because the momentum is such that even with some caution about second quarter, we know we're going to beat that number. RINVOQ, we feel good about RINVOQ as well, but we don't need to raise that at this point. We need to give it probably another three four months and then we'll make a decision what that looks like. HUMIRA has a very large installed base. And so, I indicated that we are making some adjustments to what we think will happen with channel mix specifically Medicaid. We've worked diligently to try to understand what that looks like. And as you probably know during the 2008, 2009 recession, which is probably the best thing that we had to be able to compare it to, Medicaid went up about two points from 2007 to 2009, two percentage points. So we have factored in some potential shift in HUMIRA and that's primarily what we're reflecting. Rob can give you a little bit more color, but I'd say that's a significant part of what we're trying to reflect there. We also took down MAVYRET. And MAVYRET is two things. One it is COVID-related. Probably about half of it's COVID related there, where HCV internationally is administered through hospitals and they've clearly been disrupted. And we need that disruption to play through before we can get back to the same momentum. In the U.S. though I would say, it's primarily driven by price. That month is still under price pressure and some share pressure. So those are the two most significant ones. Rob?
Rob Michael: Yes. Navin, so if you look at the guidance we gave of approximately 7% growth, so that translates in about a $300 million change for U.S. HUMIRA. I'd split it really in the three buckets evenly. So as we think about unemployment, higher PAP volume, Medicaid channel mix each of those say one-third and one-third from those two. And then the remaining one-third would be just lower new patient starts during the stay-at-home period. So that will be most acute in the second quarter. As it relates to SKYRIZI -- and look the momentum from SKYRIZI is very, very strong. And we would have raised it even higher had it not been for the disruption in Q2 on new patient starts. So despite having that disruption on new patient starts, we're still taking the guidance up. We would have taken up higher without that. And I think Rick characterized the HCV change very well.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Navin. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.
Randall Stanicky: Great. Thanks guys. Rick focus is going to shift pretty quickly here to pro forma 2021 earnings. You've had more time to prepare for the integration given COVID-19, but can you just talk about does COVID-19 impact those integration plans at all? And then, how are you thinking about the synergies and specifically, how quickly you can realize those $2 billion plus in cost synergies? I know they're third-party verified under Irish law, but at the same time it's -- 90% of that is operating expenses. So the question is why couldn't we see more of that realized early on? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah. I think as it relates to pro forma earnings, I mean, once we close the transaction at that point we will evaluate the business again and make a decision at which point we're going to provide pro forma earnings. As far as integration is, concerned I would tell you that, we're not – we have done all the integration work. We're well prepared and have been prepared now for several months to do the final integration. And I don't believe -- we're operating AbbVie at a very high level of effectiveness as we're operating today where a significant number of people are working remotely. I wouldn't say it's the ideal scenario. I'd much prefer we can all get back to operating the way, we did before. But look it's not practical right now. And I don't believe that anything will change the performance of the integration as it relates to COVID. So I'm not overly concerned about that. Synergies, obviously, we have built a synergy plan that we are very comfortable with. And we haven't – I don't believe we've given the gating of that yet right? We have not. Okay. That was Rob shaking his head no because you can't see Rob. So we've obviously gated that. I wouldn't say, we have changed the gating because of COVID one way or another, but we feel good about achieving those synergies. And obviously, everyone that does transactions like ours tries to overachieve their synergies. And we won't be any different than that, but we'll give you an update on what that gating looks like once we've gated the pro forma guidance.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Randall. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for all the color today. I really appreciate it. Just wondering if – first question is if COVID has impacted the rate of uptake of biosimilars in Europe at all either on the positive side or the negative side. And then for ABBV-3373, I know you mentioned the data is coming out in the near term. Maybe just can you remind us what you're hoping to see here on the efficacy side to advance this into further studies? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah. So this is Rick. I'll cover the first one. I may hand it over to Rob to give you a little more specifics, and then Mike will cover the second question. So I probably saw in the quarter, we did better internationally than we had projected initially. And so that is related to a great extent that we have seen less biosimilar conversion than we originally anticipated. It's a little difficult to tell at this point whether or not that is COVID-related. In other words one hypothesis could be and it is nothing, but a hypothesis is that because people are staying at home they can't get converted to biosimilars as rapidly. I think it's not the one that, our area organizations think is happening. It just appears that we're performing better than we had expected. But I think to know that for sure, we'll have to see a little more time play out. But overall, we feel pretty good. And so I'm not giving you a very good answer, because I don't know the answer totally. So I'm giving you the best information that I have available to me. Rob anything you'd add on?
Rob Michael: I think if you look at our beat versus guidance it's about approximately $140 million. Keep in mind that, we have about $35 million of COVID-related inventory stocking. We did have some tender timing in Brazil. It's about $30 million. So the balance of that you'd call $75 million of favorability. Could there be some COVID-related impact there? Possibly. If you look, we didn't change our full year guidance even though we have the U.S. dollar strengthening. So that's inherently about a $70 million $75 million operational upside that we've baked in that's offsetting that foreign exchange headwind. So it is going better so far than we expected, which is great but it's hard to pinpoint whether it's COVID-related or not.
Michael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take the question on 3373, which is our TNF steroid conjugate. It's in a proof-of-concept study in rheumatoid arthritis. And what we'd like to see there is efficacy that is greater than what can be achieved with currently available agents really across the board, but also with a particular focus on higher levels of response. Obviously, we're going to want to see that with an appropriate safety profile recognizing that a proof-of-concept study is a relatively limited safety database. And importantly, we're going to want to confirm that we can deliver that without impacting the pituitary access as a measure for systemic steroid effects. We have stated in other settings that from the 1b portion of this trial in healthy volunteers, we've shown we can deliver this construct without those steroid effects without impacting the pituitary axis. So we would expect to be able to do the same thing in RA patients in treatment, but we'd want to confirm that obviously.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Terence. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.
Andrew Baum: Thank you. A question on the long-term impacts of COVID-19. I'm interested in what's the prescription rate for both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ among private practice versus salaried dermatologists or rheumatologists? I guess, what I'm thoughtful about is the extent to which the economic pressures that COVID-19 may force many private practice physicians to become salaried with perhaps more constraints on their prescribing or switch frequency? Many thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Andrew, I would say I don't know the answer to your question to be honest. I can tell you that we don't see a -- today we don't see a significant difference across practices from a behavior standpoint. But future behavior I think that will be a little more difficult to predict. I think most physicians prescribe a medicine that they believe -- in the United States, that they believe is fundamentally the right medicine for that patient. And I would say that the profile of the drug is what tends to drive their prescribing habits more than anything else. So I would say, I would be surprised if there's any difference in the behavior. We'll go back to our commercial group and see if they have any data on it. And if so, we'll provide something back to you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Andrew. Operator next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: Thank you. A couple of questions please. The first is on business development. And Allergan certainly helps fill the long-term hole from HUMIRA going off patent, but I still view it as M&A is going to be a likely continued part of the story. So my question here is the time frame for AbbVie being actively back in the marketplace to do additional acquisitions, and I'm defining those acquisitions as smaller bolt-ons single-digit billion-dollar types of deals, could that start to happen as soon as the current year in 2020? Second question is on RINVOQ. In atopic derm, you are running a head-to-head study versus DUPIXENT called heads up similar to what Pfizer has done with its JADE COMPARE trial. And I think your results come out in early 2021. The Pfizer results were perceived as being a bit underwhelming. I'm wondering, if you expect RINVOQ results would be any different from Pfizer's? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: On the BD front, we haven't changed from what we have talked about historically. Our capital allocation strategy is -- support a strong and growing dividend, pay down debt aggressively. And we've allocated approximately $2 billion per year that we can do more bolt-on kinds of transactions. I can tell you that Mike and the BD team have been very actively pursuing what we think fits strategically and doing the work that's necessary to determine, is it an asset that we want to add to our portfolio and where we find those opportunities? And we believe they're a good return for the company. We're aggressively pursuing those. And so I think you will see over the course of time here, you will see us do deals that are consistent with that strategy. And clearly there's a lot of focus on oncology that we have interest, but other areas as well. Mike?
Michael Severino: So this is Mike. I'll cover the question on atopic dermatitis. Obviously, we're well aware of the Pfizer data from their program in atopic dermatitis at least at the top-line level that are currently available. And what I would say is we're going to have to look at each of these programs individually, although there are some mechanistic similarities factors such as dose selection ability to cover the relevant pathways are important when you are trying to predict the results that you're likely to see. We feel good about the pharmacodynamic coverage we've been able to drive with RINVOQ really across the board, but particularly in AD. We had very strong Phase 2b results. So we feel that our program will stand on its own merits and we look forward to those head-to-head data as we look forward to all the data from the Phase 3 program in atopic dermatitis.
Tim Anderson: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Carter Gould from Barclays.
Carter Gould: Great. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. A few questions. Rick, I appreciate the color on the Allergan aesthetic business. Maybe just a follow-up. Just trying to understand the sensitivity around your deleveraging forecast to the return of the aesthetics business in line with your assumptions? And I guess also based on your survey work, maybe you read on the rate -- not so much the rate, but like the ultimate return of the med spas and any view on I guess what percentage of those may not return given, I guess there's a view that that's somewhat of a more economically sensitive population relative to the broader BOTOX community. And then apologies if you already commented on this. On the pro forma guide that's going to come is the expectation that will come upon deal closing, or we'll have to wait to 2Q? And then maybe just given all the uncertainty around COVID, your latest thoughts about also providing longer-term guide at that point? Thank you.
Rob Michael: Carter this is Rob. I'll take your question on deleveraging. Look, if you think about the amount of cash flow that the combined business generates, it's a tremendous amount of cash flow that we feel very confident in our ability to deliver on our deleveraging commitments. As I mentioned in my remarks, we still expect to pay down $15 billion, $18 billion of debt. We're going to have $7 billion paid down by the end of this month, and we still will be able to support a strong growing dividend. So even as we flex various scenarios, we feel very confident we've reaffirmed those commitments on deleveraging.
Rick Gonzalez: As it relates to the med spa question, I would say, across the board, we looked at what kind of assumptions should we make about any consolidation in the industry. And the one thing I would say is, it does appear that these businesses fairly aggressively participated in the U.S. government stimulus programs, the Payroll Protection Programs and the other programs that were available. And so, I think, the data would suggest to us now that that won't be a massive impact. And if there were any consolidation across any of the channels and I don't know that any one channel really stands out in a significant way, we believe that there -- all we'll see is a shift of that capacity to other players, meaning they get bigger. And so, we're not assuming any significant reduction in the supply side of the channel that can't be absorbed through consolidation if necessary. On the pro forma guide, obviously, we're going to wait for the business to close. We're going to do some work on the business and then we'll provide the pro forma guidance after that. So depending upon the timing of when it closes and how close we are in the second quarter it could come on the second quarter call. So we're not really in a position right now where we can give you total clarity on that.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Cater. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. And our final question today is from Damien Conover from Morningstar.
Damien Conover: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask a question on the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. We're seeing great growth there. And both these drugs have shown excellent data. But I also want to ask, is there any ability to leverage the competitive positioning of HUMIRA here? And I guess I asked that, because I think about the recent launch of the IL-17s, which those competitors used to complain about the strong entrenchment of the TNF class and some of the rebating that was going on there. So I was just wondering, the two growth of, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, is that really coming from the medicines themselves? So that's question one. And then the second question is, when thinking about the shift back towards normal and sort of the transient impact that we're likely to see from COVID, I wanted to ask about the thoughts around the potential second wave of coronavirus patients as some of the stay-at-home orders lessen up and doctor's office reopen? Is it the view of AbbVie that the second wave won't be that large, or that when the second wave comes we'll have strong treatment options and triaging that we'll be able to get to more business-as-normal operations? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Yes. I think, as we look at the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, it's driven by a couple of factors, right? Particularly, I'd say in the U.S., it's driven by a couple of factors. As I said a few minutes ago, certainly the clinical profile of the drug is first and foremost. The second is, you have to have broad-based managed care access in the United States to be successful. It doesn't matter how you much you convince the physician to use the product based on its clinical profile. If they can't get it reimbursed, they obviously can't prescribe it to their patients. And so that takes a company that has strong expertise in being able to deliver high levels of managed care access, which obviously we can. And then the third is just the effectiveness of your commercial and medical affairs organization. And I think in this area we have one of the best, if not the best. So I think those are the things that really drive it. In our business, you can't really leverage one product against the other specifically. So I don't believe it's a leverage issue. As far as the second wave, I'm going to let Mike cover most of that. The only thing I would say is we have not assumed another major shelter in place order in the fall in our assumptions. So we have assumed that we'll be able to manage through any increase in infections in the way we've built this forecast.
Michael Severino: That's correct, Rick. And so, I think it's very hard to make exact predictions about the longer-term nature of the coronavirus infection rates. But what we are assuming, as Rick said is that, there will not be a major second wave in lockdown. And I think the factors that would play into that would be a much greater understanding of surveillance, broader access to testing, the ability to respond much more quickly based on experience. And based on those factors that I just mentioned, if small pockets of new infection do pop up, as well as hopefully the availability of some treatment options, although, I think, treatment options will continue to evolve over some period of time and renewed capacity or relief from the overcapacity status that the healthcare systems are currently operating under. So, I think, it's all of those features together that lead us to the view that supported the assumptions that Rick outlined in our thinking on this.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Damien. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2019 Q4  (2020-02-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also, on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; and Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I'll remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2018 Annual Report and on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website Please note that, we have also posted a set of slides to our website to supplement some of the content, we'll be covering this morning. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2019 performance, as well as our 2020 expectations for AbbVie on a stand-alone basis. We will provide combined AbbVie and Allergan guidance after the close of the planned transaction. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D programs. And Rob will discuss last year's performance and our 2020 guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we will take your questions. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Our adjusted EPS of $2.21 represents growth of more than 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. Total adjusted operational sales growth of 5.3% was also ahead of our expectations for the quarter driven by continued strong performance in both immunology and hematological oncology. Our performance this quarter tops off another strong year for AbbVie. For the full year 2019, we delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. We have driven strong commercial, operational and R&D execution, which has allowed us to substantially grow through the impact of international biosimilar competition. We saw excellent performance in our hematological oncology business, which drove operational growth of more than 39% in the year. We have built a substantial franchise with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, which combined nearly $5.5 billion in combined revenue with strong double-digit growth expected once again in 2020. IMBRUVICA remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy in CLL. With the largest body of clinical evidence, a robust survival benefit, and the highest category rating in treatment guidelines today, we remain confident that IMBRUVICA will be a significant growth contributor for many years to come. VENCLEXTA will also contribute substantially to our growth in 2020 with continued share expansion expected in both the broad relapsed/refractory and frontline CLL segments, as well as continued penetration in frontline AML. In our immunology business, the launches of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are going exceptionally well. Both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ have demonstrated strong differentiated efficacy in their initial indications and we are making considerable progress to expand their uses in several additional immune-mediated diseases. SKYRIZI is already having an impact on AbbVie's growth with sales of approximately $215 million in the fourth quarter, which already equates to an annualized run rate approaching $900 million. And we expect robust growth in 2020. The launch execution has been nothing short of exceptional. In a very short timeframe SKYRIZI has established the leading in-play psoriasis patient share, which includes both new and switching patients at roughly 25%. SKYRIZI is redefining the standard for efficacy and safety in the psoriasis market, where it has not only demonstrated superiority to HUMIRA, the gold standard of care, but also outperformed other novel agents, including COSENTYX. SKYRIZI's commercial access is now at parity to HUMIRA and above 95%. While still early in the launch, we're also seeing robust demand trends for RINVOQ which is performing well ahead of comparable analogs in the RA segment. In the first full quarter, RINVOQ was on the market, we estimate more than 7,600 prescriptions were filled, including both paid prescriptions and those who received RINVOQ through our bridge access program. Based on this level of prescription volume, RINVOQ is currently capturing approximately 9% of in-play RA patients and has surpassed the in-play share for several other established brands. The cannibalization of HUMIRA market share in this segment remains very low thus far. Feedback from prescribing physicians has been very positive. And the strong benefit/risk profile RINVOQ has demonstrated across our registrational trials has supported very rapid and broad formulary coverage for RINVOQ. Commercial access for RINVOQ is now at more than 95% and we expect paid prescription volume to increase significantly throughout 2020 as a result. HUMIRA in the U.S. continues to generate strong revenue driving more than $1 billion of growth in 2019 and will remain a significant contributor to growth again in 2020. The international HUMIRA dynamics remain consistent with our expectations with 2019 revenues, down roughly 28% on an operational basis. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance and the outlook for our immunology franchise. We had previously commented that SKYRIZI and RINVOQ would deliver more than $1 billion of revenue combined in 2020. Our 2020 guidance now contemplates that these two products will contribute approximately $1.7 billion in revenue together this year. Since our inception, we have focused on building a robust pipeline and added growth platforms that will allow AbbVie to absorb the eventual impact of biosimilar competition in the U.S. and maintain a strong and growing business. We continue to make excellent progress against that objective. As I just highlighted, the better-than-expected launch trajectories of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ and the continued strong performance of our hematological oncology franchise has further increased our level of confidence that these platforms will drive significant growth over the long-term. Our R&D productivity over the past seven years has resulted in numerous new products, which collectively contributed approximately $9 billion in revenue in 2019. And our R&D pipeline continues to develop nicely with multiple programs well underway to expand the breadth of indications for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ as well as the advancement of a significant number of early- and mid-stage programs six of which will have proof-of-concept data readouts in 2020. AbbVie's R&D pipeline has been phase-gated from the time we launched as an independent company back in 2013. Our initial priority was to develop next-generation assets that would be superior to HUMIRA and other competitive alternatives within our key immunology disease areas. And as you have seen SKYRIZI and RINVOQ have demonstrated that type of performance across multiple clinical trials. Their successful launch, trajectories demonstrate the value of these assets in two very large segments of immunology, which combined represent approximately 40% of U.S. HUMIRA revenues today. We continue to rapidly progress the development of these assets in the remaining key HUMIRA disease areas as well as new indications such as atopic dermatitis. Our second priority was to build our hematological oncology franchise into a major growth engine for the company. IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA have become roughly a $5.5 billion franchise and growing rapidly. And we continue to expand these medicines into important new disease areas such as multiple myeloma with VENCLEXTA in the t(11;14) biomarker-defined patient population; and combination therapy with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA which have the potential to provide even deeper and more durable responses. The third priority was the development of a robust early- and mid-stage pipeline, which now has nearly 40 clinical programs ongoing including novel new mechanisms developed by AbbVie scientists as well as assets we are advancing across our many collaborations such as Calico. The most advanced programs in our mid- to late-stage pipeline which we expect to be approved by 2022 include navitoclax for myelofibrosis, ABBV-951 for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease and veliparib for the treatment of ovarian cancer and BRCA breast cancer. These approvals are on top of the numerous new opportunities expected for RINVOQ, SKYRIZI and VENCLEXTA. Over the same period of time, we anticipate approximately 30 proof-of-concept readouts from novel programs in our early-stage pipeline, which Mike will discuss momentarily. It is truly an exciting time for AbbVie science. Another exciting aspect of our business is the planned acquisition of Allergan, which has significant strategic and financial merit. Allergan will provide AbbVie with highly valuable on-market assets with leadership positions across additional attractive growth segments including new growth platforms in aesthetics and CNS/neuroscience. The acquisition will further diversify AbbVie's revenue and payer mix and immediately accelerates the stand-alone scale of our non-HUMIRA business the AbbVie growth platform, which is expected to drive high single-digit annual growth revenue over the next decade and beyond. The proposed acquisition is proceeding well. We recently received conditional approval from the European Commission. The FTC review continues to advance following the divestiture announcements of both Zenpep and Allergan's IL-23. And we have completed the integration planning process including confirmation of our synergy objectives. We remain on track for closing the Allergan transaction as expected in the first quarter of 2020. We've entered 2020 with very strong momentum and we're committed to delivering strong results which is reflected in our guidance. We expect full year 2020 adjusted earnings per share of $9.61 to $9.71 representing growth of 8.1% at the midpoint. As I mentioned earlier, this guidance reflects AbbVie on a stand-alone basis. We will provide pro forma guidance for 2020 following the close of the Allergan transaction. So in summary, as you can see from our 2019 results and our 2020 guidance, the performance of AbbVie's business remains very strong. Net performance combined with a late-stage pipeline which includes more than 20 new medicines in major new disease indications as well as a robust early-stage pipeline gives us significant confidence in the future outlook of our company. The AbbVie business will be even stronger and more diverse with the Allergan transaction. We look forward to another successful year and to welcoming our Allergan colleagues to the new AbbVie in the near future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. When we set out as an independent company, we knew that building a productive R&D engine was an essential part of our success. And we're proud of the progress we've made over the past seven years. We've built one of the strongest late-stage pipelines in our industry and brought to market six new assets; RINVOQ, SKYRIZI, IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA, MAVYRET and ORILISSA, which collectively delivered approximately $9 billion in sales in 2019. These assets are performing very well in their lead indications and will drive significant growth for AbbVie over the long-term as we continue to build the body of evidence supporting their differentiated clinical profiles. In immunology, both RINVOQ and SKYRIZI are off to a very strong start in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis respectively. And we continue to generate clinical data sets that set them apart from competitive offerings. For example we recently announced positive topline results from a Phase 3 head-to-head trial comparing SKYRIZI to COSENTYX in psoriasis. In this study, SKYRIZI demonstrated superiority to COSENTYX at week 52 with 87% of SKYRIZI patients achieving PASI 90 compared to 57% for COSENTYX. SKYRIZI also demonstrated superiority to COSENTYX on all ranked secondary end points including PASI 100, PASI 75, and sPGA clear or almost clear at week 52. These results underscore two critical components of SKYRIZI's profile; the ability to drive high levels of response and the durability of that response at long-term end points. In oncology, we will also continue to support our hem/onc franchise with important regulatory milestones and additional Phase 3 data readouts for our approved indications in 2020. We recently received a positive CHMP opinion for VENCLEXTA in previously untreated CLL. And we expect to receive an important label update for IMBRUVICA in the first half of this year based on results from ECOG study which demonstrated the superiority of IMBRUVICA to FCR in frontline fit patients with CLL. When we think about sources of growth beyond the current indications for our recently approved assets, it's important to consider two components of our late-stage pipeline. The first is a large number of programs that will allow us to drive our core assets into important new disease areas that represent large and attractive markets. And the second is a set of new assets that will help support additional growth in the future. If we look first at our opportunity to move into new disease areas with our existing therapies, we see a number of commercially attractive programs that have been de-risked based on strong data. For example we recently announced topline results from the second Phase 3 study for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis which compared RINVOQ to both placebo and HUMIRA in patients who had an inadequate response to at least one non-biologic DMARD. In this study, both doses of RINVOQ met all primary and key secondary end points, demonstrating a significant impact on both joint and skin end points as well as radiographic inhibition of damage to joint structure. RINVOQ also demonstrated superiority to HUMIRA on ACR20 response at week 12 with the high dose and non-inferiority with the low dose. These data followed the positive results from our first registrational trial reported late last year. Detailed data from both pivotal studies will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and we expect to submit our regulatory applications for RINVOQ in psoriatic arthritis in the second quarter with commercialization expected in 2021. Following discussions with global regulators, our approval submissions in ankylosing spondylitis are planned for the second half of 2020 based on positive data already presented at ACR last November. In this study, RINVOQ demonstrated significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms as well as physical function and imaging end points compared to placebo. Together, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis make up an important segment of the rheumatology market with global market sales of approximately $14 billion. The dermatology segment will also be an important area of growth for RINVOQ. Moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis is a large market that we do not participate in today. And in the middle of this year, we expect to see Phase 3 data for RINVOQ in this indication. In our Phase 2b study, RINVOQ demonstrated a very strong effect on the easy composite end point and had a prominent impact on itch which is one of the most troublesome symptoms of this disease. Following the pivotal data readouts, we plan to submit global regulatory submissions later this year. We are also nearing completion of the registrational programs for SKYRIZI in several new disease areas. In the second half of this year, we expect to see data from Phase 3 studies in both psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease with regulatory submissions for both indications expected in 2021. The IBD segment, including both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, represents a significant opportunity with global market sales of approximately $18 billion. IBD is a growing segment where there continues to be significant unmet need. And based on the efficacy demonstrated in our mid-stage studies, we believe both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ have the potential to drive higher levels of performance than other therapeutic alternatives. Together we expect SKYRIZI and RINVOQ to have full coverage across the major disease areas for which HUMIRA is currently approved plus new areas such as atopic dermatitis. With these two new medicines, AbbVie is well positioned to maintain its strong leadership in the $70 billion global immunology market. Another growth asset that we expect to expand into important new areas is VENCLEXTA. CANOVA our Phase 3 study in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with the t(11;14) genetic mutation is now well underway. And towards the end of this year, we plan to initiate a second Phase 3 study in the relapsed/refractory t(11;14) population.
21:49: The level of efficacy that we've seen suggests that t(11;14) patients may be particularly responsive to VENCLEXTA. This biomarker-defined population makes up approximately 20% of the $18 billion multiple myeloma market representing an important new opportunity for VENCLEXTA. In addition to multiple myeloma, we will begin Phase 3 studies in two additional Bcl-2-driven diseases in 2020. The first is AML. Building on our experience in the transplant-ineligible population, we are initiating a study in fit patients with AML who have received stem cell transplant, but remain at high risk for recurrence. The second is higher-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome or MDS. MDS is a malignant disease of bone marrow stem cells that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to the risk of bleeding, infection and transformation to acute leukemia. Some patients with MDS undergo stem cell transplant, but many cannot. And these patients have very few treatment options. Preclinical and early clinical studies support a role for Bcl-2 inhibition in these patients and our Phase 3 studies with VENCLEXTA will begin later this year. The second component of value in our late-stage pipeline includes important new therapies that we expect to launch in 2021 and 2022 including; navitoclax, veliparib and ABBV-951. Navitoclax will be entering Phase 3 studies in the first half of this year in frontline and second-line myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is a malignant disease in which the bone marrow is replaced with fibrotic tissue leading to bone marrow failure. Currently, JAK2 inhibition is the only approved therapeutic option, but despite treatment many patients progress and experience significant morbidity and mortality. Navitoclax is a first-in-class Bcl-xL inhibitor with the potential to transform the treatment of myelofibrosis by deleting the clone that causes the disease. At ASH last year, we presented encouraging data from a Phase II study which demonstrated that up to 43% of patients who had failed JAK2 inhibition responded to navitoclax based on a 35% reduction in spleen volume. In addition, responses deepened over time and we continue to follow these patients. Navitoclax treated patients also showed reductions in the number of malignant cells and decreases in bone marrow fibrosis supporting the potential for disease modification. In the area of solid tumors, we've previously presented positive Phase 3 data from two veliparib studies in frontline ovarian cancer and BRCA breast cancer. Data from these two studies demonstrated significant prolongation of progression-free survival and support the use of PARP inhibition in combination with chemotherapy earlier in the course of treatment. In ovarian cancer, veliparib will be the only PARP inhibitor to combine with frontline chemotherapy and treat a broader population that is not restricted to biomarker status or chemo responsiveness. In BRCA-positive breast cancer veliparib will also be the only PARP inhibitor to combine with platinum-based chemotherapy giving these patients a valuable new treatment option. Based on feedback from global regulatory authorities, we plan to submit our applications for veliparib in the first half of this year. Veliparib will be an important new treatment option for women with ovarian cancer and BRCA breast cancer offering the potential to provide better outcomes. And in our late-stage neuroscience pipeline, we are making good progress with the Phase 3 program for ABBV-951, our innovative approach to delivering DUOPA like efficacy through a subcutaneous delivery system for advanced Parkinson's disease. This approach is enabled by novel levodopa and carbidopa prodrugs and would be a transformative improvement to current treatment options. With a less invasive non-surgical delivery system 951 has the potential to significantly expand the patient population currently addressed by DUOPA or other more invasive therapies for advanced Parkinson's such as deep brain stimulation. We'll see data from the pivotal program in 2021 with commercialization anticipated in 2022. In addition to advancing, our late-stage programs we've also made tremendous progress building our early-stage pipeline. Following several years of investment, we're beginning to see these efforts pay-off. And over the next three years, we're planning for proof-of-concept data readouts in approximately 30 programs. Our early pipeline is designed to include a mix of highly novel targets supported by strong underlying science and clinically validated targets where we think an opportunity exists to improve on current agents. In the area of immunology, I'll highlight our TNF steroid conjugate ABBV-3373, which is novel technology that delivers a proprietary high-potency steroid directly to activated immune cells by TNF-mediated uptake. We've shown in model systems that this approach has the potential to drive transformational efficacy. And our early clinical work has demonstrated that we can deliver 3373 at its anticipated therapeutic dose without systemic steroid effects. We will see efficacy data from this study later this year. If our clinical data reproduce what we have seen pre-clinically, our steroid conjugate technology has the potential to serve as a platform across a wide range of diseases including RA, IBD and lupus. We will also see proof-of-concept data this year from several other early-stage assets in our immunology portfolio including data for ABBV-599 our JAK-BTK program; and ABBV-323 our CD40 antagonist program, which are both targeting multiple pathogenic nodes that are thought to play important roles in diseases such as RA, IBD, lupus and scleroderma, allowing us to restate standard of care in our core disease areas and move into new ones where no effective therapy exists today. In oncology, we are building on what we have learned with venetoclax and navitoclax to advance a number of promising apoptosis programs. The most advanced of these are ABBV-155, which uses a B7-H3-targeting antibody to deliver a novel high-potency Bcl-xL warhead to solid tumors; and ABBV-621, which is designed to induce apoptosis by clustering TRAIL, an apoptosis-inducing ligand on the surface of cancer cells. We will see monotherapy data for ABBV-155 in 2020 and combination data in 2021. We expect to see proof-of-concept data for ABBV-621 in 2021 as well. In immuno-oncology, we have a number of very promising T cell-redirecting bispecifics in the clinic and several more in preclinical development. The most advanced of these are BCMA bispecifics in multiple myeloma TNB-338B [ph] and HPN-217. These programs allow us to explore different epitope specificities and binding affinities to optimize benefit/risk of our candidates in this very promising area. We are also pursuing several novel approaches designed to modify the tumor immunosuppressive environment. Here I would highlight ABBV-151, our monoclonal antibody targeting GARP. Through its effect on GARP ABBV-151 reduces TGF-beta-mediated signaling within tumors. TGF-beta is thought to be an important driver of tumor immune evasion and TGF-beta signaling is correlated with a lack of tumor immune infiltrate and PD-1 unresponsiveness. In addition, I would highlight our CD39 inhibitor, TTX-030. Recently emerging data suggest that CD39 plays an important role in tumor immune evasion by converting pro-inflammatory ATP to anti-inflammatory ADP and adenosine in the extracellular environment. TTX-030 is designed to restore this important pro-inflammatory signal and reduce tumor immunosuppression. Lastly in our early neuroscience pipeline we have several promising disease-modifying candidates in the clinic for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In addition to our tau-directed programs we have programs aimed at important regulators of the neuroinflammatory response TREM2 and CD33; as well as a core driver of pathology in Parkinson's disease alpha-synuclein. So in summary, we've continued to see significant evolution of our early- and late-stage development programs. We have a late-stage pipeline that includes more than 20 programs in registrational studies and have nearly 40 programs in early- to mid-stage development that will mature over the next few years. With that I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our 2019 performance and our 2020 guidance. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thank you, Mike. Today I'll review our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 and then walk through our 2020 outlook. We had another year of strong execution. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $8.94 reflecting growth of 13% compared to prior year and beating our initial guidance midpoint by $0.24. For the full year, net revenues were $33.3 billion, up 2.7% on an operational basis excluding a 1.1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Strong growth from several key products and newly launched assets more than offset the impact of international biosimilar competition. For the fourth quarter, net revenues were $8.7 billion, up 5.3% on an operational basis excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. U.S. HUMIRA sales were $4 billion, up 9.8% compared to prior year, reflecting high single-digit volume growth plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below 0.5 month in the quarter. Full year sales of HUMIRA in U.S. were $14.9 billion, up 8.6% versus prior year. International HUMIRA sales were approximately $950 million in the quarter, down 25.4% operationally reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and in line with our expectations. SKYRIZI continues to perform extremely well with global sales of $216 million in the quarter. RINVOQ is also demonstrating strong uptake with sales of $33 million in the first full quarter following the U.S. launch in late August. For the full year, the combined revenues of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ were $402 million and above our initial expectations. Hematologic oncology global sales were more than $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 37.2% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong performance of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were approximately $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 28.9%, driven by strong share in all lines of therapy in CLL. VENCLEXTA revenues were $251 million in the quarter, driven by continued share gains across all approved indications. For the full year, our hem/onc global revenues were $5.5 billion, up 39.3% on an operational basis. Global HCV sales were $632 million in the quarter. For the full year, HCV sales were $2.9 billion, down 17.7% on an operational basis, driven by lower treated patient volumes in select international markets and increased competition within the U.S. managed Medicaid segment. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for Creon and Duodopa. Turning now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 81.6% of sales, up 180 basis points compared to the prior year including the year-over-year benefit related to the expiration of HUMIRA royalties. Adjusted R&D investment was 15.3% of sales supporting our pipeline programs in oncology, immunology, and other areas. Adjusted SG&A expense was 21.6% of sales, reflecting continued investment in our on-market products and newly launched assets. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 44.6% of sales, an improvement of 290 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted net interest expense was $282 million and the adjusted tax rate was 8.8%. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding specified items was $2.21, up 16.3% versus prior year. As we look ahead to 2020, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $9.61 to $9.71, reflecting growth of 8.1% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $1.95 of known intangible amortization and specified items. On the topline in 2020, we expect revenue growth approaching 8% on an operational basis. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact on reported sales growth. This forecast comprehends the following assumptions for our key products. In 2020, we expect U.S. HUMIRA to deliver revenue growth of approximately 9%. We expect international HUMIRA to approach $3.4 billion at current exchange rates. As Rick noted, we expect global sales of our newly launched immunology products to reach approximately $1.7 billion in 2020. This includes SKYRIZI global revenues of approximately $1.2 billion and RINVOQ global revenues of approximately $500 million. We expect our hem/onc franchise to grow 24% on an operational basis, with IMBRUVICA global revenues of approximately $5.5 billion and VENCLEXTA global sales of approximately $1.3 billion. We expect HCV global sales of approximately $2.5 billion. For Creon, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%. For Duodopa, we expect sales of approximately $500 million. For Lupron, Synthroid, and Synagis, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year. And we expect approximately $200 million in combined revenue from ORILISSA in endometriosis and Elagolix in uterine fibroids. Looking at the P&L for 2020, we are forecasting adjusted gross margin of approximately 81.5% of sales. We are forecasting adjusted R&D expense just above 14% of sales, reflecting continued investment across all stages of our pipeline. We are forecasting adjusted SG&A expense to be just above 19% of sales including funding to maximize the sales potential of new products. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 48% of sales, an improvement of roughly 70 basis points versus 2019. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $1.2 billion and we model a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 10%. Finally, our share count for 2020 will be roughly flat. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.28 and $2.30 excluding approximately $0.53 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We anticipate first quarter operational sales growth of approximately 7%. At current rates, we expect a modest unfavorable foreign exchange impact. For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales of approximately $3.5 billion. We expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $900 million assuming current exchange rates. For SKYRIZI, we expect global sales of approximately $250 million. And for IMBRUVICA, we expect global sales approaching $1.2 billion. Moving now to the P&L for the first quarter, we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 48.5% of sales. As a reminder, the 2020 guidance provided today reflects AbbVie on a standalone basis. We will provide combined AbbVie and Allergan guidance after the close of the transaction. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results. And with our strong track record combined with the momentum of our business we are well positioned for strong growth in 2020. With that I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks Rob. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much for the question and congratulations on the quarter. Rick I just wanted to ask you it's been a while since you gave the kind of initial overview of the basis for the Allergan transaction. Could you talk about how the business performance of AbbVie and frankly also Allergan has been trending compared to the assumptions that you had going into the transaction? And then as you get close to closing how confident are you about the $2 billion in synergies? And how soon might they be realized? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Hey Geoff. I think you've obviously seen the standalone AbbVie performance and we're coming off of another very good year. And our projection and our guidance obviously is projected from a standalone basis another strong year for the company. And I think, in particular, we're very impressed with what we're seeing out of our immunology franchise and what we're seeing out of our hem/onc franchise. And so we feel good. We've been watching the Allergan performance. They have reported two quarters that we've seen. They'll be reporting another quarter here soon, probably sometime early next week. And I would say, at least for the two that have been reported, overall the business is tracking, I'd say slightly ahead of what our deal model had projected. As I mentioned, I think a number of times the deal model that we put together was a fairly conservative deal model. So that's not too surprising. But I think as you look at key products that are – critical products for their business, they're all performing in line or ahead of what our projections were. As it relates to the synergies, as I mentioned in my formal comments, we have gone through all of the integration planning process with Allergan. Part of that process is to validate the synergies. And so we're comfortable that, the synergy target that we had communicated, which was $2 billion or greater than $2 billion is an achievable number. Obviously, anytime you do a transaction like this you're trying to maximize the synergies and obviously maintain the business to perform at the level that you would expect it to perform. So I feel good about the synergy projections. We'll provide final gating for those projections, when we do the combined pro forma guidance and – but I feel good about the overall target over the first three years meeting or exceeding what we had projected. The timing close everything is progressing as we had planned. And we still anticipate that we will see closure by the end of the first quarter. The other thing I'd say is, as we step back and we look at what were we trying to accomplish with the Allergan transaction, it was basically to try to build a business that ultimately would be even stronger than the AbbVie business over the long-term. And I think one of the things – as investors start to think about the business, it's important to sort of put that in perspective. We want a business that's more diversified, both from a revenue standpoint, as well as a payer mix standpoint. We want a business that has durable positions. This business the combined business will have durable growth positions in eight different franchises and be able to drive strong growth. There'll be four franchises for the new company that will be the major growth franchises for us. Obviously, immunology, hematological, oncology, medical aesthetics and CNS/neuro will be the four franchises. This is a business that will have excellent payer diversity and payer mix. If you look at it as a percent of the global revenues Medicare Part B will be about 2%, Medicare Part D will be about 16%, Medicaid will be about 3% and cash pay will be about 10%. So nice balance and security along the payer base, it will be a business that's driven by volume not by price. And so that's important. It will be a company that has a strong growing dividend that's underpinned by tremendous cash flow, which provides security to deliver a growing dividend over the long-term and through the loss of exclusivity in 2023 in the U.S. It will also have a number of recently launched products and growth products. In fact, there'll be six of them if you think about it. You look at SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, VENCLEXTA, IMBRUVICA those all have significant growth opportunities ahead of them on the AbbVie side. And then you look at the Allergan side, you have VRAYLAR. This is a product that has a – it's about an $850 million product. I think the last numbers, I saw showed it was growing about 70%. And you have their recently launched oral CGRP that, we haven't seen any data on yet as far as their revenue performance, because they just launched it, but I think that will be an important product over the long term. So – and then that's underpinned by our late-stage pipeline that has 20 new drugs in new major indications and an early-stage pipeline that Mike outlined in his remarks. That's a pretty impressive profile of a company in our industry and that's the kind of company we were trying to build by combining these two companies together. So I think that's how we think about it.
Geoffrey Porges: Great. Thanks very much Rick.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Geoffrey. Operator next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: Thank you. And let me add my congratulations on another well-executed quarter. I have two questions. First SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are obviously off to great starts and the raised guidance for them in 2020 is impressive. Previously, AbbVie had provided 2025 guidance of $10 billion for these two products. And I'm just wondering, how you are thinking about that number now. And then secondly, the company had given 2020 revenue guidance in 2015 of $37 billion and then in 2017 said that that would be exceeded. I realized that in complicated businesses there are always pushes and pulls. But it appears today's 2020 revenue guidance implies a $36 billion revenue number in 2020. So I'm just curious for the reason for the delta. Thank you very much,
Rick Gonzalez: Well, I mean, if you look at SKYRIZI and RINVOQ obviously they're off to a very strong start, when you look at the $10 billion guidance that we had that still had some level of risk adjustment for the follow-on indications associated with it. And obviously, as we move along then those risk adjustments will come down. Probability of success will go up. So by definition by the way, we look at things you would expect SKYRIZI and RINVOQ to be able to exceed that level of performance assuming all those follow-on indications perform at the level that we would expect. And everything that we know would clearly indicate that that is the case. We're not in a position where we're going to up the guidance. Now in any complicated business like ours on the $37 billion, obviously, there are things like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ that are ultimately performing better. Certainly, when you look at our hematological oncology business that's performing at a level that we would expect to deliver at least what we had expected back in that point in time probably a little bit higher. Now you also have puts and takes, right? International biosimilars were more aggressive than we had anticipated. But net-net, I think we're comfortable with that level of performance and more importantly, we're comfortable with being able to deliver the kind of earnings that we would expect. And so I think we feel very good about how the company is performing and our ability to deliver on those long-term expectations. The other thing I'd say is as you look at the biosim, obviously biosimilars are an important aspect of our particular business. And we're now at a point where we're basically lapping the first year of biosimilar experience in the international markets. And it gives us the ability to be able to look back and say did our strategy work that we had put in place? And I think we've obviously been able to learn from what that strategy has been able to do. In general, I would tell you that I'm feeling pretty good about how the strategy played out. On the aggressive side, obviously the biosimilar competitors before they entered the market priced more aggressively than we had seen with the analogs. And so the shape of the curve was different which we've talked about a number of different times. Having said that, our strategy was to make sure that we could maintain as much share as possible of HUMIRA and maintain it as profitable as possible and we can now step back and look at what does that look like. Well what it basically looks like is we have maintained about two-thirds of the volume. If you look specifically at the countries that went biosimilar and you look at what the erosion level is in those countries, it's about 44%, 45% within those countries. So what that means is we've obviously maintained a tail of about 55% of the HUMIRA volume, which is a pretty -- the HUMIRA revenue which is a pretty significant tail when you think about a product of the size of HUMIRA. So I think overall, we feel good about how our strategy played out despite the fact that the biosimilar players were more aggressive. I think as we look at the U.S., there are some things that we can translate out of that experience. And it gives us some feel for how the U.S. will evolve as we enter that biosimilar phase in 2023. Obviously, we have products like RINVOQ and SKYRIZI that are growing rapidly. We have a number of years to be able to drive that. And we're making very good progress on the follow-on indications. And therefore, we should have a broad set of indications -- approved indications for those assets, which should drive very significant growth leading into that LOE event. The strategy that we'll put in place is the exact same strategy that we did in the international markets. Our goal is to maintain as much share as we can in as profitable of a way as we can. There is no market exactly like the U.S. market outside the U.S. But what I would say is we would expect it to be competitive like the international markets. We'll have more competitors entering the U.S. market. So I think the shape of the curve will be similar to what we saw in the international markets. But I'd say as far as our ability to maintain share, we certainly in the U.S. have at least the same competitive position that we have in the international markets and in all likelihood we have a stronger competitive position in the U.S. market. So I would say we would expect to fare at least as well or better from the standpoint of maintaining that tail over time. And so, we're feeling better about where we stand, both the progress that we're making against the assets that will allow us to be able to drive growth over the long-term and the experience we're getting with dealing with biosimilar competition in these markets.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.
Navin Jacob: Hello. Thanks for taking my question. A couple on RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. Number one on SKYRIZI wondering what the feedback from physicians and patients are regarding -- I realize it's very early, but regarding average duration of therapy. How should we be thinking about that relative to your experience with HUMIRA? And then on RINVOQ, wondering about the Q4 sales number which came in a little bit lighter relative to how we were thinking about it based on the scripts. Wondering what the dynamic is from a dollar per prescription standpoint, how the couponing and sampling is affecting that. There's been commentary from Pfizer on Xeljanz pricing that's brought up some questions about pricing in this space. Obviously very early on, but would love any color there. And as a corollary to that, with regards to the differences in the channel mix for RINVOQ versus SKYRIZI, any kind of color there would be appreciated. Particularly as you said that you have very good access in the commercial setting for RINVOQ wondering about the access in the other parts of the channel as well? Thank you so much.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So on the first question, this is Rick average duration of therapy. Obviously, SKYRIZI is a quarterly dose product as a loading dose that occurs in the first phase. So we don't have a tremendous amount of experience yet. But I'd say the experience that we have thus far is consistent with what our original launch assumptions would be and that is that the duration of therapy would be very high at HUMIRA levels or above. Obviously, it's more convenient to have quarterly dosing. And so, we're not seeing anything there that is different than what we would have anticipated, albeit it's early on, right? As far as RINVOQ in the fourth quarter, I'd say RINVOQ is tracking well. It's continuing to gain in-play share. Now it didn't get its significant uptick in market access until January. There was a fairly significant jump from December to January. So there was still a fair amount of prescriptions that were being driven through the -- our access program where we provide patients -- if they don't have access, we provide them with free product through our bridge program. But now as I mentioned we're over 95%. And our policy is once we've achieved access in an account, we no longer allow bridge access for those products in other words from a compliance standpoint. And so you should start to see those paid prescriptions ramping in line with what we would expect the access to be. SKYRIZI has very similar kinds of access. As far as the channel mix is concerned, I'm going to have Rob cover that.
Rob Michael: Hi, Navin, it's Rob. So if you think about the difference in the patient profile with RA versus psoriasis, you obviously have an older patient population. So you'd expect RINVOQ to be higher in terms of Medicare Part D. To give you just a range, it's around 20% of the RINVOQ channel mix is Part D whereas at SKYRIZI it's closer to 10%.
Rick Gonzalez: The only other thing I'd mention is the one thing that is very encouraging to us is, if you take SKYRIZI, about half 49% of the patients are naïve patients and the other 51% are obviously second-line and beyond. If we look at RINVOQ, it's about 40%, 38%, 39% are naïve patients, which at this phase of the launch is higher than what we had originally modeled and the remaining are second-line and beyond. The other thing I'd say is we, obviously, track how we're doing against various competitors. It's now -- RINVOQ now has an in-play share that's the equivalent of about 70% of XELJANZ and obviously growing at a pretty rapid pace. And so I think that's an encouraging sign as well.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Navin. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.
Terence Flynn: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the quarter from me as well. One more on the guidance front, when you do give the pro forma guidance post-deal close, I was just wondering if we should expect a new longer term guidance on that front as well? And then again appreciate all the detail on the pipeline. On the slides you had six proof-of-concept readouts this year. Just wondering of those assets, which do you view as most transformational? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: On the pro forma guidance, we haven't made a final decision. Obviously we'll be providing for calendar year 2020. We haven't made a decision whether we'll go out any further than that. So I'd say that's a decision that we'll make as we get closer to the close and ultimately announcing what the combined guidance is. Mike, do you want to cover number two?
Michael Severino: Sure. So as you mentioned, we have six proof-of-concept readouts this year in our early to mid-stage pipeline. And if I wanted to pick some examples of the most transformational, I think I would point to ABBV-3373 our TNF steroid conjugate. If you look at the basic biology, the ability to drive -- to deliver this very, very high-potency steroid directly to the activated immune cells that are doing the damage in these diseases really has tremendous potential. In our pre-clinical work in our model systems, we see results that are really unlike anything we've ever seen with other sorts of agents. And we can deliver that impact in those systems without systemic steroid effects. So if that plays out in the clinic in the same way it has in those model systems that would really be transformational across a wide range of diseases across a range of TNF-mediated diseases like RA, other rheumatologic conditions, inflammatory bowel diseases and many others. And you could also use that same technology with different targeting warheads to get into areas where there really aren't effective therapies today like lupus for example. So that really has transformational potential. Maybe I would point to one other program on the onc side. If you look at our work in apoptosis there really is a tremendous opportunity I believe in the future to get into solid tumors with our apoptosis programs. And one program that'll have a readout at least from the mono-therapy component this year is ABBV-155 our B7-H3-targeted xL delivery.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Terence. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho.
Vamil Divan: Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. I just want a few follow-up on the comments Rick made regarding HUMIRA U.S. erosion and Phase 1 biosimilars that arrive. And I think you said the overall shape of the curve you think will be similar to what we've seen outside the U.S. And I think you also previously mentioned that part of the reason for the Allergan deal was to give you the ability to address the various scenarios of HUMIRA erosion. So I'm just trying to get a sense as you think about the scenarios and how this might evolve in 2023, 2024, do you expect that you'll be continuing to grow sales and earnings right through those years? Or do you think that if it is a somewhat rapid erosion that there might still be a little bit of a decline during that time period? And then my second question is just around pricing. And it sounds like you've got maybe one or two percentage points of pricing growth for HUMIRA this year. Just wondering is that a reasonable expectation for 2020 for HUMIRA? And also maybe just for the next couple of years, do you think you'll still be able to get a low single-digit amount of price? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay, Vamil this is Rick. So I'll take the first question and then Rob will cover the second question for you. We're, obviously, not in a position where we're going to give 2023 guidance at this point. What I was referring to is if you look at consensus today what it shows for HUMIRA is that it basically is a stair-step down over the course of three or four years. I would say our experience in the international markets by the way multiple biosimilar competitors coming into the market simultaneously created a sharper decline, a deeper decline in year one and then it's pretty much stabilized at that level. Might be some slight erosion after that, but relatively minor or moderate after that. That when I describe the shape of the curve, I think that's a more reasonable shape of a curve that we would expect in the U.S. market based on the fact that, there'll be probably seven competitors that enter the marketplace in 2023. So as far as growth, it is our obvious objective to make sure that we're in a position that we can grow over the long-term. That's an important objective for us. It's certainly an objective that we have been able to deliver on throughout our history as a company and it's an important objective for us. Now, that doesn't mean that in 2023, there couldn't be some step-down in 2023 and then return quickly to growth thereafter. But ultimately, as we get closer, I think we can provide more accurate guidance. But I have a high level of confidence that we are building an engine that will allow us to be able to grow through it over a long period of time – over the longer period of time. Allergan plays an important part of making sure that we can maintain the investment profile that we want to maintain in R&D and SG&A to make sure we have the levels of cash flow to continue to support the dividend and grow the dividend. It plays a very important role in a number of aspects of how we manage the business over the long term. Mike – or I'm sorry, Rob?
Rob Michael: So, Vamil, it's Rob. So I'll take your question on U.S. HUMIRA. So of the approximate 9% growth we've guided, volume is going to be mid-single digits and price will be low single digits. I think for modeling purposes it's fair to model low single digits going forward. We'll obviously provide that guidance at the appropriate time, but that's the best way to think about it.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Vamil. Operator next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets.
Randall Stanicky : Great. Thanks. Rick, there's been a trend in large biopharma towards divesting legacy products. AbbVie has legacy products you're getting more from Allergan. How are you thinking about potential divestitures from the combined entity? And then just secondly, on ORILISSA, you've talked about the need to build awareness activation. Is that still a $2 billion opportunity? And how are you thinking about the potential to inflect that backup? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah. I mean, every company in our industry for the most part has some level of legacy products. We do as well as others. I think many people want to divest those products, typically, not because those products aren't profitable and provide significant earnings, but because they depress their overall growth, if they're too large, as it relates to their overall base of business. I would say, as we look at our profile and our ability to be able to grow, we don't believe that that's a significant issue for us. That doesn't mean that at some point in the future, we might not reevaluate, if we thought that was in the best interest of the company overall. But I'd say that's not something that we have any plans for at this point in time. ORILISSA the point you raised is an accurate point. The challenge that we've had with ORILISSA in endometriosis has been activation of those patients at the rate that we would have expected. We have made some changes in the fourth quarter to our go-to-market strategy. We'll have to see how those play out. And also, we'll have the launch of the uterine fibroid indication in 2020. That's a different patient population. And so I think it will have a different activation profile. And – but I think we have to see how endometriosis – whether or not we get an inflection point here that's different than what we've seen thus far before we make any predictions about how we would change the long-term projections. We fundamentally believe this is a good drug. Everything we know about it says, it's a good drug and it ultimately fits an important need. But we're obviously going to have to change that activation curve to get to the level of expectation that we have had for that – for the drug.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Randall. Operator next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: Thank you. A couple of questions please. Just to round out the discussion on prior 2025 guidance for certain products and asked about three of them so far. VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA maybe you can just talk about how those are trending today relative to those projections. IMBRUVICA seems like it's doing great. But you set really high 2025 guidance, I think of $11.5 billion. And then VENCLEXTA I think you guided for $6 billion. And I think it finished out the year here at $800 million. So, any comments on those two products? And then a second question just on in the context of FTC being more unpredictable with the brazikumab divestiture, a person could argue for different reasons the FTC might raise an eyebrow about Astra taking back an asset that they got rid of originally. I think back then it wasn't core to their business. And frankly, when you look at Astra and what they concentrate in now it's hard to see where it fits. So FTC could potentially question whether Astra is really a committed competitive developer of that asset. Just wondering, if you can share your thoughts on that? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Sure. As far as VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA are concerned in the long-term guidance, we feel very comfortable with our long-term guidance for those two assets. If you look at this year for VENCLEXTA, it will be an important inflection year for VENCLEXTA. And we would expect it to continue to grow quite nicely over time. Obviously, the multiple myeloma and t(11;14) is a significant opportunity for VENCLEXTA. I think that represents roughly 20% of the myeloma patients and myeloma is obviously a very big market. So we feel good about that. As far as the FTC is concerned, the way this process normally works is you bring in the players that you're considering to acquire a product which we and Allergan did. And so the FTC has had an opportunity to interact with both of the players and give us feedback around those players. So I think you can conclude from that that, we wouldn't move forward with a player that the FTC told us they were uncomfortable with.
Tim Anderson: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator next question please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.
Andrew Baum: Thank you. Just in the psoriasis segment, you run a very impressive trial versus the leading IL-17, seemingly taking away all their key selling points, both in terms of depth as well as speed of onset of response. To what extent do you think you're going to accelerate eating into the IL-17 segment by leveraging that trial in the psoriasis setting? And then secondly, back on CLL, could you just talk to how you see the near-term competitive risk from the introduction of Calquence among patients who are struggling with IMBRUVICA tolerance. I realize, it's only a minority of those patients as they tolerate the first year of therapy, but whether we're going to see any patient shift across as it comes to market. And then second, longer term, now that you have the covalent -- the non-covalent inhibitors coming on to the scene with ArQule Lilly and others. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: So, Mike, why don't you cover one and three and then I'll come back and cover the Calquence question?
Michael Severino: Sure. This is Mike. With respect to the head-to-head data we just released in the last several weeks against COSENTYX, really was a very strong result. And what I would say is, it highlights a number of the things that we said. One, we drive very, very high levels of response. That response is very durable over time. Although, all the data haven't been presented, they will be at an upcoming medical meeting. We said that we hit across all of the ranked secondary end points, so there's very sort of broad-based results. And we had very good data at 16 weeks, as you said. So we think that that's going to continue to drive the momentum of SKYRIZI into this space. Now, having said that, SKYRIZI is already performing extremely well and we would expect that to continue. So with the -- for your third question on the competitive space for BTK inhibitors, we feel very, very good about the package of data that we have delivered around IMBRUVICA. It's very broad. We have five large-scale randomized readouts. We have a robust survival benefit. And that's a data advantage that's very hard to overcome. If you look at the launch of some of the follow-on covalent BTK inhibitors, our data package still is the broadest and we believe is the strongest in terms of showing the overall benefits. And the points of differentiation that folks had talked about in the past haven't really materialized. So we feel good about our competitive position there. They'll take some share, as you've seen in MCL, but it's nothing that would change our ability to grow IMBRUVICA. With respect to the non-covalent inhibitors, I think, the place for those is less clear. As I've said, we have many large-scale Phase 3 data readouts, including survival benefits. So until those molecules really have an equivalent data set, it's going to be very, very difficult for them to compete in the space where IMBRUVICA plays. Now there are a small number of patients who have cysteine mutations that lose response to covalent BTK inhibitors because of that. One might expect a non-covalent inhibitor to work there. But that's really a much smaller opportunity and that follows the use of the covalent inhibitors. And we would say, in that space, that VENCLEXTA-based regimens are probably the best option and certainly have the most data today.
Rick Gonzalez: And then, to your second question, as it relates to whether or not we'll see patients being moved off of IMBRUVICA and on to Calquence based on side-effect profiles. We don't believe that will be the case. I mean, I think, as Mike pointed out, when you look at the body of data around IMBRUVICA and particularly the survival benefit that we see with IMBRUVICA, physicians are reluctant to move a patient off of a drug that gives them the opportunity to be able to have that level of survival benefit to something that has less data to be able to support that. The guidelines reflect that as well. And most physicians know that when they have a side-effect profile that they're having difficulty managing through, that they routinely -- prior to Calquence being on the market, what they would typically do is, take the patient off of therapy for a short period of time until it resolves and then put them back on therapy. And many patients would ultimately be fine when they were put back on therapy. So moving to another non-differentiated products, we don't think will have a fundamental impact. We're obviously watching the share data. It's early on because the latest share data that we have is still November. And as you know they were approved in November. Now they were on guidelines for most of 2019 in CLL but the share is very low. They have about 1% share in first-line, 2% share in second-line, about 6% share in third-line but most of those patients in third-line about half of them are BTK failures IMBRUVICA failures. So thus far, we don't see anything that would suggest that it's having a significant negative impact on our performance.
Liz Shea: Thank you, Andrew. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger: Thanks very much and I wanted to add my congrats as well. I have two questions for you Rick and the team. So with respect to looking at analogs, branded ex U.S. REMICADE has stairstepped down 30% annually over the past five years since biosimilars first launched and the 2019 sales were less than 20% of the 2014 sales. So could you discuss the considerations for AbbVie when your team has evaluated it as a potential analog for HUMIRA-declined prospects? And then second with respect to ORILISSA, could you discuss efforts to change the mindset of younger women who may be hesitant to take hormonal therapies? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Yes. So David this is Rick for your first question. Yes I think the difference between REMICADE and Enbrel as well actually and the experience that we had with HUMIRA was in most of those cases only one or two competitors came in at a time. And so what you're seeing is essentially the way we had originally modeled, HUMIRA was that at year three, we would get to the levels that we're at now because it would stairstep down, but I think what we learned in that process is when four competitors entered the market at one time that the competitive dynamics between them to try to get share, created an environment where they became far more aggressive early on. So I don't think the curve will look as – it won't look as if the same as REMICADE. Now that doesn't mean that over time, we won't see some moderate continued erosion. But it's – for a business of our size and with the growth prospects of our business that's not something that would inhibit our ability to be able to grow. I think you can see we grew through – we ultimately had positive revenue growth in 2019 despite the fact that we had a very significant portion of our international business go biosimilar in 2019. The second question is part of the activity that we're working on now to try to drive activation at a faster rate in women on ORILISSA that is one component. I wouldn't say it's the most significant component but it is one component: to better educate women on what this therapy is all about, what the side-effect profile of this therapy really looks like, the safety profile of it; and make sure that we do that in a way that it's easily accessible for women in that age group, meaning it has a social media aspect to it that allows them to be able to access accurate information about ORILISSA and the benefits of it and the appropriate use of it. And so that is part of the changes that we made in the fourth quarter. And we're just going to have to see how those changes – the impact those changes have over time.
Liz Shea: Thank you, David. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-11-01 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce, Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; and Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our third quarter performance and highlights, as well as our full year guidance which we are raising again this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across the R&D programs and Rob will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions. AbbVie delivered another outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.33, representing growth of nearly 9% versus last year and exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04. Total revenue of $8.4 billion was also ahead of our expectations for the quarter driven by continued strong performance in hematological oncology and immunology.  I’ll start with our hem/onc business, which delivered operational sales growth of 38.5% in the quarter. IMBRUVICA continues to perform exceptionally well with global revenue of more than $1.2 billion in the quarter an increase of nearly 30% versus last year. IMBRUVICA has a strong position across multiple indications and remains the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy in CLL. We are especially pleased with the recent inflection in the frontline setting driven by IMBRUVICA’s growing body of clinical evidence, label augmentation and update to treatment guidelines. We are also seeing a substantial contribution from VENCLEXTA with total revenue of more than $200 million in the quarter. VENCLEXTA continues to expand new patient share in the broad Relapsed Refractory CLL segment and we are making very good progress with our recent approvals for frontline CLL and AML.  Now turning to immunology where we strengthened our leadership position with the introduction of two new best-in-class therapies, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, creating a broad portfolio of therapies well positioned to further improve patient care.  We continue to see excellent performance from SKYRIZI, with total revenue of approximately $90 million in the quarter. The launch is going extremely well with prescription trends that continue to remain well above recent launch analogs in the psoriasis category. Through the first six months on the market, we already have approximately 3,500 prescribing physicians and more than 9,000 patients treated with SKYRIZI including those in our bridge access program. And in this short timeframe, SKYRIZI has already established its position as the leader for in-play psoriasis patient share. This includes both new patients, and switching patients.  In addition, commercial access for SKYRIZI is now more than 80%, a testament to its best-in-class product profile. We continue to expect SKYRIZI to drive significant growth over our long-range plan.  In the quarter, we also announced the approval of the upadacitinib, known as RINVOQ in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients who had moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. This approval marks yet another major milestone for AbbVie, the 14th new product for a major indication approval in the last five years and continues to demonstrate our commitment and our leadership in immunology,  With a strong benefit risk profile demonstrated across the registrational trials, RINVOQ offers meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development for rheumatoid arthritis. Feedback from prescribing physicians has been very positive and we have a highly experienced immunology commercial organization to support a strong launch trajectory.  The early trends for RINVOQ are highly encouraging and performance has been tracking ahead of comparable analogs within the RA segment. I’ll highlight a few recent datapoints for you. In the month of October, the second full month was on the market, we estimate more than 1400 prescriptions were filled including both paid prescriptions and those who received RINVOQ in our bridge access program.  Based on this level of prescription volume, RINVOQ is currently capturing approximately 6% of in-play RA patients. After less than 90 days on the market, RINVOQ’s in-play patient share has surpassed REMICADE and several other established products and is rapidly approaching in the in-play share for Enbrel.  We are also seeing very low cannibalization of HUMIRA market share thus far. Commercial access is ramping strongly and in line with our expectations. By early January, we expect RINVOQ to have commercial access above 75% and we expect paid prescription volume to increase significantly as this expands over the next several months.  So while we are still early in the launch, we are certainly pleased by the feedback we received from field from physicians, and the robust demand trends that we are seeing.  Now turning to HUMIRA. HUMIRA grew 9.5% in the U.S. this quarter driven by continued strong volume growth across all three segments, rheum, derm, and gastro. International HUMIRA sales were down approximately 32% on an operational basis, reflecting the impact of direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other international markets. The international biosimilar trends and dynamics remain consistent with our expectations. Based on the continued strong momentum of our business in the quarter and the progress year-to-date, we are once again raising our full year 2019 EPS guidance. We now expect adjusted earnings per share of $8.90 to $8.92 reflecting growth of 12.6% at the midpoint, which remains at the top tier of our peer group.  I am extremely pleased with the underlying performance of our business. Additionally, with the planned acquisition of Allergan, we will be adding highly valuable on-market assets with leadership positions across additional attractive growth segments including significant new growth platforms in medical aesthetics and CNS.  The proposed acquisition is proceeding as expected with the recent successful completion of the Allergan shareholder vote who approved the transaction and advancing regulatory reviews around the globe. Integration planning is also well underway and we have made substantial progress. We remain on track for closing in the first quarter of 2020.  The Allergan transaction has significant strategic merit and the new AbbVie is poised to deliver top tier financial performance. Combined, we will generate significant earnings and cash flow to enhance our innovative R&D platform, support a strong and growing dividend and rapidly pay down debt.  As noted in our press release today, we are announcing a 10.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.07 per share to $1.82 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2020. Since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by 195%.  So in summary, we continue to demonstrate strong momentum and I am extremely pleased with our execution across the portfolio including the progress that we are making with the recent new product launches and our pipeline advancement. We have assembled an impressive set of growth assets and the outlook for our business remains strong.  The Allergan transaction will make us even stronger and more diversified. We remain focused on achieving our long-term strategic vision for the company delivering industry-leading performance and outstanding shareholder value while improving patients’ lives.  With that, I’ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael Severino : Thank you, Rick. We continue to make great progress across all stages of our pipeline with several significant pipeline milestones since our last earnings call, as well as notable data presentations at a number of medical meetings.  In the immunology, we achieved another major milestone and continued to expand our portfolio with the U.S. approval of RINVOQ and its initial indication of rheumatoid arthritis. We are very pleased with the label, which reflects the strong benefit risk profile demonstrated across our large and comprehensive registrational program. RINVOQ, which was internally discovered and developed at AbbVie represents an important advancement in the treatment of RA providing physicians with a new, highly differentiated therapeutic option for their patients. The launch is underway in the U.S. and feedback from the medical community has been very positive.  We also recently received a CHMP positive opinion for RINVOQ with an approval decision in Europe expected in the next few months. In addition, we expect approval in Japan in the first quarter. We are making good progress with the development programs for RINVOQ in other immune mediated conditions as well.  We recently announced results from the first of our registrational trials in psoriatic arthritis, the SELECT PSA 2 study. In this study, which evaluated RINVOQ compared to placebo in psoriatic arthritis patients, who had an inadequate response to one or more biologic DMARDs, both doses of RINVOQ met all primary and key secondary endpoints. We are very encouraged by the strong levels of response on both joint and skin endpoints, including ACR responses and PASI measurements, as well as minimal disease activity scores in the heavily pretreated biologic refractory population. We look forward to presenting detailed results at a medical meeting next year.  We expect to see data from our second registrational trial, SELECT PSA 1 in the first half of next year with our regulatory submissions expected in mid-2020 and commercialization anticipated in 2021. At the ACR Meeting later this month, we will be presenting 26 abstracts for RINVOQ in rheumatic diseases including results from stage two study in ankylosing spondylitis.  In this study, RINVOQ met a primary and key secondary endpoints demonstrating significantly greater improvements in signs and symptoms, as well as physical function and imaging endpoints compared to placebo.  We plan to begin a Phase 3 study in Axial Spondyloarthritis in the coming months, an indication expansion that will further strengthen RINVOQ’s position within rheumatology. Both psoriatic arthritis and Axial Spondyloarthritis, our large and important markets in the rheumatology segment and our key areas of focus for AbbVie’s immunology portfolio.  In the Dermatology segment, we expect to see results from the first of RINVOQ’s registrational trials in atopic dermatitis in the first half of 2020. We continue to make great progress with SKYRIZI, as well. SKYRIZI was approved in its first indication psoriasis in the second quarter and the launch is going extremely well with its differentiated profile and quarterly administration resonating with both physicians and patients.  One important feature of SKYRIZI’s profile is its strong durability of response. We recently presented long-term data at the EADV Congress showing that after 2.5 years on treatment, SKYRIZI continues to provide high levels of efficacy as demonstrated by 61% of patients achieving PASI 100 or complete skin clearance.  Similar to RINVOQ, SKYRIZI is being developed in several additional indications. The Gastro segment in particular, represents a significant opportunity for SKYRIZI and the registrational programs in both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are progressing very well.  We expect to see data from a Phase 2b study in ulcerative colitis next year and data from the Phase 3 studies in crohn’s disease are expected in 2021.  Moving now to hematologic oncology, where we continue to make good progress advancing our programs and expanding the breadth of data for IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. We’ve made significant progress this year with IMBRUVICA in the frontline CLL setting. We received a label update to include data from ILLUMINATE study, which evaluated IMBRUVICA in combination with Gazyva in frontline CLL.  In addition, the NCCN guidelines were updated to include data from three important studies in our frontline CLL program. We also reported positive Phase 3 data in the watch and wait population and later this year, we plan to submit data for regulatory approval from the Phase 3 ECOG study in young and fit first-line patients.  An important element of our hem/onc strategy is our ongoing clinical program evaluating combination use of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA.  In the area of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we expect to see results from the Phase 3 SYMPATICO study next year, a trial evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA in relapsed refractory mantle cell lymphoma. We are also making good progress with the combination program in CLL. We expect to present data from a Phase 2 study in frontline CLL at the upcoming ASH Meeting and additional data from the Phase 3 program are expected in the next 12 to 18 months.  We continue to advance other programs in our hem/onc portfolio. We will see data next year from two confirmatory Phase 3 studies evaluating VENCLEXTA in frontline AML. And at the upcoming ASH Meeting, we will be presenting data from several early-stage programs including results from a Phase 2 study evaluating Navitoclax in myelofibrosis where we are seeing very encouraging data in patients who have failed Jakafi. High risk myelofibrosis is a serious hematologic disease in which bone marrow is replaced by fibrotic tissue interfering with bone marrow function. Current therapies attenuate signaling through the Jak-Stat pathway to address symptoms but are not disease modifying.  With Navitoclax, we are targeting the mutated clonal cells causing myelofibrosis for apoptosis through the BCL-xL and BcL-2 pathways, a unique approach offering the potential to modify the course of disease reverse fibrosis and restore hematopoiesis.  Navitoclax may also act to resensitize cells that have developed resistance through Jakafi, thus representing a potentially important treatment option for myelofibrosis patients. Also in the quarter, we submitted our regulator application for Elagolix in uterine fibroids with an approval decision expected in the second quarter of next year.  And in neuroscience, we recently presented data for ABBV-951 demonstrating its potential as a new treatment option for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease. ABBV-951 is a subcutaneous delivery system for our Levodopa/Carbidopa pro drugs, an innovative approach to treating motor fluctuations in Parkinson’s disease with the potential to provide DUOPA-like efficacy with a less invasive non-surgical delivery method.  If successful, ABBV-951 would represent a transformational improvement to current treatments with the potential to significantly broaden the addressable patient population beyond those treated with DUOPA today.  The Phase 3 program for ABBV-951 is underway and we look forward to updating you as the program progresses. So, in summary, we have continued to make very good progress advancing and accelerating our programs this year and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the coming months until 2020.  With that, I will turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Rob?
Rob Michael : Thank you, Mike. We had another quarter of strong performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.33, reflecting growth of 8.9% compared to prior year and $0.04 above our guidance midpoint. Net revenues were up 3.5% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Strong growth from several key products and newly launched assets offset the impact of international biosimilar competition. U.S. HUMIRA sales were $3.9 billion, up 9.6% compared to prior year with volume growth of 8.6% and a favorable price impact of 1%. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below 0.5 a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were approximately $1 billion, down 32% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and in line with our expectations. SKYRIZI continues to demonstrate strong uptake with sales of $91 million in the first full quarter following the launch in April. As Rick mentioned, we are pleased with the launch and – RINVOQ. Sales in the partial quarter were $14 million.  Hematologic oncology global sales were nearly $1.5 billion, up 38.5% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong growth of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were more than $1.2 billion, driven by strong share in all lines of therapy in CLL.  VENCLEXTA revenues were $221 million driven by continued share gains across all approved indications.  Global HCV revenues were approximately $700 million, down roughly 19% on an operational basis, driven by lower treated patient volumes in select international markets and increased competition within the U.S. managed Medicaid segment.  Despite the dynamics impacting performance this year, Mavyret remains the global leader in HCV therapy and we expect it to generate durable cash flow for AbbVie well into the next decade. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for Creon and Duodopa. Turning now to the P&L profile for the third quarter, adjusted gross margin was 82% of sales, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year, including a 140 basis point benefit related to the expiration of HUMIRA royalties, partially offset by the impact of partnership accounting. Adjusted R&D investment was 14.5% of sales supporting our pipeline programs on oncology, immunology and other areas. Adjusted SG&A expense was 19.1% of sales, reflecting continued investment in our on-market products and newly launched assets. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 48.4% of sales, an improvement of 120 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted net interest expense was $288 million and the adjusted tax rate was 8.8%. In the quarter, we recorded a net charge of $0.56 per share related to the impairment of intangible assets acquired as part of the Stemcentrx acquisition. The net after-tax impact of this impairment and the related adjustment to contingent consideration liabilities was $823 million. This net charge has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results.  Based on our continued strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $8.90 to $8.92, reflecting growth of 12.6% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $3.82 of known intangible amortization and specified items.  We are also increasing our revenue guidance for the full year and now expect growth of approximately 2.5% on an operational basis. At current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have approximately 1% unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth. This forecast comprehends the following updated full year assumptions. We now expect U.S. HUMIRA sales growth of approximately 8.5%. We continue to see a robust volume growth and maintain a strong leadership position across all segments. For international HUMIRA, at current exchange rates, we now expect sales to approach $4.3 billion representing an operational decline of approximately 28%.  We now expect SKYRIZI global revenues of approximately $275 million reflecting continued launch momentum. For our hem/onc franchise, we now expect IMBRUVICA global revenues approaching $4.7 billion with U.S. sales growth of approximately 28% and for VENCLEXTA, we now expect sales of approximately $775 million. We are now forecasting global HCV sales approaching $3 billion.  And on the P&L, we now forecast adjusted gross margin of approximately 82.5% of sales and adjusted operating margin to remain just above 47% of sales.  Finally, we now expect a non-GAAP tax rate just below our full year rate in 2018. All other full year 2019 guidance assumptions remain unchanged. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.17 and $2.19, excluding approximately $0.49 of non-cash amortization and other specified items.  We anticipate fourth quarter operational sales growth approaching 5%. At current rates, we expect a modest unfavorable foreign exchange impact.  As Rick mentioned earlier, today we announced a 10.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend beginning with the dividend payable in February 2020. The significant earnings in cash flows with the combination of AbbVie and Allergan will generate allow us to support a strong and growing dividend and rapidly reduce debt.  We continue to expect the combined company to achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2021. We are further deleveraging through 2023.  In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance and with our strong track record, combined with the momentum of our business, we remain well positioned to deliver top-tier financial performance in 2019 and beyond.  With that, I will turn the call back over to Liz. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Navin Jacob from UBS. 
Navin Jacob : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. A couple please. Number one, just want to understand how we should think about the psoriatic arthritis market for RINVOQ relative to RA. Same I guess for SKYRIZI. And on a relative basis, how big those opportunities could be?  And then four, with regards to IMBRUVICA, there has been some questions around AstraZeneca’s Calquence. They're going to be reporting some updated data at ASH. Wondering how you are thinking about the competitive landscape?  And then finally, just on the Allergan transaction, do you have an update on or when should we hear an update about the divestment of some of your assets. There is some questions around SKYRIZI versus brazikumab. So any clarity would be helpful. Thank you. 
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Hi, this is Rick. I think I’ll have Mike walk you through PSA and then, I’ll cover the Calquence question and I am going to have Laura talk a little bit about the status of the regulatory reviews for Allergan’s products. Michael?
Michael Severino: Okay. This is Mike. I’ll take the PSA question. The PSA segment is an important part of the overall other segments. I equate as large as RA but it makes a meaningful contribution, that and spondyloarthritis, axial spa it’s often referred to.  Those two components provide meaningful revenue in that area and as we announced earlier this week in the psoriatic arthritis study we had at this – we delivered very strong results which were completely in line with our expectations.  We had a very strong impact on both joint measures, on the ACR measures, on the skin measures, and on composite measures of minimal disease activity, which look across both joint and skin and show that we are getting a substantial proportion of patients with very high level of control.  So we think it’s a very, very substantial opportunity for RINVOQ in the long-term. We haven’t put a dollar on that market yet. But we do think it’s going to be a very important contributor to the overall RINVOQ profile.  SKYRIZI is doing very well and its initial indication of psoriasis. We have a psoriatic arthritis program underway. We think it’s important to show the benefit of SKYRIZI in a psoriatic arthritis setting. That’s not as advanced.  We don’t have those data readouts yet. But we would expect it to perform well in that setting as well based on Phase 2. So we think between the two we’ll really have a very strong portfolio in that important segment of the market. 
Rick Gonzalez: So, let me talk a little bit about the – and we got to talk about it maybe a little more broadly, the competitive environment around IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA are in the CLL setting. I think, certainly, as we look at Calquence being a BTK, we would certainly expect that it will have positive data and that we will be frankly surprised if it didn't have positive data in first-line.  I mean, obviously, IMBRUVICA have very impressive data and a large and comprehensive data and that will certainly play into the competitive dynamics. I think if you think about the competitive dynamics in this field, you need to think about it sort from two perspectives. What does the competition looks like today? And what’s the experience been against that competition?  And then, what way it looks like going forward for a competitor to be able to compete in this market in an effective way and I am specifically talking CLL now. So, Calquence has been in the market now for, I think about two years. It really has not been able to get a label that has any real differentiation. It has today and it’s a proved indication of MCL second-line plus about 14% share.  It had between 10% and 14% for quite some time. So, it’s kind of vacillated in that area for quite some time. Its current use in CLL is about 1% despite being on treatment guidelines I think since about 2018, and almost all of that 1% is in third-line plus, which gives you an idea of how physicians view it behind IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA.  If and when they get approval in first-line, I think it is important to remember or anybody to compete in this marketplace is, how the market operates today. If you look at IMBRUVICA’s share of treated patients and what I mean by that is, patients who are currently under active treatment today. IMBRUVICA’s first-line share of treated patients is 51%.  So, roughly half of the patients that are under treatment today are utilizing IMBRUVICA. Second-line plus is about 75%. So, three quarters of the patients who are under treatment right now are using IMBRUVICA. IMBRUVICA is treated to progression therapy. I don’t see physicians taking well-maintained patients off of IMBRUVICA and switching them to Calquence or anything else.  And if we were seeing that, the duration of therapy which is something we track, we’d be going down, but indeed it’s not. It’s stable to slightly increasing. So anyone that comes into this market will have to compete for share and will be limited to compete for share by only competing in the areas where you got new patients or you have failure patients.  And in the case of new patients or failure patients, they are also going to have to compete against VENCLEXTA in this market. And as you know, VENCLEXTA is recently been approved in first-line. We are about three months post that approval. If you look at VENCLEXTA’s new patient capture share in first-line, it’s 5% already. In second-line, it’s 10% and in third-line, it’s 21%.  So, I think the reality is, we fundamentally believe and I think many physicians believe that we have the two best assets for being able to treat CLL patients and provide them with long durations of disease-free intervals between VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA. So, if Calquence gets a first-line approval in CLL, that certainly gets some share.  But I would tell you that I feel highly confident in our position in this marketplace based on our performance, and based on the assets that we have. So, Laura? 
Laura Schumacher: Okay. With respect to the regulatory process, the regulatory process overall is proceeding well. We have filed for approval in all major jurisdictions. With respect specifically to the FTC, we received a second request for information at the end of September, which was not unexpected and we are working through those requests with the FTC.  We’ve also notified them of our intent today about two assets. One brazikumab, which is an IL-23 and the other Zenpep. We have a robust divestiture process ongoing right now with several interested parties. And I think as Rick said earlier, we remain optimistic of a first quarter 2020 closing. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, Navin. Operator, next question please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. 
Terence Flynn : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on all the launch progress. Maybe just two from me. I was wondering with respect to ex-U.S. SKYRIZI, looks to be off to a strong start there. Wondering any more color you can give us in terms of where sales are coming from and anything similar or different versus the U.S. launch?  And then, Rick, how should we think about U.S. HUMIRA pricing next year? Amgen had some comments earlier this week, but we’d be curious to hear your thoughts as well. Thank you. 
Rick Gonzalez: I think on an international SKYRIZI, you have to remember, we really only have reimbursement in a relatively small number of countries today. But that reimbursement process, that pricing reimbursement process is ongoing.  So you can expect it’s doing extremely well in the markets that it is in. But that’s going to expand significantly over the course of the next 12 months as we get pricing and reimbursement in additional countries.  I would expect SKYRIZI to perform reasonably consistently with what we are seeing in the U.S. and certainly in the western European markets. So, I think, there is a good opportunity there and we are excited about that opportunity.  Certainly, as it relates to HUMIRA pricing, we are obviously in the process of going through all of our managed care and I’d say, we are far into that pricing or that contracting process for 2020. I don’t view any significant change in the dynamics around HUMIRA pricing in 2020. It would be significantly different from what we’ve seen in 2019. 
Liz Shea: Thanks, Terrence. Operator, next question please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen . 
Steve Scala : Thank you. Congratulations on a very well executed quarter. Despite all the investor apprehension, HUMIRA foreign has beaten three quarters in a row. How is that success between regions? Were there are biosimilars and AbbVie is just delivering despite the pressure and regions where patents are still in force? So, that’s the first question.  And then, second, it seems like the Allergan closing might be earlier than generally thought, the company had been saying Q1, but in the release it says early 2020 which kind of implies January. So, what key steps have been achieved earlier than expected to allow for that earlier closing? Thank you. 
Rick Gonzalez: Yes, so, if you look at – you are correct, Steve. This is Rick. On OUS HUMIRA, if you go back to our guidance in the fourth quarter of last year, we guided to overall erosion at about 30%. As Rob said in his comments, our forecast now is that that erosion will come in at about 28%. So, slightly lower than what we expect and you’ve seen that in each of the quarters. As you indicated, we’ve overachieved.  I would say, the bulk of that is slightly better performance in the areas where biosimilars are impacting the market. There is a portion of it, that’s a little better performance in the other market as well. But the majority of it is driven by stabilization of pricing in those markets at a level that came earlier than we would have expected.  As far as the closing is concerned, I don’t think we were trying to telegraph an earlier date, if that’s how the market interpreted it. We are making good progress on the Allergan closing. Integration activities are going extremely well. We are obviously managing that very tightly. As Laura indicated a few minutes ago, the regulatory processes are advancing.  But we’d like to stay with the current guidance that we’ve had and that is a first quarter close. Obviously, we’d like to close it as rapidly as we can and we are pursuing that activity to get that done. But at this point, I wouldn’t want to change what the original guidance was. So, that’s how it was interpreted. That was not our intent. 
Steve Scala : Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi. 
Andrew Baum : Thank you. Couple of questions please. First, on Washington, obviously, it’s very dynamic, but the Senate’s Finance Committee proposal probably has more legs than most. Within that, there is a proposal to fund the cap and out-of-pocket spend through funding of the catastrophic coverage periods from both pharma as well as the planned sponsors.  Thinking about IMBRUVICA, how do you balance the impact of that? I am thinking on the positive side of increased volumes due to compliance adherence versus a negative of both the direct hit to net revenues, but also the indirect hit from payers playing you off against competitors, including Calquence in order to claw back economics.  The second question is on rheumatic arthritis. So both Novartis and Lilly have failed to show ACR-20 improvements in front-line setting versus HUMIRA given your waiting date to next year for your trial, are you confident that RINVOQ will enable you to do that?  I know it’s dangerous making cross-trial comparisons in the second-line from what you presented today doesn’t necessary provide significant reassurance. But I am interested in that.  And then finally, could you comment on the infection rates that you saw with RINVOQ in the 30 milligram of the psoriatic arthritis trial versus placebo? Many thanks. 
Rick Gonzalez: Andrew, this is Rick. I’ll cover the first one and I will have Mike cover the other two. Certainly, as you indicated, the situation is still pretty dynamic. Although, I’d say, it’s a little lighter over the last month or two. They had been across the summer. But I still think there is a lot of interest and a lot of activity that’s still going to continue to look at ways to try to open up access and affordability, particularly in the Medicare population.  And I think that’s appropriate and I would tell you, we as a company support that. We do believe we need to make medicines more affordable to Part-D patients. The Senate Finance Bill goes in a direction and I think it’s helpful. It takes those out-of-pocket costs down from where they are today on a therapy like IMBRUVICA or even a therapy like HUMIRA as an example.  It takes them down fairly significantly to an out-of-pocket cost. It’s about $3,000 or $3,100. I would say, we still fundamentally believe that’s too high for most Medicare patients. The average Medicare patient has an income of $2,600. We think it needs to be more in the neighborhood of something below $2,000 and our government affairs people are working to try to articulate that position.  The other issue with it is, there is still front-end loaded in the year. So from a cash flow standpoint, the patient has to come up with that $3,100 in the first two months, typically the first three months and most of these individuals don't have that kind of cash flow.  So, coming up with a structure that will allow it to be spread across the full year would be certainly a more reasonable approach to allow those patients’ affordability. As it relates to the funding in the catastrophic area, certainly, if you look and trying to make these drugs more affordable to patients and have broader access, someone has to pay for that. And certainly, I can't speak for the entire industry. But I can speak for AbbVie. We have said and I testified at the Senate Finance Committee, I said we are willing to step-up and cover more of that cost.  Healthcare plans have to pay more of the cost and obviously the government needs to pay a piece of that as well. It moves in that direction, although I will say, the way they structured it so far, it is more punitive or more costly to companies that have more innovative therapies and it actually gives a benefit to certain companies who have drugs where the total cost would be below $6,000 per year.  I don't think that was the intent, I doubt seriously. They were trying to give a benefit to any specific company. So, really looking at where that threshold is and the overall percentage in the catastrophic base is something that would be an important aspect of modification to this bill. But I'd say, it moves in the right direction. Specifically, the answer your question about volume, we have looked carefully not just to move it up across our entire portfolio. We do believe there will be some volume increase. Net-net, I can tell you the volume isn't enough to offset the overall cost.  But I think in the grand scheme of where we want to go with this, I think this is a reasonable approach and with some modifications, I think you could have a meaningful impact on the issue and potentially put the debate to rest. So, it's something that with modifications I am supportive of it.
Michael Severino: Thanks. This is Mike. I'll take the question on psoriatic arthritis. One thing that's important to keep in mind is that the study that we just released is in a bio IR population. And in fact, it was in a pretty heavily pre-treated bio IR population where a number of patients had failed two or three prior biologic DMARDs despite that we drove very high levels of response at the ACR-20 level and at higher levels on the joint endpoints.  And if you look at the placebo subtracted differences, they are entirely in line with our expectations. So, these data would increase our confidence in the overall program and our ability to hit our marks in the second study which includes not only the head-to-head comparison, but also the structural endpoint. The second thing that I would add is that that second study is a very large and robust study because it has a structural endpoint. So it's very well powered to show the effects that we would expect to see. So we remain confident in the head-to-head and in our overall psoriatic arthritis program. And then, on the third part of your question with respect to infection rates, in the data that we just released in psoriatic arthritis, we did see numerically higher rates of infections and serious infections in the 30 milligram dose. That's not uncommon in a therapeutic immunomodulator class.  This is our first study. We are going to have to see how that second study plays out, not only with respect to the safety parameters, but also with respect to the dose response that we see or do not see across doses on the joints and other endpoints and we'll make a determination of the most appropriate dose to carry forward based on that complete dataset as we did in RA.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Andrew. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink.
Geoff Porges : Thank you very much and I appreciate the questions. Congratulations on the strong results. Two questions if I may. First, on VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA, could you give us a sense of whether you really think significant volume of CLL patients could really be treated with a non-chemo, non-CD 20 regimen? And how are you thinking about the duration of VENCLEXTA in that setting, because it could be potentially transformational? And then, Rick, could you just talk a little bit about capital allocation? I am sure there is some relief out there that the dividend went up. Now you are getting close to closing the Allergan transaction. Could you talk about how confident you feel about the outlook for the dividend and your ability to continue the long record of dividend increases? Thanks.
Michael Severino: This is Mike. I'll take the first part of your question on VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA combination used in CLL. I mean, we do think there is a very meaningful opportunity there. When you look at the CLL population, it's a heterogeneous group and that ranges from patients who develop CLL later in life and have a number of co-morbidities.  Those patients today tend to receive rich progression therapy with IMBRUVICA. We are seeing that shift very strongly as we've released those IMBRUVICA data. But there are other patients, patients who developed CLL earlier in life, patients who had less co-morbid illness, who are interested in treatment intensification and getting very, very deep responses.  And for those patients in particular, the VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA combination, I think is very compelling based on the data that we've generated to-date. We see very deep responses. We'd expect that to translate into long disease-free intervals and we think it's a therapy that will be an important treatment option. With respect to the specific duration, that's going to be tailored based on the data to individual settings. But those combination regimens do tend to have fixed duration therapy.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Hi, this is Rick. I'll take the capital allocation question. Let me start maybe with more broadly about capital allocation. We have basically three priorities when we look at capital allocation. We want to invest in the business. We want to continue to drive a strong and growing dividend and we want to pay down debt. And those are the priorities for us.  We have a debt pay down plan that we have put in place that’s consistent with the objectives that Rob indicated in his formal comments and that will be something that we will absolutely drive towards. Now we are fortunate that we are in a business that generates a tremendous amount of cash flow in the combination of Allergan and AbbVie together will generate very, very significant cash flow.  And so, we have the luxury that we are able to do both. And we certainly would not have increased our dividend double-digit now if we had any concerns about that going forward. So, I can tell you we are committed to a strong and growing dividend and we are committed to paying down debt and we have the ability to be able to do both.  And I think the dividend increase that we are announcing today is a reflection of our confidence in that cash flow generation.
Geoff Porges : Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks Geoffrey. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson : Thank you. Going back to Astra's Calquence, if that product is able to show differentiation either on side-by-side analysis to your product or in the head-to-head that reports out next year, where does that come? And what form does that come? Is that likely to be efficacy or on safety?  And I understand the commercial dynamics still might keep them on the sidelines, but in terms of what the clinical data shows with these next-gen products like Calquence, if it were to be better, where would that be? And then, a second question on Allergan, obviously the lead asset is Botox. Wondering if you can give us some indication of your view of the product’s durability over an extended period of time and your long-range planning assumptions, send it off competition well in the past.  There is obviously certain new threats on market now, what is your long range planning assume? Is it continued positive growth through the next decade at about the same rate for example?
Rick Gonzalez: Okay, Mike?
Michael Severino: So this is Mike. I'll take the first part on Calquence. We really wouldn't expect to see differentiation on efficacy or safety, based on our look at the data. We understand the positioning that that some of the follow-on BTK inhibitors have put forward. But when we look at the data, they look like me-toos as Rick has said.  If you look at like-for-like data in second-line CLL, for example, which is the only indication where they have publicly available Phase 3 data and you line that up against our Phase 3 data. If you look at response measures, they look very, very similar. And that's despite the fact that in the assorted of study they had a median number of prior therapies at one prior therapy and we had a median number of three prior therapies.  So, a much more heavily treated patient population and yet the same efficacy results. So that's not indicative of likely differentiation in our mind and you wouldn't expect that based on mechanism of action. It's a BTK inhibitor. And when you look at safety, that story has evolved as well. It started off as no bleeding and no afib because now we see both of those in their label and those events are showing up in their larger scale clinical trials, as well. And if you go back to that same study comparison that I talked about, you see rates that they fit that actually looks pretty similar if you look at corresponding time points.  So we don't really see differentiation there either. I mean, it's important to keep in mind that labels evolve over time. If you look at how our label has evolved, as we have unblinded multiple large Phase III trials and also accumulated extensive post-marketing experience, things get added to your label and that's the natural course of a product's lifecycle over time.  If you look at their label today, compared to IMBRUVICA's label at a corresponding time point, they look pretty similar. So, to our eyes, these look like me-toos and we wouldn't expect to see that differentiation.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. This is Rick. Tim, I'll answer your second question about Botox. And I am getting answer it in the backdrop of the work that we did as it relates to the acquisition, the market research that we did leading up to the acquisition. So we look carefully at Botox and the durability of Botox. It's an important product for Allergan.  And I would tell you the Allergan organization I think has done an outstanding job with Botox. But if you look at competition, it comes in two forms or potentially it can come in two forms. One, other branded toxins, which is what they've experienced thus far and we expect to see more other branded toxins.  And I would tell you that what the market research clearly told us is that the brand equity of Botox in the channels that they operate is so strong that it is extremely difficult for those practices to operate without offering Botox, because many patients when they walk in the door, ask for it by name.  And so because of that, they have a bundling program that has been extremely effective and being able to manage the competitive dynamics around this asset quite well.  And in fact, I would say as we built our model for the Allergan transaction, we’ve built and we've said this a number of times. We've built a fairly conservative model and we did that across virtually every single product. And so, our model is more conservative than what the Allergan current performance is and it’s certainly more conservative than their longer range forecast. But it still does project growth for Botox going forward. I would say we've watched the quarterly performance last quarter and Botox despite the fact that there was a lot of speculation. The competition was going to have a big impact, Botox performed very, very well. We'll see their performance here soon.  But I would expect that Botox will continue to perform very well. And so, I think that organization deserves a lot of credit for the way they have handled the competition and the way they continued to grow this brand quite well. The second aspect as you have to look at as it relates to Botox is whether or not you are going to see any biosimilars for Botox and we've talked to investors in quite a bit of detail around here.  But the short answer is, based on the uniqueness of this particular molecule, we have come to the conclusion there would be extremely difficult to create a biosimilar version of Botox and I would tell you, we looked at this very extensively with a lot of outside expertise and we feel very confident that that's the case. So, that was a long answer to basically say to you, we feel good about Botox. We feel good about our ability to be able to continue to grow Botox both in the aesthetics area, as well as the therapeutic area. And I think all of the data thus far only further supports our confidence.
Tim Anderson : Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question is from Dave Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger : Thank you very much. So obviously the results were quite impressive. I just had a question on the gross margin. So that was down slightly sequentially to 82.0%. Could you just comment on that? And the outlook for AbbVie's gross margin? Second, with respect to a comment you made earlier, Rick, you said that RINVOQ is capturing 6% of in-play RA patients. I was wondering if you have the SKYRIZI in-play psoriasis patient percentage as well.  And then finally, with respect to IMBRUVICA, there was a recent Blood article on the product's link with hypertension. Could you just comment on that? And talk a little bit about how you are managing that? Thank you.
Rob Michael: David. So this is Rob. I'll take your first question. So if you look at our year-to-date gross margin profile, we are at 82.7%. I have given guidance of approximately 82.5% for the year. The key thing to keep in mind within a particular quarter, you will have sales mix and it can be more pronounced and more pronounced impact on gross margin profile.  In Q3, we saw stronger sales from partnered products like IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, as well as the seasonal impact of Synagis. But keep in mind that we also share expenses with our partners for IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. So that gross margin impact was offset in our expense profile. So as a result, you can see that we've exceeded our guidance on the operating margin profile this quarter.  We just achieved an all-time high at 48.4%. So it's really important when you think about those partnered products to be really focused on operating margin, as opposed to just gross margin.
Rick Gonzalez: And then David, this is Rick. On SKYRIZI, the in-place psoriasis share for SKYRIZI is over 20%, right now and growing pretty rapidly.
Michael Severino: And this is Mike. I'll take the IMBRUVICA question regarding hypertension. So hypertension has been seen with clinical uses in IMBRUVICA and other BTK inhibitors and obviously, we believe that it's important to pay close attention to patient safety and then it needs to be managed effectively. And we think it is managed very effectively both in clinical practice and in our clinical trial programs.  If you look at the overall benefit risk profile, it’s very strong. We have released data from a number of Phase 3 studies across a wide range of settings and that benefit risk profile comes, I think very clearly in all of our data. So we are very confident in the overall profile of the molecule and we are managing hypertension I think quite effectively.
David Risinger : Great, thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, David. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: And I am showing no further questions at this time.
Liz Shea: Okay, thanks a lot. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-26 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; and Rob Michael, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Laura Schumacher, Vice Chairman, External Affairs Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary will join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statement. Additional information about the these risks and uncertainties is included in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our second quarter performance and highlights as well as our full year guidance which we are raising again this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D programs and Rob will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, we'll take your questions. AbbVie once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2.26, representing growth of 13% versus last year exceeding our guidance. Total revenues of more than $8.2 billion was also ahead of our expectations for the quarter with several key products contributing to that growth. We saw excellent performance from our hematological oncology business with global operational sales growth of nearly 40%. IMBRUVICA is performing exceptionally well with robust share growth across multiple lines of therapy in CLL including new patient share of approximately 35% in the frontline setting, up approximately 10 share points over the past year. This strong momentum directly relates to the growing body of clinical evidence, label augmentation, and recently updated treatment guidelines which now position IMBRUVICA as the only preferred therapy in the frontline CLL market. VENCLEXTA also continues to make very good progress in the broad relapsed/refractory CLL setting and has established a strong growth trajectory in the recently approved indications for first-line CLL and AML. U.S. HUMIRA grew more than 7.5% versus last year driven by continued strong volume growth across all segments. And despite a very competitive environment, HUMIRA remains the market leader across each of the three primary categories; rheum, derm, and gastro. During the quarter, we also announced our ninth global settlement agreement resolving all IP-related litigation with BI over their biosimilar HUMIRA. This final settlement agreement reinforces our confidence that we will not see direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until 2023. International HUMIRA sales were down 31% on an operational basis, reflecting the impact of direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other international markets. The international biosimilar trends and dynamics remain consistent with our expectations. And SKYRIZI, our recently approved treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis is performing significantly above our expectations, contributing nearly $50 million in revenue this quarter. The launch is going extremely well. We are seeing strong prescription volume well above recent launch analogs in the psoriasis category. Through the first 11 weeks of launch, we already have approximately 1,700 prescribing physicians and approximately 3,750 patients have been treated with SKYRIZI including those in our bridge access program. We're extremely encouraged by this uptake which supports our continued confidence in the asset. Commercial access for SKYRIZI is also tracking in line with our expectations. As a result of the launch progress and the momentum, we are increasing our full year guidance for SKYRIZI and now expect full year global sales of approximately $250 million. The outlook for SKYRIZI remains very strong and it represents a significant long-term opportunity for AbbVie with multibillion-dollar peak sales potential. We're also very pleased with our overall commercial performance and financial results for the quarter. We remain well-positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth once again in 2019. As noted in our earnings release we are raising our full year 2019 EPS guidance and now expect adjusted earnings between $8.82 and $8.92 reflecting growth of 12.1% at the midpoint which is at the very top of the expectations for our peer group. Clearly, this is an extremely exciting time for AbbVie. Before I turn the call over to Mike and Rob, I want to speak briefly about our proposed acquisition of Allergan and the progress we are making. We've had an opportunity to speak with many investors over the past several weeks since the announcement to share the strategic rationale for the transaction and our outreach with investors will continue as we have a number of opportunities to engage with shareholders in the coming months. The integration planning is already underway and we are working to ensure a seamless transition on day one. We've identified individuals within AbbVie that will lead the integration process and there will be dedicated teams to ensure there is no disruption to our strong momentum. And finally I'll be meeting with the Allergan employees in the coming weeks. I look forward to engaging with and ultimately welcoming this experienced and very talented organization into AbbVie. We remain incredibly excited about the transaction which has significant strategic merit. The acquisition represents a unique opportunity for AbbVie to accelerate our non-HUMIRA business, the AbbVie growth platform by adding highly valuable on-market assets with leadership positions across attractive growth segments. AbbVie's new growth platform will achieve stand-alone scale immediately with sales of more than $30 billion in 2020 and top-tier growth prospects. And it will enable enhanced funding of our innovative R&D platform and provide ample resource for additional pipeline expansion which remains the core focus for AbbVie. The combination of AbbVie and Allergan will also unlock significant value for our shareholders as we've outlined. The transaction delivers immediate robust financial benefits with EPS accretion of 10% in the first full year of combination increasing to above 20% at peak. This is inclusive of more than $2 billion in annual pre-tax synergies and cost savings which is expected in the third year post-closing.  This combination also provides significant additional earnings in the period following the loss of HUMIRA exclusivity. And the transaction provides enhanced cash flow to support a strong and growing dividend while rapidly paying down debt and continuing to invest in our innovative pipeline through increased R&D funding and the acquisition of mid to late-stage assets. And finally, we're actively seeking the relevant approvals for the transaction and are working towards our stated goal for closing in the first quarter of 2020. In summary, we're extremely pleased with our outperformance in the quarter and with the continued strong momentum of our business leading to another increase in our expectations for 2019. Since 2013, we have built a strong foundation through outstanding execution and the advancement of our robust pipeline of new innovative medicines. Looking back, we have delivered 16 quarters of double-digit earnings growth and have consistently been among the peer group leaders for revenue and EPS growth.  We've launched 13 new products for major indications which have and will continue to contribute considerably to our growth. While this level of consistent performance is truly exceptional, especially given the challenges which inevitably arise in a large complex business like ours the key to long-term sustainable strong performance has always been forward planning. And Allergan represents another example of our proactive planning to ensure we will continue to deliver top-tier performance into the next decade. Our strong track record of execution combined with the momentum of our business gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue to successfully execute on our long-term strategy and deliver outstanding shareholder value going forward. With that I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. We had another productive quarter with continued progress across all stages of our pipeline. In the area of hematologic oncology, we received FDA approval in May for VENCLEXTA in combination with GAZYVA for previously untreated patients with CLL. This marks another major milestone for the VENCLEXTA program and illustrates its growing utility across CLL patient populations. The frontline CLL indication is the fourth approval for VENCLEXTA and was based on data from the Phase 3 CLL14 study which were reviewed under the FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review program and led to approval in just over two months following submission. The CLL14 data demonstrated that VENCLEXTA plus GAZYVA significantly prolonged progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated CLL compared to a combination of GAZYVA plus chlorambucil reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 67%. The VENCLEXTA combination also achieved significantly higher rates of complete response and minimal residual disease negativity versus the comparator regimen. At the recent EHA meeting, we presented detailed results from the BELLINI study, evaluating VENCLEXTA in combination with Velcade and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. In a subpopulation of patients with a t (11;14) translocation treatment with the VENCLEXTA combination resulted in an observed 89% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death. Following consultation with the FDA, we recently resumed the CANOVA study, our registration-enabling trial in this biomarker-defined patient population. Based on the data generated today, we believe there is a role for VENCLEXTA in this patient group, which represents roughly 20% of the multiple myeloma population. We expect data from the Phase 3 CANOVA trial in the 2021 time frame. Moving now to IMBRUVICA, where we continue to build the body of evidence supporting IMBRUVICA across various patient segments in CLL as well as in other blood cancers. Results from the CLL12 study a placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial designed to evaluate IMBRUVICA versus no treatment in the asymptomatic watch-and-wait population were presented at the recent EHA meeting. In this early CLL population, current standard of care has been observation rather than therapeutic intervention. However, we believe there are patients with high-risk features within this segment who may benefit from treatment with IMBRUVICA. Data from the CLL12 trial showed that treatment with IMBRUVICA significantly improved event-free survival, progression-free survival and time to next treatment in patients with treatment-naive early-stage CLL when compared to placebo. Importantly, safety results from the study demonstrated that most adverse events were seen at similar rates between IMBRUVICA and placebo with the exception of atrial fibrillation, bleeding and hypertensive disorders, which we believe to be on-target BTK effects. We are encouraged with this data as they further illustrate IMBRUVICA's potential in patients who typically don't receive treatment today. In the area of solid tumors, we recently completed the Phase 3 study evaluating veliparib in BRCA-mutated breast cancer as well as the Phase 3 study in ovarian cancer, which is being run in collaboration with the gynecologic oncology group. In both studies, veliparib achieved the primary endpoint of progression-free survival and safety was consistent with that observed in the previously reported studies. We are continuing to analyze the data from these two studies and plan to discuss the findings with regulators to determine if they are sufficient for registration. Detailed results from both studies will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. Now moving to immunology. We continue to make great progress with our two late-stage assets SKYRIZI and upadacitinib as well as with our early-stage immunology assets. Early in the second quarter, we received U.S. and European approvals for SKYRIZI in psoriasis and we anticipate an FDA decision in the coming weeks for upadacitinib in its initial indication of rheumatoid arthritis. We believe both of our next-generation therapies have proven to be differentiated assets in their respective initial indications and have the potential to be best-in-category medicines across more than a dozen diseases. We expect data readouts from several follow-on indications over the next 12 months to 18 months and we look forward to providing updates as these programs progress. And while we believe SKYRIZI and upadacitinib will set new standards across a broad range of indications, we believe we can push the standard of care even higher with our early-stage programs which include ABBV-599 our JAK-BTK inhibitor combination in Phase 2 for RA with proof-of-concept data expected last year and beginning Phase 2 in lupus later this year; ABBV-323 our CD40 antagonist in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis with proof-of-concept data expected next year and beginning Phase 2 in Sjogren's syndrome later this year; and our TNF steroid conjugate program where early clinical work is ongoing and proof-of-concept data are expected next year as well. In the area of women's health, we expect to submit our regulatory application for elagolix in uterine fibroids in the coming days. Many women with uterine fibroids suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding and painful periods and elagolix has demonstrated the potential to become an important new treatment option for the large number of women suffering from this disease. This regulatory submission will mark another major milestone in our elagolix development program, and we look forward to bringing this innovative new medicine to the market once approved next year. And lastly, a few updates in the areas of -- in the area of neuroscience. We recently made the decision to stop the Phase 2 study for ABBV-8E12 in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy or PSP following a futility analysis showing that AB 12 did not demonstrate the efficacy we had hoped for in PSP patients. Alzheimer's disease and PSP differ in a number of important ways including the genetic background in which they occur and the distribution and potentially the nature of TAL pathology. Therefore, the ongoing Phase II study in Alzheimer's disease will continue as planned. Also in the quarter, we began the Phase III program to support the registration of ABBV-951, our innovative subcutaneous Levodopa/Carbidopa delivery system. In summary, we've seen tremendous progress across all stages of our pipeline in the first half of the year and we remain on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2019. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our second quarter performance. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thanks Mike. As Rick mentioned, we had another quarter of strong performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.26, reflecting growth of 13% compared to prior year and $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. For the second quarter, net revenues were up 1.5% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Strong growth from several key products offset the impact of international biosimilar competition. U.S. HUMIRA sales were $3.8 billion, up 7.7% compared to prior year with volume growth of approximately 7% and a modest positive price impact. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below 0.5 month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were approximately $1.1 billion, down 31% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets and in line with our expectations. As Rick previously mentioned, we are extremely pleased with the performance of SKYRIZI, with sales of $48 million in the quarter. Hematologic oncology global sales were nearly $1.3 billion, up 39.1% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong growth of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were $1.1 billion, primarily driven by continued uptake in the frontline CLL segment. In CLL, IMBRUVICA remains the market leader across all lines of therapy with new patient share of approximately 35% in the frontline setting. VENCLEXTA revenues were $169 million, driven by continued progress in the broad relapsed refractory CLL segment and our recent approval is for frontline CLL and AML. We've seen market share gains across all approved indications including AML, where the launch is exceeding our expectations. Global HCV revenues were $784 million in the quarter, down approximately 17% on an operational basis, mainly driven by lower treated patient volumes in select international markets. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for both Duodopa and Creon. Turning now to the P&L profile for the second quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 82.7% of sales, up 220 basis points compared to the prior year including a 290 basis point benefit related to expiration of HUMIRA royalties, partially offset by the impact of partnership accounting. Adjusted R&D investment was 14.9% of sales supporting our pipeline programs on oncology, immunology and other areas. Adjusted SG&A expense was 19.6% of sales, consistent with our expectations. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 48.2% of sales, an improvement of 290 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted net interest expense was $302 million and the adjusted tax rate was 8.7%. In the quarter, we recorded a specified charge of $1.55 per share for the contingent consideration increase related to SKYRIZI future milestone and royalty payments. This non-cash charge includes the impact of both a higher risk-adjusted cash flow forecast following the recent regulatory approvals for SKYRIZI as well as lower discount rates. As mentioned earlier, based on our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $8.82 to $8.92, reflecting growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $3.13 of known intangible amortization and specified items. We are also increasing our revenue guidance for the full year and now expect growth of approximately 2% on an operational basis. At current rates, we continue to expect foreign exchange to have approximately 1% unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth. Included in this guidance are the following assumptions for our key products. We now expect U.S. HUMIRA sales growth approaching 80%. We continue to see a robust volume growth and maintain a strong leadership position across all segments. For our hem/onc franchise, we now expect global revenues of approximately $5.3 billion. This includes IMBRUVICA global revenues of approximately $4.6 billion with U.S. sales growth of approximately 27%. For SKYRIZI, as Rick mentioned, we now expect global revenues of approximately $250 million. We're now forecasting global HCV sales approaching $3.1 billion, which we expect to be split evenly between U.S. and international. And for ORILISSA, we now forecast sales to be approximately $100 million. We are still in the early stage of market development. And while the launch ramp is slower than initially expected, we continue to believe ORILISSA will be a significant long-term opportunity for AbbVie. All other full year 2019 forecast assumptions for our key products remain unchanged. Turning now to the P&L for 2019. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $1.2 billion. All other full year 2019 guidance assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.28 and $2.30 excluding approximately $0.43 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. We anticipate third quarter adjusted revenue of approximately $8.4 billion. At current rates, we expect a modest unfavorable foreign exchange impact. For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales growth of approximately 8%. We expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $1 billion, assuming current exchange rates. And for IMBRUVICA we expect global sales of approximately $1.2 billion. Moving now to the P&L for the third quarter, we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 48%, and we expect the adjusted tax rate to be in line with our full year guidance, which is just above our 2018 rate. In summary, AbbVie has delivered another excellent quarter with results well ahead of our expectations. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of 2019 putting us in a strong position to once again deliver top-tier earnings growth. And with that I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Rob. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: Thank you. I have two questions. Rick in Q1 you warned us that SKYRIZI was unlikely to have meaningful sales in Q2 and today you delivered one of the biggest launch numbers in my memory. So what is going on? What has been better than expected? So that's the first question. And the second question is the fact that it appears there will not be upadacitinib AdCom, could be great news or a bit troubling. Great, if approval is going to be an FDA rubber stamp and troubling if it implies the FDA is unlikely to approve the drug on August 19. So any perspective on what's going on with the regulators would be helpful. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. All right, Steve. I'll cover the first question and Mike will cover the second one. I would say, we have been extremely pleased with the market reaction to SKYRIZI. I think it's a clear demonstration as to the value of this asset in the marketplace, the higher level of efficacy, and the other attributes of the product. And so I think it has clearly beaten the expectations that we have, and have gotten there much faster than we would've expected it to get to this level of performance. I mean, it's truly outperforming all of the analogs that are out there in this category. I think one of the more impressive numbers from our perspective is, if you look at the in-play share, which we define in-play share to be naive patients plus all switching patients SKYRIZI after 10 or 11 weeks has already achieved 24% of the in-play share. And to put that in perspective prior to the launch HUMIRA was at 28%. So it's almost to the level of what HUMIRA was as the market leader in that category. And interestingly enough about 75% or a little more than 75% of that volume is coming from other biologics. We've only seen HUMIRA trend down slightly from that. So it's clear that SKYRIZI is capturing significant competitive opportunities in the marketplace. So, I mean, I think we're obviously pleased with it. It's reinforcing the expectations that we had long-term for the drug and I think we'll get to the ramp much faster than we had expected. So it's great news from our perspective. Mike?
Michael Severino: So, this is Mike. I'll take the question on upa. So we submitted upa in late December of last year under a six plus two review clock. So we're pretty far along in the review process. We have said in the past and it continues to be true that we do not expect an Advisory Committee. We feel good about the performance of upa both from an efficacy and a benefit/risk perceptive across the program and we do not have any concerns about approvability.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Geoff Porges from SVB Leerink.
Geoff Porges: Thank you very much for taking the question. Just a couple of things Rick that have come up since the deal was announced. Could you comment on whether AbbVie has any opioid liability flowing through from legacy Abbott? And then secondly could you talk a little bit about the percentage of your revenue that comes from Part B and Part D and your view on the Grassley-Wyden bill? It seems to be getting bipartisan support. So what effect would that have on your business outlook? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: All right. Great. So I'm going to have Laura answer the first question and then Rob and I will cover the second one.
Laura Schumacher: Okay. With respect specifically to opioid liability flowing through we do not have any liability for opioid relating to Abbott's co-promotion with Purdue Pharma.
Geoff Porges: Great. Thanks.
Laura Schumacher: Yes.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So maybe let me talk first about the Senate proposal that is out. I'd say from the standpoint of -- as we've said in the past, we're obviously very supportive of anything that lowers patients' out-of-pocket costs. I mean I think one of the most significant challenges that we face in the U.S. is that the way the Part D design was built originally it didn't necessarily envision the level of specialized medicine it would develop over time, and the out-of-pocket cost for patients made many of those drugs unaffordable for the average senior. And so anything we can do to reduce that, I think is a positive for the industry and it's certainly a positive for patients and we think that's a big plus. The Senate bill will reduce out-of-pocket costs to some extent. I think the question is, is it enough? Can patients really afford the $3,100 of out-of-pocket cost, the average patient on Medicare? I think that's an important question to be debated. The second thing that I think is important to be debated is, it's still very front-end loaded for the patient, meaning in the first few months of the year, they have to come up with the $3,100. And that's difficult for many of these patients to be able to do from a cash flow standpoint, have the ability to be able to do that. So we would be looking to try to advocate for something that would spread that out across the year to make it more affordable on a monthly basis for these patients. And I think that's an important debate that should occur as we go forward. I would say, there are some aspects of the legislation that we believe are punitive, particularly the innovation-driven companies. And clearly, it does give benefit to some other companies that don't have specialty products that get into the catastrophic phase. And so, I don't know that that was the intent that companies should pay lower than what they pay today. I doubt that was the intent. But that is the nature of the way it’s structured today, and I think that's something that ought to be debated and discussed. But, it's a long road from here as you know. This will be debated and worked through. These kinds of legislations are complex and they take time, and there'll be likely extensive changes that occur to the draft legislation. But I think, the merit of going after things that reduce patient out-of-pockets, I think is a good thing. It's a bit premature at this point to start understanding or projecting what the impact would be on AbbVie's business. I think anything we can do to lower out-of-pocket costs will obviously drive some level of increased volume and that has to be taken into consideration, but there's a lot of things that will be worked on between now and the time anything ultimately gets implemented. And then, as far as the percentage of business, I'm going to have Rob cover that.
Rob Michael: Yeah. This is Rob. So Part D is about 20% of our U.S. sales or 14% of our global sales. Part B is very small less than 1% of our sales.
Geoff Porges: Great. Thanks very much.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Jason Gerberry with Bank of America.
Jason Gerberry: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First I just wanted to follow-up on Geoff's question actually. This idea around the Purdue co-promote, because Abbott seems to be saying something different about where that liability could fall. So, is your comment that AbbVie does not have any liability, is it really just on the fact that the issue is just not ripe yet, and it's just premised on so many hypotheticals that you don't want to cause fire or characterize that as a liability? So, just trying to understand if that's really it or if you guys have fundamental differences around the separation agreement when AbbVie spun off in 2013. And then my second question just on upadacitinib. If approved, how quickly do you think that drug could replicate the early commercial success of SKYRIZI that we've seen so far? And if you can frame any of the critical variables in the labeling determination that you think would facilitate that sort of outcome. Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Jason, this is Rick. So on the first one, look, what we're describing to you is essentially our view, and I think our view is consistent with the language of the agreements of where the liability would fall. And just like any other company, I'm not going to speak for another company's liability. They should speak for it themselves, but what we're telling you is that it's not an AbbVie liability. I don't know how much clearer I can be than that. The second one is the -- on upa. Obviously, upa is a drug that was built around the same kind of premise that we looked at SKYRIZI. We were looking for an asset that could outperform HUMIRA that could demonstrate superiority to HUMIRA. It's obviously an oral delivery, which is an advantage from a patient standpoint. And it's demonstrated outstanding efficacy in clinical performance. So we would expect it to be able to -- whether it can replicate exactly what SKYRIZI is doing or not, we will certainly put it in a position to be able to do that. And I don't think there's another more confident organization to be able to launch a product like upadacitinib or SKYRIZI than we are. And so, I think clearly, we will be able to drive this asset to achieve its maximum level of performance. And I can tell you that obviously we're very excited about SKYRIZI and how it's performing and it's certainly meeting or beating our expectations, which is a good thing. And I think I'm equally excited about upadacitinib, when I looked at the clinical performance of that asset and the attributes of that asset. So we like to get it on the market and go out there and launch the product and get it into the marketplace as quickly as possible.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Stephen. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.
Navin Jacob: Hi, Thanks for taking my questions. A couple if I may. Rick, wondering if you could comment on what the potential is for international reference pricing proposals that are potentially out there from -- perhaps coming from the Trump administration. If that's feasible in any way to be pushed over to Part D, obviously the focus has been Part B, but there's also been discussion that it could be pushed over to Part D. Is that feasible in any way in your mind? And then just on upa, all the data we've seen thus far looks incredibly differentiated versus the other JAKs in terms of safety, but wondering just from a regulatory standpoint, if the agency has a view around the class as a whole. Do they distinguish the JAKs as being different between each other? Certainly, the data would point to that from what we've seen, but wondering how your conversations with the regulators are going with regards to that, especially given the fact that literally just as we were speaking a few minutes ago the agency updated the XELJANZ label to include a black box warning for VTE DVT? Thank you very much.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Very good. So let me cover number one and -- the first question and I'll have Mike cover the second question. I think if you look at the international reference pricing that was being proposed in Part D, as you know, we obviously have a very small Part D business, so it doesn't have a significant impact for us. Whether or not, a structure like that or something similar to that could be moved over to D I think in a broad way that would require legislative action I believe based on the way the law is written today. But it doesn't mean that there couldn't be pilots or other kinds of methods to ultimately look at that. So it's -- I think it's difficult to predict what it would look like. I think the Senate proposal I think is a good start with some modifications. I think the Senate proposal could be modified in a way that it could solve many of the issues that are out there. And I think that one has a structure that then plays -- that could require some level of modification. But I think the framework around it is a good framework. And so I would hope that that would get some traction to move forward and be modified in the areas that I referenced before, potentially look at smoothing the out-of-pocket, potentially even look at maybe trying to take the out-of-pocket down a little bit further. And then relooking at the distribution across all of the different drugs that approaches through Part D all of the proprietary drugs and making sure that that distribution is appropriate across the full range of medicines that patients buy as Part D. It would be some fundamental modifications that I think could be looked at there. Mike?
Michael Severino: Okay. I'll take the question on upadacitinib. So we feel very good about the performance of upadacitinib across its program, not only from an efficacy perspective, but from a benefit/risk perspective. With respect to the agency's view, I can't speak for the agency, but that generally will differ across different components of the program. Obviously, there's been a lot of -- there's been a lot of focus on the DVT and PE issue with baricitinib. And then, we just saw this morning that the FDA has announced that they've updated the label for tofacitinib to include a box warning around similar events. What we've said consistently is our program hasn't demonstrated that risk. So if we were to pick up labeling language like that or warnings around this issue, that would have to come from a determination from the FDA that they're going to move from some form of class labeling. And I'm not in a position to speak for them about that, certainly not today. Our review is ongoing so we will update on our label when we have more information.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Navin. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: Hi, thank you. Two questions. Your share price was right at about $80 a share before you announced Allergan. It's now down over 15% since that transaction. You guys have had no setbacks in that time frame. You beat results today. So that says investors aren't enamored with the deal. From investors you've met with what's the biggest pushback on the transaction? And what do you think investors are not appreciating? And second question on ORILISSA. On the market for about a year now did $19 million in the quarter. Your prior guidance is $2 billion in 2025. Is that still realistic? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Sure, Tim. This is Rick. I'll cover both of those. So first on the share price, I think it's important to put in perspective, all of the larger transactions that have been done over the course of the last several years. So, Bristol-Celgene, Takeda, Shire and others, I've had a similar reaction out of the blocks down -- I'd say the data I looked at prior to our announcement was down in the range of 10% to 16% at announcement. I would say as we went out following the announcement you saw that the stock rose about 3% per day on that Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and while we were on the road. And that I think is a good indication as to, when you sit down and you get in front of investors. And you walk them through the strategic logic. And what this does for us longer term. I think most investors that we met with, walked away with a positive impression. There are mechanical aspects of this, of how arms come in and short the acquirer. And we're obviously seeing our short volume go up significantly which is putting pressure on the stock. So, I don't think the stock's performing differently than what we would expect. And I don't know that it's a specific indication to just the perception of the transaction. When we'll know what the perception of the transaction is, is when we close it. And the shorts move out of the stock and then the stock will trade on its merits. And I would be -- I'm encouraged that I think the stock will trade on its merits quite well. This is a company that has performed extremely well over the last five or six years. And this strategically puts us in a position, where regardless of what happens with HUMIRA in 2023. We can continue to perform at a very high level. And that was the intention. And as I said in my formal comments, the reason we've been so successful is that we run the business in a way to make sure that when there are issues or risks around the business that we take proactive actions to be able to deal with those. And that's what investors would expect us to do and that's what we do. And this is an example where it will protect the company and the shareholders from a range of outcomes around HUMIRA when we see the LOE in 2023 in the U.S. and that's the way to run the business. And so, I'm excited about the Allergan transaction. I think it's a great set of assets. I think it's a very good organization, from an execution standpoint. And I think it will add to our business in a positive way. And give us additional growth platforms that will allow us to continue to grow the company. As it relates to ORILISSA, our long-term guidance on ORILISSA remains the same. As we indicated to all of you when we started this -- this is an example of a drug where you have to go out and build the market. Endometriosis hasn't had a new therapy in a decade or maybe even more than a decade. And so, you have to create the awareness. You have to create the confidence in a new therapy. And you have to get patients to be aware of it, and then to be activated to go to their physician and get treatment. So, we're continuing to look at our launch strategy and make modifications where we think they are appropriate to accelerate the ramp. And one of the things that we're looking at right now is if you look at the profile of the drug, the profile of the drug is excellent. There's -- it fits exactly the objectives that we need in a drug in this class. The physician uptake has been good. We're getting good trial out of the physician base and getting pretty broad coverage out of the physician base. The third component for a drug like this is you have to -- as I said, you have to create awareness for patients. And you have to activate those patients to go into their physicians' office and talk about treatment of their condition. And, I'd say, we're getting good awareness. In fact I'd say the awareness is slightly higher than what we would have projected. Where we're not getting enough activation, because these women are essentially -- they go to their physicians typically once a year or less on average. So we want them to basically make a special visit, to ultimately come in and start to talk about their condition and what the appropriate treatment is for that condition. We're not seeing a lot of activation or -- at the level that we would expect of their routine visit schedule. And so we are looking at some modifications to our current promotional strategy to try to increase that activation and that will obviously allow the ramp to increase. And that's the area of focus that we have today. So, you constantly modify your strategy to make sure that you're dealing with the elements that could enhance it. And that's what we're doing.
Tim Anderson: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks Tim. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.
Andrew Baum: Thank you. A couple of questions please. Firstly, could you help us think through the potential impact of biosimilar Enbrel introduction in the U.S. on your HUMIRA business? What's your level of confidence that any usage will impact only treatment-naive RA patients? Or is there risks to your in-built franchise of established patients? So that's the first question. Second with SKYRIZI. In relation to the usage anticipated with the drug how much do you expect to be home administration versus in the physician's office? And are there ready economic incentives for physicians in that to select SKYRIZI as a result of that? And then finally, again on SKYRIZI the drug is not currently approved with psoriatic arthritis unlike some of your competitors. That's about 30% I believe of the current psoriasis market. To what extent is that a disadvantage given it's going to take a while before you get the data? And there may be some questions about the Sharp scores and the comparative nature of that data versus the approved IL-17? Many thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: All right. Thank you. So impact of biosimilar Enbrel, I will tell you that there is no data that would support that it will cause a change in well-maintained patients. We obviously have REMICADE biosimilar in the U.S. marketplace today. It's not having any of that kind of impact granted it's an infused product but it's a -- outside the U.S. when we had biosimilar Enbrel, it didn't have any material impact at all on HUMIRA. And so I don't expect that it would have any significant impact at all if Enbrel were to go biosimilar. And if it had any impact it would only be on naive patients so I don't think that's something that we would be overly concerned about. On point number two what the split is between physician office and self-administered I don't know that I know the answer to that question so we may need to follow-up with you on that. So let us take a follow-up and get back to you on that. On the third one Mike why don't you cover that?
Michael Severino: So this is Mike. With respect to psoriasis in psoriatic arthritis there is a degree of overlap between those conditions but patients often present with more prominent skin disease or more prominent joint disease. So our strategy is to have a portfolio of options for those patients. Today we have SKYRIZI which has demonstrated outstanding efficacy on the skin disease. HUMIRA we still believe is a gold standard for patients who have primary joint involvement and prominent joint involvement. Going forward, we have Phase 3 programs both for SKYRIZI in psoriatic arthritis and for upadacitinib in psoriatic arthritis. So we think across that range of options we'll have the best treatment option for each of those individual patient profiles.
Rick Gonzalez: And the only thing I'd add is you have to look at the data that's coming out today. I said the bulk of the volume that's coming to SKYRIZI today 77% of it is coming from other biologics. And I can tell you a significant portion of that is the IL-17s. And just think about it from this perspective between SKYRIZI now and HUMIRA we really should capture almost 50% of all in-play patients. So I think that gives you some idea of the kind of impact that it's having and the competitiveness of SKYRIZI versus those alternatives that are available whether they're 17s or other 23s or TNFs.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Andrew. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Terence Flynn from Goldman.
Terence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the SKYRIZI launch. One question. You mentioned in the past Rick that some smaller divestitures might be required as part of the Allergan deal. I think some investors assume Allergan's IL-23 would be one of those products. So just wondering if that's a fair assumption. And then what's your confidence level in retaining SKYRIZI? And then the second question I had relates to the U.S. HUMIRA erosion curve. Can you give us any sense of how you're thinking about that in the 2023 time frame and where Allergan fits into that? You mentioned managing the business where there's kind of risks and different outcomes but how did you guys think about that 2023 erosion curve with respect to Allergan in the business there? Thank you. 
Rick Gonzalez: So let me talk a little bit about the divestitures. We've commented on questions that have come up from investors in the broader nature of are we interested in divesting anything out of the portfolio. And generally I would tell you no. There could be some overlaps from an FTC standpoint and that -- and therefore we would deal with those. Laura, is there anything additional you want to comment on from an FTC standpoint?
Laura Schumacher: Yes. I guess I will just say we filed our initial HSR filing. And obviously, we're working with the FTC to the extent that our product overlap. Specifically with respect to SKYRIZI, we do not anticipate that the FTC would require that divestiture at the very least because it's on market for a different non-overlapping indication. And from the standpoint of the FTC's review of the overlap both the SKYRIZI product and the Allergan IL-23 will be considered pipeline assets. And SKYRIZI is being developed for a number of different indications while the Allergan product is only being developed for a couple. So we really don't believe the FTC would require divestiture of SKYRIZI simply because it's on the market for a different nonoverlapping indication.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. And then on the HUMIRA erosion curve -- we're obviously not in a position where we're going to talk to you what that erosion curve looks like this far out because obviously things can change along the way. And when we get closer to the point that we can give you a predictable erosion curve, we will obviously supply that to the market. But we want to do it, when we have a high level of confidence that we can give you a number that is accurate. Having said that, as we've gone out and talk to investors, what we've described to them is, we have a base case erosion curve that we have built. We have -- we update that erosion curve at least once a year, but sometimes more often than that based on -- as we see circumstances play out. We have updated the erosion curve based on the experience that we've seen in the international markets. And I'd say specifically, we've updated the speed at which the curve drops in 2023 because the experience in the international markets is that it's not and has not been a stair step over a number of years. It has come down to basically where a year or three would've been and it's pretty much flattened out. And we are seeing the market outside the U.S. in most countries around the world, reach a point where the competitive dynamics are clearly well within the expectations that we've built in our plan and are somewhat stabilizing I would say. So we've updated the U.S. erosion curve to look more like that international curve in the shape of that curve. And then, we obviously do downside scenarios where we look at okay what scenarios could come together in a way that would create a higher level of erosion? And that's based on a number of competitor’s, interchangeability, changes to the U.S. health care system and we do a number of different modeling assumptions around that to determine what a downside case might look like. If you look at the Allergan transaction, I think the beauty of the Allergan transaction is it guards against the full range of those options. So, if we ended up on a downside scenario, the Allergan transaction allows us to totally buffer that impact. If we end up on the base case, then obviously AbbVie is in a much better position. And so there really isn't a downside scenario that I can come up with that the Allergan transaction doesn't make AbbVie stronger as we go through the LOE. And that was the premise of the transaction and I think everything that we know about it today, only reinforces that that is the appropriate way to be able to manage the business over the long term.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Aaron.
Terence Flynn: Great. Thanks you.
Liz Shea: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger: Great. Thank you very much. So the results in the quarter were obviously very strong. I just want to understand a little bit better the gross margin. So the sales growth sequentially was over $400 million versus the first quarter, but the gross margin declined from 83.4% to 82.7%. So, if you could just give us some color on that. And then could you talk a little bit about the benefits of leveraging HUMIRA in autoimmune disease with payers? I think that management has discussed in the past that payers appreciate the fact that AbbVie is a major player in autoimmune disease and the company can offer bundled programs to facilitate adoption of SKYRIZI and that should also help upadacitinib as well. So, if you could just talk about leveraging the franchise. And then if there's any way to comment on the math that's involved so how you actually allocate rebates for example between SKYRIZI and HUMIRA that would be helpful. Thank you very much.
Rob Michael: David, this is Rob. So I'll take your first question. So, if you look at our gross margin profile through six months, we're right at 83%. That's very much in line with our full year guidance. I mean quarter-to-quarter, you'll see the profile fluctuate due to sales mix impact of foreign exchange and timing of spending, but we feel very good about the progress we've made in gross margin and we're tracking in line with our guidance.
Rick Gonzalez: So David, this is Rick. I guess the first thing I'd say is we don't leverage HUMIRA with our payers. We obviously have a portfolio -- or will have a portfolio of assets that we believe provides payers with the greatest flexibility to cover the largest number of patients and that's a benefit for those payers to be able to have assets that give them the greatest level of coverage for -- from a clinical standpoint for those patients. And as far as what the rebates are, we obviously don't publicly disclose what those rebates are for competitive reasons. But what I would tell you is -- I mean I've heard this rumbling out there about somehow trying to leverage HUMIRA for SKYRIZI as an example. And I'd just point to this quarter as an example all right? HUMIRA grew 7.7%. It had 0.5 point of positive price, all right? So at the end of the day, obviously we didn't leverage HUMIRA to a great extent to get a position for SKYRIZI. There are benefits that we would provide to payers, who allowed both products to go on formulary and -- but there isn't a big leverage component here that the market seems to be perceiving or you wouldn't have positive price. So, I think that answers two and three.
Liz Shea: Okay. Thanks David.
David Risinger: All right. Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks David. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-04-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elizabeth Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also, on the call with me, today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration; and Rob Michael, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that some statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie's operations is included in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our first quarter performance and highlights, as well as our full year guidance, which we are raising this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D programs and Rob will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, we will take your questions. I'm pleased to report that we're off to an excellent start in 2019, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term fundamentals of our business. We are seeing strong momentum across all aspects of our operations, with excellent growth from our hematological oncology portfolio, continued robust growth from HUMIRA in the US, international biosimilar impacts is trending within our expectations for 2019. And importantly, our late-stage pipeline continues to deliver, with the recent approval of SKYRIZI in major markets globally. We delivered first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, representing growth of more than 14% versus the prior year, and once again exceeding our guidance. Total revenues of more than $7.8 billion were also ahead of expectations for the quarter, with several key products contributing to that growth. We saw excellent performance from our hematological oncology business, with global operational sales growth of more than 43%. US HUMIRA grew more than 7% versus a last year, driven by continued robust demand. International HUMIRA sales were down 23% on an operational basis, reflecting the impact of direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other international markets. The international biosimilar trends and dynamics have been consistent with our expectations. We also saw a substantial contributions from several other products in our portfolio, including Mavyret, Creon and Duodopa. We're certainly pleased with our commercial performance and our financial results for the quarter, and we remain well-positioned to deliver double-digit earnings growth once again in 2019. As noted in our earnings release, we are raising our full year 2019 guidance and now expect adjusted earnings between $8.73 and $8.83, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint. In addition to the strong financial results, we have continued to make significant progress, building a pipeline that will allow us to maintain a growing and vibrant business. Since our inception, we've put tremendous effort and resources toward developing new therapies that advance the standard-of-care across a spectrum of important disease states. With special emphasis on doing so in a broad range of immune-mediated diseases, our central focus has been on advancing new medicines that will raise the bar and address important therapeutic needs for patients. We believe that risankizumab and upadacitinib have achieved the objectives that we set forth. Both of these therapies have demonstrated differentiated clinical profiles versus HUMIRA, as well as other mechanisms on the market or those in development. This profile coupled with our strong commercial execution gives us tremendous confidence that both will be the new standard-of-care in their respective indications. We recently announced the approval of risankizumab now known as SKYRIZI in the US and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. These approvals mark a major milestone for AbbVie and further demonstrate our commitment and leadership in immunology. We're certainly pleased with the approved label for SKYRIZI, which reflects its best in category efficacy, favorable benefit risk and quarterly dosing. As you know, we also have a highly experienced team, including the leading immunology marketing team and sales force, which will support this launch. Given its compelling product profile, we expect to secure rapid and broad formulary coverage for SKYRIZI, with more than 50% commercial access by the end of July, a 90-day access metric not achieved by any other recent launch in the psoriasis category. SKYRIZI represents a significant long-term opportunity for AbbVie, with multi-billion dollar peak sales potential. We have also been planning and preparing for the forthcoming regulatory approval and commercial launch of upadacitinib, our JAK1-selective inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis. We've been extremely encouraged by the level of efficacy and benefit risk profile observed across the entire upadacitinib clinical program, including its clear superiority versus HUMIRA, the current gold standard for the treatment of RA. Based on the data generated across our program, we believe upadacitinib will offer meaningful advantage over other products on the market today for those in development and we remain on track for US regulatory decision in the third quarter. With a robust and differentiated data we produced from our assets and the launch of several new products now under way, we remain confident that the strategy we have in place is working extremely well. We're excited to see the evolution of our pipeline assets from promising late-stage development compounds to successful on-market products. SKYRIZI marks the 12th new product or major indication approval for AbbVie in the last five years, demonstrating the productivity of our R&D investments, which is vital for the long-term success of any innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company like ours. So, in summary, I'm extremely pleased with the strong execution and pipeline advancement we're seeing, leading to our increase in expectations for 2019. We are off to an exceptional start of the year, followed by several years of market-leading performance and we're well-positioned to continue to deliver top tier financial performance in 2019 and beyond. With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. I'll start with immunology, where, as Rick noted, we've made significant progress with both of our late-stage assets. We recently received approval in the US and Japan for SKYRIZI in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and expect an approval decision in Europe very soon. Based on the positive CHMP opinion we received at the end of February. These approvals are supported by a broad clinical development program, where SKYRIZI demonstrated a very start strong profile in Phase 3 studies across more than 2,000 patients. We are pleased with the SKYRIZI label, which reflects the efficacy and safety profile demonstrated across our program. As we evaluate the available biologic treatment options, we believe SKYRIZI has a best in disease product profile, with differentiated attributes across the categories that physicians and patients the most important, including skin clearance, durability of response and dosing, with a favorable benefit risk profile. In our Phase 3 studies, SKYRIZI demonstrated very high rates of durable skin clearance, with more than 80% of patients achieving PASI 90 and 60% of patients achieving PASI 100 or complete skin clearance at one year. Importantly, the proportion of SKYRIZI treated patients who achieve these high levels of response increased over time. In fact, the level of complete skin clearance at the one-year mark is the highest reported in a Phase 3 program to our knowledge. In psoriasis both speed and durability of response are important considerations for an optimal therapy, as loss of efficacy is a key concern for both patients and physicians. Our clinical trials demonstrated clearance after just a single dose of SKYRIZI, as measured by the mean change in PASI score. The average skin clearance following the first dose was 58%, increasing to 91% after two doses and 95% after five doses. SKYRIZI also provides a best in category dosing profile, with convenient quarterly dosing and flexibility for in-office or at home self-administration. We look forward to bringing this new treatment option to psoriasis patients. We also continue to make good progress with the development programs for SKYRIZI in several other immune-mediated conditions, with late-stage studies ongoing in several follow-on indications. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Moving now to our other late-stage immunology assets, upadacitinib, where regulatory applications are currently under review for its initial indication rheumatoid arthritis. Our regulatory submissions are based on a comprehensive Phase 3 program. In our program, upadacitinib demonstrated strong results across a wide range of patients, including patients early in the treatment paradigm, who are naive to methotrexate, as well as patients who are heavily pre-treated with biologics. Upadacitinib is the only JAK1-selective inhibitor to meet all primary and secondary endpoints across all registrational trials. Importantly, upadacitinib demonstrated clear superiority versus HUMIRA across all key measures evaluated in a head-to-head study, as well as clear structural benefit in two Phase 3 studies. Upadacitinib also performed extremely well as monotherapy, which we view as another important differentiator, because although methotrexate is commonly used as a first-line therapy, many patients do not respond to or cannot tolerate methotrexate treatment. Based on the data generated across our clinical program, we remain confident in the benefit risk profile for upadacitinib and believe that it will offer meaningful advantages over other therapeutic options. We continue to anticipate a regulatory decision in the third quarter and look forward to bringing this new therapy to the market. Moving now to our hematologic oncology portfolio. In the quarter IMBRUVICA received FDA approval for its 10th indication. For using combination with GAZYVA in front-line CLL. This represents the first approval for a chemotherapy free combination regimen and treatment-naive patients with CLL. The approval is based on results from the Phase 3 iLLUMINATE study, in which treatment with the combination of IMBRUVICA and GAZYVA demonstrated a significant improvement in the risk of progression or death compared to treatment with Chlorambucil and GAZYVA. iLLUMINATE trial is one of several important Phase 3 studies that have demonstrated treatment with IMBRUVICA alone or in combination significantly prolongs progression-free survival compared to therapies such as FCR, BR and GC and previously untreated CLL patients. These studies add to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA, providing physicians more evidence of its compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting. The data from three of these studies have been reflected in the NCCN Treatment Guidelines for front-line CLL, which now position IMBRUVICA as the only preferred regimen in the major segments of this market. We anticipate submitting data from other Phase 3 studies in front-line CLL for label augmentation later this year or early next year. Moving now to VENCLEXTA, where our supplemental NDA and front-line CLL is currently being reviewed by the FDA under its real-time oncology review program. In conjunction with this submission VENCLEXTA received priority review, as well as a fifth breakthrough therapy designation. If granted, this approval will provide physicians and patients an important new treatment option and substantially expand the addressable population for which is VENCLEXTA is approved in CLL. We anticipate a regulatory decision later this year. Last month, we disclosed top line data from the Phase 3 Bellini study in patients with relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma. While the study met the primary endpoint of progression-free survival, a higher proportion of deaths was observed in the VENCLEXTA arm compared to the control arm. Based on these data the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on all trials evaluating VENCLEXTA in multiple myeloma. We're working with the FDA to further analyze these results. But based on the data we have produced today, we continue to believe there is a potential role for VENCLEXTA in the biomarket defined myeloma population. We will provide updates on the multiple myeloma program as they become available. Moving now to the area of women's health, where we're nearing completion of our pivotal program for Elagolix in uterine fibroids. Our registrational program evaluated nearly 800 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in two pivotal studies. The results of the two pivotal studies demonstrated that Elagolix in combination with low-dose hormone add-back therapy significantly reduced heavy menstrual bleeding compared to placebo. Current non-surgical treatments are limited in this area and women suffering from uterine fibroids need more therapeutic options. The results from these studies represent a significant advancement for women suffering from uterine fibroids and approval in this disease would represent an attractive follow on indication. We remain on track to submit our regulatory application in the middle of this year. And in neuroscience, we are in the process of initiating a Phase 3 trial to support registration of ABBV 951, our innovative, subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system. Continuous delivery of levodopa/carbidopa has proven to be very effective in managing motor fluctuations in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Duopa has helped to establish AbbVie's presence in this market and by providing patients with a less invasive non-surgical delivery option, this next-generation approach has the potential to broaden the treated patient population and help strengthen AbbVie's position in the advanced PD market. In summary, we're extremely pleased with the productivity of our R&D organization, as we continue to invest in our pipeline to develop innovative medicines and support our long-term growth. We're seeing progress across all stages and in all therapeutic areas of our pipeline. With many important catal -- catalysts expected over the next 12 months to 18 months. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Rob?
Rob Michael: Thanks, Mike. As Rick mentioned, we had another quarter of outstanding performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up more than 14% compared to prior year and $0.08 above our guidance midpoint. For the first quarter, net revenues were up 0.4% on an operational basis, excluding a 1% -- 1.7% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Strong growth from several key products offset the impact of the first full quarter of international biosimilar competition. US HUMIRA sales were $3.2 billion, up 7.1% compared to prior year, driven by continued strong demand. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were $1.2 billion, down 23% operationally, reflecting biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets, and in line with our expectations. Hematologic oncology global sales were $1.2 billion, up 43.2% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong growth of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. IMBRUVICA global net revenues were more than $1 billion, primarily driven by continued uptake in the front-line CLL segment. In CLL, IMBRUVICA remains the market leader across all lines of therapy, with new patient share of more than 25% in the front-line setting. VENCLEXTA revenues were $151 million, driven by continued progress in the broad relapsed refractory CLL segment and our recent launch in first-line AML. We continue to be pleased with our strong global position in HCV. In the US, HCV revenues were up more than 17%, reflecting higher market share versus the prior year quarter. Our International business has also experienced positive share dynamics. But given patient de-warehousing in select markets during the prior year quarter, International HCV revenue declined approximately 25% on an operational basis, consistent with our expectations. We also saw continued strong operational sales growth for both Duodopa and Creon. Turning now to the P&L profile for the first quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 83.3% of sales, up 310 basis points compared to the prior year, including a 280-basis-point benefit related to the expiration of HUMIRA royalties. Adjusted R&D investment was 15.3% of sales, supporting our pipeline programs on oncology, immunology and other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 20% of sales, consistent with our expectations. The adjusted operating margin was 48.1% of sales, an improvement of 400 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $325 million and the adjusted tax rate was 7.9%. As mentioned earlier, based on our strong performance year-to-date, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $8.73 to $8.83, reflecting growth of 11% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $1.47 of known intangible amortization and specified items, as well as a non-cash charge for contingent consideration related to the recent approval of SKYRIZI. We plan to communicate details about this charge on our second quarter earnings call. This revised guidance continues to contemplate full year revenue growth of approximately 1% on an operational basis. At current rates, we now expect foreign exchange to have approximately 1% unfavorable impact on full year reported sales growth. As Rick and Mike noted, we're pleased with the recent approval of SKYRIZI. Given the quarterly dosing schedule and our free goods program to bridge patients to commercial access, we expect very modest sales contribution from SKYRIZI in the second quarter. For the full year, our revenue guidance includes approximately $150 million of SKYRIZI sales, which will predominantly occur in the second half of the year. All other full year 2019 forecast assumptions for our key products remain unchanged. Turning now to the P&L for 2019. We now expect an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 83% and we now expect adjusted operating margin to be just above 47%, roughly 250 basis points above prior year and inclusive of the required investments for our new product launches. All other full year 2019 guidance assumptions remain unchanged. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.20 and $2.22, excluding approximately $0.30 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. As mentioned earlier, this guidance excludes a non-cash charge for contingent consideration related to the approval of SKYRIZI. We anticipate second quarter adjusted revenue above $8.1 billion. At current rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on reported sales growth of approximately 1.5%. For US HUMIRA, we expect sales growth of approximately 7%. We expect International HUMIRA sales of approximately $1 billion assuming current exchange rates. And for IMBRUVICA we expect global sales approaching $1.1 billion . Moving now to the P&L for the second quarter. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio comparable to first quarter results. We anticipate higher spending in the second half of the year related to new product launches. And we expect the adjusted tax rate to be in line with our full year guidance, which is just above our 2018 rate. In summary, AbbVie has once again delivered an excellent quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations. Our strong growth prospects have enabled us to position the business for another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2019, despite Biosimilar dynamics and the required investments to support several major product launches. We are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Rob. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Stephen Scala: Thank you. I have a few questions. First, raising guidance after the first quarter is clearly a sign of confidence in the outlook. I believe, AbbVie raised after Q1 last year on its way to a great full year performance. How many times in its history has AbbVie raised guidance after the first quarter? Secondly, on the gross profit margin was quite strong. You mentioned the royalty relief. Were there any other one-time benefits in the quarter? And then, lastly, AbbVie has an exciting late-stage pipeline, but also an expansive early to mid-stage pipeline. Within the early to mid-stage pipeline, what products look most interesting and promising? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Hi, Steve. This is Rick. I'll take the first question. I mean, obviously, we feel good about how the year started, and I said, we've started with a tremendous amount of momentum. Certainly, as we look at the performance of the hematological oncology business and US HUMIRA, and many other products are performing extremely well. And so, that's certainly driving the level of confidence that we're seeing. As well as, we've now seen a substantial period of time that I think we can measure the impact of biosimilar competition outside the US and feel good about how that is tracking against our expectations. Specific to your question, we raised guidance three times in the first quarter and we've raised guidance, I think, 13 out of the 25 quarters that we've reported. And certainly we do not raise guidance in the first quarter unless you had a level of confidence that you could deliver that or greater performance across the year. That would just be a foolish position to take. So in both of the prior years where we raise in first quarter, those ended up being years where we outperformed significantly. So I think it is a good indication of the level of confidence that management has in the business whether it be our business or any other business, I think, it demonstrates a level of confidence, otherwise we wouldn't choose to do that. And certainly, I am extremely pleased with how we've come out of the blocks in 2019 and I'm pleased with what -- how the pipeline has continued to deliver, and obviously, we'll be launching two major products this year SKYRIZI and ultimately we anticipate being able to launch upadacitinib this year in addition to the products we've already launched recently and are driving a tremendous amount of growth. So I have a lot of confidence in how the business can perform. With that, I will turn it over to Rob to answer your second question.
Rob Michael: Hi, Steve. It's Rob. So we feel very good about our progress in gross margin. We just printed a new high. The lion's share of improvement you're seeing comes from the termination of HUMIRA royalties. We do have efficiencies in foreign exchange helping cover the impact of partnership accounting. But as you can see from our full year guidance, we have a lot -- we feel very good about the progress we've made in gross margin. So I wouldn't anticipate a lot of one-time impacts.
Rick Gonzalez: Mike, why don't you answer that?
Michael Severino: Sure. So, this is Mike. We have obviously invested considerably in our late-stage pipeline. But we've also paid a large amount of attention and invested to make sure that we have broad and promising early to mid-stage pipeline as well. So I'd highlight programs from a couple of areas. Although, it's a late-stage program, I think, it's one that doesn't get a lot of attention, and so, I think, it's worth mentioning, which is Depatux-M, which used to be known as ABT-414, which is our EGFR targeted ADC in EGFR-amplified glioblastoma multiforme. That has delivered very interesting mid-stage data in the second-line patients with GBM and is in a randomized Phase 3 study with overall survival as a primary endpoint now in front-line GBM. So, I think, that is potentially a very interesting opportunity, because there really is very limited treatment options available for these patients and so that's one that I think we can keep an eye on. Turning to our early pipeline. I would highlight in oncology. Our work in apoptosis, which is really an extension of what we learned discovering and developing a venetoclax or BCl-2 inhibitor. We have a Phase 2 study ongoing now with the different molecule with the venetoclax, which inhibits both BCL-2 and BCL-XL and that combination inhibition, that pattern of inhibition has potential in myelofibrosis and can specifically address the clone that drives that very serious hematologic disorder. There's really only one pathway currently that treat that disease. The current standard-of-care is Jakafi. In our Phase 2 study we're looking at patients who failed or didn't respond to Jakafi. We're looking at a pretty resistant population and even early on we're seeing some very interesting responses. And I think there's also real potential that we could address the underlying pathophysiology and therefore be disease-modifying in the bone marrow fibrosis. So that study is accruing by the end of this year, early next year, we will be in a position to make a decision to advance that program into later stage development. We also have number of other programs that are just a little bit behind that one in apoptosis. Programs like our TRAIL program, which is an apoptosis related program that has promising solid tumors including things like colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer and we're seeing some very interesting responses in good PK-PD relationship in our early studies there. And we have a BC-XL targeted delivery for solid tumors also that add about the same stage of development. If we shift to immuno-oncology, we've done a lot of work to advance our pipeline there. And one of the most novel programs in that area is program called GARP, which is now ABBV-151. That modulates TGF-beta and T-reg function which is thought to mediate the tumor immunosuppressive environment. So that's a program I think has a lot of solid science behind it is now in the clinic and we have a number of other novel IO programs in the clinic as well. If we now shift our focus to immunology, a couple of things I would point to our TNF steroid ADC that has promised to deliver very high levels of response to patients, because we know that steroids are highly effective at managing the symptoms of RA and other immunological mediated diseases, but they can be given at high doses for long periods of time. So this program attempts to deliver a novel steroid directly to the immune effector cells in RA without systemic consequences or systemic adverse effects. What we know from the early studies is we are able to dose this molecule in the range where we would expect to see efficacy without seeing those widespread steroid like effects and we're now moving into a randomized study that will give proof-of-concept and should read out next year. We've invested in other programs in immunology as well, like our CD40 antagonist and our jack BTK combination program. So a lot of data to come there. Last area I focus on is neuroscience. People are familiar with our TAL antibody, which is in Phase 2, but we've built a broad pipeline behind that and our two neuroinflammation assets that we're developing in partnership with Alector are now in the clinic and so those are some very interesting programs. So there's a lot of data to come over the next 12 months to 18 months.
Stephen Scala: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks very much for the questions. My first one was on SKYRIZI and just how we're thinking about that launch ramp. I guess, historically, we've seen some of the newer psoriasis agents having relatively gradual ramps and then maybe a few years to really gain momentum. I guess, is that fair to think about in this situation or when we think about the higher payer access you cited in the commercial infrastructure you have, should we think about all the different dynamic here? And your second question, just kind of building on that is, how are you thinking about HUMIRA dynamics in dermatology with this launch and with a range of new agents coming in. I know that business remained fairly healthy, but should we think about the growth slowing at that indication over time? And maybe the final one was just on business development priorities, just latest thoughts on how you're thinking about business development, and I guess, specifically, how you're prioritizing revenue growth potential versus diversification as you think about potential deals that you'd be looking at? Thanks so much.
Rick Gonzalez: Hi, Chris. This is Rick. I think if you look at SKYRIZI and you look at the ramp and you compare to historical ramps, one of the limiting factors in the historical has been their ability to be able to get market access -- broad based market access in a reasonable period of time and that's always a limiter, no matter what product we're talking about, what specialty product we're talking about, if you don't have access, it makes the launch extremely difficult, but what most companies do is subsidize with free goods for a period of time until they can get access. But no one has gotten access like we're describing here. So, certainly, access should enhance the ramp of SKYRIZI. Now having said that, it takes a few months even in our case, to get to the level of access that we're talking about. So in the current quarter, you shouldn't expect much in the way of SKYRIZI revenue, because we are going to use free goods extensively during that period of time, but that access should ramp dramatically as we get toward the end of the quarter and moving into the next quarter. And then you should expect that the product will ramp. As with any new mechanism, it obviously take some time to get physicians familiar with it, but I would expect SKYRIZI to ramp more significantly than what you've seen with historical ramp. So I think that would be a reasonable way to be thinking about it. As it relates to HUMIRA dynamics. I think if you have to look at the profile of SKYRIZI and think about where it would fit in the treatment paradigm for patients. Here you have an agent that has PASI 90, PASI 100 scores, like we've never seen before and it's an agent that has a good benefit risk profile. So from a safety standpoint, I think, there will be a high level of comfort around it and it's an agent that obviously has significant advantages from a dosing standpoint, where patients will only have to inject themselves once a quarter. So when you look at all of those dynamics, you have to ask yourself the question, why wouldn't that be a front-line agent and indeed that will be certainly how we will be positioning this agent, it has the profile to be able to deliver against that criteria that would be appropriate for front-line naive patients, and obviously, an agent that will also be used extensively for those patients that are switching from a therapy that ultimately -- they're not getting the level of efficacy that they desire and need. Now, HUMIRA, obviously, will maintain, there's a large number of well maintained patients on HUMIRA. Obviously you don't switch a patient that is well maintained. It is not just appropriate. And so -- but I would expect that you will start to see HUMIRA slow somewhat in the psoriasis category as SKYRIZI starts to ramp in a very significant way. The last question is around business development. And what I would say there is, if you look at our business, obviously, our business continues to perform well. We launched a significant number of products over the course of the last several years, you're starting to see that diversification. In fact, last year, if you look at the -- what drove our growth, it was very balanced growth between IMBRUVICA, HUMIRA, Mavyret and to a lesser extent VENCLEXTA. So you're starting to see that diversity or that diversification play out and obviously we're launching significant number of additional assets, we launched some at the end of the year and then more will launch this year with SKYRIZI and upadacitinib. That will drive over time more diversification. Having said that, we have a business that generates significant cash flow and our first priority is always using that cash flow to be able to invest back in the business. And so we look at all different kinds of transactions, small ones, medium-sized ones and larger ones. We look at them all in the backdrop of do they strategically fit in the enhanced long-term performance of the business and are they value at a point which we can get a good return for the investment that we need to make. And when we find those, we obviously act on those and we have the financial wherewithal to do that. So that's how we think about it, and I wouldn't say that's different than how we've historically thought about it, but that is how we look at business development.
Chris Schott: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.
Jason Gerberry: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just first one on the EU HUMIRA guidance. I think the 2Q guidance was for $1 billion, which is about 40% down. So I was just wondering if you could help square that for us in terms of the 30% erosion for the full year. And then also help us reconcile, I think, Biogen yesterday mentioned that there's about 35% biosimilar share in Europe. So just trying to put these data points together, it would seem like, perhaps, the erosion profile might be a little bit worse in Europe than you would -- than the last guidance. So if you can provide a little clarity there that would be helpful? And then, I guess, just second question, just on the ORILISSA launch, can you just give us a little color how this is progressing, it is progressing according to plan, are there some early challenges that there maybe a little greater than initially anticipated, that would be helpful as well? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Jason, this is Rick. I'll answer those questions for you. First, to the point that you made about the erosion, the erosion that we quoted on the call was 30% against the total international base. I think we said at the time, if you just looked within the segment that we are growing in biosimilar that was around 40% or 44%, something in that range. So it is consistent with that. The guidance is consistent with what we originally talked about, and I'd say that's the guidance that we are absolutely comfortable with as things are playing out. If you look specifically to the Biogen comment. I think for Biogen said, although, I didn't read the transcript, but others did, is I think what they said was that share was in Germany. And I'd say, it's in the range of that in Germany. I can't remember the specific number that they quoted, remember, Germany has a quota system that they use and that quota is that 40% of the prescriptions written by their doctors, their physicians should be biosimilar products and so they are obviously going to drive to that 40% and they're not -- they're approaching that now. So I don't think that is a big surprise. If you look more broadly across all of Europe -- all of the areas that are affected by biosimilars in Europe, then the share would be about 16% right now in the first quarter. We would expect that that will rise over the course of the year, which is just how we planned it. We plan two things, rising share and more price erosion as we advance toward the fourth quarter and that is how our forecast is built. So it's tracking against that forecast well. I think if you look at Biogen and Amgen, I'd say they have been the most aggressive in the market thus far. So Biogen quoted what they were getting up that share in Germany, I have no reason to believe that that wasn't accurate and but that's essentially how the biosimilars are going. So I'd say, I think, now actually we had more experience, we're pretty comfortable with how the biosimilars are sorting themselves out. On ORILISSA, the ramp is going or the launch is going as we would expect. We have spent quite a bit of time out educating physicians. This is a physician population that hasn't had a new medicine in this area in order they prescribe a lot of these types of medicines in their practice generally. I'd say the receptivity that we're seeing physician -- from physicians is very good, very positive. These feedback we're getting from patients as they start I think is encourage. It would be suggestive of the fact that even into 150-milligram dose patients are seeing rapid relief of pain. So I think that's certainly positive and they like the profile of the drug. We started the DTC campaign a couple of months ago and that will be an important aspect of this launch. And we said all along, this is a -- this is an area where we're ultimately going to have to build the market. And it's important to remember, these patients are typically younger women, right, and they don't go to their doctor every couple of months. They go to their doctor typically once a year. So engaging them and making them understand that there is a therapy available, and therefore, they should go to their doctor off cycle is an important part of this launch and building this launch. I would say it's tracking well, compared to what we would have expected. The drug has right now about a $60 million running rate and growing. So it's within the expectations that we had. And long-term, I can tell you, our expectations are still. This will be a very sizable product for us going forward, albeit, it's going to be more of a slower ramp than some other products like HCV where they ramp very rapidly.
Jason Gerberry: Got it. Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Jason. Operator, we'll take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Navin Jacob from UBS.
Navin Jacob: Hi. Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a question for Bill and a question for Rick, if I may. Bill, with the nice increase to your operating margin guidance to 47% for 2019. How confident are you in your 2020 operating margin guidance of 50%, I mean, that -- what's driving that 300 bps of increase? And then second question for Rick. Obviously, the Pharma Group over the last two weels, three weeks has been under significant pressure, last week lease was associated with Medicare for all concerns, before that IPI and rebate rule. There's a lot of things proposed a lot of things discussed. I guess, Rick, help us understand beyond, obviously, I'm not going to ask you to handicap political outcomes, but beyond the political hurdles, what are some of the practical hurdles associated with broader form such as Medicare for all? And then with regards to the rebate rule, what are your expectations going into next year, assuming implication -- implementation? How that will affect AbbVie's ability to deal with marketplace, which is fundamentally has been driven with the inflammation marketplace, which has fundamentally been driven by -- a lot by how payors position products? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Thank you. Rob, why don't you answer the first?
Rob Michael: Hi, Navin. This is Rob. So we're in the process of developing our LRP right now. So I'm not going to give you 2020 guidance. But let me tell you how to think about it. If you think about the 2019 profile, we're up about 250 basis points, despite the investment for new product launches and flattish sales. In 2020, you should see increased P&L leverage as those new products ramp and the overall top-line grows. So that's the way I would model it.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah. As it relates to the debate that's ongoing about affordability of healthcare and affordability of medicines. It certainly is obvious to everyone that there is a very significant debate that is ongoing here. I think fundamentally comes back to having patients have access to the medicines that they need and making sure that those medicines are priced in a range where they are affordable and they are justified based on the pharmacoeconomics of those particular agents. We should hope it will get to that debate. I think eventually it will get to that debate. And so as you look at patients ability to be able to access medicines. I think it's important to think about it in the backdrop of where is the challenge in that. I would tell you as an example, and I don't think we're unusual, but we have a very extensive patient assistance program and that program actually allows patients up to 600% of poverty, which I think is around $150,000 a year worth of income for a family of four somewhere thereabouts, that in the event they can't afford their medicines, they can come to us and we obviously will provide the medicine even free of charge and we provide a significant amount of medicine to those patients. Those programs are available to commercially insured patients, to uninsured patients, and therefore, there shouldn't be a patient that falls into that category. It doesn't have access to an AbbVie medicine regardless of their ability to be able to pay. Now do people fall through the net and they don't realize it. We are looking into that and we may actually do some additional awareness campaigns to make sure patients understand how to be able to access that that program. But I can tell you we have pretty broad coverage of that program, and we monitor how many patients don't qualify because of their income levels and we always constantly look at whether or not we have that set appropriately for patients who can't afford the medicine. And so we adjust it in time based on the percent of over poverty income to ensure that we're trying to cover the vast majority of those patients. So, you shouldn't have a significant problem with those kinds of patients. Then you look at commercially insured patients, obviously, the industry provides a significant level of co-pay assistance to those patients and so that shouldn't be a challenge. Where the challenge does exist, because these programs are not available broadly to patients on Medicare Part D, is in Medicare Part D. The non-LIS portion of Medicare Part D has very high out-of-pocket costs for medicines, particularly specialty medicines and to sort of put in perspective for you, a Medicare Part D patient, if you compare their out-of-pocket expense to a commercially insured patient, a patient on Medicaid, a patient who isn't Part D, but part of the LIS program, their out-of-pocket expense for something like HUMIRA is a little over 50 times, five-zero times, what it is compared to those other patient populations, which is a pretty significant burden on those patients. And so I think, one of the things, we're trying to drive as we go through this process is, I think, it is the industry's responsibility to help step up and try to cover some of that cost and share some of that with the government to be able to make it affordable for those patients, that is just too high a burden on Medicare patients to be able to afford that. And I think that's the area that you have the greatest challenge from an ability to access these kinds of medicines. And so, we are obviously trying to come up with ways that we can suggest or try to participate in the process to help alleviate that challenge and I think we should be willing to come to the table and help drive that. Now, people say, well, what about the cost associated with that? If you look at the Part D plan and you look at the overall cost, compared to how enrollment has increased over time, I would tell you that the Part D plan has worked extremely well from a competitiveness standpoint, the insurers that negotiate this and the PBMs that negotiated on behalf of the government, drive a pretty hard bargain and you see fairly significant rebating or discounting in this program. I think one of the challenges and I will get to that here in a minute when we talk about rebate. One of the challenges is it would appear most of that rebate is being put back into the premiums, lowering the premiums and so there is this debate, where should that rebate money go back, should it go back against the actual drug costs or should be built back into the premiums and look that's not a decision that we make and I think that is part of where the rebate challenge comes in. Now, as it relates to patients, well, certainly, I think, most of us believe that patient shouldn't be paying against the list price of their substantial rebates. And so the rebate rule as its proposed right now, would allow manufacturers like us to discount at the point-of-sale or point of pharmacy to be able to reflect that and then that would be reflected in what the patient pays. I can tell you we are totally supportive of the patient paying off of the rebated price or the discounted price. I think that is absolutely appropriate. Whether the rebate rule goes through as it is or some modification or doesn't go through at all, look, I can't handicap that. We have analyzed how it would as is currently proposed and as we've said many times, it doesn't affect our business, one way or another, whether it's a rebate or a discount, they are one and the same. And so, I think, we're comfortable with -- if that were to go through, being able to manage our business in a very similar way to the way we manage our business now. I think one of the challenges with Medicare for all would be you'd have to look pretty carefully at this drug benefit, because you would have patients who if they switched off one of those other programs and went on Medicare, at least the way Medicare Part D works right now. Their co-pay out-of-pocket is going to go up dramatically. And I think that's not something that they would necessarily like. So I think that's a significant challenge. But I think one way or another we have to attack that and resolve this. This group making sure that they have good access, affordable access to drugs that they need. Now these are drugs that don't get abused. Now at the end of the day, take a drug like HUMIRA. HUMIRA is step edited has prior authorization. The patient has to fail all the lower cost alternatives before they ever get access to a medicine like HUMIRA. So there is not any real risk of abuse in this kind of a category. And so I think that's something else that's important to put in perspective as we have this debate.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Navin. Operator, we'll take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI.
Joshua Schimmer: Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to clarify some of the points on guidance. On the fourth quarter call, you had indicated ORILISSA would be around $200 million this year. Is it on track for that or might that take a little longer to achieve? And then just follow-up on your answer to Jason's question about the OUS guidance for HUMIRA this year, sorry, in the second quarter being down 40% year-over-year. You talked about the expected cadence of erosion in Europe. But OUS is still projected to be down 40%. So you can elaborate on the answer and reconciling that with the initial guidance of 30% for global US for the -- ex US for the year? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: So on ORILISSA -- Josh, this is Rick. On ORILISSA I would say that we are tracking against that number. So we're not changing our guidance on that number. And obviously, as I said, it has a running rate right now of about $60 million. And so it's ramping significantly from that. And I'd say, based on everything we know today, we're comfortable with that ramp. I'm not 100% sure I understand the question that you asked on the second one. Rob, I mean, you said something about 40% in the second quarter?
Rob Michael: So, Josh, this is Rob. If you look at the guidance and compare that to our total international sales in the prior year that would put you at a 33% operational decline. So I'm not sure how you're getting your 40%.
Bill Chase: And that -- Josh, this is Bill. That would be in the second quarter, as you look at the gating of the impact around biosimilars recognized in Q4, we are going to be comparing against a quarter in the prior year that already had some biosimilars. So you would expect actually that year-over-year impact to be less than what we're seeing in the first three quarters. So it averages out to our overall guidance.
Joshua Schimmer: Okay. Thanks.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks Josh. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
Geoff Meacham: Good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the question. Just had a few. Mike on VENCLEXTA and myeloma the imbalance I'm sure was a surprise, what's the hypothesis at this point. I'm not sure it's clear, what's different about myeloma versus CLR or AML in terms of unique safety tolerability risk and how does this alter your long-term view of the value of the drug? And then, Rick, had another one on capital allocation. You guys have obviously expressed confidence in the long-term trajectory and without a large transaction. So my question is whether there are triggers that would evolve that strategy, for example, like if the -- if OUS HUMIRA is worse than expected later this year or next or your launches don't have initial objectives, what do you do from there and how much of a priority is the payout in that scenario? Thank you very much.
Michael Severino: Okay. So, this is Mike. I'll take the first one. So with respect to Bellini and the imbalance that we observed in mortality in the overall population. Yes, obviously, that was a surprise to us. That's not something that we would have expected to see. I think it's hard to say with certainty what drove that. But I think comparing and contrasting the situation to CLL is important. So what we know about CLL is that CLL is BCL-2 driven and you see that in the efficacy results that we've driven across our CLL program from the very early studies in 17p del from the MURANO study and all the work that we've done. If you look at multiple myeloma, there are, from our perspective, really, really two groups. Now I'm speaking from a BCL-2 biology perspective. There is a subset, which is this subset. So it's a subset, but it's about 20% of multiple myeloma and add it to obviously a significant proportion given that -- we have seen it improved given that myeloma overall is very big. And that subset is very highly BCL-2 driven in its biology. Then there is the broader population where the hypothesis was a little different. There the hypothesis was primarily synergy with proteasome inhibitors that we've seen mechanistically and that we saw in earlier studies. And so the Bellini result is that overall non-selected group. And so while we can't tell you with certainty today what drove that, what we can tell you is that that behavior is very different than what we've seen in other populations. In the group, it's very BCl-2 driven. The early data that we've seen suggests that we should see a good effect and that's why we continue to expect that the drug has a role in that population. Now, obviously, we're going to need to take the time to work with the FDA around the issues of the partial clinical hold, but we do believe that in the long-term there will be a role or at least potential for a role in that population. So that's really the difference between multiple myeloma and CLL. So does this change our long-term view of the value of the asset? No it doesn't change our long-term view of the value of the asset. It doesn't change our view of CLL in anyway. And we had always felt that the larger opportunity because the clearer link to the biology for VENCLEXTA in myeloma was in that biomarker driven population.
Rick Gonzalez: Geoff, this is Rick. So on your question, I think, the best way to think about it is this. If you look at 2019 and I think it is a good test. Our ability and our strategies ability to be able to withstand significant LoE. If you think about 2019 roughly just under $5 billion of HUMIRA that's facing LoE and probably something in the neighborhood of about $500 million of AndroGel that's facing LoE. And you are in the very early stages of the launch of several of our new products like ORILISSA, like SKYRISI and ultimately it will be like upadacitinib. So you're not getting much benefit. In fact if anything you're getting a little downdraft because everyone knows in the first year or so, the pharmaceutical launch of lose money because you have to apply a significant amount of SG&A to it to create the ramp. So you actually have headwinds from a profit performance standpoint. So -- and you can see based on that, we have a business now that still has positive revenue growth and has EPS growth of 11%, let's call it. And yes, there's some share repurchases in there. But if you adjust that share repurchase out, it's still high single-digit EPS growth. So tremendous EPS growth despite those headwinds that we're facing. And I think that demonstrates the strength of the underlying business and it was really designed to be able to deal with that. Now having said that, I don't know that those kinds of dynamics are what's going to drive, how we look at opportunities that exist from an acquisition standpoint. What drives that is what I described before. It is always better to have a stronger business than we can't have too strong of the business. So resets the philosophy that we operate with. And so as we look at different kinds of transactions we evaluate them against their strategic fit. And then, can we get a good return on those assets and if our analysis suggests that we can, then we obviously try to act on those and that's what drives from a capital allocation standpoint where we invest. And I don't see a dramatic change in the way international biosimilars behave, because obviously, I think, we've seen enough of that now that we have a pretty good idea of how they are behaving. And that would drive -- that would be a trigger event in and of itself. I think what will drive -- what we do is ultimately can we build a stronger business, if we were to acquire an asset, whatever that asset maybe.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
Vamil Divan: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So just two on the product side. First for upadacitinib, I think we're about four months from the PDUFA date. Just wondering, I don't know if you -- I apologize, if you mentioned on your prepared remarks. I am wondering, if you have any updated thoughts on the likelihood of the AdCom ahead of decision. And just the impact with other recent safety update on XELJANZ regarding the -- you raised some more questions about thrombosis risk with JAK inhibition and wondering what you -- how you think that might impact the review? And then second one on SKYRIZI, you mentioned the dosing advantage you guys have with TREMFYA, just looking at the label, there is a little bit higher rate of immunogenicity with the product that with TREMFYA. I think it's about 14% of patients had antibodies that can be classified as neutralizing. So just wondering how you think physicians might think of the trade-off between more convenient dosing, but maybe a little bit more immunogenicity for a chronic condition like psoriasis? Thanks.
Michael Severino: Sure. So, this is Mike. I'll take those. With respect to upadacitinib, we are still in the relatively early stages of our review, but we are several months into it. With respect to the likelihood of an AdCom. What I've said before, is that advisory committees are common for these sorts of applications. So for novel molecular entities and rhemathoid arthritis. So it wouldn't be necessarily surprising, if we had one or concern to us if we had one. But based on what we're hearing today, we do not anticipate one. And so, obviously, as we get closer, we'll be able to provide additional color on that. With respect to XELJANZ and the safety finding that came out of their large-scale study. I'd say a couple of things. One, we need to see the data presented in full. We need to see how that translates through their label, but I would point a couple of features. One, that was at a dose that was higher than approved in RA for XELJANZ and it was in a very particular patient population, because it was in their cardiovascular safety study. So these were patients who were selected to be at high risk for cardiovascular disease. So they were a little different than the broader patient population. Our program hasn't demonstrated an increased risk for VTEs for upadacitinib compared to essentially all of the competitors that we had in the trial, which include HUMIRA, includes methotrexate and in our monotherapy studies, for a portion of time, it even includes true placebo. So we feel very good about our data set. With respect to SKYRIZI. What I would point to is the performance of the product. We have very, very strong performance. We are clearly covering the pathway very effectively and doing that with the favorable benefit risk profile. We have skin clearance that's actually rising over time and very durable out to a year. And so I don't see that as a concern at all for us.
Vamil Divan: Okay. Thanks for taking the question.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Vamil. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-01-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Vice Chairman and President; Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration; and Rob Michael, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that some statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 performance as well as our expectations for 2019. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D pipeline, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2019 guidance in more detail. Following our remarks, we will take your questions. We delivered another impressive year with results well above initial expectations. Adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.90, representing growth of more than 28% versus last year and once again achieving our guidance for the quarter. Total adjusted operational sales growth of 8.3% exceeded our guidance for the quarter. This growth was driven by a number of products including hematological oncology portfolio with global operational sales growth of more than 50% and U.S. HUMIRA, which grew by more than 9% versus the last year. Our international HUMIRA sales were down nearly 15%, reflecting the impact of direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other international markets. We also saw a continued strong performance from several other products including MAVYRET, CREON and DUODOPA. AbbVie has demonstrated an exceptional track record of consistently delivering top-tier financial performance despite any market or competitive challenges and 2018 was another clear example of that performance. We continue to drive strong commercial and operational execution, resulting in full year 2018 global operational sales growth of more than 15% and adjusted earnings per share growth of more than 41%. As we look at the evolution of our business and of our strategy, we're pleased with the progress that we’re making. AbbVie's strategy has contemplated biosimilar competition since day one of the launch of this Company. Our focus has been on building a pipeline that would allow us to absorb the impact of biosimilar competition, and maintain a strong and growing business. Although our work is never done, we have made tremendous progress, building what we believe is one of the industry's most attractive pipelines. In hematological oncology, we have built a powerhouse franchise with IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. Today, this franchise is roughly $4 billion with more than $1 billion of growth expected in 2019, and significant growth anticipated over our long range plan. In immunology, HUMIRA in the U.S. will continue to generate strong revenue, driving roughly $1 billion of growth in 2019. Since we became an independent company, our research and development efforts in immunology have focused on identifying and advancing new assets that can deliver efficacy superiority to HUMIRA and other new agents. Given the importance of this growth platform, we understood that in order to maintain and expand our leadership position, the development of highly differentiated assets was absolutely critical. We are now confident that with risankizumab and upadacitinib, we have accomplished our objective. Both of our next-generation immunology therapies have demonstrated across multiple clinical trials superiority versus HUMIRA and other competitive offerings. This efficacy was shown across the broad spectrum of patients, including bio-naïve patients at one end of the treatment paradigm and very difficult to treat patients who would fail one or more therapies at the other end of the spectrum. In our hands, these assets have the ability to become the new standards of care in immunology. We expect to launch both risankizumab and upadacitinib in 2019, and based on their profiles, anticipate broad formulary access. Beyond our new therapies hem-onc and immunology, we’ve also developed other assets that represent attractive multibillion-dollar revenue opportunities, such as MAVYRET and ORILISSA. And we have a base business that includes therapies like CREON, DUODOPA, SYNTHROID and LUPRON, all products we expect will remain durable for many years to come. The event that has for many years concerned investors most has been the loss of exclusivity for HUMIRA. Certainly the most frequently asked question that we get is what impact will biosimilars have on AbbVie's business. We have long been planning and preparing for the event that is now upon us. We are now facing direct biosimilar competition in Europe and other countries, which represent approximately 75% of our international HUMIRA business or approximately 25% of total global HUMIRA revenues. As we described on our third quarter call, biosimilar competitors have been more aggressive with HUMIRA than previous anti-TNF biosimilar analogs. But, despite the more aggressive discounting, our strategy is working as we had intended. 2019 is a year that should clearly demonstrate to all investors that AbbVie is once again delivering on its commitments. In 2019, we will absorb roughly $2 billion of erosion related to biosimilar competition and roughly $400 million of additional impact following the entry of generic competition for AndroGel 1.62. We're also facing an extremely difficult comparison period due to the outstanding growth we drove in 2018. And in 2019, we’ll also be funding five major products or indication launches. Yet despite all of these challenges, AbbVie expects to deliver positive revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth this year. This level of performance demonstrates that the strategy we have in place is working as we planned, and it should re-ensure all investors of our ability to absorb the impact of direct biosimilar competition while maintaining a strong, growing and vibrant business. Further to that point, our ability to deliver industry-leading EPS growth in 2019, despite the challenges I just outlined, is particularly notable, given that this year many of our key pipeline assets will be at the very early stages of their launch trajectory and therefore providing minimal offset to the biosimilar impact. Given their product profiles, we expect these pipeline assets will grow substantially over the next several years and provide significant offset to the 2023 U.S. biosimilar event. So, as I said, we are pleased with the progress with our strategy, and investors should view 2019 as a real test of that strategy. In summary, this is important time for AbbVie. The continuing momentum of our U.S. business and our hematological oncology franchise, combined with the launch and ramp of several new products will allow us to grow through biosimilar impact in 2019, just as we have predicted. We've demonstrated a strong track record of managing and overcoming challenges and our expected performance from 2019 is another clear example of that. And while we are certainly proud of what we've accomplished in the first six years as an independent company, I can tell you, we remain focused and committed to delivering our long-term vision for the Company, sustained, top-tier performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. 2018 was a very productive year with significant pipeline advancement, including numerous development and regulatory achievements and successful data readouts across our pipeline. We secured regulatory approvals for several programs including VENCLEXTA in the broad relapse/refractory CLL population, and conditional approval for VENCLEXTA in newly diagnosed AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy; approval for IMBRUVICA in combination with Rituxan as the first chemotherapy-free combination treatment for Waldenström's, the 9th FDA approval for IMBRUVICA overall; and for ORILISSA, for the management of moderate-to-severe pain associated with endometriosis. We completed registrational studies and submitted regulatory applications for our two next generation immunology therapies, risankizumab and its initial indication, psoriasis; and upadacitinib in its first indication, rheumatoid arthritis. Across each of the four Phase 3 studies in the pivotal program for psoriasis, risankizumab showed consistent, high, durable rates of skin clearance. Based on these results, we believe risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-naïve and TNF-inadequate responder patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis while offering the convenience of quarterly dosing. Our regulatory reviews are well underway with approval decisions expected in the second quarter. With upadacitinib, our goal is to deliver a differentiated treatment to RA patients. We designed a broad and comprehensive set of six pivotal studies in RA, enrolling nearly 5,000 patients across multiple populations, including two studies with biologic comparators. We evaluated upadacitinib head-to-head against the standards of care in RA, including methotrexate and HUMIRA, and in a broad range of patient types within the moderate-to-severe RA segment. This includes monotherapy treatment in patients who are naïve to methotrexate as well as studies in very difficult to treat patients who have failed one or more biologic therapies. Across the select clinical program, both doses of upadacitinib performed extremely well and demonstrated a strong benefit risk profile. Based on our analysis of the data generated across the registrational program, we believe the 15-milligram dose represents the best dose for the RA indication as it delivered maximal efficacy across a wide range of studies, drove strong results on important structural endpoints, and demonstrated superiority to HUMIRA in our head-to-head study. Thus, this does provides the differentiation we were seeking when we designed our program. Our regulatory submissions are currently under review and we expect approval decisions in the second half of this year. In addition to the successful trial readouts for upadacitinib and risankizumab, we also reported positive data from several Phase 3 studies in other areas of our pipeline, including elagolix uterine fibroids, VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL, and data from several important Phase 3 studies in our frontline CLL program for IMBRUVICA, including results from the ECOG, ALLIANCE and iLLUMINATE trials. Data from these three studies showed treatment with IMBRUVICA alone or in combination, significantly prolonged progression-free survival comparative therapies such as FCR, BR GAZYVA plus chlorambucil in previously untreated CLL patients. We also initiated several Phase 3 programs, including studies for upadacitinib in atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. In addition to the progress we made across our late-stage programs, we also advanced a number of early-stage assets in the mid-stage development, including our JAK BTK program in RA and our CD40 program in ulcerative colitis. And, we transitioned several preclinical programs into human trials including our novel TNF steroid conjugate, and our RORgammaT programs. Clearly, we made tremendous progress, advancing our pipeline in 2018, and we look forward to many important pipeline milestones in 2019 as well. In hematologic oncology, we will see data from several Phase 3 studies for VENCLEXTA this year, including results from the BELLINI trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and from our two frontline and AML studies, as well as the detail data from CLL14, our Phase 3 study for VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL. These data and subsequent label augmentations will build upon the body of evidence demonstrating VENCLEXTA's potential as a foundational treatment option across a number of hematologic malignancies. Earlier this month, the VENCLEXTA CLL14 data were selected for FDA’s real-time oncology review program. This program is aimed at expediting the review and approval process for supplemental drug applications. Results from CLL14 have already been shared with the FDA, which is part of the agency's evaluation process, leading to the decision to offer the real-time review. Very soon, we will begin submitting data, as part of the review process, and expect an approval decisions later this year. We look forward to bringing this new treatment to market in the frontline CLL population. In the area of solid tumors, we’ll see later this year from our Phase 3 study for depatux-m in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. This is an extremely difficult to treat from of brain cancer with a very high unmet need and limited treatment options. We’ve seen encouraging trends in overall survival in our Phase 2 study in second line GBM, and look forward to the results of our frontline Phase 3 study to define the future regulatory path for the program. We also expect several assets from our early-stage solid tumor programs to transition to proof-of-concept studies this year, and will share data from these programs as they mature. In the area of immunology, as I previously mentioned, we expect regulatory decisions later this year for upadacitinib in RA and risankizumab in psoriasis. In addition to their lead indications, we continue to make great progress with upadacitinib and risankizumab in a number of other immune-mediated conditions. This year, we’ll report mid-stage data for upadacitinib in axial SpA, and we plan to begin Phase 3 development in giant cell arteritis. Overall, this year, we’ll have 10 active ongoing registration-enabling programs for upadacitinib and risankizumab. We’re also making good progress with our early-stage immunology pipeline, which includes programs aimed at redefining the standard of care in autoimmune diseases. We have several promising assets including ABBV-323, our CD40 antagonist; ABBV-3373, our TNF steroid conjugate; and ABBV-599, our combination JAK BTK-inhibitor. And in the area of women's health, following completion of the pivotal trials for elagolix in uterine fibroids, we plan to submit our regulatory application around the middle of the year. So, in summary, in 2018, we made tremendous progress advancing our pipeline, achieving a number of key clinical and regulatory milestones across all of our therapeutic areas. And we expect 2019 to be another very productive year for our R&D organization. We look forward to updating you on our pipeline progress throughout the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our 2018 performance and our 2019 guidance. Bill?
Bill Chase: Thanks, Mike. Today, I'll review the highlights of our performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2018, and then walk through our 2019 outlook. As Rick mentioned, we have completed another year of outstanding performance, delivering top and bottom line growth that ranks AbbVie among the very-top of our industry peers. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $7.91, up more than 40% compared to 2017 and $1.44 above the midpoint of our initial expectations for the year. For the year, adjusted revenues were $32.7 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis, excluding a nearly 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange. For the fourth quarter, total revenues were $8.3 billion, an increase of 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. This performance reflects double-digit underlying volume growth offset by approximately 2.5 points of negative price. Global sales of HUMIRA were $4.9 billion in the quarter, up 1.4% operationally. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 9.1% compared to the prior year, reflecting high-single-digit volume growth plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter, down 14.8% operationally, reflecting the introduction of biosimilar competition across Europe and other international markets. Global HUMIRA sales for the full -year 2018 were $19.9 billion, reflecting operational sales growth of 7.4%. Full-year sales of HUMIRA in the U.S. grew more than 10%, and international HUMIRA sales approached $6.3 billion, performing in line with our expectations. Hematologic oncology global sales were $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 50.3% on an operational basis, driven by the continued strong growth of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. In the quarter, IMBRUVICA net revenues were $1 billion, primarily driven by continued uptake in the frontline CLL segment. VENCLEXTA revenues were $124 million in the quarter, driven by continued uptake in the second line plus setting, as a result of our midyear approval in the broad relapsed/refractory CLL segment. For the full-year, our hem-onc global revenues were $3.9 billion, up 45.8% on an operational basis. Global HCV sales for the fourth quarter were $862 million. MAVYRET continues to perform well, holding roughly 50% market share globally. For the full-year, HCV sales exceeded $3.6 billion and was above our previous communicated guidance. We also saw continued double-digit operational sales growth for both DUODOPA and CREON.  Turning now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 79.8% of sales, up 80 basis points compared to the prior year. This was inclusive of the year-over-year benefit related to the termination of certain royalties with HUMIRA, partially offset by the dilutive impact of partnership accounting. Adjusted R&D was 16.5% of sales, supporting our pipeline programs in oncology, immunology, and other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 21.6% of sales, an increase of 30 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting continued investment in our on-market products as well as investment in advance of several upcoming product launches. The adjusted operating margin was 41.7% of sales in the fourth quarter, an improvement of over 100 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $319 million and the adjusted tax rate was 9.1% in the quarter. Fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share, excluding specified items were $1.90, up 28.4% year-over-year. In the quarter, we recorded a net charge of $2.75 per share, related to the partial impairment of intangible assets, acquired as part of the Stemcentrx acquisition. The net after-tax impact of this impairment and the related adjustment to contingent consideration liabilities was $4.1 billion. This one-time net charge has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. As we look ahead to 2019, our full-year adjusted EPS range is $8.65 to $8.75, reflecting growth of 10% at the midpoint. Excluded from this guidance is $1.26 of known intangible amortization and specified items, as well as non-cash charges for contingent consideration adjustments related to the expected approval of risankizumab in the first half of the year. On the topline, in 2019, we expect revenue growth of approximately 1% on an operational basis. At current rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have just less than 1% unfavorable impact on reported sales growth. Included in our revenue guidance are the following assumptions for our key products. In 2019, we expect U.S. HUMIRA to once again be an important contributor to our performance, with revenue growth of approximately 7%. We expect 2019 international HUMIRA to be down approximately 30% on an operational basis, reflecting the impact of biosimilar competition outside of the U.S. For our hem-onc franchise, we expect global revenues of approximately $5.1 billion, contributing more than $1 billion of growth; this includes IMBRUVICA global revenues to AbbVie approaching $4.4 billion with U.S. sales growth of approximately 21%. For VENCLEXTA, we expect sales of approximately $725 million. We expect global HCV sales of approximately $3.3 billion in 2019, with roughly flat performance in the U.S. and international sales of approximately $1.7 billion. For ORILISSA, we expect sales of approximately $200 million. We are pleased with the early stages of the launch, and expect demand to ramp, given recent increased formulary access, which now stands at approximately 70%. For CREON, we expect approximately 10% sales growth; for DUODOPA, we expect revenues approaching $500 million; for LUPRON, SYNTHROID and SYNERGIST, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year. And for AndroGel, we are forecasting sales of approximately $100 million, following the entry of generic competition for AndroGel 1.62. Finally, we are expecting a regulatory decision for both risankizumab and upadacitinib, later this year. We will provide specific guidance for these assets following their respective approvals.  Looking at the P&L for 2019. We are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of above 82.5%. This profile reflects a year-over-year benefit of HUMIRA royalty reduction, as well as the impact of partnership accounting. We are forecasting R&D expense of approximately 15.5% of sales, reflecting funding actions supporting all stages of our pipeline. We are forecasting SG&A to be approximately 20.5% of sales in support of five major product or indication launches. For 2019, we e are forecasting an operating margin ratio of just above 46.5%, roughly 200 basis points above prior year, inclusive of the required investment on our new product launches. We expect net interest expense approaching $1.3 billion, and we model a non-GAAP tax rate, just above our full-year rate in 2018. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.05 and $2.07, excluding approximately $0.31 of specified items. We anticipate first quarter revenue of approximately $7.7 billion. At current rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on reported sales growth of approximately 2% in the first quarter. For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales of approximately $3.2 billion; we expect international HUMIRA sales of approximately $1.2 billion, assuming current exchange rates. And for IMBRUVICA, we expect sales of approximately $1 billion. Moving now to the P&L for the first quarter, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio in line with full-year guidance and spending levels slightly favorable relative to the full-year profile due to investment timing. We expect an adjusted tax rate, just below 8% in the first quarter, lower than our expected full year rate, reflecting the fact that the tax impact of equity compensation is most pronounced in the first quarter of each year. In summary, AbbVie has once again delivered an excellent quarter and full-year results. We’ve driven top tier revenue and EPS growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And our strong growth prospects have enabled us to position the business for yet another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2019, despite biosimilar dynamics and the required investments to support several major product and indication launches. We are very pleased with AbbVie’s strong performance. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Bill. We’ll now open the call for questions. Operator, first question, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: Thank you very much. In 2019, if HUMIRA grows $1 billion in U.S. but declines $2 billion o-U.S., it would have to grow up 11% in 2020 to hit the $21 billion guidance figure. Is that still your expectation? Secondly, do you anticipate an FDA AdCom for upadacitinib? And then, lastly, perhaps in part due to AbbVie’s openness to do a deal and its desire to have another therapeutic vertical, there's been some speculation that AbbVie might pursue a big deal, even in an unfriendly way. Considering the many moving parts at AbbVie, what is your appetite right now for a big deal and would you consider an unfriendly one? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Yes. Steve, this is Rick. So, I’ll cover one and three, and then Mike can cover number two. So, first of all, if you look at HUMIRA, obviously, we continue to see strong growth in the U.S.; we’re continuing to see the biosimilar effect play out. We've assumed within our planning period of 2019 that we’ll see some continued erosion from a price standpoint across the time period that is greater than what we currently have -- is currently in place. So, obviously, we’ll have to see how that plays out. In the end, if we look at the long-term targets that we put in place, we still feel confident in the overall long-term targets. Whether or not one product is slightly different than another, I mean we'll see how that plays out, but we obviously feel confident in what we have committed to and we maintain that commitment. As far as the appetite for a big deal, I can tell you that is not something that we are contemplating.
Michael Severino: Okay. So, this is Mike. I'll take number two. With respect to upa and the potential for an AdCom, I think it's important to keep in mind that we’re in very-early stages of a regulatory review. But, if you look at the practice of this review division, it's common for filings like this for new molecular entities in RA to go to an AdCom. So, it's certainly possible article. But, we’ll have a much better idea once we’re further along in the review process.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.
Andrew Baum: Thank you. Apologies if I missed the early part of the call. But, just in terms of what's embedded in your 2019 adjusted earnings guidance for HUMIRA in international markets, if you could give us additional color on that that would be great. Second, you recently had a management reorg. Could you talk to that in relation to also succession planning of the organization? And then, finally, you disclosed a couple of negative headlines in two Phase 3 veliparib trials over a year-ago. I haven't seen the data for that. It's just broader interest as what is -- as when might we see that data being presented. Many thanks.
Bill Chase: Hi, Andrew. I’ll start with your first question. It’s Bill Chase. Our guidance around HUMIRA for 2019 is in the U.S. strong growth, 7% is what we are recommending to model. Outside of the U.S., obviously with the advent of biosimilars, we are forecasting a decline, and currently we view that as about 30% on an operational basis.
Rick Gonzalez: So, Andrew, this is Rick. I'll cover number two. We did announce a change in our organizational structure at the executive level. The purpose of that change -- and we've operated now for six years with a fairly a broad management structure reporting to me, and the purpose of the change really was to narrow the focus of the direct reports that I had that ultimately would allow us to focus and execute even at a higher level around where our strategy is going forward. In addition, we have a very talented executive leadership team and we wanted to get those people some additional experience in other areas, and this will allow us to be able to do that. I've heard all the rumors about potentially me retiring. I can tell you they are not true. As many of you probably know, I retired once. And I can tell you, I'm heck of a lot better running AbbVie than I was at retirement. So, hopefully that clarifies it.
Michael Severino: This is Mike. With respect to veliparib data, so, we announced those topline results when we had them. We’re committed to publishing all results and making the data available. I don’t have a specific meeting or a specific timeframe to point to here on the call today. But, we will be making those data publicly available.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Andrew. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
Geoff Meacham: I just had a few on HUMIRA. For O-U.S., are there countries that still need to be contractual locked in for ‘19? And what’s your new guidance, Bill? Are there resets at year-end looking to 2020 and beyond? And then, when you guys talk about the U.S., the strategy seems to be moving HUMIRA to later in the paradigm across different markets and then upada and rizu upstream. As you guys get closer to launch, are you thinking about -- how is the contracting going to make this happen? Is it just about discounts or rebates or other more novel strategies under discussion?
Rick Gonzalez: So, this is Rick. I will cover those first two. So, there are still some countries where obviously, it is still evolving. The southern European countries are probably the most significant, and to some extent in Germany. I’d say, we haven't seen a lot of movement in price over the last 60 days or so. But, we are anticipating -- and as I said, we built into our forecast some incremental decline in price, just to make sure that we felt comfortable with where it potentially could go. As far as other countries in 2020, the majority of the volume doesn't come under additional biosimilar exposure in 2020. The more significant countries are in 2021. So, there is some, but the majority of it occurs in 2021, not in 20. As far as what you described as contracting dynamics, I think if you talk about our go-to-market strategy for these products, we’re not in a position, nor from a competitive standpoint do I think we would want to talk about at this point what our go-to-market strategy is. But, I think in general, the way you can think about these assets and then certainly the way we're thinking about it is, now that we’ve produced the data on upa and risa across the broad range of indications, it is validated for us that these assets ultimately are superior to what’s out there today. And clearly, as I indicated, we now have enough data across a broad range of clinical trials and across a broad range of patient population from naïve patients to TNF inadequate responding patients that we know these assets will ultimately be able to deliver significantly superior results to both HUMIRA as well as other assets that are out there, other medicines that are out there. And therefore, the logical strategy with these assets is to position them to be lead products in the marketplace. We would obviously put a contracting strategy in place that will be consistent with that approach, and obviously we will find those launches in a way to be able to drive that approach in the marketplace, both in the U.S. as well as outside the U.S. And we expect the uptake to be consistent with the profile of those assets.
Liz Shea: Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.
Tim Anderson: I have a question on spending infrastructure over the long-term. So, naturally, the big concern is HUMIRA biosimilars and how that impacts the P&L. And one of the levers you could potentially pull is cutting cost some point in the future. And I know you've given long-term operating margin guidance. But, can you give us kind of more detail on how you see SG&A and R&D evolving over time? I’m wondering if you can call large amounts of spending out of these line items. It seems like that could be challenging in the context of still investing heavily in the INI space with your other assets. So, how much is spending, a major lever that can be pulled in the future? And then, second question just goes back to HUMIRA international. So, in October, you revised down your erosion guidance. And now, just three months later, you’ve revised it down again in terms of international performance for 2019. Can we be confident that you won't have to revise it down yet again at another point in the current year?
Rick Gonzalez: So, I'll cover most of those questions, and Bill can fill in if anything that I haven't covered. So, let me start with what you described as the guidance. And let me go through the history of the guidance because I think it is important to lay out. We came out with the original guidance back in 2015, and that was based on what we saw out in the marketplace primarily at the time REMICADE and then followed it with ENBREL. And we updated it I think in 2017, specifically what we thought. And then from that point forward, we said we needed [ph] to see what it would look like going forward. On the third quarter call, what we -- we were only, to my best of my recollection, three weeks into biosimilars. Right? And we made it fairly clear, and I think if you go back and if you read this transcript, it's fairly clear that what we were giving the market was a snapshot of what we saw at that time. And in fact, I think I said at the time, you should not assume this is guidance, it's likely to get worse. So, hopefully, we were clear at that point. As far as specifically to your question, as I indicated, we have built in further erosion that we haven't seen yet. So, in the number that Bill described, the 30% to 31%, which is roughly 5 points above where it was before, that has some assumed erosion that has not occurred. And look, what we're giving you is our best estimate of what will happen. Obviously, this is driven by -- not us, it’s driven by competitors and their behavior. And so, ultimately, it's not like we have a crystal ball that we can predict exactly what they do. What I can tell you is this. We have a high level of confidence in delivering the bottom line performance that we described to the market, and we have enough ability to be able to do that and we have a high level of confidence in double-digit EPS. So, that's what you should rely upon. Whether or not things move around a little bit? They could. But to the best of our ability, we are forecasting what we believe. And I think I'd say, it's a reasonably high probability that those numbers should be accurate. As far as spending in infrastructure, I mean obviously, as we look at what's going on in these various markets, just like we do with any product that experiences an LOE, reflects as quickly as possible the spending around those products to be reflective of what's appropriate in that particular market in those circumstances. And we’re certainly doing that with you HUMIRA right now in the international markets. But, obviously, one of the things that's important to remember here is, we're going to launch -- or really either just launched or will launch over the course of the next 12 months, four major products that have multibillion-dollar potential. If you think about VENCLEXTA, it's in its very early stages now; it's just received the broad label in CLL and in AML. So, it's essentially a relatively small product that’s now growing rapidly. ORILISSA, we just launched that product. We’re going to launch upadacitinib; we’re going to launch risankizumab. These are all multibillion-dollar assets. We’re going to fund those to the extent that is appropriate to drive the potential because that is ultimately what will offset and absorb the biosimilar impact. And so, that's the strategy that we’ll drive.
Bill Chase: Yes. The only thing I’d also add is as you look at the 50%, look, the big part of the story from here on out is going to be obviously P&L leverage, given robust sales that we’re expecting once these new products get up to into their ramp. So, 2020 should be a sales expansion year. But, even then, we’re always going to be thoughtful about how we deploy our resources. If you look at this year, on a operational sales increase of 1%, we’re still delivering 200 basis points of op margin progress. So, I think that's pretty good. And we are appropriately funding those new product launches. The only way you can do that is being thoughtful about your overall book of SG&A and do some prudent reallocation. And obviously, you could infer to that happening in the numbers this year. So, look, we’re always going to be thoughtful on spend. But, the real way to get an improved op margin is going to be through sales leverage, P&L leverage. And we are going to remain focused on making sure that we appropriately fund new opportunities.
Rick Gonzalez: And the only other thing I would add is, I think it’s important to keep in perspective how this business is performing. You have a business here that for six years has delivered top-tier performance. Last year, we grew the bottom line 41% with the top line 15%. If you look at 2019 and you look at that guidance range at the midpoint being 10%, you back out the share repurchase, which is about 3 or 4 points of it, it says that the underlying business, despite taking almost $2.5 billion hit, is growing at 6% or 7% from an EPS standpoint. If you adjusted for the $2.5 billion, the bottom line is growing at 23%. There aren’t many businesses around here that have that kind of performance. Top line is same thing. If I adjust the top line, which is roughly 1%, if I adjust it for the $2.5 billion, the rest of the business is growing high-single-digits. And so, you certainly want to make sure that you're in a position that you can continue to drive this business in a way that it can continue to perform because that is ultimately the way you’re going to absorb biosimilars. And I would tell you that despite the fact that these biosimilars have priced more aggressively than we thought or the analogs would have suggested, the business is absorbing them effectively, and that's what the strategy was designed to do.
Operator: Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from SVB Leerink. 
Geoffrey Porges: First, could you just talk a little bit about pricing, Rick? What assumptions about pricing you baked into your guidance for particularly U.S. revenue growth in 2019, and what do you think of the political risks that could affect that outlook? And then, secondly, could you talk a little bit about the launches of upa and risa in 2019? Could you help us understand what if any ability you have two prepare for those launches in your discussions with payers? Should we be expecting them to launch with the same sort of trajectories as the preceding products in that class or should we push those launches out to 2020, as you get into that payer cycle? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: I think if you look at pricing, we have now -- we were one of the companies that made a commitment that we're going to do one price increase per year, a couple of years ago, and it would be below double digits. And we've obviously honored that going forward. So, we've done the price increase for this year. You saw that it was lower, 6.2% roughly. And so, I think you know what the pricing will be in 2019 because we have no intention of doing another price increase in 2019. I think, if you look overall, yes, the industry has adjusted to some extent I believe to the environment as it relates to pricing. Our business is not a business that is driven to any great extent by pricing. We’re fortunate that we have innovative products, and volume is the vast majority of it, though I mean you're probably talking -- 2019, you're probably talking overall negative price.
Bill Chase: For the entire book of business in the U.S., low single digit.
Rick Gonzalez: Yes. So, it’s not heavily reliant upon price, nor last year was it heavily reliant upon price. So, I think we're comfortable with where we are from a pricing standpoint. We don’t see any exposure related to that. As far as, upa and risa, obviously, we will want to get these products on formulary as broadly and as quickly as possible. I would say, that's an area that we have a team that is good at doing that, effective at doing that. And so, obviously, based on the fact that we assume risa is going to be approved here in the not too distant future, we have to be in a position we are in discussions, nothing that we update you here on. But, I would say the operating assumption that is probably a good assumption is that we will end up with broad coverage of these assets. As far as the ramp is concerned, I think I understood your question, and I'm going to answer it in the backdrop of what I thought you asked. What I thought you asked is how would I compare these to prior competitive launches? And I can tell you that we would expect, like other launches that will take a little bit of time in order to ramp. But, I'd say also, with our expertise in this area and the portfolio of assets that we have and the profile of these particular drugs from a clinical standpoint, I would expect that these assets will be able to drive significant share over time, and a significant capture of new patients and switching patients. And that will certainly be the strategy we have in place to drive a significant part of those available patients to these better assets.
Liz Shea: Thanks. Operator, next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.
Chris Schott: Thanks very much for the questions. My first one is just following up on the longer-term international HUMIRA business, so beyond 2019. Do you see 2019 as a peak rate of erosion for that business and then maybe more moderate step downs beyond 2019, or could we see several years of this more severe erosion level as we just think about kind of getting past this year and the outlook for that business? My second question was on capital allocation. And I guess, is the more challenging HUMIRA environment change or alter your priorities at all? I guess, specifically, the Company’s been very active on the share repo front over the past few years. But, how do you balance, I guess that repo with priority with diversification, given some of these HUMIRA dynamics that we’re seeing playing out?
Rick Gonzalez: So, I think, I would see that you have gotten the vast majority of the impact from a price erosion standpoint in 2019. But, remember what I described before. We have factored into our plan further erosion as you go throughout. So, there’ll be some annualization impact that you would obviously see in 2020, if that is going to play out the way that we have planned for. And then, you will have some countries that will go biosimilar in ‘21; they have not gone biosimilar today. And then, we obviously have some impact, although I would say most of those countries, it should be a lower impact, but we’re going to have to see how that sorts itself out. So, certainly, I don't think you will see a step down that’s as significant as we’ve seen in the first year because there have been very aggressive pricings in certain countries. And so, we’ll obviously get to the point at which the biosimilar players have gotten to what they believe is the floor where they want to operate. And so, I think you should see it moderate, I guess, is the best way to describe it. As far as capital allocation versus share repo, I’d say, if you look at how we’ve operated this business since day one, we’ve obviously been very vocal about how we view the business and what our mission and what our vision is for the business; and that is to drive long-term, sustainable top-tier performance. And in order to do that, you have to invest in the business appropriately. We have obviously invested significantly in R&D. Since we launched the Company, we grew significantly. We've obviously been very active from a BD standpoint. At the same time, we have a business that generates a tremendous amount of cash flow, and we generated enough cash flow that we had opportunities to be able to also do share repurchase and other methods of being able to returning capital to shareholders, such as the growing dividend. And so, we try to balance those things in a way that is appropriate but never to not strategically invest in the business. That’s always our first priority. If you look at the share repo that we’ve done in 2018, as an example, I think the thing you have to remember, and the numbers I quoted a minute ago I think are reflective of that. Share repo is driving some of the EPS growth, if you look at the midpoint. But, it’s relatively modest, 3 to 4 percentage of that. And it wasn’t driven for the purpose of doing that. Ultimately, we did the share repo and we announced it, I believe, in that first quarter call that we were going to do a significant amount of share repo because of tax reform, and we thought that was fundamentally important to be able return cash and capital back to shareholders. And so, we did it long before we ever knew what the biosimilar pricing would be. So, it wasn’t driven for the purpose of driving the short-term versus the long-term. Having said all that, we continue to be active and looking at opportunities there are out there. We have a very active business development group. We look at things that are small, things that are medium, things that are large, and we certainly have the wherewithal to be able to do things, if we could find something that strategically fit and we could get a good return on that, I can tell you we would act and we would act swiftly in order to do that. I think you’ve seen us do that before. If we could find another IMBRUVICA or we could find another risankizumab out there, I can tell you we would aggressively pursue that. And so, we fundamentally have a pipeline that we believe has the ability to do what we strategically intended it to do, and that is to absorb the impact of biosimilars. Our focus is to ramp that pipeline as rapidly as we possibly can and make sure we're in a position to be able to continue to drive strong growth in the business.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, we’ll take the next question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.
Jason Gerberry: Thanks for taking my questions. First one, just coming back to U.S. HUMIRA, just curious, the softening of the 2019 number, just sort of curious, to what degree is that cannibalization from the next generation immunology brands, sort of curious, if that's a factor or if it really is just sort of maybe the moderation of pricing. And then, my second question, I guess with Jamie no longer on these calls, I'll ask the question. Rick, how are you defining a large M&A deal? That's a question that we’re getting from investors. So, if you can maybe put some parameters around that that would be great.
Rick Gonzalez: Last time I defined a large bolt-on, it had a undesirable reaction in the marketplace. The largest transaction that we've done so far has been Pharmacyclics. That's what I view as a -- the size of roughly a large bolt-on kinds of transaction. And when I say a large deal, I'm thinking about a very significant kind of deal, merger type deals; we’re not contemplating anything of that magnitude at all. U.S. HUMIRA, do you want to cover that, Bill?
Bill Chase: Yes, sure. So, if you look at U.S. HUMIRA, we're guiding 7% in 2019. That's coming off of a number in ‘18 of 10%, and with, as I thank you pointed out, a lighter price increase on the years. So, if you really factor out the change in pricing year-over-year, you'll see that the business is still performing very, very well; volumes are still pretty much pegged right where they have been historically. You got the law of large numbers here a little bit. But, I wouldn't read much into underlying dynamics on HUMIRA other than continued strong performance in the U.S.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Jason. Operator, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Katherine Xu from William Blair.
Katherine Xu: I'm just curious about the hem-onc franchise strategy. Apparently, IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA are doing well. What are you thinking about boosting over that? There is of course the case [ph] that you used have with other companies and returned, and there is also the cellular therapy -- therapeutic space there. I was just wondering about your general strategy there?
Rick Gonzalez: Mike?
Michael Severino: This is Mike. I’ll take that. With respect to our hem-onc franchise, both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA are performing very well, both from a data perspective and from their trajectories in the marketplace. One of the things that I think is particularly attractive about those two, with respect to our franchise, is that they cover a broad range of hem malignancies. They work well together in areas like CLL and mantle cell lymphoma, MCL, and they also have some unique areas, for example, like venetoclax in AML. So, that’s going to be an important area for us going forward. It’s now annualizing over $4 billion; it’s growing at a robust rate. So, I think, you can expect to see us continue to work in this area. We’re going to look at how we not only continue to develop those mechanisms in areas like multiple myeloma for VENCLEXTA, but also how from our earlier pipeline we can add additional mechanism, so that will further strengthen our position in hem-onc. And there are lot of things in our early, now approaching mid-stage pipeline work in apoptosis and other areas that could apply there. And of course, we’re looking more broadly than that. You’ve seen us do early stage deals, but early stage deals that give us access to interesting technologies. We have some very early plays that could be in toward cellular therapies and to other mechanisms that could further develop that franchise.
Liz Shea: Thanks, Katherine. That concludes today’s conference call. If you’d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning. Welcome to the AbbVie third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are: Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration; and Rob Michael, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that statements we make today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Following our prepared remarks we'll take your questions. So with that I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our third quarter performance, our full-year 2018 guidance, and I'll provide some comments about our expectations for 2019. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D pipeline and Bill will discuss the quarter in more detail. Following our remarks, as usual, we will take your questions. We delivered another quarter of outstanding performance with results once again ahead of our expectations. We've driven strong commercial, operational, and R&D execution resulting in industry-leading top and bottom line growth. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.14, representing growth of more than 50% versus last year. Total adjusted operational sales growth of 18.5% was driven by a number of products in our portfolio including HUMIRA with global operational sales growth of nearly 10% and IMBRUVICA which grew more than 40% versus the prior year. HCV was a substantial contributor in the quarter with more than $860 million in sales, and we also saw strong performance from several other products including VENCLEXTA, CREON, DUODOPA and LUPON. Based on the continued strength of our business in the quarter and our progress year to date, we are raising our 2018 earnings guidance for the fourth time this year. We now expect full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $7.90 to $7.92, reflecting growth of more than 41% at the midpoint. This represents exceptional earnings growth and puts us at the very top of our industry peer group. And while 2018 certainly sets a very high bar for performance, we expect strong earnings growth once again next year. Although it's too early to provide specific growth targets for 2019 as we're still in the midst of our annual planning process, based on our strong underlying business momentum, we are confident in our ability to deliver double digit earnings growth once again in 2019. And importantly, we expect to deliver this level of growth despite a number of factors including direct biosimilar competition, impacting our more than $6 billion international HUMIRA business; a difficult comparison year, particularly in light of the rapid ramp of our HCV business in 2018; and the significant investment we will be making in 2019 to support new product launches including VENCLEXTA, ORILISSA, risankizumab and upadacitinib. Clearly 2019 will be an important year for AbbVie, an opportunity for us to clearly demonstrate our ability to continue to drive strong earnings growth. In addition to the strong bottom line performance, we also expect to continue to generate significant cash flows. Underscoring the continued confidence in our business, today we're announcing 11.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.96 per share to $1.07 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2019. Since our inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend nearly 170%. Also in the quarter, we announced two additional patent license agreements over proposed HUMIRA biosimilar products. These agreements, of which there are now five in total, are yet another example of the strength of our intellectual property, and we remain confident that we will not see direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until 2023. As we look at our business and evaluate our prospects, just about every aspect of our business is performing at or above our expectations. Our pipeline remains one of the best in the industry and the progress we're making to bring new products to the market will allow us to support our long-term growth expectations. Let me highlight a few examples. We have invested significantly in oncology over the past several years to build a major new growth driver for AbbVie. Today our hematological oncology portfolio is now annualizing above $4 billion and growing at a robust rate, including growth of more than 48% in the third quarter. As we continue to generate data that validates the utility of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA across a wide range of patient populations and cancer types, we expect this franchise to drive significant growth for many years to come. This growth will be driven by further penetration in front-line CLL where we have a very broad clinical program including numerous trials evaluating our assets in different combinations against the other first line therapies including the gold standard FCR. Growth will also be driven by expansion into other malignancies like AML and multiple myeloma, both sizeable indications that represent a multibillion dollar peak sales opportunity. We're also well positioned to grow our strong leadership position in immunology, with the introduction of our two new therapies, risankizumab and upadacitinib. As we've built our immunology pipeline, our focus was to identify assets that not only improved performance over HUMIRA, currently the gold standard, but offered differentiated profiles versus other new mechanisms. We firmly believe that our two next generation assets have the potential to be best in category. Risankizumab and upadacitinib are on track to launch in 2019, and we're confident based on their profiles both will perform very well and drive significant growth. This gives us three to four years of ramp and the opportunity to drive significant uptake of these two therapies prior to the expected entry of direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. Elagolix is yet another compelling asset that represents a multibillion dollar growth opportunity. The recent launch of ORILISSA in endometriosis is tracking right in line with our assumptions, with broad formulary coverage expected by early 2019. We expect to submit our regulatory application for uterine fibroids, another attractive follow-on indication, next year. This is an extremely exciting time for AbbVie. We've entered a new phase of our evolution, the phase where we clearly demonstrate the strength of our business and the strength of our pipeline. The continued momentum of the U.S. business combined with the launch and ramp of several new products, including ORILISSA, risankizumab and upadacitinib, along with the outstanding performance of our heme-onc portfolio will allow us to grow through biosimilar impact in 2019 just as we had predicted. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate outstanding performance driven by strong commercial, operational, and R&D execution. We're making significant advancements in our pipeline and delivering outstanding financial results as evidenced by our industry-leading performance year-to-date and our confidence in our expectation to deliver double digit EPS growth again in 2019. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?
Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Rick. This morning I'll highlight noteworthy pipeline updates from the quarter and discuss several of the key milestones we anticipate over the next 12 months. I'll start with oncology where we're making very good progress advancing our programs for IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. As Rick mentioned, these two therapies have the potential to transform the treatment of CLL and other hematological malignancies by providing chemotherapy-free options that deliver better long-term disease control and improved outcomes for patients. IMBRUVICA has already changed the treatment paradigm in relapsed/refractory CLL and we're making significant progress in the front line setting. The current IMBRUVICA label in front line CLL is based on strong data from the RESONATE 2 study which evaluated IMBRUVICA versus chlorambucil in older CLL patients. We have several ongoing studies evaluating IMBRUVICA alone and in combination in additional patient populations and versus more widely used comparators. Our program includes studies in young and fit patients where we are evaluating IMBRUVICA versus regimens such as FCR, BR, and GAZYVA chlorambucil, often thought of as the gold standards in CLL treatment. We are also conducting studies in patients in the watch and wait population who are at increased risk of depression. Data from two important studies in our front line CLL program the iLLUMINATE study and the Alliance study will be presented at the upcoming ASH meeting. In the iLLUMINATE study, we evaluated IMBRUVICA plus GAZYVA compared to a combination of GAZYVA and chlorambucil or GC. In June, we reported that the IMBRUVICA arm in this study demonstrated significantly longer progression-free survival compared to GC. Based on these results in the third quarter, the FDA accepted our regulatory application for IMBRUVICA in combination with GAZYVA for first line treatment of CLL. At ASH, the Alliance Cooperative Group will be presenting results from a Phase 3 study which evaluated IMBRUVICA alone and in combination with Rituxan versus BR. In this study, treatment with IMBRUVICA alone or in combination with Rituxan demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared with BR in previously untreated CLL patients over the age of 65. The evidence from these studies demonstrate IMBRUVICA's compelling clinical benefit in front line populations beyond those addressed by RESONATE 2 and will provide an opportunity to treat significantly more patients in the front line setting. Over the course of the next few years, there will be additional data readouts for IMBRUVICA in front-line CLL that we believe will help drive further penetration. We continue to make good progress with IMBRUVICA in other hematologic malignancies as well. In the quarter, we received approval for IMBRUVICA in combination with Rituxan as the first chemotherapy-free combination treatment for Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. This marks the ninth FDA approval for IMBRUVICA. Moving now to VENCLEXTA, where we are making substantial progress in several hematologic malignancies, including CLL, AML, and multiple myeloma, in the quarter, we received an expanded label for VENCLEXTA to include minimal residual disease negativity data from the MURANO trial. This follows our approval in the broader relapsed/refractory CLL setting received this summer and is VENCLEXTA's second label expansion in 2018. MRD negativity, which is undetectable disease at a threshold of 1 in 10,000 cells, is becoming an increasingly important goal in the treatment of patients with CLL. The rates of MRD negativity demonstrated in the MURANO trial support VENCLEXTA's ability to drive deep responses and potential to provide long periods of remission for these patients. The inclusion of these data in the VENCLEXTA label is another important milestone for our program. We are also making very good progress with VENCLEXTA in the front-line CLL setting. We recently announced positive top line results from the CLL14 study, which evaluated VENCLEXTA in combination with GAZYVA versus GAZYVA plus chlorambucil. We expect to present detailed data from this study at an upcoming medical meeting. The CLL14 study will form the basis of regulatory submissions in the coming months and will move us further towards our goal of establishing VENCLEXTA as a foundational chemotherapy-free option in the CLL market. Beyond CLL, we are also making good progress in other hematologic malignancies such as AML and multiple myeloma, where w0e've seen strong mid-stage data and are nearing completion of the first registrational studies in both indications. Our U.S. regulatory application for VENCLEXTA in first-line AML patients who can't receive high-dose induction chemotherapy is currently under review with the FDA, with an approval decision expected by the end of the year. This accelerated approval will be based on compelling data from our Phase 2 study, with confirmatory results from our Phase 3 program expected in 2019. In multiple myeloma, we're expecting data in the first half of 2019 from the Phase 3 BELLINI study, which is evaluating VENCLEXTA in combination with Velcade and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We are also exploring VENCLEXTA as a potential treatment in front-line multiple myeloma, with Phase 3 studies expected to begin in 2019. Moving now to immunology, where we continue to make good progress across all stages of our portfolio, we have built a strong leadership position in immunology, and AbbVie has played an integral role in defining the standard of care across the rheumatology, dermatology, and gastroenterology segments. At the recent ACR, UEGW, and EADV meetings, we showcased our immunology portfolio and presented a total of 70 abstracts, reinforcing our deep scientific expertise and commitment to researching innovative therapies in these areas. Our immunology franchise, which we believe is the best in the industry, is evolving to a portfolio of therapies with the forthcoming commercialization of our two late-stage assets, upadacitinib and risankizumab, next year. In late-stage development, we have registrational programs ongoing for upadacitinib, our JAK1 selective inhibitor, in five immune-mediated conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. And we plan to begin Phase 3 studies in the sixth potential indication for upadacitinib, giant cell arteritis, in the first half of 2019. In rheumatoid arthritis, the lead indication for upadacitinib, we remain on track to submit our regulatory application by the end of the year. At the ACR meeting last week, we presented nine abstracts for upadacitinib in RA, including data from three of the five Phase 3 registrational studies. As we gather long-term data from the Phase 3 studies in the SELECT program, we remain very encouraged by the profile that we have observed. Based on the data generated across our clinical program, we remain very confident in the benefit/risk profile for upadacitinib and believe that it will offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. At the recent UEGW meeting, we presented Phase 2 upadacitinib data in ulcerative colitis, demonstrating that significantly more patients treated with upadacitinib achieved clinical remission and a scopic improvement in clinical response following induction therapy versus placebo. These results look very promising based on the strong signal we've observed. Moving now to our anti-IL-23 antibody, risankizumab, where like upadacitinib, we're evaluating the asset in several indications, in addition to the lead indication, psoriasis, we have Phase 3 studies ongoing in Crohn's disease, Phase 2 studies ongoing in ulcerative colitis, and expect to initiate Phase 3 studies in psoriatic arthritis in the first half of 2019. The regulatory applications in psoriasis are currently under review, with approval decisions expected in the first half of 2019. Across each of the four Phase 3 studies in the pivotal program, risankizumab consistently showed very high and durable rates of skin clearance. Based on these results, we believe risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-naïve and TNF-inadequate responder patients with moderate to severe psoriasis while providing the convenience of quarterly dosing. We are also making very good progress advancing our early-stage immunology pipeline, with several of our next-generation assets recently starting Phase 2 studies and several more expected to begin Phase 2 over the course of the next 12 months. ABBV-599, our JAK inhibitor/BTK inhibitor combination, recently began Phase 2 in RA and will begin Phase 2 in lupus next year. ABBV-323, our CD40 antagonist, recently transitioned to Phase 2 in ulcerative colitis. And our anti-TNF steroid ADC program is moving through multi-dose Phase 1 studies, with Phase 2 expected to begin in 2019. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the mid-stage data mature. And lastly, in the area of neuroscience, we continue to make good progress with our preclinical and early clinical programs. Neuroscience is an emerging area of focus for AbbVie, and we are making considerable internal and external investments. We're advancing research across several neurodegenerative disorders with innovative approaches such as targeting tau, trem2, cd33, and alpha-synuclein, just to name a few. In 2019, we and our partners expect to transition several programs from our neuroscience collaborations into the clinic. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing and accelerating our programs over the quarter, and we look forward to many more important pipeline milestones in the coming months and through 2019. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Bill?
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. We are very pleased with our strong third quarter results. Total adjusted net revenues were $8.2 billion, up 18.5% operationally excluding a 70 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.14, up 51.8% compared to the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EPS exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.13 due to favorable sales and operating margin profile dynamics. HUMIRA global sales were $5.1 billion in the quarter, up nearly 10% operationally. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 12.5% compared to the prior year, with more than half driven by underlying volume growth plus a mid-single digit price contribution. The growth rate in the quarter also reflected a modest stocking benefit from the launch of our new citrate-free formulation. Wholesaler inventory levels remained roughly half a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales approached $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 4.2% on an operational basis and in line with our prior guidance. In oncology, global sales of heme products were nearly $1.1 billion in the third quarter led by the continued strong growth of both IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. In the quarter, IMBRUVICA net revenues were $972 million, increasing more than 40% versus the prior year, primarily driven by market share gains across all lines of therapy in CLL. Venclexta revenues were $96 million in the quarter driven by uptake in the second-line plus setting as a result of our recent approval in the broad relapsed/refractory CLL segment. Global HCV sales in the quarter were $862 million. MAVYRET continues to perform very well, holding roughly 50% market share globally. As expected, we saw sequentially lower sales internationally as a result of fewer warehoused patients in certain markets. We also saw double-digit operational sales growth in both DUODOPA and CREON. Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 81.7% of sales, up 90 basis points compared to the prior year. This was inclusive of the year-over-year benefit related to the termination of certain HUMIRA royalties and the impact of favorable foreign exchange partially offset by the dilutive impact of partnership accounting. Adjusted R&D was 15.4% of sales in the quarter, supporting our pipeline programs in oncology, immunology and other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 19.1% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 170 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting sales leverage as well as operational efficiencies. The adjusted operating margin profile was 47.2% of sales in the quarter, an improvement of 430 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $302 million in the quarter, and the adjusted tax rate was 9.1%. Turning to full year guidance, as Rick mentioned, today we are raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.90 to $7.92 per share, representing growth of 41.3% at the midpoint. This guidance assumes an increase in adjusted net revenue which we now expect to approach $32.7 billion, with full year operational performance of approximately 15% which is also above our previously communicated guidance. At current exchange rates, we continue to expect a favorable foreign currency benefit on the year of less than 1%. This forecast comprehends the following assumptions related to our key products. For IMBRUVICA, we now expect global revenues to AbbVie to be above $3.5 billion with U.S. sales above $2.9 billion. For international HUMIRA at current exchange rates, we now expect sales to approach $6.3 billion. This updated forecast incorporates the latest dynamics we are seeing following the introduction of biosimilar competition across certain markets in mid-October. We continue to expect U.S. HUMIRA sales of approximately $13.7 billion, and we continue to forecast global HCV sales of above $3.5 billion. We forecast full year adjusted gross margin to be above 80.5% of sales and now expect adjusted operating margin to approach 45% of sales. All other full year 2018 guidance assumptions remain unchanged. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.89 and $1.91. This adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.26 of non-cash amortization and other specified items, and represents year-over-year growth of more than 28% at the midpoint. We expect fourth quarter operational sales growth of above 7%. At current rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on reported sales growth of less than 1% in the quarter. In closing, once again, we have delivered outstanding performance in a quarter. We have driven top and bottom line growth that has been strong while continuing to advance our pipeline. Our increased guidance range for 2018 puts us among the top of our industry peers once again with the midpoint of the range representing growth of more than 41%. And underscoring our confidence going forward, as Rick mentioned earlier, today we announced an 11.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend beginning with the dividend payable in February 2019. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Bill. Before we open the call for questions I wanted to say a few words about Bill so this is the part where I'm going to embarrass Bill. I guess you won't be able to tell that because you can't see him but Bill, as you know, recently announced his intention to retire in the summer of 2019. I can tell you that Bill has been my partner since we launched AbbVie, and he has played a very significant role in the tremendous success that we have been able to deliver. I've known Bill and worked with Bill in some form or fashion at least 25 years. Between Abbott and AbbVie, Bill has had a tremendous 30-year career. I can tell you that personally I will miss Bill when he retires. I told him the story about me flunking retirement, that didn't seem to faze him very much. But in all seriousness, I know that Bill and his family are extremely excited about moving to Europe next summer and starting this new chapter in their lives. So I can tell you that all of us here at AbbVie wish him and his family all the best, and I know he'll do extremely well and he's extremely excited about this move. As I mentioned, Bill will be with us until the middle of next year, so many of you will have an opportunity to congratulate him personally prior to his departure. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Rick. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, first question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Steve Scala from Cohen.
Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you, and congratulations on a phenomenal performance. AbbVie is a couple weeks into direct international biosimilar competition. What have you been seeing so far? And how does that feed into your thoughts for the year? And what will be the major pushes and pulls in 2019? AbbVie will have international HUMIRA headwinds but offset by a promising group of new products. And it does appear that AbbVie is expecting a strong contribution from new products next year to blunt the headwinds to some extent. Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Steve, this is Rick. Thanks for the question. Let me start with international biosimilars. I know there's a lot of interest, so I'm going to go through it in a little bit of detail. Now having said that, I think as most of you probably know, the healthcare systems internationally are somewhat heterogeneous, so it's not like you can explain one system and explain exactly how biosimilar competition will work across all of the marketplaces. But I think I can give you a pretty good feel for what we're seeing out there and how we dialed that impact in. We're only two weeks or so into the launch. Four biosimilars launched basically simultaneously: Amgen, Sandoz, Biogen Samsung and Mylan. I'd say that we have now seen pricing in every single market, so we have an idea of what pricing looks like in every single market. Doesn't mean it's stabilized in every single market yet, and I'll describe for you what that looks like in some level of detail here. The discounting has been on the higher end of the planning scenarios that we had laid out. It's still within the planning scenarios that we had laid out but a little bit on the higher end of that and on the higher end of the relevant analogs. And what I mean by that is we use REMICADE and ENBREL biosimilars as the analogs that we have planned against. We've seen discounting at ranges from as low as 10% to as high as around 80%. The higher discounting is seen in the Nordic tender countries. These are markets where it's winner takes all across the entire TMF category, so includes REMICADE and ENBREL as well. They have a policy of non-medical switching. I'd say they're a bit of an unusual market from that perspective, and that tends to drive deeper discounts. So I would tell you this level of discounting is not a surprise to us in those markets. It's certainly not unprecedented. We've seen REMICADE tenders in these markets that were fairly early on at 72% discounts, some as high as 75% discount. So this wasn't unexpected at all. They're not a big part of our business. They represent about 4% or 5% of the overall revenue of our international business. And they don't tend to move into the other markets based on any of the experience that we've seen or any of the experience that we've had. So we now have price points, as I said, for the vast majority of the business, the revenue in the countries. I'm going to characterize it in this way. I think two-thirds of the total revenue internationally I would consider to be locked. Now what do I mean about locked? So you can characterize locked as a country that's still protected, so it still has IP protection, so there is no risk in those countries; a country that has mandated discounting, so the country basically says when biosimilars enter the market, we're going to cut the price of both the innovator and the biosimilar, and they'll both be at the same price point. France is an example of that, and then they just go out and compete in that marketplace. Or it would be a country that has already tendered, and so we know what the pricing is in the tender, we know what our position was in that pricing. So that roughly represents about two-thirds of the overall volume. There's a third that is still being negotiated. We have pricing in those markets. We have a pretty good idea of where we stand, but there's still an opportunity for some movement in those markets. And so we need probably another month or two for that to be able to play out and for us to have a firm understanding of where the discounting will settle out and where our volumes will settle out. Now to characterize for you what are we seeing versus what we planned for, I'd say on average the discounting is coming in approximately 10 points higher than what we would have anticipated. So if you go back to the 18% to 20% that we've communicated before as a planning assumption that we had back a year or two ago, if you look at the new calculation, you would put that at 26% to 27%. Now, I caution you about locking in on that number. I'm only giving it to give you a relative perspective versus where we were. Because obviously that number could move, and in all likelihood, I think it will move some. I don't think it will move dramatically, but I think it will move some. So we factored in all of this pricing that we've already seen. You've seen some of that in our fourth quarter estimates. So you can basically look at that and factor that through 2019 as well. We factored that into all of our estimates, and we factored in further room for more downside. And that's why we're coming back to you and telling you we're absolutely confident we can deliver double digit. In the fourth quarter call, we'll give you – at that point we'll have more accurate information on that third that is left, and we'll give you a specific guidance range at that point. But you can assume that it will be double digit as a floor. So hopefully, that gives you some idea of where we stand from a biosimilar standpoint. To the rest of your question, I think one of the things that is important to keep in perspective here is obviously we'll see some headwinds in our international biosimilar – or international HUMIRA business based on biosimilars. But fundamentally, the business continues to remain extremely strong. Our U.S. business continues to perform at a very strong rate, including HUMIRA. Our heme-onc franchise that I described to you in my formal remarks continues to perform extremely strong. And in fact, we're starting to hit the inflection point with VENCLEXTA. With the MURANO data out and the excitement around AML, VENCLEXTA has moved up dramatically in patient starts. And so that will be an important contributor. And then obviously, we have a number of new products that we either have launched or will launch over the course of 2019. ORILISSA is going well, and upadacitinib and risankizumab will both launch in 2019. So I think our prospects going forward look very strong.
Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: The next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.
Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats to Bill on retirement. Best of luck in Europe, and it's been a pleasure. Just to follow up, Rick, on the biosimilar erosion commentary on ex-U.S., is that 26% to 27% blended across Europe and ROW markets which may not be impacted or may even be growing? I'm just trying to understand as we think about the impact on 2019, because I know that I think Canada – I don't think we expect biosimilars in Japan, and Brazil may not be impacted. So could you just provide some clarity there? And then on U.S. HUMIRA, your confidence and ability to continue to capture mid-single-digit pricing benefit where it seems like the broader industry is migrating to low single digit in the U.S.? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. On the biosimilar erosion, I think the best way for you to think about it is it's across the book of the $6.3 billion of business. So it does include countries that are not exposed, so it's a blended rate across those. So it would obviously be higher in the countries that do have biosimilar exposure. And the number – I don't know, have we ever publicly described what the number is of the protected versus the unprotected?
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Not with any specificity, no.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, then I guess I won't describe that. On HUMIRA's confidence on price in the U.S., if you look at our HUMIRA business, it's primarily a volume-driven business in the U.S. And I would expect that we will continue, based on all of the contracts that have been negotiated for 2019, that we'll continue with a very similar price fall-through to what we had in 2018. So on the lower end of that mid-single digits is probably a reasonable expectation. So not a tremendous amount of price, but no significant change from what we've had.
Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great, thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI.
Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe you can discuss your confidence in the outlook for approval of VENCLEXTA in the AML, despite not having a randomized data, as well as if you can quantify that part of the addressable market. Thanks.
Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.: Sure, this is Mike. I'll take that. So we've had Breakthrough Therapy Designation for AML in the U.S., which gives us good insight into the FDA's thinking on the standard for approval. And when you couple that with the very strong Phase 2 data that we've generated where the combination complete response in something that's called complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery, which is the way the data are looked at in that field, are on the order of about two to three times higher than historical comparators. It's the strength of that evidence based on – and that coupled with our understanding of what it's going to take to get approved in the U.S. that gives us confidence. We also have our Phase 3 studies up and running and well underway. And they're positioned to readout next year, so in 2019. So it's that full picture that gives us that confidence. In terms of how much of the addressable market that represents, it's a substantial portion. AML tends to have a peak incidence later in life, and up to about half of patients can't undergo intensive induction chemotherapy and then go on to stem cell transplant. And for those patients, there really are very, very limited treatment options. And it's in those very difficult to treat patients that VENCLEXTA has demonstrated the data that I described. So we think that there is a very real opportunity here that will be very important both medically and commercially.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: And maybe to just give a little more color on VENCLEXTA, what we're seeing, because AML is obviously a portion of that, I mean, if you looked at the AML market in total, it's probably a couple of billion dollars. And as Mike said, roughly half of that is addressable, although I will say we are seeing some activity where physicians are pretreating patients prior to induction chemotherapy to get disease activity down. So it could be even larger than half of that population in AML. As I indicated in my remarks a few moments ago, we are seeing VENCLEXTA take a fairly significant inflection in growth since we released the MURANO data, and I think physicians have become more aware of the AML data. If you actually look at patient starts compared to the first quarter of 2018 and looking at them versus the third quarter of 2018, they're up 73%. So obviously the brand is starting to really grow at a fairly rapid pace. It's at about a $400 million running rate right now and growing rapidly. So I think you can expect that you'll continue to see very strong growth out of VENCLEXTA, and it will be an important contributor to our oncology growth going forward.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Josh. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Congrats to you, Bill, for the retirement. And just a couple actually on the margins I guess for you. One, the gross margins this quarter I thought were especially strong. Was there any sort of one-time impact that sort of drove anything there, or anything we should be aware of? And then the comments from Rick regarding your expectation on biosimilars and sort of that 26%, 27% number, I'm curious how to think about your prior commentary on operating margins. You said 50% operating margin by 2020. Does this sort of change in discounting, you're on the higher end of your planning scenarios, does that impact how you think about what your operating margins might be in that 2020 timeframe? Thanks so much.
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Sure. So if you look at the quarter, this is only the first quarter that we've seen the full impact of the termination of HUMIRA royalty that were previously in place. So we're picking up about 160 basis points of favorability related to that royalty reduction. That was the big mover in the quarter. We also did see some favorable exchange, call that maybe a little under 0.5 point, and then offsetting that going the other way was about 120 basis points related to partnership accounting. As you know, we book the profit that we pass to our partner on IMBRUVICA as a cost of goods sold. So that actually has a dilutive impact on the gross margin line. So when you add that all up, that's how you get to the number that we saw in the quarter. In terms of progress towards 2020, look, certainly we're factoring in the biosimilar experience that we're seeing now into our 2019 plan, although I don't have a clear picture yet. Be what I can tell you is, if you look at this quarter, we had very, very strong operating margin growth. We've increased by over 400 basis points on the 47% range. I think that that is the base that you've got to think of us starting to build off of in our inherent run-rate. And then, next year we're going to pick up the benefit of royalty reductions, which ought to be about 170 to 180 basis points. So we're not going to be there in 2019. We never said we were going to be there in 2019. But when you look at the rapid growth we'd be expecting in 2020 with the pipeline products really moving into full gear, we still remain confident.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Baum from Citigroup.
Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you, a couple of questions, please. Could you give us some order of the magnitude of the royalties in relation to the settlements in Europe, whether they're meaningful or insignificant? Second, there have been some recent publications addressing the platelet impact of BTK inhibitors, suggesting that the bleeding that's seen with IMBRUVICA may be a BTK-specific phenomenon, rather than drug-specific (45:44) thinking about CALQUENCE, your competitor, and whether it may not be such a better mousetrap as initially envisaged. And then finally, any update on the Boehringer Ingelheim District Court case? Many thanks – on HUMIRA.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Andrew, this is Rick. I'll cover one and three. So the magnitude of the settlement royalties, those are all confidential agreements, so I can't speak to the magnitude of those even in a qualitative way. I would just say that they're typical royalties that are associated with the license of important IP. On the court case for BI, I can tell you we have confidence in our position. We don't fundamentally believe that the essence of what BI is describing is, if you get a large number of patents on a product, that in and of itself is a problem. I don't believe there is case law to support that, nor do I believe that there is evidence that would support that position. I'd also say the following. Look, we have five settlements now. We have very sophisticated companies who have made a decision based on our IP to do a settlement agreement with us. I think that speaks for itself about the magnitude and the power of our IP, and we remain confident in our position.
Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.: All right, this is Mike. I'll take the question with respect to BTK inhibitors. It's been our view for quite some time that the bleeding risks that are associated with BTK inhibition are on target, and that BTK specificity from follow-on compounds are therefore not a way to address those risks. The risks are manageable. They are part of the overall benefit/risk profile of a BTK inhibitor like IMBRUVICA, which is overall very strongly favorable. But that specificity isn't a way around that. And we say that based on our preclinical understanding, and we also say it based on clinical data. And if you look at a number of follow-on BTKs that have come forward with arguments around putative selectivity, you see the same picture, which is in very early, very small studies, it's very hard to detect these sorts of effects. But as one moves into larger, longer-term trials, a very similar risk/benefit profile emerges. And I think we've seen that with a number of follow-ons, including CALQUENCE. So again, we believe that the bleeding effects are part of the benefit/risk of a BTK inhibitor, that they can be managed effectively, and we believe we have managed them effectively with IMBRUVICA. Obviously, the overall benefit/risk is strongly positive, but we don't see any advantage in the follow-on BTK inhibitors in that respect.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: And the only thing I'd add there is I think the market data would now support that. I mean, if you look at the relatively small indication that they have in MCL, I think they peaked at market share around 10% – 13%, and now they're declining to some extent. So clearly, the market uptake on the product does not appear to be representative of a product that has differentiation.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thanks very much for the questions. Just coming back to the HUMIRA biosimilar erosion, how predictive do you see this higher 2019 erosion rate to be as we think about longer-term annual erosion for the drug OUS? So beyond 2019, do you think this higher 26% – 27% erosion rate is how we should think about this, or are you viewing 2019 more as an outsized one-time step down, and then a less severe annual impact as you think about 2020 and beyond? My second question was just on SG&A for 2019. AbbVie stepped up spending this year. Does that put the company's spending at levels that can support these significant upcoming launches, or should we think about another step-up in spending as we look out to 2019? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, Chris, this is Rick. I'll take the biosimilar question. I think what we've seen is as the biosimilars entered the market, and it's probably somewhat consistent with the fact that four of them entered basically simultaneously, the pricing has been more aggressive, which all along we've said we would see the biggest impact at launch in that first year, and then it would taper off as we got to the follow-on years. And I think what we've seen play out now only supports that further. So I think you can expect a much bigger impact in 2019 in the countries that had an impact. And then it will slow as we get into 2020-2021. Now there will be countries that come on in the later years, and they'll experience probably a similar kind of a curve as we enter those markets. So I think that's the way we think about it, and I think it's the best way for the investment community to think about it.
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Chris, speaking in absolute dollar terms, we certainly will be putting more money into SG&A next year to support our launches. If you look at the quality of the assets and the importance of the assets to the overall AbbVie growth story, we are not going to do anything that would impede our ability to maximize their ultimate potential. So from a dollar standpoint, we will certainly be putting money in for both risa and upa. Obviously, a lot of the spend is already in the base for VENCLEXTA and to a degree ORILISSA. However, moving into AML, there will be additional spend there. And ORILISSA, we have not seen this year the startup of the full DTC campaign. So I think you should model increased spending on those assets.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks very much. So I have two questions. So Rick and Bill, I was hoping that you could talk a little bit more about your view on capital allocation. Obviously the company has been quite aggressive with respect to buying back stock and increasing dividend, but it appears that equity investors are more focused on the company's long-term revenue growth and seem to hope for more pipeline enhancement transactions rather than some of the other capital allocation opportunities for the company. So I was just hoping that you could comment on that and how you see that balance? And then separately, with respect to the 26% to 27% that you mentioned, Rick, could you just clarify? I had thought that the 18% to 20% was over the two-year period, i.e. between 2018 and 2020, so is the 26% to 27% over a two-year period such that you're talking about low teens ex-U.S. HUMIRA sales decline in 2019, and then again in 2020? Or are you talking about a 26% to 27% decline in ex-U.S. HUMIRA sales in 2019? Thanks so much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Yeah, David. It's Rick. So let me answer number two first. So what I'm describing to you is the level of erosion that we would expect in 2019. It will moderate, but there will be some impact in 2020. You are correct that what we described to you was 18% to 20% over that two-year period of time. So, you're thinking about it the right way. So obviously there's higher levels of erosion. Now, I will say, as I mentioned a moment ago, I think we have seen a deeper discounting strategy out of the blocks. And that will moderate some as we go forward. But I think you should assume that you will see more erosion in 2020 which would obviously raise that number going forward. I don't think it will be dramatic, but I think you will see some impact. On capital allocation, I think our overall strategy is very similar to what we've operated with for quite some time, and that is that we view returning cash to shareholders as an important strategy. Our dividend we're committed to a growing dividend, and obviously we've demonstrated that again in this call. We view our dividend as our primary vehicle to do that, although we have done some substantial buybacks as we saw the stock at a value that we thought was undervalued. We thought that was an appropriate use of it. Our first priority is always building the business for the long-term. We're fortunate that we have a strong pipeline, and therefore we can drive significant growth. So we focused a lot of attention on assets that we could bring in that would have an impact in that 2023, 2024, 2025 timeframe which are typically earlier stage, smaller kinds of transactions. But we've been active in that area across the range of areas, oncology being a good example, immunology being a good example. We have done some transactions now in the area of fibrosis, and so we have a pretty active program in that area. We look at almost everything. We look at small opportunities, medium opportunities, larger opportunities, and we evaluate each of those. It goes through a filter of, first, does it strategically fit, and second, is the value at a point that ultimately we can get a good return on it for our shareholders? And so we evaluate all these opportunities versus that. I don't see a fundamental shift in how we've operated from a capital allocation standpoint though.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, David. Operator, we have time for one final question, please.
Operator: Our final question today is from John Boris from SunTrust.
John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. So, Rick, just on biotech valuations, we've obviously seen a significant contraction. I think at an investor conference you indicated that you were interested in possibly doing a transaction somewhere in the $20 billion to $30 billion range. Just your thoughts about the environment, at least currently, relative to biotech valuations contracting. Second question on the dissolution or the termination of the royalties, I think, Bill, a third of them went away in 2018. Two-thirds go away in 2019. Can you just give some commentary or quantitatively what the impact is on the 2019 gross margin? Thanks.
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: So I'll start with that one first, John. So you're exactly right in terms of the gating between 2018 and 2019. I think you should expect next year to pick up about somewhere between 170 to 180 basis points on the gross margin line as a result of those royalties being eliminated.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: On biotech valuations, I guess I'll clarify the $20 billion to $30 billion comment. What I was trying to describe in that meeting was what we viewed as a larger bolt-on, not that we were actively pursuing a transaction in that range. But having said that, if you look regardless of value, if I look at biotech valuations now, although they've come down some, they're still valued pretty highly, and valued in a forward-looking way. And what I mean by that is if you get some early data, you tend to see valuations rise very rapidly in anticipation of future positive data. But when we look at a transaction, just like everybody else in the industry, you have to evaluate the risk of that data not playing out in a larger study, a later study. And so valuations are still – for the stage of the product, still have a tendency to get ahead of where the right balance is for the risk reward of a good return. Doesn't mean every single one of them is that way. But I'm talking in generalities now. And certainly all of us continue to look for those opportunities where there's the right value and an exciting opportunity. We have seen some of those that we've brought in, and we'll continue to look for those.
John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, John. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at his time.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Liz Shea: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Severino, Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll take your questions. So with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I’ll briefly discuss our second quarter performance and highlights as well as our full year guidance which we’re increasing again this quarter. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D pipeline, and Bill will discuss the quarter in more detail. As always, following our remarks, we’ll take your questions. AbbVie once again delivered an outstanding quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $2. Representing growth of more than 40% versus last year and exceeding expectations. We also delivered strong top line results in the quarter with global adjusted operational sales growth of 17.1%. This outstanding performance was driven by growth from several assets across our portfolio including significant contributions from HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, and MAVYRET. We’re extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter and the progress year-to-date. We’ve driven outstanding commercial, operational and R&D execution resulting in strong top and bottom line results. Based on our performance in the first half of the year and the tremendous confidence we have in our business we’re raising our full year 2018 EPS guidance by $0.10 we’re now expecting adjusted earnings per share of $7.76 to $7.86 reflecting growth of 39.5% to midpoint. It’s important to recognize this is the third increase to our earning’s guidance for 2018. A testament to the momentum and confidence we have in our ongoing business fundamentals and underlying performance and we’re raising our guidance despite the anticipated introduction of direct biosimilar competition in certain markets outside the United States in the fourth quarter. So clearly, we expect our performance in the second half of the year to continue to be robust. As I mentioned a moment ago several products within our portfolio are driving strong growth. Starting with HUMIRA which delivered global operational sales growth of 8.2% in the quarter. In the US HUMIRA sales grew 10% driven by strong prescription volume growth across all three categories. Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 4.4% operationally. We continue to be pleased with the underlying market trends across geographies and therapeutic segments. Global sales of IMBRUVICA were $850 million in the quarter, an increase of more than 35% over the prior year. Globally we’re seeing very strong patient uptake including higher market share and growth across multiple indications. This includes CLL where IMBRUVICA continues to be the clear market leader. We expect this momentum to continue based on the growing evidence illustrating IMBRUVICA’s strong efficacy across the wide range of indications. Global HCV sales were $973 million in the second quarter, again exceeding expectations with continued momentum from the MAVYRET launch. Based on its compelling clinical profile and our commercial execution. MAVYRET has achieved the market leading position in the US as well as strong leadership positions in a number of other major markets including Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy among others. As evident in our results, the overall business continues to deliver robust revenue and EPS growth. Driven by our highly differentiated assets and our outstanding execution. Our business performance is underpinned by strong volume driven growth. Of the more than 17% global operational revenue growth in the quarter roughly 16% was volume driven growth with the remainder approximately 1% driven by price. In addition to the strong financial results, we continue to make excellent progress with our late stage R&D programs. Mike will cover the pipeline in more detail here in just a few moments. So I’ll mention just a few of the highlights. Earlier this week, we received FDA approval for elagolix now known as ORILISSA. For the management of moderate-to-severe pain associated with Endometriosis. A chronic disease which effects approximately three million women in the US. With very few treatments approved over the last 20 years ORILISSA will be an important new therapeutic option for the many women who suffer with this painful condition. We’re extremely pleased with the approved label, which provides physicians flexibility of dosing and duration of therapy. Given the compelling product profile, the disease prevalence and the patient need ORILISSA represents a significant long-term opportunity for AbbVie with multi-billion dollar peak sales potential. We’ve also made two major advancements with VENCLEXTA further strengthening our leadership position in Hematological Oncology. We received US Regulatory Approval for VENCLEXTA in the broader Relapsed/Refractory CLL patient population representing a significant expansion beyond the narrow indication where VENCLEXTA was previously approved. We also submitted our US Regulatory application for VENCLEXTA in AML representing a significant acceleration of the timeline for the sizable follow-on indication. We’ve also made significant progress with our two next generation immunology assets. Upadacitinib and Risankizumab. We recently reported results from the fifth and final pivotal trial evaluating Upadacitinib as a treatment for RA. We’ve been very encouraged by the level of efficacy and the benefit risk profile observed across the entire clinical program. Upadacitinib has the potential to be best in class therapy in RA offering meaningful advantages over products on the market today or those we see in development. We remain on track to submit our regulatory application later this year. Following the completion of our four pivotal studies in psoriasis, we’ve submitted our regulatory applications for Risankizumab both in the US and Europe. Based on the data generated from our registrational [ph] programs, we believe Risankizumab represents a potential best in category therapeutic option. We also believe that with Upadacitinib and Risankizumab along with HUMIRA we have the most competitive and best portfolio in immunology, which should enable us to maintain our therapeutic leadership and drive continued growth. When we launched AbbVie in 2013, we had an important objective to create a robust pipeline for differentiated assets enabling us to drive industry leading growth to the long-term. I can tell you that I’m extremely pleased with the progress that we’ve made towards that objective. As demonstrated this quarter as well as last quarter, IMBRUVICA and MAVYRET are both playing important roles in diversifying our sources of growth. Each driving strong performance along with HUMIRA. With our recent and near-term approvals, we expect even further diversification of growth going forward. This year, we’re seeing VENCLEXTA’s expansion into the broader Relapsed/Refractory CLL population and the launch of ORILISAA for Endometriosis. These are both significant opportunities. In 2019 we anticipate the approval of VENCLEXTA in AML and the launch of Risankizumab in psoriasis and Upadacitinib in RA. Each of these assets has demonstrated best in class clinical results allowing us to significantly enhance our leadership position in these very sizable markets. By 2020 AbbVie will be extremely well positioned with multiple new assets in our portfolio, driving growth. Enabling us to continue to achieve our mission of delivering top tier industry performance. All told now in between now and the expected entry of direct biosimilars in the US. We were poised to launch more than 20 new products or major inductions from our late stage pipeline. Each of these opportunities will contribute significantly to our overall growth. Diversifying our sources of revenue and offsetting the impact of biosimilar competition. So in summary, we’re pleased with our progress and we’re confident in our ability to continue to drive strong growth. We remain committed to achieving our long-term strategic vision for the company, delivering industry leading performance and outstanding shareholder value. With that I’ll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments in our R&D program. Mike?
Mike Severino: Thank you Rick. When we launched AbbVie our strategy was to build an industry leading pipeline and a robust R&D engine capable of driving significant and sustainable growth. We’ve made tremendous progress over the past few years and we’re now entering a period where a large number of assets have either already transitioned to commercialization or are preparing to do so. Our R&D engine has been very productive over the past two years. Specifically we’ve received a number of major regulatory approvals including VENCLEXTA and Relapsed/Refractory CLL. IMBRUVICA in Marginal Zone Lymphoma and graft versus host disease. MAVYRET and HVC and ORILISSA and Endometriosis. We’ve reported positive data from nearly a dozen key registration enabling clinical programs including Upadacitinib in RA. Risankizumab in psoriasis. VENCLEXTA in Relapsed/Refractory CLL and AML. IMBRUVICA in frontline CLL and elagolix in Endometriosis and uterine fibroids to name a few. We’ve been very pleased with the data generated across these programs. As each asset has proven to be differentiated relative to the current standard of care. We’ve also seen promising proof of concept data from numerous mid stage programs which we’ve advanced into registrational studies. These includes Upadacitinib in Crohn’s Disease, psoriatic arthritis and atopic dermatitis. Risankizumab in Crohn’s Disease and VENCLEXTA in multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. The data we’ve produced and the regulatory success we’ve to-date, reinforce our view that the assets we’re developing will achieve strong competitive positions within their respective markets. And we’ve also continued the significant progress in the recent quarter, which I’ll now spend a few moments highlighting. In immunology, we’ve made significant progress with Upadacitinib and Risankizumab, our two late stage assets with best in class potential across a broad range of indications. In the quarter, we reported top line results from the select early study which evaluated Upadacitinib, our JAK1 selective inhibitor as a monotherapy treatment compared to methotrexate in methotrexate-naive patients. Similar to the efficacy observed in the previous four SELECT studies in its fifth and final registration trial. Upadacitinib drove very high levels of response on all clinical endpoints and importantly, on the more stringent endpoint such as ACR50, ACR70 low disease activity and DAS remission. In the study both the lower and higher doses of Upadacitinib met the primary and all ranked secondary endpoints at weeks 12 and 24. Both doses also significantly inhibited radiographic progression at week 24 compared to methotrexate. These results support the potential of Upadacitinib as first line monotherapy in methotrexate-naïve RA patients. We’ve evaluated Upadacitinib in a comprehensive set of studies in patients with moderate-to-severe RA. This includes head-to-head study against HUMIRA, the currents standard of care and additional studies conducted in a broad range of clinical settings including patients who are naïve to methotrexate therapy at one end of the spectrum and very difficult to treat patients who have failed one or more biologic therapies at the other end. Based on the data generated in our program, we remain very confident in the benefit risk profile of Upadacitinib and believe that it will offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. Following the successful completion of our fifth and final study, we remain on track to submit our regulatory application in the fourth quarter of this year. Moving now to our other late stage immunology asset; Risankizumab. We recently submitted our US and European regulatory applications in psoriasis. Based on the very high and durable rates of skin clearance we saw in the registrational studies. We believe Risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-naïve and TNF inadequate responder patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, while offering the convenience of quarterly dosing. Moving now to oncology, where we continue to advance our programs for VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA. We’ve seen very strong activity across a broad range of hematologic malignancies with these two therapies. Demonstrating their potential to transform treatment by driving better long-term disease control and better outcomes for patients. In June, we received FDA approval for VENCLEXTA in combination with rituximab in patients with Relapsed/Refractory CLL. Substantially expanding the patient population for which VENCLEXTA is approved. This approval is based on the Phase 3 MURANO study, where combination treatment with VENCLEXTA and rituximab showed a profound improvement in progression free survival. This combination also showed high and durable rates of MRD negative response compared to BR. A measure that is predictive of improved clinical outcomes in patients with CLL. VENCLEXTA plus rituximab combination therapy has the potential to be a new standard chemotherapy free treatment option and we’re excited to bring this new therapy to the broader Relapsed/Refractory CLL population. In the quarter, we also submitted our US regulatory application for VENCLEXTA as a treatment for first line AML patients who can’t receive high dose induction chemotherapy. AML is one of the most aggressive hematologic malignancies with a very low survival rate and few options available for patients who can’t receive intensive chemotherapy. VENCLEXTA has demonstrated rapid, deep and durable responses in these patients. Based on the Phase 2 data recently presented at EHA, we’re seeing response rates in excess of 70% with VENCLEXTA in combination with hypomethylating agents which represents a meaningful improvement relative to the current standard of care, where response rates range from 10% to 30%. We believe this could be an important new treatment option for the substantial group of patients which represents roughly 50% of the frontline AML market. We expect to see data from several other important VENCLEXTA studies over the next 12 months, this includes data from the Phase 3 CLL 14 study and frontline CLL later this year and the Phase 3 BELLINI study and multiple myeloma in the first half of 2019. Turning now to IMBRUVICA, during the quarter we reported data from two important trials that expand and strengthen our data set in CLL. The iLLUMINATE and CAPTIVATE studies. Results from the Phase 3 iLLUMINATE study which evaluated IMBRUVICA in combination with Gazyva in frontline CLL showed a significant improvement in progression free survival in patients treated with IMBRUVICA plus Gazyva compared to patients treated with the combination of Gazyva and Chlorambucil. A regimen which is currently recommended as a Category 1 treatment within the NCCN guidelines. We also recently presented data from the Phase 2 CAPTIVATE study evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with VENCLEXTA in frontline CLL. We are very encouraged by the early results of this study where approximately 90% of patients achieved responses with no detectable minimal residual disease following 12 cycles of therapy. Illustrating the potential benefit of combining these two agents to deliver deep responses in CLL. iLLUMINATE and CAPTIVATE are just two of several ongoing studies evaluating IMBRUVICA alone and as a combination therapy versus regimen such as GC, BR and FCR often considered the standards of care in the treatment of CLL. Over the course of the next few years, there will be additional data readouts for IMBRUVICA in the frontline CLL setting that we believe will help drive further penetration. Finally, in the area of women’s health as previously noted we recently announced the FDA approval of ORILISSA for the management of moderate-to-severe pain associated with Endometriosis. ORILISSA is the first and only oral GnRH antagonists approved for women with this condition and the first oral treatment for these patients in over a decade. We also continue to make good progress with our pivotal program evaluating elagolix in combination with low dose hormone add-back therapy in women with uterine fibroids. Detailed data from our pivotal trials in this indication will be presented at a medical meeting later this year and will support our regulatory submission in 2019. So in summary, we’ve had several important data readouts, regulatory submissions and approvals in the first half of the year and we look forward to updating you on our pipeline as it continues to progress. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our second quarter performance.
Bill Chase: Thanks Mike. As Rick mentioned we’re very pleased with our outstanding second quarter performance. Our year-to-date underlying business fundamentals remain strong and we’ve entered the second half of significant momentum. Total adjusted net revenues for the second quarter were $8.3 billion up 17.1% operationally excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2 up 40.8% compared to the second quarter of 2017 and exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. HUMIRA global sales were $5.2 billion up 8.2% operationally. In the US, HUMIRA sales increased 10% compared to the prior year with high single-digit prescription volume growth and roughly 3% favorable price. Wholesaler inventory levels remains below half month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.6 billion up 4.4% on an operational basis. We continue to see very good growth through the first half of 2018 despite increasing competition. With its unique product profile years of physician experience and broad set of indications HUMIRA remains the leading global frontline therapy across all approved indications. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $850 million up 35.6% year-over-year with continued strong uptake in CLL as well as other approved indications. Global HCV sales were $973 million with MAVYRET sales of $932 million. The pace of MAVYRET’s uptake continues to exceed expectations driven by strong market share performance globally as well as higher treatment volumes from warehoused DAA failure patients in certain markets. Global sales of Duodopa, a therapy for advanced Parkinson’s disease, grew 25.1% on an operational basis in the quarter, and we also saw strong operational sales growth from Creon which was up 11.4%. Turning now to the P&L profile for the second quarter, adjusted gross margin was 80.5% of sales compared to 82.3% in the prior year. The decrease versus prior year reflects the year-over-year dilutive impact of partnership accounting as well as exchanged impacts of hedged currencies. Adjusted R&D was 15.3% of sales in the quarter, supporting pipeline programs in oncology, immunology as well as other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 19.9% of sales in the quarter, a decrease of 40 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting sales leverage and operational efficiencies. The adjusted operating margin was 45.3% in the second quarter an improvement of 90 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $272 million in the quarter and the adjusted tax rate was 9%. As Rick mentioned based on our performance year-to-date and our outlook for the remaining two quarters. We’re raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $7.76 to $7.86 representing growth of 39.5% at the midpoint. This guidance assumes revenue approaching $32.5 billion inclusive of recent negative currency dynamics. This forecast comprehends full year operational performance approaching 14.5% up 1% from prior guidance. At current rates we now expect a foreign currency benefit of less than 1% for the full year sales. This forecast includes the following updated assumptions for our key products. Despite less favorable exchange at current rates we continue to expect international HUMIRA sales to approach $6.4 billion this year. For IMBRUVICA, we now expect global revenues to AbbVie approaching $3.4 billion with US sales approaching $2.8 billion. Given the momentum and performance in HCV, we’re raising our forecast and now expect global sales above $3.5 billion. For ORILISSA, due to the timing of the launch we expect full year sales of less than $50 million in 2018 as we continue to create awareness and build the market for this important new treatment option. Turning to the P&L for 2018, we now expecting adjusted gross margin ratio of above 80.5% which includes exchange impacts from weaker hedged currencies. We are now forecasting SG&A of approximately 20.5% of sales reflecting investments to maximize the potential of assets launching in both 2018 and 2019. We expect full year R&D expense approaching 16%. And we’re now expecting adjusted operating margin above 44% roughly 150 basis points above prior year. All other full year guidance assumptions remains unchanged. As we look ahead into the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $2 and $2.02. Our third quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.23 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. We’re forecasting operational revenue growth in the third quarter of approximately 17%. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on sales growth of approximately 1% in the third quarter. For US HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the third quarter of approximately 11%. We expect international HUMIRA sales approaching $1.6 billion assuming current exchange rates. For IMBRUVICA we expect US sales approaching $725 million and for HCV, we expect global sales of approximately $850 million. Lastly, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 9%. In summary, we are very pleased with our performance this quarter as we’ve driven strong revenue and EPS growth again while continuing to advance our strategic priorities. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of 2018 putting us in a strong position to deliver top tier industry growth once again this year and with that, I’ll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea: Thanks Bill. We’ll now open the call for questions. Operator, we’ll take the first question please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin: I know there are whole bunch of questions on this call regarding rebates. Let me just ask you Rick, sort of bigger picture question. The gap between AbbVie’s industry leading performance would you continue to execute on time and time again and the stocks below evaluation and lower valuation this year and investor lack of confidence has never been wider. What do you do to close that gap? Is it deal activity? Do you feel that’s what needs to happen, is it share buyback, is it committing to 50% dividend yield or dividend payout ratio, are there other structures that you’re considering such as spin outs? In addition Rick, can you clarify your comments that you made during our conference last month about doing $20 billion to $30 billion deal. I think investors took that as a signal that something is going to happen sooner, rather than later. Maybe if you could just address those please, thanks very much.
A – Rick Gonzalez: Thanks Jami. This is Rick. Appreciate the question. Maybe let me answer is first by framing, how I view AbbVie. There’s a lot of scepticisms, concern about rebates about biosimilars. Frankly some of that is reasonable, some of it is driven by people who want to illicit for their own personal gain, I don’t think that’s quite as reasonable but its reality. And so I think If you step back and look at AbbVie and what I would say [indiscernible] objective way. The way I would evaluate AbbVie is the following. Look I’d start with how we perform. We’ve been in existence now 5.25 years, 22 or 23 quarters we’ve had. We’re clearly a company and management team that lives up to the commitments that we make to investors. We take that extremely seriously, we never once disappointed investors and back in most of those quarters, much like this year we have exceeded the expectations that we have set from investors. Every year since I can remember there is been [indiscernible] about HUMIRA. Biosimilars coming in 2018, new mechanisms of action, etc. you’re never going to make $18 billion etc. we have beat every single one of those expectations along the way. We have built two assets in additions to HUMIRA now that are both approaching $4 billion, IMBRUVICA and MAVYRET. Two major mega assets that are part of our portfolio and our business going forward. If you look at VENCLEXTA, it’s on the verge of becoming a major asset for us with the MURANO approval and the approval of AML next year. We’ve a tremendous amount of confidence in what we think VENCLEXTA can do. If you look at ORILISSA. It was approved just recently. It has an excellent label and that is clearly a multi-billion asset for us. If you look at the clinical trial from Risa and Upa, it clearly supports these two are best in class assets and are going play a very important role when biosimilars enter the marketplace in the US and we have a lot of confidence in what that portfolio is going to be to do and how it’s going to be able to perform. If you look at 2019 and 2020, so out in sort of the near future here. And you look at AbbVie we’re going to have seven assets. HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, MAVYRET, VENCLEXTA, Upa and Risa, which will all either be multi-billion assets or on their way to being multi-billion assets. For a company that started five an half years ago, with one asset HUMIRA, the HUMIRA company. It will tell you we have made impressive progress and I think the future is even brighter than what the past is been going forward. So I’ve tremendous confidence in the growth trajectory of the company going forward and frankly the strategy we put in place back in 2013 is playing out pretty much exactly as we had planned. It doesn’t mean there aren’t changes and things that you have to do along the way to adjust to different environmental factors. Over the long haul, investors will reward long-term performance and there is not a company that I’m aware of that’s performing better than us and there’s not a company that has performed better over the past five years. If you talk about it, we’re delivering 40% EPS growth this year and people will say, but you’ve gotten benefit of tax. Okay, so back the benefit of the tax out. We’re delivering 25% EPS growth this year on an operating basis. There aren’t many companies that’s delivering 25% EPS growth. In fact I can’t think of another one our size, that’s delivering that level of growth. I’d also say that we have delivered a tremendous amount of cash back to shareholders to our dividend increase kind of our buyback programs. And certainly we have shown that we are not shy about doing M&A, when we think we need it and we find the appropriate kinds of assets. As it relates to the $20 billion to $30 billion comment that certainly took on a life of its own. Far greater than why we would have anticipated. I mean my objective there was to frame how we viewed large bolt-ons like a pharmacyclics like asset. As we look at, at how we’re going to build this business going forward. We obviously have a commitment that we’ve said over and over again and that is, a commitment that we’re going to deliver top tier performance and we’re going to do it over the long-term and we’re going to grow through the biosimilar impact that we knew we were to phase from day one and I think, how we’ve executed around the biosimilar issue has been excellent, outstanding in fact I would say. And so we’ve built a pipeline that for the most part with one exception [indiscernible] which was a relatively small asset in small indication, we have delivered on every single one of the assets in our late stage pipeline that we’ve talked about. And now you’re starting to see the benefit of that, you’re going to see the benefit of it in 2019 and again in 2020 as these products start to build. And so we look at going out and building the business around the premise of we want to continue to be able to drive top tier growth. When we find the right kind of opportunity, that we think fits strategically that we believe we can get a good return for our investors, fits into what we’re good at, then we’ve shown, we’re not shy, we’ll act on those. Having said that, I would say the majority of what we’re looking at and we will do will be smaller kinds of products assets that fit into our portfolio. I’d tell you today there aren’t a lot of assets in our opinion that either from a valuation standpoint we can get the right return or they fit strategically on what we’re doing. Now if the right thing comes along I’m certainly not saying to you, we wouldn’t act. We certainly have the cash flow to be able to react and if it [indiscernible] enhance our long-term ability to be able to deliver on our mission, we would certainly do that. But as far as $20 billion to $30 billion I can tell you there’s nothing in the horizon right now. What I was trying to do was frame for you, how we viewed it. But we found the right thing, we would but we haven’t found anything that looks like that right now. And fundamentally if I look at our pipeline, I look at everything that’s going on in the marketplace. I still have a high level of confidence this pipeline will drive us through where we need to go.
Liz Shea: Thanks Jami. Operator we’ll take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Q – Steve Scala: As we approach the launch of HUMIRA biosimilars in the EU, is anything shaping up differently then you would have expected either positively or negatively? In the past you’ve spoken to that the fact that you’re implementing defense strategies and I’m not aware that you’ve amplified on them, perhaps you could now. Secondly has the Risankizumab filing been accepted and is there a PDUFA date and then thirdly can you give us VENCLEXTA sales in the second quarter? Thank you.
A – Rick Gonzalez: Steve, this is Rick. Let me take the first one, Mike take the second and Bill can take the third and maybe I can add some color onto the third. So as far as biosimilar assumptions in the EU. I’d say there is nothing different from what we had anticipated. I recently had a review I’m going to have another review in a month or so with the team. I’d say everything is tracking as we had assumed it would track, so and we certainly wouldn’t, if we had concerns we certainly wouldn’t be raising guidance at this point because we’re already delivering tremendous levels of performance if we had any level of uncertainty and based on what I said a few moments ago, we take extremely seriously that we’re never going to miss. We wouldn’t be raising guidance at this point, unless we had a lot of confidence in what that fourth quarter was going to look like. Now am I going to go through the defense strategies, I apologize on that because unfortunately it’s not my objective to telegraph to all of our competitors, what our defense strategies are? But what I can tell you is, thus far it is playing out exactly as we had planned it to play out and certainly as we go through the fourth quarter all of our are going to get a lot of clarity, on with that quarter looks like. I think buyer actions you can probably tell, we feel about it. But we’re all going to know here soon. And I have confidence in how we’re going to execute against that.
Mike Severino: Okay, so this is Mike. With respect to the Risa file, the file was submitted in April. It was accepted on scheduled, so it would be June. We don’t typically give exact PDUFA dates, but you can do the math from there. It’s a standard 10 plus 2 review, so I call it – and although it’s very early what I would say is the file is going very smoothly and matching our very high expectations.
Bill Chase: VENCLEXTA sales in the quarter were $65 million.
A – Rick Gonzalez: Thanks for that, that’s accurate. I will say that since the MURANO approval, we have seen an inflection point in patient starts. We track patient starts on VENCLEXTA like we do on other drugs. And so we have seen a fairly significant uptick in patient starts and so we are I think we’re encouraged based on what we’re seeing here now. It’s obviously very early since but I think if you look at that data, you look at the position, you look at the feedback that we’re getting from KOLs [ph] about their excitement about this asset and most importantly if you look at the benefit they can provide patients in this Relapsed/Refractory setting particularly patients who have failed BTK inhibitor. I think it’s a tremendous opportunity going forward for us. And I think another big opportunity for VENCLEXTA is AML. This is a very serious disease has bad outcomes for patients, particularly patients that can’t tolerate intensive chemotherapy and this is an excellent new therapy for those patients and it provides significant benefit for those patients and so I think our ability to have a big impact in AML is a high probability.
Liz Shea: Thanks Steve. Operator next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.
Q – Jason Gerberry: I appreciate the guidance on elagolix launch for this. Could you talk a little bit more about how that launch progresses what I mean by that is, is the slow early launch is it more to do it educating the docs around the monitoring requirements are in the label or is it just difficult revenue recognition early on just because of presumably early access barriers? My second question, I’m not sure if you’re going to be able to answer this, but can you just talk a little bit about the differential gross margin profile for HUMIRA US versus ex-US? Just wondering because the price point is so different on those and just kind of curios, do you guys still kind of standby the 50% operating margin target by 2020? Thanks.
A – Rick Gonzalez: First on ORILISSA there isn’t any monitoring requirements in the label, but maybe let me back up a little bit and talk about what are the key attributes of this product in order for it to be successful and then I’ll talk about the ramp. So if you think about this area, what you would want to get the maximum value out of an asset in this area is, one you want a drug that gives high levels of efficacy, has a relatively clean safety profile, fast on, fast off because many of these women are reproductive age and they want to, if they choose to become pregnant or try to become pregnant, you want a drug they can stop taking and therefore they can move forward from a pregnancy standpoint. You want a label that allows for clinical diagnosis not diagnosis by lab, which is what we have. We wanted two doses because you have different levels of pain among these women and so you want to be able to titrate the dose depending upon their level of pain and your ability to be able to control that pain overtime. We’ve obviously gotten that in the label. You want the ability to be able to maintain therapy for a relatively long period of time and we were extremely pleased with the duration of the low dose being two years and you don’t want monitoring or any kind of black box for a drug of this size or of this nature rather. So we’ve gotten everything that we hope for in the label. We priced it in a way that it’s design to get relatively rapid uptake, it’s price at roughly 30% lower than Lupron which is one of the competitive alternatives, that’s available and so I think we have priced it in a way that should enhance the length. Now having said that, there hasn’t been a therapy new therapy in this area now, 15 or 20 years and because of that physicians aren’t used to prescribing medical therapy for it. So and patients aren’t necessarily used to seeking therapies other than paying management kinds of therapies for it. And so there is an education element that has to occur. Now we start at disease awareness campaign already, we started it a couple of months ago and we’re going to continue to run that disease awareness campaign. I think the early returns would suggest it’s working well. six months post the approval we’ve launched then a branded DTC campaign for the drug and so it’s more a function of just getting the patients engaged in a way that they go to their physicians and seek therapy for this condition and number two, then educating physicians what are the attributes of this product and how should it be used? And so that drives a different ramp then and HCV is an example or you get a very rapid update. So it has a softer ramp on the front end because of that. but I’d say, if I look at every attribute of the product from a label standpoint all the attributes of the product and we’ll repriced it or designed to ultimately give you maximum value and we believe this is a multi-billion opportunity for us.
Bill Chase: So Jason its Bill Chase on your two questions regarding gross margin and operating margin. We’ve never been specific around gross margin of HUMIRA in certain geographies but you’ve obviously noted the fact that the price point outside of the US is lower and therefore there is less profit. That said, if you look at on a percentage basis whether it’s in the US or outside of the US HUMIRA is still a profile and profit generator and I don’t think you want to be necessarily of the opinion that it would be massively lower based on pricing. So but I can’t give you a whole more guidance from that. And then with operating margin, yes I mean our intent is still to aim for that 50%. If you look at the progress year-to-date, we’re going to be up about 1.5 points versus last year, but what people don’t actually realize is that is inclusive of a lot of dilution related to both partnership accounting and the stem and the idle. If you squared those away and did apples-to-apples, we’d probably about 350 basis points higher still yet. Now of course those investments are exactly the type of the investments you want to make, we’ve been happy taking that near term dilution on operating margin in order to have product like Risa or the ability to have the optionality of Stem. So we’re pleased with our progress. I think what you need to watch from here is two things. First of all the roll off of the rest of the HUMIRA royalties that really kicks in the back half of this year and then again in 2019. As well as the contribution of a more rapidly growing top line and as products like Risa launch for example and Upa and ORILISSA. You should definitely see some real positive [indiscernible] in P&L.
Liz Shea: Thanks Jason. Operator next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore.
Q – Josh Schimmer: For ORILISSA do you expect hormone add-back will ultimately lift the limited duration of use recommendation on the late month, if so when do you expect that would happen? And then is the week stage pipeline program maturing to commercial assets. What do you see is the key early and mid stage programs you’d emphasize is best positioned to take replaces? Thanks.
Mike Severino: This is Mike, I’ll take that. We’re pursuing Phase 3B program for ORILISSA looking at the ability of low dose hormonal add-back to mitigate some of the anti-estrogenic effects are intrinsic to this mechanism of action. We would expect that would allow for longer duration of therapy and we already feel pretty good about the tiers we have, but then maybe some women who knew even more than that and add-back maybe a route, to allow that to happen. We’ve not given specific timing on that study or on subsequent label changes because we’re still in the execution phase, but it’s something that we are progressing very nicely. With respect to the pipeline, as you point out we have a number of assets that are transitioning into commercialization. These are the assets for which we’ve been delivering positive Phase 3 data pretty consistently over the course of the last couple of years and we’ve paid a lot of attention to making sure that the pipeline is full behind that. What I would point to is a number of assets in our early oncology pipeline. We’ve invested a lot to make sure that pipeline is robust. We have on the order of about 18 programs in the clinic in early oncology and that number changes day-to-day as we advance programs, but that’s very robust across a number of areas. We have our stem [ph] [indiscernible] pipeline we have our early immune-oncology programs and some of those are producing very interesting early data, late preclinical and early clinical data and we have other programs aimed at our areas of expertise like apoptosis as one example. So we have a very robust pipeline there that will drive future growth we’re quite confident and outside of oncology we’ve also invested a lot in our pipeline. We’ve invested in our early immunology pipeline with a number of assets now either in Phase 2 or post enter Phase 2. These include things like our TNF steroid, immunology ABC platform which uses a steroid [indiscernible] non-acidic toxic [indiscernible] with the goal of driving very differentiated response in patients with RA and other TNF mediated diseases and if successful that could be a platform that we could apply to other disease states as well, with other targeting antibodies. We have a number of small molecule programs like our BTK and BTK JAK inhibitor combo programs and we have a number of very interesting programs in inflammatory bowel diseases like our CD40 program that is moving forward therein and many earlier than that. so it’s a overall, we put a lot of focus, a lot of attention into making sure that early pipeline is robust and will drive the next generation of product launches and next generation of growth.
A – Rick Gonzalez: I mean only thing I’d add Josh, this is Rick. Is if you think about the strategy we had with HUMIRA, it was a strategy where we tried to maximize the value of the asset by identifying other disease states where that mechanism could be successful and provide a good clinical benefit. As you look at things like Risa and especially Upadacitinib. The breadth of that mechanism I think we’re equally as excited as we were with HUMIRA that it will allow us to be able to expand the indications fairly significantly overtime and remember those are going to come out more in a 2021, 2022, 2023 timeframe. So going in areas like Crohn’s Disease like atopic dermatitis which we’ve seen impressive data. Those are big opportunities, they’re big markets that too is going to add to our ability to be able to continue to grow and add on significant opportunities in the pipeline overtime, in addition to our earlier stage or mid stage pipeline as Mike mentioned in oncology and immunology as an example.
Liz Shea: Thanks Josh. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
Q – Chris Schott: First, can you just talk about the President’s blueprint for reducing drug cost and potential changes to rebate structures? I know there’s a lot of uncertainty here, but we want your perspective on A; how likely you think that we’ll see changes to the current industry pricing structure and B; how you think about that and prepare for any potential changes from an AbbVie perspective? My second question was on the outlook firm for HCV from here, you’ve always have a ton of success in this business this year. You’re talking about north of $3.5 billion of revenue, but we’re seeing step down 3Q versus 2Q. how [indiscernible] how do you think about the trajectory for HCV as we think about the second half of the year, then we start looking out in the future, is this the business that you can maintain at this level or do we start to think about this stepping down in the next few years? Thanks so much.
A – Rick Gonzalez: Okay, Chris. This is Rick. I’ll take those two. So I think as we think about the blueprint that has come out from the administration. I’m saying in our view we believe it’s an important step to address probably one of the biggest challenges that we face both as a nation as well as an industry and that is the significant burden out of pocket cost for seniors in Medicare around co-pay and the donut hole. I mean that’s a significant challenge and I think it’s something that we have to be able to wrestle to the ground. I would say we’re very supportive of the idea, of changing a structure where the net price how the co-pay where paid against. I think that’s a fair and very reasonable thing to ultimately implement. And I’d also say, that if you look at the blueprint it’s probably the most comprehensive look that we’ve seen in a very, very long time at the system and looking at ways to ultimately improve the system overall. So we’re encouraged to continue to work with industry to provide feedback and to provide feedback directly around the blueprint, we’d be interested in making sure that we come forward with solutions that will work. Now it’s little early in the process, so there’s not a lot of specificity yet on what some of those changes are, so it’s a little difficult to look at it yet and determine in tax on the business or any of those kind of things, but I’d say generally speaking when we look to the framework. At least for AbbVie’s business it was, there were probably more positives than there were negatives based on the kinds of products that we have. As it relates to rebates, I know there is a lot of debate on rebates and I think it is important for people to understand. I think some of the facts around rebates. When we do rebates the same as you view a discount. Okay, so from our perspective they are one and the same. Essentially we provide a rebate to a managed care group or a PBM as part of a position to be able to get a formula in position. And in fact, if you look at Medicare. Medicare typically has a higher rebate in fact I’d say it does have a higher rebate on average across the Part D plans for something like HUMIRA then the commercial plans get. Even though it only represents about 15% of our overall business for HUMIRA. So we take it very seriously how we negotiate for Medicare business, but I think there is also a lot of misconception, as it comes to rebating and the importance of rebating and what really drives HUMIRA’s success on these managed care contracts. Certainly getting access in the US is an important issue for any product in any category and we – role in that, but if you look at HUMIRA I think there is four, five important points that investors need to keep in mind. One is, if you look at our percent rebate as it relates to the competitors rebates I would tell you that, we’re certainly nowhere near the highest and in fact, we’re probably in the middle or slightly below the middle from a percent rebate standpoint. The second thing I would say is, if you look at the cost of therapy for HUMIRA for those assets that are on contract again we’re not the highest price product on contract and we’re not the lowest price product on contract. We’re pretty much in the middle of the pack. The third thing, I think this is a very important issue, over the course in the last couple of years most covered lives in the United States have moved to this open formula race [ph]. And those [indiscernible] typically have between five and seven products on contract, with HUMIRA. And HUMIRA does extremely well in an environment where there is full choice. Physicians have total choice to prescribe any one of those drugs and HUMIRA has maintained it’s positioned as the number one product for capturing naïve patients. And so it’s not like we had this position where we have exclusive contracts where physicians have to prescribe HUMIRA. They prescribe HUMIRA because of the attribute to the product, the experience they’ve had, the comfort they’ve had with the safety profile of it and the rest of the attribute to the product. And I think what further illustrates that is, look we compete in every socialized health care system in the world, none of those systems have US Dollar rebates. Physicians have the choice to prescribe any drug is reimbursed in that country and if you look at our market share, if you look at our volume growth, if you look at the percent of naïve patients that we capture it’s very similar in let’s say Europe, to what it is in United States and so that tells you, it’s not rebates that are driving this. It is the attributes of the product and our ability to be able to execute. And so if, I think it would be disruptive to do dramatic things to the rebate but I’d also tell you, I don’t know that there is a way to make those changes any less disruptive way, but what I can tell you it was [indiscernible] is whether we had a rebate based system or we had a discount base system. It doesn’t change our business model. One way or another. I think we could operate under either one of those and I don’t think anybody is contemplating getting rid of discounting altogether. So we’ll have to see how it plays out overtime, but I can tell you we’re confident in what are fundamentals that drives HUMIRA and what’s our ability to be able to continue to drive that level of performance. HCV. So right now we’re forecasting a step down in the third quarter. It’s primarily driven by two sets of assumptions, one is Japan. And in Japan, I think we indicated in the call last quarter, we had a number of patients that were DA failure patients that were in the system getting retreated. I can’t tell you that there is perfect data in Japan on how many of those patients there are, but we had forecasted that would go down somewhat and the second quarter and we continue to go down in third and fourth quarter. It didn’t go down as much as we had assumed in the second quarter, it did go down some, but it didn’t go down as much as we had assume. We’re assuming another step function down of those patients in third and fourth quarter. It’s hard to tell whether that’s going to happen or not, we’re going to have to see, how it plays out, but we normally will operate in a conservative mode and area where we don’t have good data to be able to predict it. The second area is the US and again it’s a similar phenomenon, as we were seeing patient volumes higher than we would have expected. Again we had projected that they would come down somewhat. In second quarter we didn’t see that come down, we’re projecting some reduction in patient volumes in the third and the fourth quarter. We’d love to see how that plays out, but that’s the basic difference. Bill, anything you would add?
Bill Chase: No, I mean market share is phenomenal, it’s really just the market call.
Liz Shea: Thanks Chris. Operator next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from John Boris from SunTrust.
Q – John Boris: Rick, if we look at the word interchange ability FDA withdrew some guidelines there but there continues to be a lot of saber rattling around that such as having proprietary manufactures tightness specification on there, manufacturing biologics to make it easier for companies to get into the market. There’s also some saber rattling around settlements most notably having the FDA [ph] look at settlements on a prospective versus a retrospective basis. Just your thoughts on those two potential risks on HUMIRA. And then last question just has to do with, the phases that you laid out at a competitors conference. Obviously Phase 1 since the spin in early 2013 operational execution has been superb. Phase 2 pipeline delivery and really where investor has been focused is Phase 3 your build out in solid tumors and potentially other areas such as neurosciences. Just your thoughts over the long-term on Phase 3 and the build out in that phase. Thanks.
A – Rick Gonzalez: All right, thank you John. So I’ll cover maybe the first two questions and will have Mike cover question number three. If you look at interchange ability. I would say FDA certainly the discussion around this has ramped over the last several months I would say, but if you actually go back year and half or so ago, the FDA had come out with some guidance around interchange ability, what we needed to do to be able to have an interchangeable biosimilar. And we’re switching studies, I’m sure most investors are familiar what the requirements were. And so at that point, when we were doing our LRP, we made the decision the conscious decision that we would dial in interchangeable biosimilar, [indiscernible] mean interchangeable biosimilar, but I think the prudent approach would be to dial again. So in all of our long range plans we had assumed that there would be one at the point of entry in the US, there would be US at least one interchangeable biosimilar in year one and multiple interchangeable biosimilars in year two and beyond. So I would say we’d dial that into our assumptions because we believe that was the intent of the FDA was to move in that direction. And I’d say that I think that became a prudent assumption because that clearly is, I think the direction that they’re ultimately going in. and so I mean it certainly changes some of the dynamics around how we think about it, but I don’t think it fundamentally the most significant dynamic and that is, we have always said when biosimilars enter the market, when they’re available to be able to enter the market, that we will compete on price in that competitive environment to maintain the vast majority of the line. And that’s certainly good for the healthcare system and I think if you look at the free market system that exist today and you look at examples where that competition has played out like HCV and example, the system gets a huge benefit from it. And so I’d say based on our long range plan, there is nothing in the feedback we’ve seen so far around the biosimilar plan that is significantly different than what we already assume. As it relates to settlements, I think that is unfortunately an area where over the last few weeks or few months, there has been a lot of discussion about the HUMIRA patent state [ph] and our licensing agreements whether that was direct or indirect, that’s not accurate and certainly isn’t complete and so I think it is important sort of set the record straight as it relates to that because we have been very thoughtful about how we did this. So I’m going to cover a couple of points that I think are important, but what I would say on the front end of the system or the front end of my comments rather, is there’s nothing about our intellectual property around HUMIRA or the licensing agreements that we done that we’ve entered into so far, that’s anything close to gaining the system or operating around some set of loopholes. Let’s start with the patents first, we obviously have a robust patent portfolio that protects our investment HUMIRA’s innovation, manufacturing, formulations and methods of use, those are the major areas that we have [indiscernible]. We’ve invested heavily in HUMIRA over the course of the life of HUMIRA. It’s important to recognize it was the first FDA approved human monoclone antibody and we invested a tremendous amount and research and development to expand the approved indications to the 10 different distinct disease states that HUMIRA operates in now. And we’ve improved in the applying to manufacturing and the formulation of HUMIRA overtime and there’s nothing inappropriate about protecting that investment and innovation. In fact I’d say it’s a hallmark, that our society here in the US being able to protect through the IP system your innovation. Secondly I’d say is, if you look at – there’s a mechanism by which people can challenge patents in the US. And if you look at our US patents they’ve been challenged now 20 times in IPR’s at the USPTO. And despite the fact that, in IPR process there is a lower burden approved for invalidity and generally, you get a fairly high invalidation rate in IPR proceedings. The HUMIRA patents have done extremely well. Off the 12 HUMIRA patents that have reached banality in the IPR process, nine have been found to be valid. Further, the PTO has rejected eight challenges the formulation patents and those patents expire between August of 2022 and November of 2028. And this year the PTO rejected challenges to patents covering psoriasis, UC and Crohn’s indications all of which expire April, 2025. So that brings me to our settlements, if you look at that robust patent portfolio our settlement agreement actually facilitate biosimilar entry in the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. In the US we have patents with exploration dates well beyond 2030 and our earliest to expire IP is June, 2022. The first license that we grant to biosimilar was the Amgen license. If you look at the entry date of that in US. It’s approximately six months later than our first two expired patent. Given the breadth of the IP that we have and the overwhelming strength of the patents that we have, the license entry date represents what I would describe as a fairly negotiated license agreements that expedites biosimilar entry into the United States. The other thing I would say is, that’s very important to recognize under none of our settlements are there any payments or any other kind of inducement from AbbVie to the biosimilar player. Instead what there are, there are royalties paid to AbbVie for specified amounts for a defined period of time, by the biosimilar player to be able to enter the market and use those patents and that’s exactly the kind of arrangements that promote competition in markets around the world. So I can tell you we feel confident with our position.
Mike Severino: Okay, this is Mike. I’ll take the third part of your question around the phases of our strategy. And Phase 1 as you point out is operational execution, Phase 2 is the phase that we’re in right now, delivering on our late stage pipeline to create the next generation of marketed products that can drive our growth and then the third phase looks beyond that. It is sustainable growth out into the 2020’s and beyond and what I would say about that is a couple of things. One when you look at pipeline execution there is long-term growth out of our existing pipeline assets as Rick pointed out and with assets like Upadacitinib and Risankizumab we’re really just at the starting gates and there’s a lot of work to be done and there’s like Crohn’s Disease and atopic dermatitis, [indiscernible] inflammatory bowel diseases for Risankizumab that will drive growth. So there is more to that longer term growth story than just aren’t really pipeline. What we have as I mentioned a little while earlier, invested considerably in our early pipeline. We’ve invested in immunology because we’re fully determined to remain a long-term leader in immunology and we have a robust set of pipeline assets behind both Upadacitinib and Risankizumab and those are in the areas that I mentioned already and we’re investing in our pipeline and other areas as well. In oncology, we’ve built a very robust early pipeline. As I mentioned we have a large number of early clinical assets in oncology as well as we late preclinical assets, they’re poised to move into the clinical. These are across wide range of areas. There’s our Stemcentrx pipeline, our next generation immune-oncology efforts which are going very well and other efforts aimed at our core capabilities as a company, expanding on the work that we’ve done in apoptosis with VENCLEXTA for example, with mechanisms that can take us into solid tumors there. So what I would say is, there is large number programs very importantly they’re high quality programs all supported by very strong, preclinical data and for the most advanced promising early clinical data as well. We’re not dependent on any one mechanism or any technology, so we’re very diversified in early set, we’re not dependent on ADC’s per se or in any one technology. Although we have very good ADC programs, we have very good immune-oncology programs and we have very strong pipeline across the board there and that’s going to start reveal itself over the course of the next say 12 to 24 months. We’ve invested considerably in our neuro pipeline both in terms of capabilities in Cambridge Massachusetts Research Center and in our pipeline. Our lead asset AE12 is an Tau Antibody that’s in Phase 2 and two indications, in Alzheimer’s disease, but we’ve built a robust pipeline behind that in neuroinflammation in [indiscernible], in disease modifying agent scenarios like Parkinson’s disease and others. So we really have invested in that early pipeline and we’re starting to see the fruits of those labours. Those programs are now moving to the clinic. They’re entering Phase 2 and over the course of the coming years, we’re poised and delivered, a lot of exciting there.
Liz Shea: Thanks John. Operator, we have time for one final question please.
Operator: And our final question today is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.
Q – Gregg Gilbert: Two quick ones. First, Rick going back to Jami’s question. I’m not sure you addressed sort of whether you’re considering anything that’s different from all that you described to position AbbVie operationally and from a pipeline standpoint. So are you considering anything, doing anything differently than you have already done going forward? And then for Bill, I believe your model for HUMIRA erosion outside the US, due to biosimilar competition it’s based on some other examples that have come before. Do you think that’s sufficiently conservative in light of the growing sort of experience with biosimilars in Europe and the fact that HUMIRA is larger as the starting point then some of those other examples, thanks. Bye.
A – Rick Gonzalez: Gregg, it’s Rick. When you say do anything different I mean clearly we’re still committed to be able to return significant capital to shareholders. So it’s clearly our intent and we have the ability to continue to grow the dividend and we’ve obviously just finished a fairly significant share repurchase. We have $2.5 billion left on the existing buyback program that we have and at the point, where that gets lower. We’ll obviously go back to our board and gain authorization for another share repurchase and so we continue to be committed in those areas from BDC endpoint as I said, we continue to look for various opportunities and if we were to find the right kind of opportunity, we obviously add to that. I think the other question that Jami mentioned was some kind of a spin and I wouldn’t say that we’re evaluating anything in that area.
Bill Chase: And from O-US HUMIRA perspective, it’s the best forecast we have right now, we’re going to be dealing with live ammo obviously pretty quick, but when we look at the way we’re forecasting it relative to the analogs, there are a couple of differences, first and foremost you need to recognize that unlike the analog the people typically compare us to, HUMIRA is growing at a nice pace and so that will make the decrease relative to peak. Look a little less severe than one would think, that have been just a status quo market place where there was no growth. The other thing is, keep in mind that not all of the markets are going biosimilar at the same time that gives us a little bit maybe a little bit of different circumstance given certain geographies that will be going to biosimilars later. So when we back up, when we look at it and we forecast this every year and we forecast it from the bottom up, this is the best number we have at this point in time, but it’s all going to largely be around with them because we’re going to see the real data fairly soon in the fourth quarter and then, we will adjust as we see fit.
Q – Gregg Gilbert: Thank you.
Liz Shea: Thanks Gregg. That concludes today’s conference call. If you’d like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this conference. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are: Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll briefly discuss our first quarter performance and highlights. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D pipeline, and Bill will discuss the quarter in more detail. As always, following our remarks, we'll take your questions. We delivered another exceptional quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter were $1.87, representing growth of 46% versus the first quarter of 2017, a level of organic growth that is rarely seen in a company of our size. Our quarterly results also included global operational sales growth of more than 17%. This industry-leading performance demonstrates the strength of our underlying business and the strong foundation we have built. Since our inception, we have strived to create a business that has multiple strong growth drivers. This quarter clearly demonstrates that level of diversity, with HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, and MAVYRET all delivering significant contributions to our growth. Based on our strong performance year to date as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year, as indicated in our news release this morning, we are increasing our full-year EPS guidance for 2018, which I'll discuss in more detail here in a few moments. HUMIRA delivered global operational sales growth of 10.7% in the quarter. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales grew 11.4%, driven by continued strong prescription volume growth across all three categories. Internationally, operational sales growth was 9.3%. HUMIRA continues to hold the number one market share position across all three categories, and we're pleased with the strong market trends that we're seeing across geographies as well as therapeutic segments. During the quarter, we also announced our second global settlement agreement, resolving all IP-related litigation with Samsung over their biosimilar to HUMIRA. Since our first settlement with Amgen back in 2017, the strength of our IP portfolio has been further validated by four successful IPR decisions. We remain confident that we will not see direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until at least 2022. Moving now to IMBRUVICA, IMBRUVICA delivered strong momentum and growth, with global sales increasing more than 38% over the prior year. IMBRUVICA has continued to expand its position as the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy in CLL, driven by its strong durable response and superior survival benefit over standard of care. Global HCV sales were $919 million in the first quarter, with global MAVYRET sales of nearly $850 million. MAVYRET has continued its strong launch trajectory in both the U.S. and international markets. MAVYRET has now achieved a market share in the U.S. of 45%, and we currently have access to more than three-quarters of the covered lives, with the majority of that access at parity. MAVYRET has established a strong position in other major countries as well, such as Japan, Germany, Spain, and Italy. Clearly, the launch of MAVYRET has exceeded our initial expectations. We're pleased with the strong clinical profile and our commercial execution, which has driven our ability to gain U.S. formulary access and ramp significantly faster than what we had anticipated. We now project full-year HCV sales of approximately $3.5 billion. We also continue to see strong performance from several other products, including Lupron, Creon, and Duopa, which continue to be very stable, profitable products within our base business. We're highly encouraged by our commercial performance and financial results in the quarter. We're off to another excellent start in 2018, reinforcing our confidence in the strong fundamentals of our business. As we discussed on our earnings call back in January, we view the passage of U.S. tax reform as an important business driver for companies like ours. It has enabled more efficient access to foreign cash and the ability to deploy it effectively within the U.S. We previously highlighted a number of our plans to capitalize on this flexibility, including investing roughly $2.5 billion in capital projects in the U.S. over the next five years, as well as our commitment to a one-time charitable contribution of approximately $350 million to select not-for-profit organizations. Since that time, we've continued to contemplate the most effective ways to deploy our investment opportunities from tax reform to maximize the benefit and to support our business over the long term. Now with the benefit of tax reform, we expect to invest more aggressively in R&D, exploring opportunities to augment our early-stage pipeline and add additional R&D capabilities. In support of this, we plan to continue to expand our oncology presence in Northern California, with a focus on further driving R&D innovation. We also plan to invest more heavily in support of numerous products we expect to launch over the next 18 months, ensuring that these new therapies are well-positioned to achieve their maximum commercial potential. All of these actions demonstrate that tax reform is having the intended impact, creating new jobs and helping to stimulate U.S. investment. Based on our strong cash flow generation and our confidence in our long-term outlook, in February we announced a significant increase in our return of capital to shareholders through a 35% increase in our quarterly cash dividend and a new $10 billion stock repurchase program. This morning, we announced that we are launching a Dutch auction tender offer to commence as early as May 1 and to purchase up to $7.5 billion of our stock. Despite AbbVie's exceptional shareholder return, we continue to believe our stock is fundamentally undervalued, especially following the Rova-T news, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment. This tender offer further demonstrates our ongoing commitment to deliver exceptional shareholder return and our continued confidence in our company's long-term prospects. As you know, on the first quarter call, we provided 2018 EPS guidance of $7.33 to $7.43, which reflected growth of 32% at the midpoint. There have been a number of significant developments since we issued that guidance back in January, primarily our stronger than expected operating performance in the first quarter and our expectations for continued robust underlying business performance as well as the acceleration of our planned share buybacks through the tender offer. As a result, we are raising our full-year EPS guidance range by $0.33 to $7.66 to $7.76. The midpoint of this revised guidance is $7.71, and that reflects industry-leading EPS growth of 38% over 2017. The majority of the increase in this revised guidance is being driven by stronger underlying business performance. Bill will walk you through an update on our 2018 guidance, including our expectations for top line performance, in just a few moments. I'm going to close my remarks this morning with some comments about R&D. As we recently disclosed, after consulting with the FDA, we made the decision to not seek accelerated approval on Rova-T in third-line small-cell lung cancer. And while we were disappointed with this outcome, we were encouraged by the single-agent activity that Rova-T demonstrated in these very advanced patients, and TRINITY represents the second trial where we've shown clear single-agent responses. We look forward to the data from the ongoing Phase 3 trials in first and second-line small-cell lung cancer, both of which have active comparator arms. We remain encouraged in earlier lines of therapy. And in combination with other agents, we have the potential to see stronger results and more durability of response. But despite the setback with Rova-T, we continue to believe that we have one of the most compelling pipelines in the industry, based not only on the quality and growth potential of the assets, but also on the diversity of the opportunities. We have an attractive collection of innovative late-stage assets with differentiated clinical profiles that deliver meaningful patient benefits. Given that we have largely completed registrational programs for a number of our assets, we have a tremendous level of confidence in their probability of regulatory and commercial success. For example, we recently reported the fourth of five pivotal trials on upadacitinib in RA. Each study has reinforced our view that upadacitinib is truly a best-in-class asset. For risankizumab, after reporting best-in-category results across four pivotal studies in psoriasis, we've now submitted our U.S. regulatory application, and our EMA application will be submitted within the next few days. We are confident that both of these next-generation immunology assets will achieve strong competitive positions within their respective markets. With Venclexta, we are nearing the launch of a major label expansion in relapsed refractory CLL, which represents a meaningful market for AbbVie. We're already hearing positive feedback from KOLs who view Venclexta as a potential game-changing new therapy for patients with CLL. And we're in the final stages of regulatory review for elagolix in endometriosis. When approved, elagolix will be an important new treatment option for patients in this area of high unmet need and a significant market opportunity for our company. Beyond their initial indications, each of these assets have sizable opportunities in follow-on indications, where we're already in late-stage development. These include: Venclexta in AML and multiple myeloma; elagolix in uterine fibroids; and several important new indications for upadacitinib and risankizumab, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and atopic dermatitis, among others. We're excited to see the evolution of our pipeline from promising late-stage development compounds to on-market products. We feel highly confident about our pipeline and its ability to drive top-tier long-term growth. Our pipeline represents a significant yet underappreciated growth driver for AbbVie. AbbVie is a company that has consistently demonstrated we live up to our commitments and we deliver top-tier performance. We're a company that has exceptionally strong operating performance, as is clearly demonstrated by our financial results, an impressive late-stage pipeline, an efficient tax structure, and a compelling philosophy on return of capital to our shareholders, as demonstrated by our dividend growth and our share repurchase program. So in summary, we're extremely pleased with our outperformance in the quarter and with the strong momentum of our business, leading to the increase in our expectations for 2018. We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to continue to successfully execute on our long-term strategy and deliver outstanding shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on R&D. Mike?
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Rick. Today I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss key milestones we anticipate for the remainder of 2018. I'll start with our immunology programs, where we are nearing completion of the registrational programs for our two late-stage assets, upadacitinib and risankizumab, in their initial indications of RA and psoriasis respectively. Based on the data we've generated to date, each of these assets has the potential to significantly advance standard of care in a number of immune-mediated conditions. Earlier this month we reported top line results from the SELECT-COMPARE study, which evaluated upadacitinib against both placebo and HUMIRA in patients who did not adequately respond to methotrexate. This was the fourth study in the SELECT clinical program, and the results showed a significant impact on both signs and symptoms and radiographic progression compared to placebo as well as improvements in important measures, such as ACR response and low disease activity compared to HUMIRA. Given its strong profile, upadacitinib has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy in RA and could offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. We are also obviously aware of the recent FDA Advisory Committee meeting on baricitinib. In our view, the primary safety considerations for bari relating to DVT and PE are the presence of an imbalance of thrombotic events in the controlled portions of their trials, challenges to finding the benefit/risk profile of the lower dose, and potentially concern over sustained increases in platelets in comparison to baseline. When we look at the upadacitinib program, we remain confident in our safety profile, both overall and with respect to DVT and PE rates. Today we have unblinded results from four of the five pivotal studies that will support our global registration. When we look across the controlled periods of these four studies, we have reported five patients with events of DVT or PE in the upadacitinib groups, as compared to four patients with these events in the comparator groups. Thus, we see very similar numbers of events despite the fact that more patients received upadacitinib than comparator in these studies. Therefore, we do not see an imbalance in these data. Second, we have designed and conducted a program that will characterize the benefit/risk profile of both doses of upadacitinib independently. Notably, our lower dose was included in all pivotal studies and important parts of our program, such as our head-to-head data against HUMIRA, and our structural data were performed at the lower dose. Third, with respect to platelets, the pattern we observed with upadacitinib in our Phase 3 studies is a modest decrease in platelets by week four, which returns towards baseline over time. We expect to see data from the final study in our registrational program, the SELECT-EARLY trial, in the coming months, with our regulatory submission following in the second half of the year. Moving now to our other late-stage immunology asset, risankizumab, we've completed the registrational program for the psoriasis indication, and just yesterday announced that we have submitted our BLA in the U.S. The European submission is anticipated very shortly. In all four Phase 3 studies in the pivotal program risankizumab consistently showed very high and durable rates of skin clearance. Based on these results, we believe risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-naive and TNF-inadequate responder populations with moderate to severe psoriasis while offering the convenience of quarterly dosing. We continue to make good progress with the development programs for both upadacitinib and risankizumab in several other immune-mediated conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis, and atopic dermatitis. Phase 3 studies are underway for several of these indications, and we plan to start registrational programs for the remaining indications over the course of the next year. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Moving now to oncology, where we continue to advance our programs for IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we've seen very strong activity across a broad range of hematologic malignancies with these two therapies, demonstrating their potential to transform treatment by driving better long-term disease control and better outcome for patients. With IMBRUVICA, we continue to build the body of evidence in CLL as well as in other blood cancers. We have several studies ongoing to evaluate IMBRUVICA alone and as a combination therapy in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population. These studies will add to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA, providing physicians more evidence of the compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting. We expect to begin seeing data from these Phase 3 trials next year. Moving now to Venclexta, which is currently under Priority Review with the FDA for use in relapsed refractory CLL in combination with Rituxan, we continue to expect a midyear approval for this broader relapsed refractory CLL population, moving us further towards our goal of establishing Venclexta as a foundational chemotherapy-free option in the CLL market. Beyond our core strategy in CLL, we are making great progress with our development programs to expand Venclexta across other hematologic malignancies such as AML and multiple myeloma. We remain on track to submit our U.S. regulatory application for Venclexta in AML later this summer. And we look forward to bringing this new treatment option to the substantial group of previously untreated AML patients who can't receive high-dose induction chemotherapy. This submission is based on the substantial activity we've seen with Venclexta in our mid-stage studies and represents a significant acceleration of our AML program. The Phase 3 studies in AML are ongoing, with data readouts expected next year. The Phase 3 program in multiple myeloma is also progressing well, with key data becoming available in the first half of 2019. I'll now turn to our solid tumor programs, where, despite some disappointing news in the quarter that we won't be seeking accelerated approval for Rova-T in third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer, we're making continued progress with Rova-T in earlier lines of therapy as well as with our early-stage solid tumor programs. In March, we announced top line results from the TRINITY study in third-line small-cell lung cancer. While Rova-T demonstrated single-agent responses in these advanced patients, after consulting with the FDA, we made the decision not to seek accelerated approval based on this single-arm study. Although the results from the TRINITY study were not what we had hoped for, we believe that in earlier lines of therapy and in combination with other agents, Rova-T has the potential to provide important clinical benefit. And we look forward to data from the ongoing and MERU and TAHOE trials in first and second-line small-cell lung cancer. The MERU and TAHOE studies are expected to read out in the 2020 timeframe and should provide definitive evidence of Rova-T's potential as an important treatment option for small-cell lung cancer patients. And finally, in the area of women's health, our regulatory application for elagolix in endometriosis is currently under review. We recently announced that the FDA has extended the review time by three months after requesting additional information regarding the results of liver function testing from the clinical program. We have submitted our response to the agency. And, based on our review of the data, we remain confident in our application, and we look forward to approval in the third quarter. In addition to the endometriosis program, we continue to make good progress with our pivotal program evaluating elagolix in combination with low-dose hormone add-back therapy in women with uterine fibroids. In the first quarter, we announced positive top line results from both Phase 3 uterine fibroid studies, where elagolix in combination with low-dose add-back therapy met the primary and all ranked secondary endpoints in both studies. Data from both pivotal studies as well as data from the six-month extensions will support our regulatory submission for elagolix in this indication in 2019. So in summary, we have continued to make significant progress with our pipeline, and we look forward to many more important data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals throughout the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our first quarter performance.
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. As Rick said, we delivered another quarter of outstanding performance with strong top and bottom line growth. Total net revenues for the first quarter were $7.9 billion, up 17.6% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.87, up 46.1% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and exceeding our guidance for the quarter. HUMIRA global sales were $4.7 billion, up 10.7% operationally. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 11.4% compared to the prior year, with prescription volume growth of 9% and price in the mid-single digits. Growth in the quarter was impacted by retail inventory destocking at a large specialty pharmacy. Excluding the impact of this destocking, HUMIRA sales growth in the U.S. would have been over 13%. Wholesaler inventory levels were below half a month in all quarters. International HUMIRA sales were $1.7 billion in the quarter, up 9.3% on an operational basis or 20% including the impact of foreign exchange. The quarter's performance benefited to a degree from shipment timing. Excluding this impact, operating performance was over 7%. Despite increasing competition, HUMIRA has maintained its strong position as the leading front-line therapy across all approved indications, demonstrating its unique product profile and strong physician preference. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the first quarter were $762 million, up 38.5% year over year, with continued strong uptake in CLL as well as other approved indications. Global HCV sales in the first quarter were $919 million, with MAVYRET sales of approximately $850 million. As Rick mentioned, we've been extremely pleased with the launch of MAVYRET in the U.S. and international markets. In the U.S., penetration of the commercial markets has exceeded our initial expectations, with formulary access across roughly 75% of covered lives and more rapid share gains than we originally anticipated. In the first quarter, we saw an increase in global patient volume, driven primarily by the treatment of warehoused DAA failure patients in Japan and a slightly higher level of treated patients in the U.S. relative to volume in the back half of 2017. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 16.5% operationally, and we also saw strong growth with Creon and Lupron. Turning now to the P&L profile for the first quarter, adjusted gross margin was 80.2% of sales compared to 79.9% in the prior year. This was inclusive of the year-over-year negative impact of partnership accounting and an additional negative impact of exchange due to the strengthening of hedged currencies. Adjusted R&D was 15% of sales in the quarter, supporting our ongoing pipeline programs in oncology, immunology, and other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 21% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points versus the prior year, reflecting continued investment in our unmarketed products as well as investment in advance of several upcoming product launches. The adjusted operating margin was 44.1% of sales in the first quarter, an improvement of 200 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $251 million in the first quarter. The adjusted tax rate was 7.6% in the quarter, with the rate benefiting from the timing of compensation programs. First quarter adjusted EPS excluding specified items was $1.87, up 46.1% year over year. As mentioned earlier this morning, based on our strong outperformance year to date as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $7.66 and $7.76. At the midpoint, this new guidance range is $0.33 higher than our prior guidance, with more than half of the increase from stronger operating performance. Our revised midpoint represents annual growth of 38% versus 2017. This revised guidance contemplates revenue approaching $32.6 billion and reflects a favorable foreign currency benefit of approximately 2%. Included in this guidance are the following assumptions for our key products. We expect U.S. sales of HUMIRA of approximately $13.7 billion. We continue to see robust prescription growth and maintain a strong leadership position across all segments. This guidance reflects the retail specialty pharmacy destocking that we are seeing in the market as well as a moderately more conservative stance on co-pay costs associated with cost accumulator programs in certain high-deductible commercial plans. While these programs have not materially impacted the first quarter performance, we continue to monitor them closely in order to minimize any impact on patient access. At current exchange rates, we expect international HUMIRA sales to approach $6.4 billion this year. This guidance assumes operational growth roughly in line with our prior expectations and is inclusive of the impact of direct biosimilar entrants in the fourth quarter of 2018. For IMBRUVICA, we continue to expect global revenues to AbbVie of greater than $3.3 billion, with U.S. sales just above $2.7 billion. And we are now forecasting global HCV sales in 2018 to be approximately $3.5 billion. Turning now to the P&L for 2018, as Rick noted during his remarks, with the passage of tax reform, we will be making further investments to support long-term growth. In 2018, we are forecasting SG&A approaching 20.5% of sales, reflecting investments to maximize the potential of assets launching in 2018 and 2019. We currently expect full-year R&D expense of just above 16% of our revised sales projection. We are forecasting operating margin above 43.5% of sales, more than 100 basis points above 2017, inclusive of the incremental investments in support of our upcoming product launches and an expected negative impact from currency. We now expect net interest expense of approximately $1.1 billion, inclusive of the financing impact of the announced share repurchase activities. And we are forecasting an adjusted tax rate approaching 9%. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.94 and $1.96. Our second quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.34 of non-cash amortization, impact from tax reform, and other specified items. We are forecasting operational revenue growth in the second quarter of approximately 15%. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect foreign exchange to have a favorable impact to sales growth of approximately 3% in the second quarter. For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the second quarter approaching 10%. Internationally, we expect HUMIRA sales approaching $1.6 billion, assuming current exchange rates. For IMBRUVICA, we expect U.S. sales approaching $700 million. And for HCV, we expect global sales of approximately $950 million, with approximately 40% of those sales coming from U.S. sales. With respect to the non-GAAP tax rate, the second quarter should be modeled in line with our annual guidance approaching 9%. In summary, we are very pleased with AbbVie's performance in the quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations. We have driven industry-leading revenue and EPS growth and are well positioned to continue to advance our strategic priorities. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we'll take the first question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Rick, I just have a couple questions. The first is I think that certainly some of us were surprised by the magnitude of the market share loss following the disappointing news around TRINITY. I think you lost about $30 billion in market cap. And given the small amount of revenues that we had in our models, that seemed like an overreaction. But maybe not, the market is smarter than we are. But I'm just wondering. As you were weighing the pros and cons of a Dutch auction or utilizing that authorized $10 billion buyback versus maybe making the decision to redeploy that cash into bolt-on deals, can you just talk about how you arrived at your decision to buy back stock instead of going out and buying assets? I think some investors saw the news as yes, this is bad news, but I think it also opened up questions that investors have had for so many years again about the durability of HUMIRA, the value of the pipeline, et cetera, et cetera. So if you could, talk about that. And then, Mike, just to follow up, that was a really good explanation about upadacitinib and the trials that you've reported to date. But I'm just curious why you haven't disclosed the DVT/PE rates. You gave us the absolute number, but the actual rates. And any clarity on Grade 2/3/4 hemoglobin decrease versus placebo, given we saw a dose response and placebo imbalance in your Phase 2b study. Thanks very much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Hi, Jami. This is Rick. I'll take the first question and Mike can cover the second question. Certainly, I think we view the reaction to the TRINITY data as a gross overreaction. I'll come back to that here in a moment. But ultimately, we made the decision to go forward with the Dutch auction essentially based on that gross overreaction. We fundamentally believe that the market reaction to the Rova-T data was overdone by a magnitude of 4x or 5x, and therefore, the stock is very undervalued. And when we see situations like that, we're going to take advantage of that. We think that's the appropriate thing to do. We're in the fortunate position that we generate a tremendous amount of cash flow in this business. And despite doing this, we still have all the flexibility that we need to be able to do whatever acquisitions or licensing arrangements that we'd like to do to be able to build the business. And we continue to work on various options, so we don't view this as in any way limiting our flexibility to be able to move forward and do the things that we need to be able to do. As I said, we have the flexibility to be able to do both, and we think this is an appropriate use of some of our cash flow because we think the reaction was dramatically overdone. And to that point, what I would say is if you look at our pipeline and you look at the level of performance that this company has delivered over the last several years, we've delivered top-tier performance. We've built a pipeline that is clearly capable of continuing to drive top-tier performance. Rova-T was the smallest of those assets in our late-stage pipeline. It had an immaterial impact on our overall growth rate in third-line. It was the only non-derisked asset that we had, meaning all the other assets that we have in our late-stage pipeline, we have a significant amount of Phase 3 data that supports the profile of those assets and the confidence that we have around regulatory approval of those assets. And so look, there are always bears on every stock out there. There's always people who have an interest in shorting. They've been seeing ghosts now for a number of years. And at the end of the day, I don't see the same ghosts that they see. Now, it doesn't mean that it wasn't painful to see the reaction, but our job is to continue to drive the business and to drive the level of performance, and you see that in the quarter that we're operating in. And I can tell you, we have confidence that you're going to see it going forward. And over time, markets tend to figure things out, and I think in our case, that will be the case as well. So we certainly feel good about what our prospects look like going forward.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, this is Mike. I'll take the question about upadacitinib and DVT and PE rates. So I think there are a number of things one has to consider when one evaluates the safety of any Phase 3 program. And comparison to background rates is one of the things that we look at, but it's certainly not the only thing and it's also not the most important thing. We talked about our rates being within expectations of background, and they have been throughout the course of this program. And that is one of the early indicators that we look at as our data accrue. But we now have four out of our five studies, which is a fairly substantial amount of our placebo-controlled and active comparator controlled program in the public domain, at least at the top line level. And that's why in my explanation today, I focus on what we've seen there, because what you see within your own program is of course going to be the most important. So you ask why not disclose the DVT and PE rate, we will when we have our full program. The rate changes. It has stayed within that background rate, but there's not a final number until we're done with our program. And when we unblind all of our studies, we'll talk to folks about the DVT and PE rate. But we'll also talk about what we've seen within the randomized part of our trial and the overall safety picture, which, as I indicated, we continue to have confidence in. With respect to your question on hemoglobin, AEs of anemia have been uncommon across the program. They've been seen in all groups, including placebo, and we haven't seen a signal for an increase.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore.
Joshua Schimmer - Evercore, Inc.: Great, thank you. I have three very concise questions. First, how do you see the long-term sustainability of the HCV franchise performance in terms of price and volume relative to current levels? Two, do you see any scenario in which you could file for Rova-T approval this year in the U.S. or ex-U.S.? And number three, maybe you can outline the path to market and positioning for Venclexta in myeloma. Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: So, Josh, this is Rick. I'll take the first question. I think Mike probably will cover two and three. So long-term sustainability of HCV, HCV is obviously a big and attractive market. MAVYRET has done extremely well. It has a profile that fits the marketplace well. I think our execution and our launch strategy has worked well, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. Although the patient volumes do vary a bit and they're not totally predictable, so you do see some fluctuation in treatment volumes around the world and within the U.S. as well, that makes it a little bit more difficult to be able to forecast and predict with a high degree of precision. But this is a market that is going to be around for a long, long time and be a very big market. And I think now, essentially you have us and one competitor who have the lion's share of this marketplace. We're obviously doing extremely well. We have leadership position in a number of markets. And where we don't have the leadership position, we're awfully close to the market leader and continuing to move in that direction. And so we view this as an attractive market, and we certainly view that we have an asset that will allow us to be able to stay highly competitive and in a leadership position going forward. And so we view it as an important market for us, and we think we have the right tools to be effective over the long term.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, this is Mike. With respect to your second question, for Rova-T in the U.S., we view the primary path to approval as the randomized studies, MERU and TAHOE, and that's based on discussions with the FDA. So unless things change substantially there, and we don't expect that they will, we'll continue to view that as the primary path to approval. In Europe, we've not communicated a decision because we're still in discussions with the regulators. And when we reach a conclusion there, we'll obviously communicate it. With Venclexta in multiple myeloma, we have an ongoing study in a broader multiple myeloma patient, but we also have efforts that are targeted at a particular subset of multiple myeloma, t(11;14). This is a subset that tends to be driven by BCL-2. They have a phenotype that's a good fit for a BCL-2 inhibitor like Venclexta, and we've seen very encouraging initial results. So that's an area that we'll continue to pursue as well. t(11;14) is a subset of multiple myeloma, but it's a fairly substantial subset, 15% to 20% of patients, with of course the overall myeloma population being quite large, unfortunately, so there are a significant number of patients with that translocation. So we see both as potential paths that are very promising for Venclexta in myeloma.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Josh. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.
Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Quickly on U.S. HUMIRA, based on the updated guide, it looks like you're not getting much in terms of net price benefit anymore, and I'm just curious. The comments about the co-pay accumulators and whatnot, is that just being conservative into something that's an unknown and difficult for you to quantify at the moment, or as you look forward in this market, do you see the new norm now as low single-digit net price benefits? And if you can comment in terms of where you guys are at with 2019 contracts, that would be helpful. Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: This is Rick. Maybe I'll cover most of that and then have Bill fill in any details. If you look at overall net price benefit that we're seeing in HUMIRA, it's consistent with what we've communicated at the beginning of the year. And that is that we're seeing prescription volume growth of about 9% in the U.S., and we're seeing mid-single-digit price fall-through. And that's consistent with what we had planned for, with one price increase at the level that we have been communicating. As far as accumulator programs and our comments around that, obviously these are a new entity that has moved into the marketplace. It's not a large percentage of the overall patient volume. It represents about 4% or so of the HUMIRA patient volume, so it's not a very large portion of the patients. Obviously, we think these programs are bad policy, particularly for patients that are on specialty medicines, chronic specialty medicines. And we have not seen any impact from them in the first quarter yet, although I'm not sure we would see a big impact in the first quarter based on how they operate. What we are assuming going forward is that, because of the higher deductibles that these patients will have that potentially we will see an increase in their use of the co-pay programs that we and all of our competitors have as well, that the amount of funds that they need to be able to get to their deductible will be higher than what we're running now on average across the board. And so what we have built in is some additional amounts for that patient population. And probably the easiest way to think about it is this. So if they have a higher average deductible than what the average was in the prior years, most of these patients, because they do have chronic conditions, have many other medical expense as well. So if they would normally have gotten to their deductible in month two at the lower deductibles, now they may not get to their deductible until month four. And obviously, we don't want to lose those patients over a month or two. So within our co-pay programs today, they have the flexibility to go higher. They just don't go higher because of where the deductibles are. And so essentially what we're describing is that phenomenon that we have built in more expense associated with that. We're not sure whether we'll see it. We think it's the appropriate thing to do, and we obviously have enough performance in the business that we can do it at this point and watch how it goes and still deliver exceptional performance and actually raise our guidance at the same time. So we're in a fortunate position from that perspective. We're obviously monitoring it carefully and we're going to have to see how it sorts out. It may not be at the impact that we've described here, but I think it's the appropriate way to model the going-forward business until we have more experience with these programs. On 2019, I think we're still early in that process, so I don't know that we have a lot of comments that we could give you at this point on that contract status. I would tell you in the discussions that we've had, we would not expect major differences in gross-to-net or major differences in the level of coverage that we have in lives. So at a very high level, I think that's the way you ought to be thinking about it. But more specificity than that would come later in the year. Bill?
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: And then, Jason, the only other thing I'll add regarding our revised HUMIRA guidance is we are assuming that the destock that we saw in first quarter is a permanent destock. We don't have that coming back. And likewise, when we look at the retail channel in particular, we think we could see a little bit more destocking in the second quarter. So that's been baked into the number as well.
Jason M. Gerberry - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it, thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Jason. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. First, congrats on the great results. The trends in psoriasis for the IL-17s have become a concern. How are HUMIRA trends in psoriasis? And to what do attribute the weakness in the IL-17s? So that's the first question. The second question is on Rova-T. You mentioned that you're encouraged by the single-agent activity you've seen in TRINITY, but you also mentioned durability as perhaps less than hoped. I'm wondering if you can elaborate. And then lastly, the SELECT-SUNRISE trial may suggest that you may advance upadacitinib at a lower 7.5-milligram dose in RA. Is that the correct interpretation? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Mike, why don't you cover two and three and then I'll come back and cover one?
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, I'll start with SELECT-SUNRISE. So the SELECT-SUNRISE study was a study done in Japan. And it's not uncommon for the PMDA, the Japanese regulator, to request additional dose-ranging on studies that are done in Japan for a number of reasons. And so I think you should view the inclusion of the 7.5-milligram dose in that light. The 7.5-milligram dose had lower levels of response, particularly when you look at measures like ACR50 and other more stringent measures, not only in SUNRISE, but also in our global Phase 2b study. So we feel very good about our dose selection, and we're not intending to pursue 7.5-milligram global. With respect to Rova-T, we have seen single-agent activity now in two studies. We think that's very important. The level of activity we have seen is very different than what one would expect with conventional chemotherapy in that setting. That rate, if it's not zero, is in the low single digits. We've seen results that show by independent radiographic review a 16% response rate in the data that we've put out previously. And that gives us confidence that we're seeing good activity, and that ought to translate into clinical benefit in those other studies that I described. The comment regarding durability has to do just with the standard for registration from a single-arm study in a setting like this. And that standard is very high, and the patients that we studied in TRINITY were very advanced. Many were past a point of no return, if you will. There was a lot of very early mortality. So in that setting, it's hard to demonstrate the sort of durability that we had hoped for, and that's what that comment reflects. But we feel good about the activity overall. And we think as we move forward in lines of therapy and also as we combine with other active mechanisms, there is the potential for real and important clinical benefit.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: As far as the psoriasis trends in the IL-17s, I think the trends you're seeing on the IL-17s is similar to what we've talked about on previous calls, and that is that they tend to be relegated to second-line and beyond. So typically, after the patient fails the first-line therapy, which in most cases is HUMIRA, then they'll go on to use an agent like the IL-17s. So I haven't seen a whole lot of change in the overall market dynamics around that. Maybe another way to think about it is to more broadly look at HUMIRA, and not just the psoriasis market but overall the market. And if you look at HUMIRA, obviously it continues to perform extremely well. It performs well because it's in big markets that are growing, and obviously the asset has the profile and our execution is such that we get the vast majority of the front-line patients moving into HUMIRA and we're able to sustain those patients over time. If you look at the overall market growth rate, it's running about 10% or 11%. That varies from mid-single digits, 6%, 7% in rheumatology to high teens in derm and GI. So those are big markets that continue to grow nicely. If you look at our Rx growth, on average, it was about 9% this quarter. Again, that varies at about a little over 6% in rheum, double-digit, 10%, 11%, 12% in derm, and GI is more like 12% or 13% overall script growth rates. The important thing in this market is to capture the front-line patients and maintain those patients over time. And so if you look at every one of the sub-categories for HUMIRA, essentially RA, SPA, PSA, AS, psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC, those are the major categories that we measure and you look at first-line capture rate, HUMIRA is number one in every single one of those. It varies anywhere from around 30% on the low end to as high as 56% of new patients capture on the high end across those categories. And so the brand continues to perform extremely well and the markets continue to perform extremely well. But there's still room for a lot of agents in this market because not all patients respond to any one agent, so you need multiple therapies to be able to put those patients in the appropriate level of control. And so the IL-17s and the IL-23s and many other mechanisms will have a role to play in the treatment paradigm for these patients going forward.
Steve Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much for the questions. My first question was just on HUMIRA ex-U.S. and specifically Europe. Can you just talk through a little bit of your expectations on qualitatively quarterly progression of that franchise from here as we think about the biosimilar entry later this year? And maybe as part of that, can you just talk a little bit about what you're doing ahead of biosimilar entry to defend the franchise, and should that – you kind of impact results at all as we think about the coming quarters? My second question was a Rova-T question and just on this dynamic around seeing additional data, not just single-agent but combination. When can we think about getting more robust combination data with Rova-T specifically with some of the PD-1s? Is that something we could see this year, or is that something that's more of a 2019 or 2020 event? Thank you very much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Chris, this is Rick. I'll cover the HUMIRA question and Mike will cover the Rova-T question. So as we indicated in the last call, we have started our preparation activities for biosimilars outside the U.S. in those countries that are going to face biosimilar activity in the fourth quarter of this year. So we have implemented – started the process of implementing our defense strategy. I would say that is going as we would have expected. It's going well thus far, and we're preparing for what will ultimately be the impact that we see in the fourth quarter. We obviously saw robust growth in the first quarter. Bill may be able to talk to that. There was some timing that was in – timing of some shipments within that quarter. Bill, do you want to touch on that?
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Yeah, it was about 2 points of the overall. So if you back that out, the operational growth in the first quarter was 7%, which was still strong. Q2 we would expect a lower growth rate given the reversal of that timing. I think in the 3% to 4% range would be a good number to bank on at this point.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: But I'd say if you look at last year and you look at where we are now, you would expect that the business will grow there up until the fourth quarter in the mid-single digit range, which is what we would expect. And then you will start to see the impact of biosimilars. A little harder to tell at this point exactly how that's going to go. We've modeled it and I think we have a pretty good idea of how that will progress and I think it will fall within the expectations that we have put forth. But we're going to need to see as it actually plays out and we watch what the biosimilars' launch strategies really look like, but I think we're well prepared to be able to deal with that. Rova-T?
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. So with respect to combo data with Rova-T and I-O therapies, first I'll say that there's good pre-clinical rationale to believe that the combination of those two agents will be very effective. We currently have an early to mid-stage trial looking at the combination of Rova-T with I-O agents in collaboration with BMS. That's looking at both nivo [nivolumab] and nivo-ipi [ipilimumab] combos. That is an early to mid-stage trial, as I said, so there's not a single period for data readout. Data can be presented as individual arms of the study mature. But I would say that over the course of this year and into the next, we ought to have data that we can talk about there. So it's in that timeframe that we'll be able to see clinical data to support this hypothesis.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I have a couple of pipeline ones. Mike, when you look at both upadacitinib and risankizumab, the profiles look differentiated. Is there anything that you can read into the durability of effect? I guess where I'm going with this is, when you look at the use of I&I [Inflammation & Immunology] agents, you see sequential therapies, and maybe every two to three years patients switch. Is there a potential for either one of these assets to have a much longer duration of therapy, which obviously would impact the model? And then just on the hep C front, I just wanted to get a sense from you guys maybe over the course of this year where you see the pace of OUS new countries and new launches just with respect to reimbursement decisions and the like. Thank you.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, so I'll start with the question on upadacitinib and risankizumab. So when we look at the efficacy profiles, we also see significant differentiation. We see that in a number of important areas. With upadacitinib, we see very high levels of response, high levels of response on the more stringent endpoints, high levels of response in biologic-inadequate responders, and that's in an RA population. Of course, we have other indications that we are pursuing as well, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and atopic dermatitis. And the picture in each of these is slightly different in terms of what the therapeutic landscape looks like. What I would say is both the level of that response and the duration of that response that we've seen in the trials to date we view as very, very encouraging. And so we think that that asset will have a very strong efficacy profile, and we do think that durability will be part of that. When we look at risankizumab, we see a picture that's very similar. We're driving very high levels of response, particularly on the stringent endpoints. And there I would point particularly to the 52-week data in psoriasis, and those data are very strong and show very high levels of response at even the PASI 90 and PASI 100 level at those endpoints. So we also think that durability will be an important point for the risa story. And so we think that between those two assets across the indications that I mentioned, we're going to be able to cover a large part of the medical need.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: In the case of HCV, I think if you look at our business, we have been rolling out in all the major countries around the world. The most recent one that we rolled out was France, and prior to that was Japan. Japan, obviously we had tremendous success in Japan, achieved market leadership in a very short period of time and sustained a very high level of market share, so the adoption of the product in Japan was extremely good. We're ramping in France now to some extent. What is left is typically smaller countries now. We'll be rolling those out over the course of the next several months. As far as reimbursement decisions, it varies pretty dramatically. When the first generation of HCV products came out, many countries did two things. One, they typically funded their later-stage later F-score patients, and they funded their healthcare budgets on a year-by-year basis, which isn't typical of how they would do a program like this. But because of that, they had to come back each year and make a determination as to how much funding they would put in. We still see that happening in certain countries around the world. So it is a difficult question I guess for me to answer for you with any level of specificity. But generally speaking, I'd say if you look across the board, the overall reimbursed population is relatively consistent. The mix is obviously different, but it does vary from country to country.
Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks a lot.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you, a few quick ones. First, Bill, you mentioned the financing impact on the tender. Can you talk to the financing aspects of that? Two, what's the latest on your ongoing HUMIRA IP litigation, and are there any milestones or dates we should be aware of? And lastly, Rick, back to corporate strategy, I was curious how you balance your views on short-term stock valuation with the reality that your enterprise value is quite large, bigger than Merck's for example, and many of the companies in biopharma. So I know you don't want to be bigger just to be bigger, but it does seem that you have a unique opportunity on a relative basis, especially as your stock recovers here on the back of today's news. Thanks.
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: So on the financing, recognized financing costs include lost interest income as well as interest expense. So obviously, we're going to deploy a sizable amount of our cash to this. We may have to top that off with some short-term loans just based on the timing of moving cash around between geographies, but this is not going to require any long-term financing.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: On the HUMIRA litigation, I would not say there's anything really new to report there. And frankly, litigation is probably not something we're going to spend a lot of time describing in a high level of detail. But what I can tell you on the current litigation is it is proceeding as we have described to you, so the time windows are consistent with what we've described to you. And I wouldn't expect any kind of significant event for quite some period of time as we go through the normal process that you go through in a litigation process like discovery, et cetera. So this is going to play out over years, as we've described to you before. So there's really nothing new to report there from that perspective. I think you make an excellent point about the value of our company, the enterprise value of our company. Obviously, the P/E of the stock compared to where it was several years ago, all of those things basically create an opportunity that if you wanted to do a larger transaction where you were using stock, it certainly puts you in a much better position to be able to do that. And so that makes obvious sense in what you're describing and certainly gives us the ability to be able to do things like that. We tend to look at what we're going to do to build the business around the backdrop of what our company's value proposition is and we're trying to drive. Our company value proposition is that we are committed to drive top-tier growth over the long term and build a pipeline that is capable of being able to drive us at that level despite all of the ins and outs that will occur in the business going forward and be able to perform at that level. If we thought a large transaction was what was necessary to be able to do that, obviously we would pursue a large transaction. But what I've said to you many quarters in a row now, we're in the fortunate position, like this quarter where we're driving a tremendous amount of growth, as we look forward, we believe we can continue to drive a significant amount of growth, a top-tier level of growth. You can never have enough pipeline in the business that we're in. and so we obviously have a very strong desire to continue to build our pipeline. But right now, we're building it more around more individual products or platforms, bolt-on kinds of platforms. And most of the time, those don't require stock to be the vehicle by which you acquire those assets. That's not to say we haven't done it. We obviously had stock in other transactions like Pharmacyclics, as an example. But that was more around the dynamics of the transaction that drove it than the need to have to do it through that vehicle. So I think your point is valid. Our goal will be to continue to build the value of the company, so I would expect that we'll be in that position for quite some time. And we'll continue to evaluate what our strategic plan is to build it. But right now, that is our area of focus, more these bolt-ons and building the mid-stage and the early-stage pipeline.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks for the color.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Gregg. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Our next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks so much for taking my questions. A couple quick follow-up ones on Rova-T and then one the co-pay accumulator side. Just on Rova-T, can you disclose what the cutoff was that you used for the high DLL3 expression in TRINITY? I don't think those are in the press release. I'm not sure if you've disclosed it since then. And also, if you can, just comment a little bit on the toxicity side. Obviously, comments around the efficacy your\ made just in terms...
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: We're having a little bit of a tough time hearing you. I don't know if you can hear us all right.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, I'm sorry. I can hear you fine. I'll try again. Just quickly on Rova-T, just what the cutoff was for high expression for DLL3 in the TRINITY trial and any comments on the toxicity side. And on the co-pay accumulator programs, I'm just curious. As we've talked to consultants on this one, they think the impact might be more for newer products as they get launched because they don't – payers may not want to disrupt a large number of patients already on something like HUMIRA. So do you think is a bigger risk for newer products like upadacitinib and risankizumab as they get launched, or do you think this is a significant risk for established products like HUMIRA and Enbrel right now?
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Mike, why don't you cover the first one? I'll cover the second one.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: So on Rova-T, the cutoff for DLL3 high expressers had to do with percentage of cells expressing, and we've looked at cutoffs like 25% and 75% of cells. Now what we found is that most of the positives are high positives because then when this is expressed, it's expressed pretty broadly. But those are the thresholds that we've looked at. I had a hard time hearing the second part of your Rova-T question. I believe it was about the safety that we observed in the TRINITY trial. Is that correct?
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yes, just how did that compare to what you were expecting? I think it looks a little bit more like...
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: So the safety in TRINITY has looked very consistent with what we observed in the Phase 1b and was very consistent with our expectations. Some of the key events were actually present in lower percentages of patients, at least numerically, in TRINITY as compared to the Phase 1b, so for example, the sorts of AEs that we look at, like the effusions and the other AEs that were identified the Phase 1b trial. But overall, I would say it was very consistent with our Phase 1b experience and very consistent with our expectations.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. On the co-pay accumulator programs, I have not heard that description that you've described. But look, it's like anything else. There are lots and lots of programs out there. Could there be a program that was similar to what you're describing? Certainly, that can be the case. I would say in general, as we look at these and as we think about them, essentially what they're designed to do is to raise the co-pay to a higher level. They're typically high-deductible plans that have a higher co-pay, and they try to force back on the patient a higher level of that co-pay and their responsibility to that co-pay. The ones I've seen are built around – they cover all expenses, medical expenses that that patient has, so not just drugs but physicians or hospitalization or all those kinds of costs. And so essentially what it does is what I described before, is you may have a co-pay that's $4,000. The average is between $4,000 and $5,000 in these programs. There are some that go as high as $10,000, but the average is more like $4,000 to $5,000. Let's say the typical co-pay would be closer to $1,500 to $2,000 on a typical medical program. So you have to get to a much higher co-pay in order for the insurance company to take on the greater responsibility. And that is not specific to a product, at least in the experiences that I've seen. As I said, I don't view them as a major threat. I view them as extremely bad healthcare policy because I think trying to put that level of burden on a patient who needs a chronic medication just is not the appropriate way to be able to try to manage those patients over the long term. But having said that, this is a relatively small percentage, and we think the biggest impact will be that it will incur some additional costs for those patients going forward. And therefore, we are reflecting some of that cost in our P&L going forward as well.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thanks, and sorry about the audio there. Thanks.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Vamil. Ylonne, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks very much. I had a few questions. First, could you just tell us what percentage of the U.S. population has a co-pay accumulator in their benefits? I just don't have a good understanding of where we are today. I thought it was a tiny percentage of the country, yet it is having an impact in 2018 when it's just getting started. Second, with respect to the upadacitinib DVT and PE figures of five patients versus four in control, my sense was that the foreign control included three on HUMIRA, one on placebo. And I guess my question is when do you think we'll get a better sense for the DVT and PE figures versus placebo? And then finally, with respect to your expectations for HUMIRA ex-U.S. sales declines in 2019 after biosimilars hit, I recall the company talking about potentially a 15% to 20% sales decline next year for ex-U.S. HUMIRA. And I just wanted to make sure that I have that right, or maybe you can remind me what your expectations are. Thanks very much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. So, David, I'll do one and three. Mike will cover number two. So if you look at co-pay accumulators, I can tell you this is our internal data, so it will give you some idea. There are roughly about 20% of patients in the U.S. that are on high-deductibility plans now. Of those, about 20% or so have co-pay accumulators associated with them, so that gets you to this about 4% of the overall HUMIRA population. Now, I think one of the things that will happen over time is for those patients that can select out of these programs, I can tell you we're getting a lot of feedback from patient groups that are extremely unhappy with this policy. And I think those patients that have the flexibility to elect out of a high deductibility plan that has it that use chronic drugs or have significant levels of medical care that is associated with a chronic condition, I think they will exit these programs because these programs don't make a tremendous amount of sense for them. It may be that you have a lower cost of your premium up front but ultimately when they get hit with a big co-pay, that becomes a difficult thing for them to manage their way through. So we could see that percentage come down. Now in fairness, there are certain employers that that's the only program that they offer. And so for those people, they won't have any choice of how they try to deal with it. But it's still a relatively small percentage. You said it's having a big impact in 2018. If you look at the grand scheme of HUMIRA, I wouldn't exactly describe this as a big impact. But there could be some costs associated with it, and we want to make sure we've reflected those costs. We haven't seen, as I said before, any impact yet. We're going to have to measure it as we get into second and third quarter and see exactly what we experience. We are committed to try to maintain those patients on therapy because we think that's the right thing to do. On HUMIRA OUS decline, your recollection I think is reasonably correct. I'd say we updated – and I'm trying to remember which call it was where we took it up slightly to 18% to 20% was the latest erosion curve that we described. The bulk of that probably will occur between the fourth quarter of this year and the end of 2019 because we would expect that the impact to be able to defend that volume will play out over that period of time, and then there will be more modest declines or pressure going forward. And so I would say right now we're still thinking it's in that 20% range, 18% to 20% range, but we needed to see some experience. I think without seeing actually what their launch strategy looks like, we're modeling everything against what we've seen with Remicade and what we're seeing right now with Enbrel. And what we're modeling here is pretty consistent with what we're seeing out there. I don't fundamentally believe we should see something a lot different, but we want to see what that experience looks like. If it's different than what we've described, we'll obviously update the market once we have more experience with it.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, so with respect to the question on upadacitinib and what we've seen in the controlled portions of our trials, as I stated in my prepared remarks, we've seen five patients in the upadacitinib-treated patients and four in the comparators. It's important to keep in mind that comparators range across these studies and what we call placebo is actually different background therapy in different studies, so a placebo on a monotherapy study is minimal background therapy. It might be NSAIDs and other things. In a methotrexate-inadequate responder study, placebo sits (01:19:03) on top of continued methotrexate. And of course, our HUMIRA study was blinded, so there actually is placebo administered there to maintain the blind. But of those case splits that we talked about, three were on HUMIRA and one came from our study that was identified as placebo. That patient was on continued methotrexate. In terms of when we'll get our next tranche of data, that will be with the next study, the SELECT-EARLY study, which we said will read out in the coming months. That's also a substantial study with longer control periods.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, David. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.

Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So now with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, I'll briefly discuss our fourth quarter performance and 2017 highlights. Mike will then provide an update on recent advancements across our R&D pipeline, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2018 guidance in more detail. As always, following our remarks, we will take your questions. We delivered another impressive quarter and year with results ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $1.48 representing growth of more than 23% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. Our quarterly results also included strong topline performance with global operational sales growth of more than 12%. We continue to see strong momentum from our business with three major drivers contributing to our growth; HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, and MAVYRET. Since our inception as a public company five years ago, AbbVie has demonstrated an exceptional track record of consistently delivering top-tier financial performance. In 2017 was another clear example of that performance. We continue to drive strong commercial and operational execution resulting in full-year 2017 global operational sales growth of 10% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 16%. We have also made tremendous progress advancing our pipeline with impressive data from several assets that are poised to fuel our growth in the years to come. HUMIRA continues to deliver outstanding performance with global operational growth of more than 14% for the full-year 2017. This performance was driven by continued robust market demand despite the introduction of new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars. We continued to see strong momentum with HUMIRA in the fourth quarter. U.S. growth was more than 15% versus the prior year. IMBRUVICA also delivered strong momentum and growth with full-year 2017 sales approaching $2.6 billion, an increase of 41% over the prior year. In the quarter, IMBRUVICA delivered strong growth of approximately 39% versus the prior year. We are continuing to see strong uptake in CLL where IMBRUVICA is now the clear market share leader across all lines of therapy. Global HCV sales were nearly $1.3 billion in 2017 including global sales of MAVYRET which approached $500 million. In the fourth quarter, total HCV sales grew more than 62% versus the prior year. While are still at the early stages of our commercialization. We have been very pleased with average strong uptake in both the U.S. and international markets. We have achieved market leadership in most of the markets where we have launched. In the U.S., MAVYRET exited 2017 with a market share of 32%, conforming our expectations that the product will be our highly competitively positioned product within the HCV market. Based on our current managed care contracting status, we have parity access across 65% of the covered lives in the U.S., with much of that access coming in the last 60 days. We continue to work with payers towards parity contracts and are pleased with the progress that we are making on that front. We also saw a strong performance from several other products in our base business. Product such as LUPRON, Creon, and Duodopa continue to perform well in their categories, and we expect and continue to be very stable profitable products for many years to come. Turning now to 2018. Based on the strong fundamentals of our business, we are projecting both strong top and bottom line growth again this year. As you know, on our third quarter call, we provided 2018 EPS guidance reflecting 17% growth at the midpoint. There are been several positive developments since we outlined our initial outlook. We have seen very strong uptake from MAVYRET both in the U.S. and internationally, and continued robust underlying performance from other products and our portfolio, driving our expectations for 2018 higher than we previously projected. This outperformance is reflected in our updated 2018 guidance. Additionally, we saw a passage of U.S. tax reform which will lower our tax rate going forward. Factoring in both items, we now expect full-year 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $7.33 to $7.43. The midpoint of this revised guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 32%, with the majority of the projected growth being driven by strong underlying operating performance. This guidance positions AbbVie to be in the top-tier for earnings per share growth once again in 2018. Bill will provide more details regarding our 2018 guidance later on in this call. For AbbVie, the recent passage of U.S. tax reform enables more efficient access to our foreign cash and the ability to deploy it in the United States. Over the next five years, we plan to invest roughly $2.5 billion in capital within the U.S. and are currently evaluating additional expansion of our U.S. facilities. In 2018, we also plan to accelerate our pension funding by $750 million as well as enhancing our non-executive employee compensation. We are also planning a one-time shareable contribution of approximately $350 million to select not-for-profit organizations, supporting initiatives such as the Puerto Rico rebuilding efforts, children's healthcare access programs, and charities that support our local communities needs. Based on our strong cash flow generation, we also anticipate an increase in our return of capital to our shareholders and we will be announcing those specific details in the near future. Moving on to R&D, where we have built a compelling pipeline of innovative late-stage products with differentiated clinical profiles into sustained and compelling patient benefits. In 2017, we saw a significant evolution of our pipeline with a number of important clinical development and regulatory milestones, which I'll briefly highlight. We saw strong results from several pivotal trials, including data from three Phase III studies for upadacitinib in RA, four Phase III studies for risankizumab in psoriasis, and the MURANO study for VENCLEXTA in relapsed/refractory CLL among others. We also began registrational trials for several pipeline assets including Phase III studies in Crohn's disease for both upadacitinib and risankizumab, upadacitinib and psoriatic arthritis, VENCLEXTA in front-line AML, and Rova-T in front and second-line small-cell lung cancer. We submitted regulatory applications for VENCLEXTA in relapsed/refractory CLL, and for elagolix in endometriosis, which is currently under priority review. And we received several regulatory approvals including MAVYRET in HCV, and two approvals for IMBRUVICA, marginal zone lymphoma and chronic graft-versus-host disease. And while we made significant advancements across our pipeline in 2017, 2018 will mark another milestone-filled year for AbbVie, which Mike will discuss in detail during his remarks in just a few moments. As we reflect on AbbVie’s performance as a Company and we evaluate our future prospects, we see a very strong company, well positioned for the future. Looking at our P&L in 2017 and across the first five years, we see a company with impressive topline growth, strong and improving operating margins, robust investment in R&D and SG&A to drive long-term performance. Strategically, we see an industry leading pipeline of late-stage de-risked assets and a productive R&D engine that has generated a pipeline of early-stage assets with transformational potential. In short, we see a high performing innovative company that is well positioned for the future. This is an exciting time for AbbVie. The productivity of our pipeline is becoming increasingly evident and we have a significant number of upcoming product launches that are poised to drive significant growth. Our growth story has only just begun. In 2017, we launched MAVYRET, which has become a major growth driver for us. This year, we will launch a major label expansion for VENCLEXTA in relapsed/refractory CLL as well as elagolix in endometriosis. In late 2018 to 2019, Rova-T will begin to contribute. And in 2019, we will launch our next-generation immunology assets, risankizumab and upadacitinib. Each of these assets will add significantly to AbbVie's already strong growth. So in summary, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in 2017 and we are certainly proud of the strong foundation that we have built. We have a high level of confidence in the momentum of our business, which is reflected in our 2018 guidance. We are committed to delivering on our long-term strategic vision for the Company and we are poised to deliver sustainable industry-leading performance and outstanding shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike.
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. Today, I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate for the year ahead. 2017 was a very productive year with a dozen pivotal trial readouts, several regulatory submissions and approvals, and several important phase transitions across our key programs. And we expect 2018 to be another catalyst rich year. In immunology, we continue to make great progress with our late-stage assets, risankizumab and upadacitinib, as well as with our early immunology pipeline. We are nearing completion of the registrational program for risankizumab and for upadacitinib and their lead indications psoriasis and RA respectively. Last month, we reported the topline results from the fourth and final Phase III study in the pivotal program evaluating risankizumab in psoriasis. In this study, the enhanced trial 73% of risankizumab patients achieved PASI 90 and nearly half achieved PASI 100 compared to just 2% and 1% of patients on placebo at the PASI 90 and PASI 100 levels respectively. And consistent with the previous Phase III results, we saw very durable rates of skin clearance. We are pleased with the strong Phase III results we have reported across all four pivotal trials and we look forward to submitting our regulatory application in the first half of this year. Based on the data we've generated to date, we believe risankizumab has the potential to significantly improve upon current treatment options for both bio-naive and TNF and adequate responder patients with moderate to severe psoriasis by offering unmatched levels of efficacy and durable effect with the convenience of quarterly dosing. Beyond psoriasis, risankizumab is also in mid to late stage development for several other indications, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriatic arthritis. We recently initiated, Phase III studies in Crohn's disease and expect to begin registrational studies later this year in ulcerative colitis. We remain extremely excited about this assets potential and believe risankizumab could be an important new treatment option across a broad range of indications. Moving now to our other late stage immunology asset, upadacitinib and oral selective JAK1 inhibitor currently in clinical development for six indications across the rheum, derm, and GI segments. Last month, we reported topline results from the third Phase III study from a registrational program and RA. In the SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study, which evaluated upadacitinib as a monotherapy treatment for patients who did not adequately respond to methotrexate. Both doses of upadacitinib met all primary and key secondary endpoints versus continued methotrexate therapy. Consistent with the results from the SELECT-NEXT and SELECT-BEYOND Phase III studies, upadacitinib drove very strong levels of response on all clinical end points. And importantly, on the more stringent end points, such as ACR50, ACR70, low disease activity, and DAS remission. Additionally, the safety profile in the SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study was consistent with previously reported Phase III SELECT trials and the Phase II studies with no new safety signals detected. Given its strong profile, upadacitinib has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy in RA and could offer meaningful advantages of our products on the market today or in development. We expect to see data from two additional pivotal trials in the RA program in the first half of this year with our regulatory submission following in the second half of the year. In addition to RA, Phase III studies with upadacitinib are ongoing in psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease and upadacitinib is also being evaluated as a potential treatment for ankylosing spondylitis. We plan to begin registration enabling studies this year in atopic dermatitis, ulcerative colitis, and giant cell arteritis. Earlier this month, upadacitinib received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation in atopic dermatitis, based on the strong Phase II data we have previously reported. We plan to present detailed results from the Phase II study at the AAD Meeting next month. There is also continued movement with our early-stage immunology programs, where we are developing assets with the potential to significantly raise the efficacy bar in areas such as disease remission and durability of response, compared to products currently on the market and in late-stage development. We expect to begin proof-of-concept studies this year for several key early-stage assets, including our CD40 antagonist ABBV-323, which will begin Phase II studies in ulcerative colitis, and our JAK-BTK inhibitor combination, ABBV-599, which will start Phase II in RA patients. We also have clinical programs recently initiated or expected to begin very soon for other key early-stage assets, including our RORgamma t inverse agonist, and our anti-TNF steroid ADC. Moving now to oncology, where we continue to advance our programs for IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA. These two therapies alone and in combination with other medicines are demonstrating extremely strong activity in a broad range of cancers such as CLL, AML, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which should enable us to expand our already strong position in hematologic malignancies. Through novel combinations of IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA and other therapies, our goal is to drive better long-term goal and outcomes for patients. With IMBRUVICA, we continue to build the body of evidence in CLL, as well as in other blood cancers. IMBRUVICA has already changed the treatment paradigm in second-line or greater CLL and following the strong RESONATE-2 data is gaining momentum in the front-line setting. At the recent ASH Meeting, we reported new three-year follow-up from the RESONATE-2 study demonstrating that in treatment-naïve CLL patients, long-term treatment with IMBRUVICA is leading to sustained improvements in patient reported outcomes and quality of life, as well as significant decreases in disease related symptoms. We also had several studies ongoing to evaluate IMBRUVICA alone or in combination in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population. These studies will add to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA, providing physicians more evidence of the compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting. We expect to begin seeing data from these Phase III trials towards the end of 2019. More near-term, we expect to see data from several IMBRUVICA combination studies this year, including Phase III data in front-line CLL in combination with GAZYVA and front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in combination with our CHOP. Moving now to VENCLEXTA, at the recent ASH Meeting, we reported detailed results from the Phase III MURANO study in relapsed/refractory CLL, which showed a profound improvement in progression free survival and strong rates of MRD negativity with combination treatment of VENCLEXTA and RITUXAN compared to BR. Based on these results, we believe that VENCLEXTA in combination with RITUXAN has the potential to be a new standard chemotherapy free treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. We recently submitted our regulatory applications for VENCLEXTA plus RITUXAN in relapsed/refractory CLL based on the MURANO data. We expect an approval for this indication later this year and look forward to bringing this new treatment to market in the broader relapsed/refractory CLL population. Beyond our core strategy in CLL, we are making great progress with our development programs to expand VENCLEXTA across multiple hematological malignancies. We have Phase III studies ongoing in multiple myeloma as well as AML, where we have received two Breakthrough Therapy Designations. These studies are progressing well with key data becoming available in the 2019 time frame. Given the significant and durable activity we've already seen in AML and following recent regulatory feedback, we now plan to submit our U.S. regulatory application for VENCLEXTA in AML later this year. This represents a significant acceleration of our program as approval in AML later this year or in early 2019 would be approximately two years ahead of our initial expectations. We look forward to bringing this new treatment option to the substantial group of AML patients who can't receive high-dose induction chemotherapy. I will now turn to our solid tumor programs where we continue to make good progress with our late-stage program for Rova-T as well as with our early-stage oncology pipeline. Starting with Rova-T, our registrational trial in third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer, the TRINITY study continues to progress and we expect data in the second quarter with our regulatory submission following soon thereafter. Our ongoing Phase III studies in small-cell lung cancer also continue to advance, with the TAHOE study in the second-line setting and the MERU trial in front-line patients both now well underway. We are also evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in mid-stage combination study with potential to start seeing data from this trial later in the year. Beyond small-cell lung cancer, the neuroendocrine tumor BASKET study continues to progress. And we will be sharing more results from this study as the data mature possibly later this year. In our early-stage oncology pipeline, we continue to build capabilities and explore new technologies that will extend our reach in the solid tumor market. We've prioritized areas of biology that we believe play an integral role in the tumor immune environment or in tumor growth, areas where we believe we can target with new therapies to have broader applicability than existing immuno-oncology agents or chemotherapy. These include the tumor microenvironment, innate immune cell activation, tumor cell intrinsic resistance, cancer stem cells, epigenetic regulation, and therapies based on engineered T-cell receptors. We have more than 20 solid tumor assets currently in the clinic and expect to move several more into Phase I studies over the course of the year. We look forward to sharing the data from these programs as they mature. And finally, in the area of women's health, our regulatory application for elagolix in endometriosis is currently under priority review and we anticipate an approval decision in the second quarter. In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase III studies ongoing in uterine fibroids and we will see data from this program later this quarter. So in summary, we've continued to make significant progress advancing and accelerating our pipeline and we look forward to many more important data readouts based transitions, regulatory submissions, and approvals in 2018. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our fourth quarter and full-year performance. Bill?
William Chase: Thanks, Mike. Today, I'll review the highlights of our performance for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 and provide an overview of our 2018 outlook. I will also walk through the impact of U.S. tax reform on our results as well as our expectations for the tax rate going forward. As Rick mentioned, we had another year of outstanding performance in 2017, generating top and bottom line growth that ranks AbbVie among the very top of our industry peers. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $5.60, up more than 16% compared to 2016 and ahead of our expectations for the year. For the full-year, net revenues were $28.2 billion, up 10.1% on an operational basis, excluding a modest favorable impact from foreign exchange. For the fourth quarter, total adjusted net revenues were $7.7 billion, an increase of 12.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.5% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Fourth quarter global sales of HUMIRA were $4.9 billion, up 12.3% operationally driven by strong demand. HUMIRA sales in the U.S. were up 15.1% year-over-year reflecting volume of approximately 10% plus price. International HUMIRA sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, an increase of 6.5% operationally or 11.7% on a reported basis. Sales growth in the quarter benefited from the timing of tenders in select markets which contributed approximately 2.5% to the growth rate. Global HUMIRA sales for the full-year 2017 were $18.4 billion reflecting operational sales growth of 14.4%. HUMIRA remains the undisputed market leader across the broadest range of therapeutic indications, reflecting its strong position with physicians, unique product profile, and strong commercial execution. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $708 million in the quarter, up 39% compared with the same period a year ago. Full-year IMBRUVICA sales were $2.6 billion, driven by continued uptake in the front-line CLL market and steady gains across other indications. Global HCV sales for the fourth quarter were $510 million, increasing more than 62% operationally over the prior year. As Rick mentioned, we've been very pleased with the launch of MAVYRET in the U.S. and international markets and I'll outline our expectations for 2018 in just a few moments. Global fourth quarter sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease increased 20.3% on an operational basis. Finally, we saw strong sales growth in the quarter on an operational basis for Creon, up almost 11%, and Synagis, up more that 4%. Now turning to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter, adjusted gross margin was 79% of sales, down versus the prior year primarily due to the dilutive impacts of partnership accounting and exchange on hedged currencies. In the quarter, adjusted R&D was 17.1% of sales, reflecting our ongoing support of pipeline programs. Adjusted SG&A was 21.2% of sales lower than the prior year as a result of sales leverage and our continuing focus on operational efficiencies. The adjusted operating margin profile improved by more than 90 basis points compared with the prior year, inclusive of almost 100 basis points of incremental spending related to the risankizumab and Stemcentrx transactions. Adjusted net interest expense was $252 million and the adjusted tax rate was 18.9% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding specified items were $1.48, up 23.3% year-over-year. In the quarter, we recorded a charge of $0.77 per share in specified items related to the 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Included in this charge is an estimated $4.5 billion tax payable, related to previously unrepatriated earnings partially offset by related valuation adjustments to tax related balance sheet items. This one-time net charge has been excluded from our adjusted EPS results. As I mentioned earlier, today we have raised our guidance range to $7.33 to $7.43, an increase at the midpoint of $0.91 over the 2018 adjusted EPS guidance we provided during our third quarter call. At the midpoint, this new guidance range is $1.78 higher than our 2017 results, comprised of $0.95 of operating performance growth and $0.83 of contribution from tax rate reductions as a result of the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Relative to our prior guidance for 2018, stronger operating performance accounted for an increase of $0.08. In addition to the previously mentioned one-time tax on historical unrepatriated earnings, the legislation will allow for a more efficient future repatriation of foreign earnings and as a result a lower adjusted tax rate. We now modeled a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 9% in 2018, increasing gradually to 13% within the next five years as a result of increased domestic income and investment. We anticipate a lower GAAP tax rate in 2018 due to the one-time benefit of the timing of the phase-in of provisions of the new law on certain foreign subsidiaries. This benefit will be excluded from our non-GAAP EPS in 2018. On the topline in 2018, we expect revenue approaching $32 billion, which reflects a favorable impact from foreign currency of roughly 1.5%. Included in this guidance are the following assumptions for our key products. HUMIRA will maintain its strong position as the leading front-line therapy across therapeutic segments and continue to be an important growth driver. In the U.S. in 2018, we expect sales growth of approximately 13% to 14%. Internationally, we expect sales to peak at approximately $6.2 billion this year. This guidance assumes current exchange rates and includes the impact of direct biosimilar entrants in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as proactive actions taken in earlier quarters. For IMBRUVICA, we expect global revenues to AbbVie of greater than $3.3 billion with U.S. sales just above $2.7 billion. Based on MAVYRET successful launch, we expect the global HCV sales in 2018 will exceed $2.5 billion with a roughly equal split between U.S. and OUS markets. For VENCLEXTA, we expect sales above $300 million in 2018. As Mike mentioned, based on the MURANO data, we recently submitted our regulatory applications for VENCLEXTA plus RITUXAN in relapsed/refractory CLL and we look forward to expanding VENCLEXTA into this broader setting in the second half of the year. For Creon, we expect sales growth of 10% in 2018. We are forecasting 2018 AndroGel sales of approximately $475 million. For Duodopa, we expect sales in 2018 of approximately [$458 million]. We are forecasting ZINBRYTA sales of less than $100 million reflecting recent labeling changes and the introduction of competitive alternatives. Based on this level of projected performance, in the fourth quarter we recorded a non-cash charge of $354 million reflecting an impairment of ZINBRYTA related assets. And for Synagis, Lupron and Synthroid, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year. Finally, we are expecting a regulatory decision for elagolix in the second quarter. We will provide specific guidance for this asset following approval when the duration of therapy and pricing have been established. Turning now to the P&L for 2018, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 80%. This is inclusive of partnership accounting impacts and current exchange dynamics on hedged currencies. We are forecasting R&D expense of roughly 16% of sales, which reflects an increase in funding to support our late-stage pipeline and continued progress across numerous mid-stage programs. We expect SG&A to be just over 20% of sales. In 2018, we will be investing in order to maximize the sales potential of assets launching in 2018 and 2019. This includes incremental spend related to the launch activities for elagolix and endometriosis, and VENCLEXTA in the broader relapsed/refractory CLL market as well as AML. In addition, we will be making investments and anticipation of immunology and oncology launches in 2019. Despite these investments, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to decline due to our rapidly growing topline. For 2018, we are forecasting an operating margin of approximately 44%, roughly 150 basis points above 2017 inclusive of the incremental investments for our upcoming product launches. We expect 2018 net interest of approximately $1 billion. Now our first quarter outlook. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.77 and $1.79 excluding approximately $0.31 as specified items. We anticipate first quarter operational revenue growth approaching the mid-teens. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect foreign exchange to have a favorable impact on reported sales growth of 3% in the first quarter. For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect first quarter sales growth over the prior year in the low-teens. Internationally, we expect operational sales growth in the mid single-digits. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect a favorable impact from foreign currency resulting in reported global sales growth in the mid-teens. For IMBRUVICA, we expect U.S. sales in the first quarter to grow in the mid single-digits sequentially over the fourth quarter. Our guidance for the quarter reflects an adjusted effective tax rate approaching 8% lower than our full-year expectation reflecting the fact that the tax benefit on equity compensation is most pronounced in the first quarter of each year. In closing, we delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter and for the full-year and our guidance for 2018 puts us among the top of our industry peers once again with the midpoint of our EPS guidance range representing growth of 32%. We continue to build on our strong momentum and we are well positioned to advance our strategic priorities. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Liz.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks Bill. We will now open the call for question. Operator, well take the first question please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin: Thank you. And I do normally say, congratulations Rick and team on spectacular performance. I want to talk about – ask about you're sitting on a pile of cash that's just going to continue to grow and even more or so with your lower tax rate, you talked about wanting to return that cash to shareholders, and one of those forms is through an increased dividend. Going back it seems that your current dividend payout is about 42% has come down as your earnings has grown, it has been as high as 50%. Would you be comfortable returning to a 50% dividend payout range over time? I know you said that the announcement will be forthcoming, but if you could give us some color as to how you're thinking about that? And then secondly at the same time, given that your stock has completely related that gives you additional strategic options that maybe you didn't have before when you were trading at a significant discount. Can you talk about your desire to use cash to acquire assets that might give you best-in-class growth post 2022? How are you thinking about M&A? I think that you have said thus far that you don't need it by anything big now, you've got a lot of growth obviously, but beyond 2022, 2023 when biosimilar has entered the U.S. market that that sort of changes? So anyway those are my questions. Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: Jami, this is Rick. So first thank you for the complement, we're certainly pleased with how the business has been performing as well. But I think if you look at our business, we're on fortunate position on two perspectives, and I’ll talk specifically about cash and how we think about capital deployment as well. But we have a business to generate a tremendous amount of cash flow as you have highlighted and we have a business that is performing at a very high level and is capable of driving strong organic growth for the foreseeable future. So as we look at capital deployment, I can tell you our philosophy is always that the first priority for us is continuing to invest back in the business in order to make sure that we can drive long-term sustainable top-tier growth. That's the commitment that we’ve made to investors, the commitment that we've made to the organization. And so we are always looking at what we can do to be able to do that. Now if you look at our late-stage pipeline, we clearly have confidence that we can do that, but we are constantly looking at what is out there that fits our strategy both within the franchises that we operate in as well as we have a program internally, we call new horizons, where we look at other verticals that might fit what we’re good at. I would say our primary focus is looking for opportunities that can drive strong growth in that 2023, 2024, 2025 time frame that's we feel confident that we can drive growth with our late-stage pipeline ahead of that. So we're constantly looking for assets in that time frame that could help further accelerate our growth in that window. And we're looking at both early-stage assets and in fact this year, we've done a number of early-stage assets in oncology and in neuroscience. I would say those are the areas that we have focused a tremendous amount of attention on. It’s not the only places that we're looking, but it certainly is an area that's a high priority and we'll obviously look at other kinds of transactions as well, and certainly your points are valid one as our P/E has risen, it does give more flexibility to do other things. Now having said that, I would also tell you that we always look at the return that we can get out of a transaction and it has to meet our internal financial criteria or we're not willing to go down a path to acquire something that doesn't give us the kind of accretion that we're looking for and the kind of return that we're looking for. And so those are always important factors that we look at. For cash flow though, if we look at our cash generation across the next 10 years, this is a business that generates a tremendous amount of cash. And now with tax reform, we have access to that cash in a much more efficient way than we did previously. So it gives us more flexibility to be able to deal with that cash appropriately. So if we look at that cash flow and we look at what we believe our needs to be able to sustain the level of performance that we want to be able to sustain in the business, I can tell you that cash flow grows faster than what we believe those needs are. So as we've said now several times, pretax reform, if there was tax reform then we would look for a way to be able to return additional capital to shareholders. And we've been evaluating that for – actually last 45 days or so, when it became clear to us that tax reform is likely to occur. We have a proposal that we have worked up in order for us to make changes in this area. It does require board approval. I’ll come back to that here in a second. But I think you can assume we've always demonstrated a strong commitment to our dividend and growing that dividend. I think we've grown our dividend to 77% so far since we launched this new company. And so I think you can assume that what I'm describing to you would be a combination of acceleration of the dividend growth and more share buybacks. Now it obviously has been through our board. We have a board meeting scheduled in February. It is our intent, my intent to review the proposal with the board at that point. And we will make an announcement post that board meeting. So I don't want to preempt what the payout ratio would be. I would say to you that you're certainly not. What you describe here is not an illogical way of thinking about it, but beyond that I wouldn’t want to comment much, but I would say investors are going to have clarity on it in the month of February. So it's not too far off before you'll have a good idea of what we're describing.
Jami Rubin: Thanks very much.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks Jami. Operator, we will take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
Jeffrey Holford: Thanks very much. And just first recounting it, while congratulations as well deserved and really nice move on the [indiscernible], particularly into Puerto Rico. So just thanks for that. First question for you, on 2018 outlook, I mean obviously this does not as I understand include any impact from share repurchases, you got tremendous momentum on your earnings I think that needs to be pushed through here. So your thoughts around accelerated share repurchase. This is something more of a progressive program, I wonder if you can comment around that because it would just seem that timing would be in your favor to do something on accelerated basis? Second, really any thoughts here on the long-term guide, it's clear it's not just tax, the underlying fundamentals keep improving as well. Is it fair to say that there's potential headroom particularly on margins and revenue for your longer term guidance when you recently put out. And then just that – just because I still get a lot of pushback on it, I wonder if you might let – care to express a level of confidence around ability to file and launch Rova-T this year, any reason why it shouldn't be 100%? Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. So I'll take most of those and may have Mike chime in on that, on the third one, the Rova-T one, but I will give you some color on that as well. So if I look at 2018, what we have built in is a typical level of share repurchase that we normally have, so we have not built in the incremental share repurchase that we would do. And I would say, we're not at a point right now were we will make a decision as to whether or not it would be an accelerated kind of an approach or would be more typical of how we buyback shares on more of a ratable consistent basis. And that's something I'd prefer to wait until after our board meeting is done to describe to you, but we will have some commentary after that. On the long-term guidance fundamentals, I mean clearly when you look at our business, our business added space fundamentals excluding the positive impact that we've seen from tax reform is very strong. And what we have projected on our long-term guidance, I think is certainly in the top tier of our peer group. I would say our fundamentals continue to improve. The point I made in my comments, I mean we are on the front end of what would be tremendous growth for AbbVie. I think MAVYRET is a good example of the kinds of products that we're bringing to the marketplace and the impact that they can have on patients most importantly, but the impact that they can have financially on the business. And those two in our business, the nice thing about it is they tend to go hand in hand when you bring products that truly make an impact on patients lives, the financial rewards tend to follow. So we feel good about the fundamentals and I'm not going to give you a new numbers, but I would tell you, I sleep well at night knowing how we're performing and where we're going in the future. So I think that probably gives us some feel for it. Our confidence on Rova-T has not changed. I mean we went into the Stemcentrx acquisition with a level of enthusiasm around the Stemcentrx platform. But we have to see what the data looks like and we have to have interactions with the regulatory authorities, and so I would say nothing has changed. But I don't know that we can predict more than that. Mike, is there anything you want to add?
Michael Severino: No, I think you covered it, Rick. Certainly there's a huge unmet medical need and the data that we've shown publicly with Rova-T from the early-stage studies show clear activity. So our plans remain unchanged for making good progress with the TRINITY study in third-line or greater. We'll see those data in the second quarter and we will progression there, and our plan remains to file following those data, and the remainder of the program continues to progress as well. Phase III randomized studies in earlier lines of therapy, the I-O combo studies we're doing in partnership with BMS and the BASKET study in particular.
Jeffrey Holford: Thanks very much guys.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Jeff. Operator, we’ll take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: Thank you so much. I have two questions. First Bill, you said the tax rate post 2018 would increase gradually to 13%. Can you provide some perspective as to the pace of the increase from the 9% that you're guiding to in 2018? And then on ABT-494, the SELECT-COMPARE trial had a primary completion in October of 2017. It's an important trial given that it's the largest of the SELECT trials. Can you say anything on the safety profile that you've seen in SELECT-COMPARE? Thank you very much.
William Chase: Steve, this is Bill. I think you should just model that pretty much a straight line linear. It really does not impact any one-year more than others. So for modeling purposes, I just pretty much straight line it linearly.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Michael Severino: And so with respect to SELECT-COMPARE, that study remains blinded. I think what might be causing some confusion about an October 2017 data is that study has two components, traditional response based on ACR and DAS measures, and then a longer term structural component of that program, looking for innovation of structural progression, and the study remains blinded until that structural component is complete. And so those data will be coming in the first half of this year and that's when we would unblind the study and that's when we would talk about the safety profile of that study in individual. Overall across the program, we continue to feel good about the safety profile we've observed. We see a profile that's very consistent with our expectations both for this molecule and for a molecule that we treat, the sorts of diseases where upadacitinib is being developed.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks Steve. Operator, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
Christopher Schott: Great, thanks very much. Just two questions on HUMIRA, maybe the first, a U.S. specific question, help us understand a little bit of the volume versus price components as we think about your 2018 outlook. I guess specifically we're hearing from some your competitors it seems like the dermatology market might be an area that's a bit more competitive on the pricing front in 2018. Actually, just any comments on dynamics there? My second question was HUMIRA on the international side. I think you mentioned in the comments you are making some proactive actions ahead of biosimilars competition. I wish you could say a little bit what you're doing there and more broadly just updated thoughts about how you see managing the HUMIRA franchise as we think about biosimilars entering the market later this year? Thanks so much.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay, thanks Chris. This is Rick. I think I'll answer the HUMIRA question maybe a bit more broadly because I think every single quarter, as some competitor has a hiccup or claims some level of victory, we have nervousness investors as it relates to HUMIRA. And look I can understand why it's obviously a flagship product of our Company. But I think it would be helpful to maybe more broadly layout for you how we see HUMIRA in the U.S., and then Bill can answer the specifics around volume and price. Certainly it’s a volume driven business primarily, but Bill can give you more specifics around that. So if you step back and if you look at what are the key parameters that you want to understand of the performance of HUMIRA and the longer-term performance of the brand and its ability to be able to continue to grow. This is a brand, if you look at the last three or four years, it has grown dramatically. The percent growth rate has come down somewhat as the brand has grown, but if you look at the absolute dollar growth, it's been fairly consistent and extremely healthy. So it starts with what is your position in managed care. And I would say we're now done with all of our negotiations in 2018. Our position is the same. We maintain a very, very strong managed care position in the United States. The pricing hasn't fundamentally changed for the brand, so there's not any dramatic moves one way or another from that perspective. You look at the overall growth we're projecting. What Bill had described and you can see 2017, 15% growth, and then what we're describing for 2018. The markets themselves – these are big markets, but they're very attractive markets from a growth standpoint. So if you look at the overall market growth rate, you should be thinking of it as high single-digits to low double-digits just in the United States. Let’s say 9%, 10%. Fundamental growth, RA more in the mid single-digit market. Rheum, more in the mid single-digit market. Derm, growing about 15%, so the big market growing rapidly. GI growing about 16% overall, so again a big market growing very rapidly. The next thing you want to look at is what is your first-line share, and what I'm going to quote you is IMS date, which we consider to be the most reliable source of data. And this is data from January through October which is the latest data points that we have. And the reason why first-line is important is that’s the brand that gets the opportunity to put the patient into the highest level of control if that brand does not do that then obviously the patient rotates to something else. So it's a leading indicator of where your share will go in the future for patients that are well maintained, they stay on the brand. For patients that aren’t well maintained, whatever that brand is they move to an alternative. So if you look at RA, our first-line share is 40%. If you look at PsA, it's 47%. If you look at AS, it’s 62%, if you look at psoriasis, if you include Otezla, it's 40%. If you exclude Otezla because Otezla really competes in a slightly different segment, it's 54%. If you look at Crohn's and UC, it's 52%. So we have very strong positions as the first-line agent across every single category. Then the next thing that you want to look at carefully is you want to look at what we describe as first brand, which is essential the naive patient population and switchers. And so if you look at each of the segments and I'm going to do the sub-segments here in a minute. So if you look at RA, SpA, PsA, AS, psoriasis, Crohn's, and UC, we are number one in every single one of those categories. Our position varies from 25% to well over 50%. You've heard commentary from some of our competitors about where they are, so I’ll give you a little bit color around that, but based on the same data if you take SpA, COSENTYX is number four. If you take PsA, COSENTYX is number four. If you take AS, COSENTYX is number three. If you take psoriasis, COSENTYX is number five. If you take Crohn's, STELARA is number three. If you take UC, STELARA is number five. So as I look at that position, I feel very confident about where HUMIRA sits in our execution. And then the final thing is when you look at volume, what's happening with our volume? And in every single category, derm, rheum and GI, we're growing our volume significantly. And so I look at the health of HUMIRA and the health of the U.S. business, and I can just have a tremendous amount of confidence in where we're going. On OUS, we have said all along that we expect the brand to peak this year and then start to gradually decline over time. We've also said that we will compete for volume within certain parameters to try to maintain the volume and ultimately maximize profitability of the brand. So we will be taking proactive actions in countries where that is feasible to do. That's primarily in Southern Europe, so places like Spain, Italy, Portugal. Those markets are controlled primarily by hospitals and so it is our intent to negotiate with those hospitals to be able to put us in a position to be able to maintain our position effectively. Going forward, we've done some of that when indirect biosimilars entered the marketplace and we were successful in doing that and we have already started that action now in those European markets. So you will see some impact on price, it should be offset in most cases by volume, and that's what we have described as a proactive actions that we will take.
William Chase: Chris, on price volume, as I said in my comments for the quarter, the 15% growth, I think you just think of 10% volume, the remainder being priced. As you look at 2018, where we got a projection of 13% to 14% growth in the U.S. year-over-year that we still expect that mid single-digit price range to stick, which would then imply a volume of high single-digits.
Christopher Schott: Thank you so much for all the color.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Chris. Operator, we’ll take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
Geoffrey Meacham: Good morning, guys, and thanks for the question. Just had a few products specific ones. On the hep C front, outside the U.S., I may have missed it, but was there stocking for MAVYRET? And are there any getting factors for getting full reimbursement across Europe and Japan, and then how do you guys think about price U.S. versus OUS? Is it different today versus how you think initially with VIEKIRA? And then for Mike, on upadacitinib and atopic dermatitis, I want to just get a sense from you about the scope of the Phase III. I'm curious whether the breakthrough designation really alters at all your thinking in terms of design like for example our shorter duration study things like that? Thanks guys.
Richard Gonzalez: Yes, so I'll take the HCV question. There was no stocking for MAVYRET inside the U.S. or outside the U.S. As far as price OUS, price outside the United States is basically negotiated country-by-country. It's done usually against some benchmark. And how you compare against that benchmark and so each country is different. We have gotten reimbursement in many of the larger European countries and we've done quite well. So Germany is an example. We have the number one position in Germany. We have the number one position in Spain. We won the tender in the UK. We have the number one position now in Italy. We have launched in Japan. So Japan has approval and we are ramping rapidly in Japan. The one large country that we have not gotten reimbursement yet is France. That is forthcoming. But I'd say the bulk of the countries were in the process or either have reimbursement and have launched or in the process of getting reimbursement and we'll launch once we have that reimbursement.
Michael Severino: Okay, this is Mike. With respect to upadacitinib and atopic dermatitis, we feel very good about those data. And we think that the Breakthrough Therapy Designation reflects clearly the degree of activity that we've shown today and so we are currently actively designing that Phase III program. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation program has in our mind has been very successful and is very helpful because what it gives you is a lot of direct interaction with the FDA, including very senior members of the FDA that you wouldn't typically have access to at the current stage of development program. So we're having those conversations now. I think it is very reasonable to assume that those conversations are going to inform, the Phase III program for upadacitinib in atopic dermatitis. That is very helpful to us in designing the program that will lead to registration in the U.S. Of course, we are also going to design a program that leads to registration in other jurisdictions around the world and all that work is currently underway. So we'll start those studies as we said in the first half of this year and as we get a little bit closer to study start, we'll be able to talk to you a bit more about what that program is going to look like.
Geoffrey Meacham: Okay, thanks.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks Geoff. Operator, we’ll take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Porges from Leerink.
Geoffrey Porges: Thank you very much, and again, congratulations on the results. So a few quick questions, first on HCV, your competitors suggested that they expect the U.S. market to stabilize sometime in the middle of the year both in terms of volume and also in terms of the price or the treatment cost for patient, wondering if that’s your expectation and what you're seeing. Secondly on VENCLEXTA, could you give us any indication of what the path might be to first-line, is obviously is very encouraging data for VENCLEXTA in combination with IMBRUVICA in CLL and wondering if it's feasible that you might do a first-line study. And then lastly, Bill if you just talk a little bit about leverage and that’s naturally de-levering the company, and of course, you’ve got all of this cash flow. So how are you thinking about how you might alter the leverage of the company in the future and does that affect your appetite for M&A? Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. So I’ll take HCV, and then Mike can take the second, and Bill can take the third. So HCV, if we look at the market in the U.S., looking at the two parameters we are describing, one is treatment volumes. We continue to see treatment volumes ebb and flow a bit, but I'd say generally we are assuming treatment volumes tail off a bit. We saw some of that over the holidays. It's a little difficult to predict whether or not it was more holiday driven, but I’d say it's down 5% to 8% from where it was prior. And this has been something that has moved around a little bit over time. I would agree that it is our expectation that the volume should stabilize going forward. But I'd also say that there could be some single-digit kind of pressure, downward pressure. We obviously priced the product where we described it in the public channel market at the level that the current pricing was and we have maintained that pricing going forward. We have been seeking parity contracts – non-exclusive contracts with the payers. And therefore, pricing has not been a big issue for us. So I would expect and hope price stability going forward.
Geoffrey Porges: Great.
Michael Severino: Regarding the question with respect to VENCLEXTA and past to front-line. So we have actually two studies already underway in the front-line setting. One in the younger, more fit patient population, one in an older patient population with more comorbid illnesses on average. Those studies all look at combinations, combinations with CD20s like GAZYVA or RITUXAN. And there are, in some of those studies, VENCLEXTA and IMBRUVICA combination arms as well. So we're exploring multiple combinations in the front-line already.
William Chase: And Geoff on the balance sheet, look we are pretty comfortable with our balance sheet, right now we've got as Rick said robust cash flow. We're blessed with a LRP that has very, very robust growth on the topline and obviously the bottom line. So we will have a natural deleveraging just by virtue of the fact that the business is growing very rapidly. Therefore, our number one priority would not be to take down the absolute amount of leverage we have. You may see us as we have a maturity, take that maturity out obviously to the extent that it's wise to do, but our number one priority would not be to take the overall leverage down. We think we have adequate capacity to pursue any M&A of the magnitude that we'd be looking at in the near-term. And as Rick said, our cash balances are going to grow pretty fast on top of that, so I think we're in pretty good shape from a balance sheet standpoint.
Elizabeth Shea: All right. Operator, we will take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Gerberry from Bank of America.
Jason Gerberry: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. First question just on the tax guidance out the five years, just curious is it sort of – the only reason you gave out the five years, it’s hard to know what will happen in five years time or should we read into anything with regards to your portfolio composition changing in HUMIRA in five years time, potentially changing as a proportion of your profit mix? And then my second question on VENCLEXTA, can you just give us a little color on how you'd envision in the relapsed/refractory setting the pace of reaching peak market share. I know I think in the last quarterly update, I think IMBRUVICA had about 70% of the second-line setting, so just sort of can you walk through the mechanics and the timeframe you anticipate getting the peak penetration in the relapsed/refractory setting? Thanks.
William Chase: Sure. So the purpose of giving some long range guidance on that tax rate. Look, I think it was important for us to put out the right rate for you guys to model from a non-GAAP perspective on tax. That for 2018 is that approximately the 9% number we gave. That said, our business mix will change over the coming years most notably with products driving increased U.S. revenue and income. I think you should look at products like IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA et cetera. And that will have the impact of taking the rate up. And that's why I say gradually as those businesses grow, it will have an impact of lifting the tax rate?
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. On VENCLEXTA, I think what you’re describing is an important phenomenon. So IMBRUVICA does have roughly about 70% of the treated population in relapsed/refractory today. We would not expect the patients will be – well maintained patients will be taken off of IMBRUVICA. So as those patients were to fail or progress then they would be given other treatment options and we would expect based on the data that VENCLEXTA will get a significant piece of that business and of that patient population. So by definition it means that it will be a bit more gradual as it grows because there'll be this trade-off between IMBRUVICA's current position. Obviously, roughly 30% of those patients that are on some other kind of treatment today. There are some of those patients that are on treatment at all, which aren’t represented in that number. Some of those will progress. So it's a mix of all those things. But I would expect VENCLEXTA will ramp based on the available population within that population will ramp within that fairly quickly, but then over time it will be the progression of those patients going forward that become available.
Jason Gerberry: Got it. Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Jason. Operator, we have time for one more question. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.
Gregg Gilbert: Thanks. Bill, back on tax this year, the non-GAAP rate for this year and up through the 13% rate, will the cash rate approximate those levels as well? And secondly, Rick I know you're not changing long-term guidance, but conceptually would it be fair to assume that the tax benefits that you now know about sort of flow through fully or would you reassess sort of reinvestment rates, and Mike lastly anything new on what's next for 414? Thanks.
William Chase: Yes. So I think from a business perspective over that five-year period you should think of the cash rate looking very similar to that rate. Obviously, the one discrepancy or exception to that would be the fact that we will be paying off our $4.5 billion payable over eight years and some of that’s backend loaded and given that we've taken that charge at 2017. The cash flow will be hitting in the next five years, so that’s one area that would be a little different. But other than that over the five-year period [indiscernible] pretty close.
Richard Gonzalez: Yes. On the long-term guidance and the tax benefit, obviously we would expect the tax benefit to be able to flow through over time. Now there's an interrelationship between what you would do from an M&A standpoint. So if you were to acquire something, that had a significant R&D burn going forward just like we did as an example with Stemcentrx and risankizumab, obviously you would dial in those R&D expenses. But I would say generally speaking, you should view the tax benefit as an incremental benefit that we flow through.
Michael Severino: And with respect to 414, that's our antibody drug conjugate in glioblastoma multiforme, so primary brain cancer. That's in our front-line study right now. That study has overall survival as a primary endpoint. So we would be sufficient to support approval, obviously based on the results. That study is an event driven trial. So we can't predict the exact time when that would read out, but we'd expect to have more information from that front-line study sometime next year. End of Q&A

In addition to the news release issued this morning, we have also posted slides on our website at investors.abbvie.com that supplement some of the content we'll be covering this morning. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So now with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. Today, we'll be covering two topics. I'll briefly discuss our third quarter performance and operational highlights, and Mike and Bill will walk you through the quarter in more detail. Then, I'll provide an update on the company's long-term strategic and financial objectives. And as always, we'll provide ample time at the end of the call to answer your questions. We delivered another quarter of outstanding performance, with results ahead of our expectations. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.41, up 16.5% versus last year. We also delivered strong top line results in the quarter with operational sales growth of 8.8%, driven by a number of products in our portfolio. This includes HUMIRA, with global operational sales growth of nearly 15%, and IMBRUVICA, which grew more than 37% versus the prior year. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year 2017 EPS guidance to $5.53 to $5.55, reflecting growth of 14.9% at the midpoint. During the quarter, we announced the global resolution of all intellectual property-related litigation with Amgen over their biosimilar to HUMIRA. We're pleased with this settlement, which we believe demonstrates the strength of our HUMIRA IP portfolio and further demonstrates our confidence that we will not see direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until at least the 2022 timeframe. Importantly, this will allow a number of key assets within our robust late-stage pipeline to enter the marketplace and establish a strong growth trajectory. Mike will provide additional color around recent advancements across numerous pipeline programs, but I'll briefly mention a few highlights. We're very pleased with the significant progress we've made with several late-stage assets. In particular, the data readouts for upadacitinib and risankizumab illustrate that both of these therapies have the potential to be highly differentiated best-in-class agents across a range of immune-mediated conditions. We've established strong leadership in immunology with HUMIRA. The 2019 commercialization of both of these therapies will allow us to further grow that already strong position. We're also very encouraged by the results from the Phase III MURANO trial, which evaluated VENCLEXTA in combination with RITUXAN for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, an indication for which we received Breakthrough Therapy Designation. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed the MURANO study and made the recommendation to unblind the trial based on the strong positive results. The full results of the study will be presented in an upcoming medical meeting, and we're moving forward with our regulatory applications. Finally, this morning we announced we received Priority Review for elagolix in endometriosis. This status, which shortens the FDA review period, is granted to medicines the agency determines have potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment of a serious disease. There have been no new treatments for endometriosis-associated pain in well over a decade. So if approved, elagolix will represent an important treatment option for this painful condition and underserved patient population. In summary, we continue to demonstrate outstanding performance, driven by our strong commercial, operational, and R&D execution. We have delivered strong financial results, and we're making significant advancements in our pipeline. I'll discuss our outlook for 2018 and provide an update on our long-term strategic and financial objectives following Mike and Bill's comments. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Rick. In order to allow time for our strategic update, I'll keep my prepared remarks brief, highlighting just a few of the noteworthy milestones from the quarter. As Rick mentioned, we've continued to make significant progress across our pipeline. In immunology, we reported results from several mid and late-stage trials. Just yesterday, we announced positive top line results from three Phase III studies evaluating risankizumab in psoriasis. Data from these trials demonstrated superior skin clearance with risankizumab treatment versus two leading biologics, Stelara and HUMIRA. In the ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2 trials, 75% of patients receiving risankizumab in both studies achieved PASI 90 compared to 42% and 48% of patients receiving Stelara, respectively. We are particularly encouraged by the durable rates of skin clearance demonstrated in these two studies. At one year, roughly twice as many patients treated with risankizumab achieved full skin clearance compared to Stelara, with 56% and 60% of the risankizumab patients achieving PASI 100 in ultIMMa-1 and ultIMMa-2 respectively. We also saw very high rates of efficacy in the IMMvent study, with risankizumab demonstrating superior rates of skin clearance compared to HUMIRA. Within this trial, we designed a portion of the study to evaluate risankizumab's efficacy in patients who had an inadequate response to HUMIRA. In this portion of the study, patients with an inadequate response to HUMIRA after 16 weeks were re-randomized to risankizumab or HUMIRA. And, of these patients, 66% treated with risankizumab achieved PASI 90, compared to 21% who continued with HUMIRA, demonstrating risankizumab's potential in the growing TNF inadequate responder population. We look forward to seeing data next year from the remaining trial in the psoriasis pivotal program. Our regulatory submission is on track for 2018, with commercialization expected in 2019. Moving now to upadacitinib, our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor, in development for six indications. Last month we announced top line results from the second of our Phase III studies, the SELECT-BEYOND study. In this trial, which evaluated patients who did not respond adequately or were intolerant to biologic DMARDs, both doses of upadacitinib met all primary and ranked secondary endpoints at week 12 and patient-sustained clinical response through week 24. Upadacitinib drove very high levels of response at ACR20. But more importantly, it drove strong levels of response on more stringent clinical endpoints, such as ACR50, ACR70, low disease activity, and DAS remission. We saw levels of efficacy in this difficult-to-treat refractory population, similar to efficacy more typically observed in bio-naive patients. We are aware that there continues to be significant investor interest regarding the topic of DVT and PE event rates. As we stated on our last earnings call, we have a comprehensive monitoring program in place for upadacitinib and have not observed anything in our Phase III program that we consider a signal, and the rate of DVT and PE across the program is consistent with the expected background rate in an RA population. While we can appreciate the desire to characterize event rates for upadacitinib, it is important to keep in mind that estimates based on individual events or a subset of trials have the potential to be inaccurate and misleading. The upadacitinib program is designed to provide a comprehensive safety database with more than 3,000 upadacitinib-treated patients. Evaluation of unblinded event rates and comparisons to rates in control groups and expected background rates must be done in the context of our overall program once the core studies have read out. Given the fact that we have reported data from two of our six registrational trials and that the majority of our database remains blinded, we view any attempt to calculate event rates or compare rates across upadacitinib and control groups as premature at the present time. Furthermore, providing unblinded data from ongoing studies could impact the integrity of these trials, which is something that we obviously cannot and will not do. In addition to our internal safety monitoring program, we have an independent data monitoring committee, or DMC, in place for upadacitinib in order to ensure patient safety. The DMC has access to all data from the program, including unblinded data, and monitors it for safety on an ongoing basis. The DMC is also obviously aware of the heightened interest in DVTs and PEs in this setting and has consistently made the recommendation to proceed with the program without modification. We remain very confident in upadacitinib and are investing in and advancing multiple indications in a manner that is consistent with our confidence. We also recently reported positive top line results from the upadacitinib Phase II study in atopic dermatitis, demonstrating very strong efficacy across all doses compared to placebo. In the trial, we saw very rapid response times, with upadacitinib demonstrating reduction in pruritus within the first week and improvement in skin lesions within the first two weeks for all doses. Roughly half of patients achieved a 90% or greater improvement in skin lesions by week 16. Based on these data, we plan to advance upadacitinib into Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis in the first half of 2018. Moving now to oncology, in the third quarter, we reported that the DMC for the Phase III MURANO trial recommended we unblind the study for efficacy, indicating that VENCLEXTA in combination with RITUXAN met the primary endpoint of the study of demonstrating significantly prolonged progression-free survival in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL compared to a combination of bendamustine and RITUXAN, a standard regimen in this patient population. We plan to present detailed findings from the trial at an upcoming medical meeting, and the data will support our regulatory application for broader use in the relapsed/refractory CLL population. Also in the third quarter, we received regulatory approval for the use of IMBRUVICA in chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. And before the end of the year we expect data from an interim analysis of the SHINE study in front-line mantle cell lymphoma, which if successful would support a label update for IMBRUVICA in this indication. We continue to make good progress with our solid tumor efforts as well, where we currently have more than 20 solid tumor assets in the clinic, 17 of which are in Phase I studies. We have started seeing early data from several of these programs, and we look forward to many more readouts as data mature over the next 12 to 18 months. At ESMO last month, we presented early data from the Rova-T BASKET study in neuroendocrine tumors. While the data are very early, we are encouraged by the findings, which showed reduction in tumor burden and confirmed responses in solid tumors beyond small cell lung cancer. Our Phase III Rova-T studies in small-cell lung cancer continue to progress, with the TAHOE study in the second-line setting and the MERU study in the front-line setting both now well underway. TRINITY, our registrational study in third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer, also continues to progress well. As we prepare for our forthcoming regulatory submissions, we've been actively engaged in discussions with regulators. We recently received feedback from the FDA that they would like to see six-month durability data as part of our regulatory submission data package. This request is not unusual in development programs where single-arm studies are being used to support approval. We anticipate that six-month data will be available in the second quarter of 2018. Therefore, we have moved the final analysis for the TRINITY study to the second quarter of next year in order to meet the FDA's request. We continue to expect our regulatory submission to follow shortly thereafter. In the area of virology, early in the third quarter, we received regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan for MAVYRET. And in the area of women's health, we submitted our regulatory application for elagolix as a treatment for women suffering from endometriosis-associated pain. And this morning, we announced that we received a Priority Review designation from the FDA. While 2017 to date has already been a very eventful and productive year, we anticipate seeing several additional clinical development milestones in the coming months, and 2018 will also be a milestone-filled year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Bill?
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. We are very pleased with our strong third quarter results. Total net revenues were nearly $7 billion, up 8.8% operationally excluding a 70 basis point favorable impact from foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.41, up 16.5% compared with the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance range by $0.04 due to favorable sales and operating margin profile dynamics. There was also a $0.02 benefit in the quarter related to the divestiture of an equity position. HUMIRA's global sales in the quarter were $4.7 billion, up 14.8% operationally, reflecting continued strong demand. U.S. growth was 19.1%, driven by prescription growth approaching 12% and mid-single-digit price contribution. The growth rate versus 2016 also reflected some benefit from customer ordering patterns in the third quarter of 2016. Wholesaler inventory levels were below 0.5 month in all quarters. International HUMIRA sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 6.8% on an operational basis. With its unique product profile, years of physician experience, and broad set of indications, HUMIRA remains the undisputed market leader across all therapeutic categories despite competition. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the third quarter were $688 million, up more than 37% versus the prior year. IMBRUVICA continues to drive strong uptake in front-line CLL and remains the market share leader in CLL across all lines of therapy, with total patient market share of 35% in first-line and over 70% in the second-line-plus setting. Global HCV sales in the third quarter were $276 million. During the quarter we received regulatory approval for MAVYRET, our next-generation HCV offering in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. While we are still in the early stages of our launch, we've been pleased with its initial uptake globally, and physician feedback on the product has been very favorable. Global sales of MAVYRET approached $100 million in the quarter. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 22% on an operational basis in the quarter. We also saw a strong growth contribution from Creon and Synagis. Reviewing the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 80.8% of sales, slightly favorable versus the prior year. This was inclusive of 50 basis points of dilutive impact related to partnership accounting. Adjusted R&D was 17% of sales, up 50 basis points over the prior year, reflecting increased funding of the pipeline. Adjusted SG&A was 20.7% of sales in the third quarter, down 70 basis points versus the prior year, driven by sales leverage and operational efficiencies. The adjusted operating margin was 43.1% of sales in the third quarter compared to 42.8% in the prior year, an improvement of 30 basis points despite an increase in R&D spending as a percentage of sales. Net interest expense was $252 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 19% in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding intangible amortization expense and other specified items was $1.41, up 16.5% year over year. Turning to full-year guidance, as Rick mentioned, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS guidance range to $5.53 to $5.55 per share, representing growth of 14.9% at the midpoint. This excludes $1.26 per share of non-cash amortization and other specified items. Our full-year GAAP guidance has been updated to reflect recent milestone payments and overall progress on the risankizumab program. We continue to forecast full-year top line operational growth approaching 10%, with minimal impact from foreign currency on a full-year basis. This forecast contemplates global HUMIRA operational growth approaching the mid-teens. In the U.S., we continue to expect HUMIRA full-year sales growth in the mid to high teens. For international HUMIRA, we expect full-year sales growth on both an operational and reported basis to be in the mid-single digits. And we remain on track to achieve the full-year sales guidance that we outlined in January for the other products across our portfolio. We continue to forecast full-year gross margin as a percentage of sales to be 80.5% and operating margin to be approximately 42.5%. We also continue to expect full-year net interest expense of approximately $1 billion, and we expect the adjusted tax rate to be approximately 19%. For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.42 and $1.44. This adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.41 of non-cash amortization and other specified items, which represents year-over-year growth of 19.2% at the midpoint. We expect fourth quarter operational sales growth of approximately 10%. And at current exchange rates, we would expect foreign exchange to have a 2% favorable impact on reported sales growth in the fourth quarter. In closing, we are pleased with our strong performance in the quarter, delivering top-tier revenue and EPS growth while continuing to advance our pipeline and successfully executing on our long-term strategy. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: All right. Thank you, Bill. I'll apologize in advance. This section is fairly long. As a reminder, we have posted a slide presentation to our website. These slides are intended to be a supplemental resource for today's call. However, my prepared remarks will not directly follow these slides. When we launched AbbVie in the beginning of 2013, our objective was to build a high-performing biopharmaceutical company capable of delivering top-tier financial performance over the long term. The actions we've taken over the last five years have been designed to support just that objective. Along the way, we have consistently communicated our objectives, sharing with investors how we intend to execute on our strategy and how we're tracking against our goals as a company. And over the last five years, we have consistently delivered a top-tier financial performance, demonstrating that we have created an organization that is capable of executing at a very high level. We've also consistently shown our ability to overcome obstacles and challenges while still meeting or exceeding our commitments. As we look back and we evaluate our performance versus our peer group of 11 companies over the last five years, whether measuring our performance over the past year, past two years, three years, four years, or launch to date, we're pleased that AbbVie has performed first or second in total shareholder return and revenue growth and EPS growth in nearly every one of those periods. We have met or exceeded our EPS guidance in all 19 quarters since becoming a public company, exceeding our guidance in 16 quarters. Additionally, we have acted boldly to build a robust pipeline that will sustain growth over the long term. AbbVie simply isn't the same company it was in January of 2013, and we have delivered exceptional shareholder return over this period, returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. To that end, today we announced that our board declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.64 per share to $0.71 per share, an increase of 11%, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2018. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend more than 77%, and we've repurchased a significant number of shares. As you recall, in October 2015, we outlined AbbVie's long-term strategic and financial objectives, including our growth prospects through 2020, our expectations around biosimilars, and our aspirations for our pipeline. Now that we are nearly at the midpoint of the five-year time period, we thought it would be helpful to recap our progress against our long-range plan as well as provide updates where appropriate. As a reminder, we forecasted the annual revenue growth on average to be approximately 10%, with total revenue growing to $37 billion by 2020. Through 2017, we're on track to deliver revenue growth of more than 10.5% annually, and we remain committed to meeting or exceeding our revenue growth objectives for 2020. We also projected the HUMIRA sales would exceed $18 billion by 2020. Clearly, we're on track to achieve that target in 2017. As such, we now expect that HUMIRA sales will approach $21 billion in 2020. This growth will be driven by continued biologic penetration, as HUMIRA maintains its strong position as the leading front-line therapy. We guided to IMBRUVICA revenues of $5 billion in 2020, and we remain confident that we will achieve that target. Our market share projections and additional indication approvals have all met or exceeded our assumptions at the time of the acquisition, and we remain committed to our guidance for IMBRUVICA. We guided to HCV franchise revenue of $3 billion by 2020. While we're currently tracking behind that projection, the strength of the rest of our business has more than offset any shortfall. We remain confident that our next-generation HCV therapy, MAVYRET, will allow us to significantly grow our position within the HCV market, and it will ultimately deliver multibillion-dollar peak-year sales. We indicated that we would achieve significant improvements in operating margin, driven by a reduction in the HUMIRA royalty burden, leverage from a growing top line, and ongoing efficiency programs. We remain on track and committed to delivering on our target of a 50% operating margin by 2020. And finally, we forecasted double-digit adjusted EPS growth on average for the five-year period through 2020. Through 2017, we're on track to achieve EPS growth of 13.6% annually, and we remain committed to meeting or exceeding our EPS objective. And while we're still in the midst of our annual planning process, based on our high level of confidence and the continued strong underlying performance of the business, we are now in a position to provide a high-level view regarding our expectations for next year. For 2018, we expect adjusted EPS of $6.37 to $6.57, representing growth of approximately 15% to 19% from the midpoint of our revised 2017 guidance range. This level of growth positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for bottom line growth once again in 2018. We have delivered significant earnings growth since our inception. The midpoint of our 2018 guidance is more than double the adjusted EPS we reported in the first year as an independent company five years ago. We'll provide detailed guidance for 2018 on our fourth quarter call. AbbVie's performance since we became an independent company has demonstrated our strong commitment to meeting or exceeding our objectives. Ultimately though, in order to sustain this high level of performance over the long term, a company like ours needs a robust pipeline. We have focused a tremendous amount of attention to ensuring that our pipeline is full of differentiated assets that will fuel industry-leading performance over the long term. We've spoken at length about our near-term growth drivers, a collection of derisked pipeline programs where we have a high level of confidence in the probability of regulatory and commercial success. These innovative late-stage products are designed to deliver differentiated clinical profiles with distinct and compelling patient benefits. As we look back over the past 18 to 24 months, we're pleased that we have been successful in achieving each of the key development objectives related to our near-term growth drivers. Our successes to date give us a high degree of confidence that these assets will achieve strong competitive positions within their respective markets. Our portfolio and pipeline span some of the most attractive segments of healthcare, areas of significant unmet need, including immunology, oncology, neuroscience, and virology, with focused investments in other areas where we have unique assets or strong strategic fit. AbbVie's leadership in immunology stems from more than a decade of experience developing 13 indications for HUMIRA and actively treating more than 1 million patients worldwide. HUMIRA has played an integral role in defining the standard of care. Based on recent developments, including the settlement of our patent dispute with Amgen, we remain confident that our IP will protect HUMIRA from direct biosimilar competition in the U.S. until at least 2022. Over the next five years, HUMIRA will continue to drive meaningful growth. And following the entry of direct biosimilar competition, whether in the U.S. or internationally, we believe our strategy will enable HUMIRA to maintain its strong and meaningful market share position with a manageable erosion curve. As a result, HUMIRA will remain a significant source of cash flow for the company for many years to come Another equally important yet underappreciated aspect of our immunology portfolio is our industry-leading immunology pipeline. Our two late-stage pipeline assets, risankizumab and upadacitinib, each have the potential to significantly advance standard of care. With the forthcoming commercialization of these two assets, our immunology franchise will evolve from a single product with HUMIRA to a portfolio of therapies that has the potential to restate our current leadership position and move into new areas, such as atopic dermatitis. Risankizumab, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim, has the potential to become a transformative therapy in a number of immune-mediated diseases by potentially providing an unmatched level of efficacy, durable effect, and safety across a broad set of indications, and all with the convenience of quarterly dosing. As Mike mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong Phase III results we reported this week, which demonstrated very high levels of skin clearance, and we look forward to submitting our regulatory application next year. Beyond psoriasis, risankizumab is currently being evaluated in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and psoriatic arthritis. We believe risankizumab could be an important treatment option in the IBD segment particularly in patients with an inadequate response to biologics, where there's a growing patient population and a high unmet need. We reported mid-stage data in Crohn's disease where risankizumab demonstrated strong activity, with highly impressive remission and endoscopic response scores. The risankizumab Phase III Crohn's disease program is expected to begin this year, and the Phase III program in ulcerative colitis is on track to start next year. We remain extremely excited about this asset's potential and believe risankizumab represents a significant opportunity for AbbVie. We estimate the nominal sales potential for risankizumab for the four indications I just outlined to be approximately $5 billion in 2025. Moving now to our other late-stage immunology asset, upadacitinib, our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor in clinical development for six indications, upadacitinib has produced strong mid and late-stage data in rheumatology, dermatology, and GI. This summer, we reported top line results from the first two Phase III studies from the pivotal program in RA. Upadacitinib performed extremely well in both studies, meeting all primary and key secondary endpoints, with a safety profile in line with previous studies and as we expected. Upadacitinib drove very high levels of response on disease activity and remission endpoints, and the results from both studies compare favorably to other selective JAK inhibitors which are in development. We think upadacitinib has the potential to be a best-in-class therapy in RA and could offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. We expect to see data from an additional pivotal study later this year, with data from two more trials and our regulatory submission expected in 2018 and commercialization in 2019. In addition to RA, upadacitinib has the potential to launch in five additional indications by 2022: Crohn's disease, atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. In atopic dermatitis, we recently reported positive top line Phase II results, demonstrating strong efficacy across all doses and a clean safety profile. We saw rapid response time, with reduction in itch within the first week and improvements in skin within the first two weeks for all doses. We're pleased with these results and believe this further demonstrates that selective JAK1 inhibition may be a novel therapeutic approach across a broad range of immune-mediated diseases. Based on the data, we plan to advance into Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis in the first half of 2018. In IBD, similar to risankizumab, ABT-494 has demonstrated impressive remission and endoscopic response scores in Crohn's disease, and we expect to begin Phase III studies soon. This agent holds strong promise in IBD, where current products show a waning response and high discontinuation rates, and we're very excited about this drug's potential within this segment of the market. All told, we believe upadacitinib will be a significant growth driver for AbbVie, with nominal sales across six indications of approximately $6.5 billion in 2025. Moving now to oncology, where one of our key strategic priorities is to expand our already strong position in hematological malignancies. Despite the emergence of new treatments that have improved outcomes, unmet needs remain relatively high. We've built a strategic portfolio of assets, including multiple mechanisms of action that have vast potential alone and in combination. With IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, AbbVie has a set of assets that is capable of transforming treatment across a wide range of blood cancers. We're targeting CLL, AML, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and multiple myelomas as well as other conditions. These two therapies alone and in combination with other medicines are demonstrating extremely strong activity in a broad range of cancers, giving us the ability to create a leadership position in the hematological oncology market, a $30 billion market today, expected to grow to $50 billion by 2020 and $65 billion by 2025. Given our portfolio, we're well positioned to drive the continued evolution of the treatment landscape, establishing BTK and BcL-2 inhibition as foundational therapies in CLL and other hematological malignancies. Our goal is to transform the therapeutic approach, allowing patients to achieve more durable, deeper responses. Through novel combinations of IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA, and other therapies, we'll drive better long-term control of blood cancers. The growing body of data for both therapies in CLL and in other hematological malignancies will support label expansion, thereby driving increasing penetration and growth in the coming years. Our confidence in our ability to achieve and sustain a strong leadership position within this market stems from the truly impressive data we've seen from both of these assets. IMBRUVICA has changed the treatment paradigm in second-line and greater CLL and in patients with the 17p deletion and is gaining strong momentum in first-line CLL by providing strong durable response and a superior survival benefit over standard of care. We're expanding IMBRUVICA's use in multiple segments of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma beyond the already approved indications and exploring potential in additional diseases. We continue to expect sales of IMBRUVICA of greater than $7 billion to AbbVie. We've also seen outstanding results from VENCLEXTA's clinical program, which has shown high response rates in difficult-to-treat patient populations, including relapsed/refractory CLL patients with a 17p deletion and CLL patients who have failed prior therapy with a B-cell receptor inhibitor. We recently reported strong positive top line results from the Phase III MURANO study in relapsed/refractory CLL, where combination treatment with VENCLEXTA and RITUXAN prolonged progression-free survival versus BR. Based on the positive results, an independent data monitoring committee has made the recommendation to unblind the trial. Analysis of the data showed that the combination treatment with VENCLEXTA and RITUXAN may offer another strong option for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. We plan to submit our regulatory application in the coming months, and we look forward to bringing this potential new treatment to the market in the broader relapsed/refractory CLL population. We also had development programs for VENCLEXTA in AML, multiple myeloma, and other blood cancers, where we've seen promising results, including strong data supporting two Breakthrough Therapy designations in AML. These indications have the potential to start adding significant value in the three- to five-year time horizon. We believe that VENCLEXTA's nominal sales potential in 2025 across multiple hematological malignancies is approximately $6 billion. Another strategic priority for AbbVie is establishing a strong foundation in solid tumors. We've made significant investments, both internally and externally, in groundbreaking technology and platforms, and we've partnered with leaders across the field to identify and advance promising therapies to address the significant unmet need that continues to exist in this area. We've made tremendous progress over the past several years. We currently have more than 20 solid tumor assets in clinical development, many demonstrating early signs of efficacy, and expect to advance at least 10 additional assets into human trials over the next year. One of our strategic investments was the acquisition of Stemcentrx, which provided AbbVie a late-stage asset in Rova-T as well as a highly attractive discovery and early development platform. Rova-T represents a multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity as we advance into first-line small-cell lung cancer and other indications. As Mike mentioned, in the second quarter next year, we'll see results from the TRINITY study in third-line small-cell lung cancer, and we plan to submit our regulatory application for this indication soon thereafter. Small-cell lung cancer is a devastating disease. And in the setting where Rova-T will initially be approved, third-line-plus, patients have extremely poor prognosis. There are currently no approved treatments, and the five-year survival is approximately 6%. There has been progress in the field with promising data from both Rova-T and I-O therapy. Recent data showed objective responses in I-O monotherapy in second- and third-line patients at 11% and I-O/I-O combinations at 22%. This level of response is a meaningful improvement over the mid-single-digit response rates experts estimate are typical in the real-world setting. Ultimately, we believe a combination of Rova-T and I-O therapy could demonstrate higher levels of efficacy, and we have ongoing collaborations to evaluate this approach with initial data expected next year. Additionally, we have ongoing studies in the front-line and second-line settings. And in parallel, we're advancing studies to validate Rova-T's activity in a number of other solid tumors. The expression of DLL3 in metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma, and some prostate, pancreatic, and colorectal tumors suggests that Rova-T may be useful in these tumor types. Beyond Rova-T, the acquisition of Stemcentrx also brought with it a pipeline of additional clinical development programs, including seven additional novel compounds which are currently in human trials, covering solid tumors from small-cell lung cancer to ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer, among others. Going forward, we're on track to advance roughly three novel assets from Stemcentrx to enter human trials each year. In our early-stage oncology pipeline, we're continuing to explore new technologies that will extend our reach in the solid tumor market. For example, our next-generation immuno-oncology programs are designed to broaden and deepen responses beyond what we've seen with the first wave of I-O therapies. We're using novel approaches, including bi-specific technology to elicit T-cell activation in close proximity to tumor cells. Over the past year, four next-generation immuno-oncology assets have entered the clinic, and we look forward to data from these studies over the next several years. As evidenced by our on-market presence, our late-stage pipeline, and our early discovery and development work, clearly we have a major strategic commitment to oncology. Oncology will be a major growth driver for AbbVie over the next 10 years and beyond, further diversifying our business. In addition to AbbVie's efforts in immunology and oncology, our strategy includes investments and development activity in other attractive high-growth markets such as women's health, neuroscience, and virology. In women's health, elagolix represents a potential new medicine and advancement for women suffering from endometriosis and uterine fibroids, both highly prevalent conditions with limited treatment options. There are millions of women unsatisfied with their treatment and cycling through oral contraceptives and pain medications. These women are dealing with significant levels of chronic pain. We believe elagolix represents a significant advancement for this large underserved population and represents a multibillion-dollar opportunity for AbbVie. Neuroscience is an emerging area of focus for AbbVie, and we are investing internally and externally to develop disease-modifying therapies to treat neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis. We're currently evaluating mechanisms like and anti-tau and RGMa, which have the potential to translate to disease modification in degenerative neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's, MS, and spinal cord injury. In virology, we recently launched MAVYRET, our next-generation HCV treatment, a pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free therapy that has SVR rates approaching 100% across genotypes with eight weeks of therapy for the majority of patients. While it's still early, the global launch is progressing extremely well, with positive feedback from physicians, patients, and payers on its strong clinical profile and our go-to-market strategy, confirming our expectation that MAVYRET is a highly competitive product within this market. Just nine weeks after the launch, MAVYRET has achieved a market share position in the U.S. of over 15%, predominantly driven by the public channel. Internationally, we've seen strong uptake in markets where we've launched, including Germany, which achieved a market leadership position with 40% market share 10 weeks after its launch. We view MAVYRET as a significant revenue opportunity over the long-range plan, with meaningful sales contributions beginning in 2018. Clearly, we have one of the most impressive R&D pipelines in our industry, and we look forward to the evolution of our pipeline assets, from promising late-stage development compounds to high-growth marketed products in these areas of high unmet need. The combination of our own market products and our promising late-stage assets should produce robust growth for our business over the long term. AbbVie represents a unique and attractive investment, offering both industry-leading growth and strong shareholder returns. There are two components of our company, our HUMIRA business and our growth platform, both of which provide a compelling growth story and high shareholder value. HUMIRA will remain the cornerstone of our industry-leading immunology franchise. We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver continued strong HUMIRA performance. And as I mentioned, we now expect HUMIRA sales to approach $21 billion in 2020. Following the entry of direct biosimilar competition in the U.S., we expect that HUMIRA will maintain a strong market position with a manageable erosion curve. HUMIRA will generate robust durable cash flow through 2025 and beyond. These cash flows will fund our pipeline and fuel our ability to continue to provide an attractive return of capital to our shareholders through a strong and growing dividend and share repurchase. Beyond HUMIRA, AbbVie has a stable base business and a highly attractive pipeline, which represents a significant underappreciated growth platform for AbbVie. Our non-HUMIRA business, which today has sales of approximately $9.6 billion, is expected to grow to more than $35 billion in 2025, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of almost 18%. This growth trajectory reflects the strength of our derisked late-stage pipeline, including over 20 new product or indication launches by 2020, supporting our ability to sustain top-tier revenue growth despite the entry of direct biosimilar competition. Based on consensus estimates, AbbVie's top and bottom line growth over the next five years is projected to be in the top quartile of our peer group, while our P/E multiple currently ranks in the lower third of our industry. So despite our recent strong stock performance, our P/E multiple still has significant room for expansion to be valued consistent with our top-tier biotech peers, offering the potential for strong shareholder returns. Our objective when we launched AbbVie was to build a high-performing biopharmaceutical company that was capable of delivering long-term top-tier performance. We are a company and a management team that has consistently achieved our objectives, and we have met or exceeded our commitments to our investors. We're proud of our performance and our proven track record of execution, and we're certainly excited about AbbVie's prospects going forward. We look forward to engaging with the investment community in the coming weeks as we meet with investors and share our strategic vision for the company. We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to continue to successfully execute on our long-term strategy and deliver outstanding shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Rick. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, first question please.
Operator: Our first question today is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Hi, everyone. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I've got a few quick ones for you. Just first off, there seemed to be a lot of focus yesterday around one of your competitor's commentary around the sudden decline or deterioration in the growth of the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis markets. I'm not sure that we've seen it in some of the other companies reporting. I just wondered if you'd like to comment on what you see the market growth there. Second, I know you're not going to give the rate based on what you said. But can you just confirm that upadacitinib you're seeing a rate below 0.8, which is I think is what one of your other competitors referred to as the upper end of the background rate that's out there? Then just on hep C, you say in your slide deck you're trending below the $3 billion for 2020, which obviously is right based on the current numbers, but MAVYRET looks to be having a very impressive early launch. I know that we won't be through contracting until through 2018, and 2019 is probably the year that it really steps up. But are you not perhaps a little bit more confident than you indicated in the slide deck that you could be around $3 billion at least by 2020? And then just last on elagolix, I note the Priority Review. That's really interesting, particularly in light of the opioid use that's there. I'm just wondering what kind of additional labeling support or just what you're looking for there to be able to make the case that this could be part of the solution to the opioid epidemic, particularly in those women with endometriosis. Thanks very much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. Mike, maybe why don't you start by talking about the rate, and then I'll cover the other three?
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Certainly. So on upadacitinib, what we've said is that we monitor the program very carefully, and we look at the aggregate data. And so when we monitor the data at this stage, we're looking in a blinded manner across our entire database. And it's important to understand that because I can't give you a rate that is a upadacitinib rate today without talking about unblinded data and ongoing studies, and I can't do that. So what I'll do is I'll talk about aggregate rates. And what we said and what remains true is that those aggregate rates are consistent with the background. And we've said that the background, there's variability in that background, but those estimates are around 0.8. And so that hasn't changed. It also hasn't changed that we haven't seen anything that we consider a signal. And the aggregate of our monitoring program tells us that all the statements that we've made are still holding.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, so let me talk a little bit about the psoriasis market first. I think what is being confused here is the slowdown in our product versus the slowdown in our market, and we had something similar happen roughly a year ago with a different product. If you think about when OTEZLA entered the market, it really drove a number of patients, particularly the more mild patients into the market. And if you recall correctly, we saw the psoriasis market rate grow very rapidly over that period of time, the market rate. And essentially, what we're seeing now is that that product is no longer gaining traction. And therefore, that group of patients and that growth is no longer in the market. But if you strip that out, which is what we do all the time to look at our performance, because we really compete in more of the moderate patient population where the biologics tend to compete, moderate to severe, that rate has stayed the same or accelerated. In fact, it's actually accelerated a bit because you'll have patients that don't get adequate response on OTEZLA that then move on to a biologic. And psoriasis is one of the fastest-growing segments we operate in, mid-teens growth rate. It's a very robust market. It's a highly attractive market. We perform extremely well within that market. And so I'd say our point of view is very different, and I think our performance clearly demonstrates that it supports our point of view as being different. So I think it's not a question of the market, it's a question of the performance of that asset and what it drove into the marketplace. On your third question, which was HCV greater than $3 billion, look, we're certainly tracking below $3 billion today. MAVYRET is off to a very good start, and I think MAVYRET does offer a significant opportunity for us going forward. I'd also say that we need to see this market sort itself out. This is a more challenging market to have a high degree of predictability in what you're going to be able to achieve and sustain over the longer term. Patient volumes have changed pretty dramatically. The competitive response in this market has been robust in certain situations. And so we're just too early in that launch to make those kinds of predictions. We've obviously dialed in a certain level of HCV performance for 2018 in what we're projecting. I'd say we're optimistic, in fact, I'd say very optimistic about the uptake that we're getting in the marketplace. But we probably won't reach a real steady-state level until the second quarter of 2018, and then I think we'll be in a much better position to make longer-term projections. And based on the fact that I made one of these projections before, I'll probably wait till I have a little better idea of what that rate looks like. Elagolix, I think, Jeff, you make an excellent point. This is an area where women are suffering from a significant level of chronic pain, and our clinical trial clearly demonstrated that we could reduce the level of pain medication use. And I think we would be hopeful that that will be something that's identified in the label. I think the trial was designed in a way where that should be something that would be an objective for us, and we do think it will serve an important purpose in treating people with endometriosis. And so we need to go through the regulatory process, but that certainly will be an objective that we have for the asset. I think it will be an important objective for the asset going forward. And I can tell you that we're extremely excited about the opportunity for elagolix.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. Rick, you provided a ton of information in your strategic update, and I'm sure you're tired of talking, but I have a really, really simple question for you. Do you see a cliff at all? And if not, can you grow the company through whatever cliff you might see or some erosion from HUMIRA? And I ask the question because, obviously, the stock has had a big move. But my sense is that if you look at the multiple, as you correctly pointed out, it is still at the bottom third, reflecting my sense is that investors still view that there is a cliff coming, albeit pushed out. So is that the right way to look at it, or do you think this is a company without a cliff and a company that can actually even grow through that cliff? Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Jami, if you look at our objective when we launched the company, we knew from day one that there was a point of time when we would be dealing with biosimilar competition on HUMIRA. And our whole focus on building a pipeline, a robust pipeline, was designed to allow us to be able to grow through that period. And we talked over and over again about the importance of the 2019 date in order to launch those products and ultimately be able to drive them up the growth curve to the point where they are profitable and they are contributing significantly. And I think as we continue to advance, we are hitting all of those milestones that we set for ourselves to be able to do that. And so I would tell you that our whole intent was to be able to drive through that erosion curve that we expected. I'd also say that as we watch biosimilars play out, mostly in the international markets is where we've seen most of the experience. They are operating in a way and the counter-strategies that the innovators are using are operating in a way that is consistent with our model that we will use, and we'll actually start that model in 2018 in markets that are going to see at the end of 2018 biosimilar competition outside the U.S. We're seeing erosion that is consistent with what we assume. And I think we will be able to deal with that in a way that is effective. And so I would say could you have some lumpiness at certain points? I think you could. Do I think will we be able to grow through it on an extended basis? I don't think there's any question that we'll be able to grow through it.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Schimmer from Evercore ISI Group.
Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI: Great, thanks for taking the question, two of them quickly. Can you provide an update for how the managed care contract negotiations have gone for HUMIRA and the rest of the portfolio as you approach 2018 and then have greater visibility into 2019? And then maybe a question for Mike, as you think about allocation of R&D spending to the Stemcentrx portfolio, can you discuss what percent of the R&D budget do you think those assets will eventually consume? And do you have any plans to assess other targeting technologies beyond the ADC approach that you're currently using? Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: On the managed care contracting, so we're through all the contracting for managed care and PBMs for 2018. HUMIRA has over 95% preferred covered lives coverage, so we're very pleased with our overall coverage range. And so I don't know specifically how many of those bridge into 2019, so I don't have that data available. But there was one change, and that was in Aetna, where Aetna did change our status for new patients. We've maintained existing patients, but Aetna is not a large number of covered lives, so that doesn't have any material impact on the brand or on the company, obviously. But as I said, we have a little over 95% preferred access, which is clearly where we want to be.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, and so this is Mike. I'll take the question about Stemcentrx and our overall portfolio. So as we mentioned on the call, we have a very robust portfolio overall in R&D. And certainly within oncology, we are building considerable momentum. As I mentioned, we have 20 programs in the clinic, 17 of those are in early development. And that's a mix between Stemcentrx and other AbbVie programs. And so that makes it difficult to give you a percentage that Stemcentrx will represent going forward because, of course, that's going to be based on the total number of programs that advance into later-stage development. What I would say is we're seeing encouraging signs across that portfolio, on stem programs and other programs of activity, so we'd expect to advance a number of those programs. And with respect to your question about targeting technologies, we certainly have a number of ADCs in our portfolio. We feel that the talents we have as an organization fit that very well in terms of our skills in small molecule chemistry and protein engineering and antibody engineering, but we are in no way limited to ADCs. We have very robust capabilities in small molecules, in novel biologics beyond monoclonal antibodies. We have a presence now in oncolytic viruses and other novel means to modulate targets. And so we're going to look at the targets that we have available, and we're going to pick the best modality that we can to address them, and that is in no way going to be limited to ADCs.
Joshua Schimmer - Evercore ISI: Great, thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Josh. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thanks very much, and appreciate all the commentary earlier on the call. Maybe the first question is for Rick. It's just expanding on some of those earlier psoriasis comments you made and just thinking about that business going forward. You obviously have a significant position here with HUMIRA, but there's a number of very effective agents, including your own IL-23, either launching or about to launch. So can you just elaborate a little bit more on, A), how much more room do you see for biologic shares to increase here? Maybe B), how do you see TNF's positioning versus these newer agents? And then C), on the pricing dynamics side, does this lead to an area where there could be more price competition, given all the options patients have? And then my second question is on capital deployment priorities. Just given all the traction you've had on the pipeline, can you just update us a little bit about how you're thinking about capital deployment on a go-forward basis? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. So I think if you look at the psoriasis business – and I'd say in general, if you look at all of the areas where HUMIRA competes, it has been and continues to be a relatively crowded market. That hasn't changed the performance of HUMIRA, and I don't expect it to change going forward either. Certainly, there are room in this market for significant additional biologic penetration. In fact, if you look at the psoriasis market, it has the lowest biologic penetration rates of the three major segments – rheum, GI, and derm. Derm is the lowest of the three, so it certainly has the greatest opportunity to be able to drive additional biologic penetration. And there clearly is an opportunity to have differentiated products within that segment where you have very, very high efficacy products, like our IL-23, that fit in a portfolio with products like HUMIRA. And in fact, as we look at our positioning within that market, that is how we think about it. We think about HUMIRA will still be a workhorse product within that market, and risankizumab will fit in for where physicians have patients that ultimately want a higher level of efficacy, and it clearly has a very durable response. I think the perception is in derm that over time you see a waning effect of these drugs. And in fact, if we look at the risankizumab data, what we see is just the opposite. As we go out in time, the response becomes more robust. And in fact, if you look at total clearance, it's 60% I think at 12 months, which is very impressive. We haven't seen an agent that looks like that. Convenience of dosing is going to be another significant thing. There will be patients who prefer a less frequent dosing regimen. And so we see these attributes being able to fit together quite nicely and serve the broader patient population. I think there's always pricing dynamics in every market that you operate in. I don't see anything in this market that has changed significantly, and I don't anticipate that we'll see something that changes, certainly over what is a reasonable time horizon, the next couple of years. So I don't see any dynamics there that overly concern me. This is still going to boil down to having the right assets and having the right team to be able to execute those assets. And we view the whole concept of both upadacitinib and risankizumab in combination with HUMIRA give us a powerful portfolio of medicines to be able to serve this market even more broadly than we serve it today, and that gives us tremendous opportunity to be able to grow this business going forward. We've given you some projections of what we think the market will look like and what we think we'll be able to do. If you think about those projections, the market that we compete in, these assets, $5 billion to $6.5 billion is what we're projecting for each asset by 2025. That represents roughly 7% market share for each asset. This is a big market. It's a market that is growing at a very rapid pace, and it's a market that the fundamentals still suggest that you can drive biologic penetration levels higher. And certainly, our execution level around that has demonstrated that. On capital deployment, we're in the nice position that we have a business that generates a tremendous amount of capital. And as we continue to grow it at the rates we're growing it, that cash is only going to grow over time. And our first priority is always to deploy that cash against strategic opportunities to be able to continue to grow the business. One of the things we did when we started the company is we committed that we would put in a long-term strategy that would allow us to be able to create a pipeline and fund that pipeline in a way that we could sustain growth over the long term. So we're always looking out in that period of 10 years to say do we have sufficient assets in the pipeline to be able to grow it? So I would always tell you that we'll be looking for those kinds of opportunities. And when we find them, we're going to go after them, and we're in the position to be able to do that. And I think we have the team that can go out and has demonstrated it can execute to get those assets when we want them. And then the second part is, obviously, we are committed to returning cash to shareholders. We've certainly demonstrated that, both in the dividend – I mentioned in my comments, we've grown the dividend over 77% since we became a public company, and we've made significant share repurchases over that five-year time period. So we're in a position where we want to continue to grow that and look for opportunities to grow that. If we get tax reform that gives us greater access to our offshore cash, that will allow us to invest more in the U.S., and it will also allow us to be able to return more cash to shareholders, and that would be desirable to us.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.
Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi all, this is Evan on for Geoff. Congrats on all the progress, and thank you for some of the longer-term guidance and insights, and one quick thank you to Liz and her team for the great strategic slides. They're very, very helpful. One on hep C. Given the evolving commercial landscape for hep C, what are some of your lessons learned on pricing and reimbursement? And then I have a follow-up on Rova-T.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Well, I don't know that I would describe them as lessons learned. I think as we indicated when we launched MAVYRET, one of the things that we look carefully at is what segment of the U.S. market would be available for this asset and what was the right go-to-market strategy to be able to access that, because we certainly viewed that as the early opportunity. And then obviously, we drove our decision to come out with a WAC that was in the price range that we came out with it. So whether you call that a lesson learned or you just say that basically in our analysis of how to be successful in this segment of the market, that was the strategy we came up with. I think you can look at it either way. Certainly, I think as we look back at that decision, that was a good decision that clearly has had the impact that we had hoped it would have. And I think in general, we like stability in this market. Certainly, this is a market that has had significant price erosion over the last several years. Most of our contracting is positioned in a parity fashion, and we're totally comfortable with that. In fact, that's our preferred position because we believe this asset can compete effectively, quite effectively, on the attributes of the asset itself. And I think that is the positioning that we're using in the marketplace, and it's been effective.
Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's great. And then on Rova-T, how has the bar changed in small-cell lung cancer, given there being other novel treatment approaches and now that you've pushed the data out, what is it, a quarter or two?
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: So small-cell lung cancer remains an area of very, very substantial unmet medical need. The standard of care hasn't changed in many years. And we view it in a positive way overall that there are now some therapies that look like they can make a real difference here, Rova-T included. I'm not sure that the bar has changed substantially though. So for example, if you look at third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer, there are no approved therapies. Response rates based on expert opinion, because there really are no good clinical studies here, would probably be in the low single-digit range, if not zero. And survival is dismal. And as Rick mentioned, with recent I-O releases, objective response rates of 10% or 20% are meaningfully different from that. And so there's a huge unmet medical need here, and there's an unmet medical need that relates not only to response rates but also to getting patients on a course that allows them to have good long-term outcomes. And those longer-term outcomes have been a strength of Rova-T based on its stem cell-targeting approach, cancer stem cell-targeting approach. So while there are encouraging signs, there's still a huge unmet medical need, and I don't think the bar has changed substantially.
Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks for the questions.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Evan. Operator, we'll take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala - Cowen and Co. LLC: Many thanks. I have two questions, first a question on the settlement with Amgen on the HUMIRA IP. Settlements of this nature almost always include language allowing the challenger, obviously in this case Amgen, to launch earlier under certain circumstances. And one such circumstance might be another company's at-risk launch, and in this case, earlier than January of 2023, at least in the U.S. Such language was not in the AbbVie release, and I think it would be material information. So I'm wondering why an earlier launch by Amgen appears to not even be possible under any circumstances? And secondly, can you be more specific on what RA studies will support the ABT-494 filing? Will it be all six or some subset of them? Many thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, I'll handle the Amgen settlement piece. We have an agreement with Amgen that we have not released all of the specifics around the contract between us and Amgen, and I'm certainly not going to do that now. What I would tell you is this. What gives us confidence that we're not going to have earlier launches? Let's disconnect it from whether or not Amgen would be able to go to the market or not, is the fact that, one, we believe this clearly demonstrates the power of our IP. Number two, we've been very clear about our position and how we'll enforce our IP. And if necessary, we will attempt to get a preliminary injunction to block anyone that launches if they violate our IP. I think if you look at the rulings that have come out of the patent office around the formulation patents alone, I would say that would be an extremely compelling argument with the court in order to obtain a preliminary injunction against someone. And I think the precedents would suggest that it would be unlikely that the court wouldn't follow what the patent office had described as they reviewed those patents and reaffirmed those patents against the challengers. And so I think what gives us confidence is we fundamentally believe, one, that's an incredibly risky strategy for someone to take based on the size of this asset and the damage that would be done and the consequences of that damage if they lost. Number two, I don't know that I can be any clearer about what our intent is, but I think they understand what our intent would be to defend it. And number three, I think our probability of success of getting a PI is high.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, so this is Mike. With respect to the RA studies for upadacitinib and what will support an NDA next year, as you mentioned, we have six studies, and those cover a range of patients from methotrexate inadequate responders to biologic inadequate responders. They include active comparator studies and studies aimed to look at structural endpoints. And so we will file with at least five studies of the six. We've always considered five studies our core. There was a sixth study, which is a structural study, which was originally anticipated to take longer than the others, but it is moving forward ahead of schedule. So it's possible that that could actually come in at a time that it can be included, but we're going to continue to evaluate that, but it would either be five or six studies that we would include.
Steve Scala - Cowen and Co. LLC: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Thank you very much and thanks for all the background color, first question for Mike. Mike, you've talked about upadacitinib in your observations. But could you just give us a sense of – we can't help this question of the BTE rate given what's happened with other programs. So could you give us a sense of the total clinical experience in RA and the number of observed events so far in the RA studies? I know that the studies are still blinded or some of them are, but it will be helpful to know where you stand. And then could you just comment on whether you're seeing any platelet increases or decreases? And then on a related note, I'm struck by the timing of the launches of upadacitinib and risankizumab in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's, which are out in 2022 and 2023. Is there a bottleneck in study sites or in patient recruitment? Because it just seems a long time to have to wait for those programs in IBD to mature. If you could, help us understand that. Thanks.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Certainly. So with respect to rates across the program, I think the best answer that I can give you is the answer that I gave you in my prepared remarks, which is that we monitor the program in aggregate across all of the studies. And of course, we're still blinded on the majority of the studies and therefore the majority of our database. And when we look at that and when we look at those rates, those rates are consistent with the background rate that we've stated on a number of occasions. We're going to continue to monitor carefully, but we do not see that situation change. I'll also refer to the remarks I made about our DMC. We are firewalled from our DMC by design, but our DMC has access to all of the data, including the unblinded data, and they have consistently recommended that we continue the program without any modifications. And if they had concerns, you certainly wouldn't expect that to have been their course of action. With respect to platelet changes, we've looked at it. We've not seen any changes with platelets. Platelets remain stable on therapy. And I think platelets don't seem to be playing any part of the picture for upadacitinib. In terms of launches in UC and Crohn's, it's early on in those programs. So we're always going to try to move as quickly as we can and advance programs rapidly, but we're not seeing any bottlenecks in sites. We're not seeing any bottlenecks in patients. In fact, recruitment across the program has gone very well, I think indicative of strong investigator and patient interest in the upadacitinib program broadly.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, we'll take the next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great, thanks so much for taking my questions and also for all the details today. So a couple thoughts around the long-term plan and just maybe some updates to your thoughts when you made the plan in 2015 and the update today. So specifically around HUMIRA, and if you can, just what your assumptions are on pricing growth in the U.S. for that product between now and 2020, what's baked into that $21 billion number? Second, HUMIRA in terms of the EU biosimilar impact, obviously it still looks like it's end of next year. Just what your thoughts are, we have a little more experience now with biosimilars, in fact, than when we did two years ago, so what you guys are assuming the impact will be on HUMIRA in Europe starting I guess in 2019? And then finally, just around once we do see U.S. biosimilar direct competition, it sounds like in January 2023, is there any change to your outlook on the rate of erosion at that point, maybe just with some of the changing pricing dynamics or payer dynamics in this country, or do you feel pretty much the same about the erosion curve after 2023? Thanks so much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, Vamil, this is Rick. So HUMIRA pricing was your first question as it relates the long-term guidance. I think obviously, we do a long-range plan. What you're seeing is the result of what comes out of that long-range planning process. That's where these numbers obviously come from. And we have communicated previously I think to the investment community that our typical strategy is that we are conservative particularly on the out years because it's much harder to predict from a pricing standpoint, so we tend to be relatively conservative on those out years. We evaluate it as we get close to the coming year what we think the dynamics are. We have recently come out and said that in 2018, we'll have one price increase, similar to what we did in 2017. And that price increase, I can't remember the specific language. Bill probably can. But it basically said that it would be below double-digit, and that is how we plan on operating in 2018. And so I think it's consistent with all of that. As far as biosimilars outside of the U.S., we've obviously spent a lot of time studying both the Remicade biosimilar, which has been out there for a longer period of time, the Enbrel biosimilar. We're watching the Remicade biosimilar here in the U.S. as well. And we've modeled both our strategy and our expected erosion curves against the experience that we've seen there and the competitive response that we've seen and the effectiveness of that competitive response. We've communicated as part of the previous long-range planning guidance that we gave, is that what we expect is for the brand internationally to peak at in 2018 and then start a modest erosion curve as we see biosimilars enter the marketplaces outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2018 moving forward. And if you model that going forward all the way through 2020, what you essentially would see is from peak to 2020, the erosion is about 15% or 20%. Now what you have to remember is, unlike some of these other drugs, we are growing volume. In fact, we're growing volume outside the United States at a rate of high single digits, low double-digit volume increases. And if you looked at some of the other brands, when the biosimilar entered the marketplace, they weren't growing volume, and so therefore, they would have a greater impact on what their revenues eroded over that period of time. So if you actually dial back in what we're assuming in the way of volume growth that will occur at the same time, then instead of being 15%, as an example, the number would be closer to about 25%, let's say. And that's relatively consistent, probably a little bit on the lower end compared to Remicade or Enbrel, but I'd say it's within the range of what we've seen from them. Now obviously, we hope to execute even better than that, but I think for planning purposes, that's a reasonable way for investors to think about it. Your third point was erosion starting in 2023 and the impact that price would have at that point. Again, we have an erosion model that we've built. I think that erosion model is reflective of what we think is likely. It has built into it what we think the pricing assumptions would be leading up to that. And 2023 is a long ways out though. So we need to continue to monitor that, and we'll obviously adjust it along the way. But I'd say right now it factors in a relatively conservative level of price leading up to the biosimilars entering the marketplace.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Vamil. We've got now almost 90 minutes, so we got only time for one more question. Obviously, after the call, we'll be available to answer and address any additional questions that we're unable to get to in the queue today. So, operator, we'll take the last question.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.
Gregory D. Fraser - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. It's Greg Fraser on for Gregg Gilbert. On elagolix, how are you thinking about the size of opportunity for endometriosis versus uterine fibroids? And how do you see your current new product business being impacted as adoption of elagolix grows? And then a quick one on VENCLEXTA, how should we think about the market opportunity with a broader label based on the MURANO data? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: If you look at elagolix in endometriosis, that deck that we provided you will give you the specific numbers, but I'll do this from recall. There are approximately about 2.5 million women in the U.S. that are diagnosed. We think that undiagnosed is probably in the range of about 4 million women. So obviously, it's a big opportunity, and it's the earlier opportunity. Now, there are more patients who have uterine fibroids, but uterine fibroids are behind endometriosis. And so clearly, we think this is so multibillion-dollar opportunity in endometriosis. It is one that will require education because this is an area where there hasn't been any real new therapies in this market for 10 years or so. So it is going to require both patient education as well as physician education. And so it will have a ramp that is consistent with the kinds of assets that require that kind of market development. And we're going to start that market development from a disease awareness standpoint prior to the approval of the drug. So we'll be starting that in 2018 to start to prepare the market for the launch of elagolix. But I think it's a very significant opportunity, and it's one we're obviously preparing for a high-level success. As far LUPRON is concerned because of the side effect profile of LUPRON, LUPRON is incredibly effective at this. The problem is that it completely shuts down the access, and so it has all of the implications of essentially putting the patient into menopause. And so it's not a very desirable drug to use for this particular indication, and therefore the sales for this area are relatively modest. So it won't have a material impact at all. My guess is it will have significant erosion of the little bit that it has, but that won't have any kind of material impact overall. And on MURANO, obviously, today we have a label that's essentially for 17p deletion, which is a relatively – it's an important segment of the market for those patients because they have difficult outcomes, but it's a relatively small number of patients. The broader relapsed/refractory indication in CLL is a very significant opportunity. So this will drive – once we have this in the marketplace, we would expect that this will drive significant revenue ramping of VENCLEXTA.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, everyone. That concludes today's conference call. You could access a replay of the call at our website. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. AbbVie delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.42, up 12.7% versus last year and exceeding our guidance range. Our results included strong top-line performance, with global operational sales growth of 8.9%. HUMIRA continues to drive outstanding performance, with nearly 15% operational growth in the quarter, despite the introduction of new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars. In the U.S., HUMIRA grew 18%, reflecting robust underlying demand, including low double-digit prescription volume growth. Internationally, operational sales growth was over 9%, driven by strong market demand. We continue to be pleased with the robust growth and strong market trends we're seeing across therapeutic categories and geographies. Another major growth driver for our business is IMBRUVICA, which continues to drive strong momentum and strong growth. In the second quarter, global IMBRUVICA sales were $626 million, an increase of more than 42% over the prior year. We continue to make significant progress establishing IMBRUVICA as standard of care in several hematological cancers. In CLL, our largest single indication, IMBRUVICA is the market share leader in first-line patients, with new patient market share of 24% and total patient market share of 33%. In second-line CLL, IMBRUVICA is now used in more than 70% of patients under treatment. We're also making good progress in other areas. We expect to receive approval soon of our sixth indication, chronic graft-versus-host-disease, demonstrating IMBRUVICA's broad utility across a wide range of serious conditions. Based on the significant long-term potential of IMBRUVICA, we've recently launched a dedicated sales team focused specifically on NHL indications. We're also seeing good progress with the launch of VENCLEXTA in our initial indication, relapsed/refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion. We're tracking against our objective to achieve full-year sales guidance of $125 million, which represents more than one-third of the 17p deletion market. We look forward to the MURANO trial readout in the coming months and our subsequent regulatory submissions, which will significantly expand the market opportunity for this important therapy. So overall, we continue to be pleased with the progress we're making with IMBRUVICA, VENCLEXTA and our broader oncology portfolio and strategy. We also saw strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including Creon and Duodopa. In summary, we continue to demonstrate our strong commercial performance, and we're pleased with our financial results. Moving on to our pipeline, we have made significant progress in the first half of the year with regulatory approvals, positive data and pivotal study starts. And, as we've noted, we have a number of important clinical development and regulatory milestones in the second half of this year. Mike will discuss our clinical programs in more detail, here in just a few moments, while I briefly highlight a few of the more noteworthy milestones. In immunology, we continue to make good progress with our two late-stage assets. We recently announced strong top-line results from the first of our registrational trials of ABT-494 in RA and we'll see results from two additional pivotal studies in the coming months. We'll also see data from three of our risankizumab registrational trials in psoriasis later in the year. In oncology, we'll see data from a number of pivotal programs, including results from the VENCLEXTA Phase 3 MURANO trial, data from the Rova-T TRINITY study in small cell lung cancer and data from ABT-414 in second-line glioblastoma as well as results from the IMBRUVICA SHINE trial in frontline mantle cell lymphoma. We also completed our Phase 3 program for elagolix in endometriosis, and we're on track for regulatory submission this quarter. And finally, we are anticipating U.S. and European regulatory approvals for MAVIRET, our next-generation HCV offering. Our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free therapy has a highly competitive profile, with high efficacy rates across major genotypes and in difficult-to-treat patient populations. In summary, we're encouraged by our strong commercial execution and our strong financial performance. And we're looking forward to the many pipeline milestones we expect in the back half of the year. We have a high degree of confidence in our strategy and in our execution. And we'll build upon the strong momentum we have to drive a high level of performance across our operations in the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Rick. As Rick just noted, 2017 marks a milestone-filled year for AbbVie's pipeline, with a dozen pivotal trial readouts and several planned regulatory submissions or approvals. We've continued to make significant pipeline progress over the past quarter. This morning, I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss key milestones we anticipate for the remainder of the year. In the area of immunology, we continue to make good progress advancing our two very promising late-stage assets, upadacitinib and risankizumab. Both of these assets have the potential to significantly advance standard of care in a number of immune-mediated conditions. Upadacitinib, also known as ABT-494, has produced encouraging mid and late-stage data in rheumatology and gastroenterology. We believe our once-daily oral highly-selective JAK1 inhibitor has the potential to provide best-in-class efficacy with a favorable safety profile in RA and provide strong activity in a very competitive profile in psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. In the quarter, we reported top-line results from the first of our registrational trials for upadacitinib, the SELECT-NEXT study. In this study, which evaluated patients who did not respond adequately to conventional DMARDs, both doses of upadacitinib met all primary and key secondary endpoints. Furthermore, upadacitinib drove very high responses at the ACR20 level, but, more importantly, it drove strong levels of response on more stringent endpoints, such as ACR50, ACR70, low disease activity and DAS remission. We're also very encouraged by the DAS responses we saw, where nearly half of the patients studied achieved low disease activity in both dose groups, and approximately 30% achieved DAS remission with just 12 weeks of treatment. Upadacitinib's efficacy in this population compares favorably to other selective JAK inhibitors in Phase 3 development. And we think this drug has the potential to offer meaningful advantages over products on the market today or in development. Additionally, the safety profile in the SELECT-NEXT study was consistent with what was observed in the Phase 2 trials, and no new safety signals were detected. We plan to present detailed data from the SELECT-NEXT trial at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in November. We expect to see results from two additional studies later this year, SELECT-BEYOND in biologic-inadequate responders and SELECT-MONOTHERAPY, with data from two more trials and our regulatory submissions expected in 2018 and commercialization in 2019. Beyond its lead indication in RA, we're making good progress with upadacitinib in mid-stage studies for several other immune-mediated conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis. And we also recently began a Phase 3 study in psoriatic arthritis. At the recent DDW meeting, we presented promising Phase 2 upadacitinib data in Crohn's disease. The results from the Phase 2 CELEST study demonstrated that significantly more patients treated with upadacitinib achieved clinical remission and endoscopic remission following induction therapy as compared to placebo. There was also a mandatory steroid taper during the induction phase of this study. And upadacitinib performed very well, with significantly more patients at the higher doses being steroid-free and in clinical remission after 16 weeks of treatment. The patient population in this study was considered to be particularly difficult to treat, given that 96% of patients in the trial had failed or were intolerant to anti-TNFs, with more than two-thirds having been previously treated with more than two anti-TNFs. The Phase 3 program for Crohn's disease will begin later this year. We also plan to begin Phase 3 studies in ankylosing spondylitis in the second half of 2017 and in ulcerative colitis in 2018. Finally, we'll see data from a mid-stage trial evaluating upadacitinib in atopic dermatitis, a prevalent chronic inflammatory skin disease, later this year. Moving now to our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, where we are nearing completion of three registrational studies in psoriasis, risankizumab has the potential to provide best-in-class efficacy and increased dosing convenience, with quarterly administration. And we look forward to seeing results from the three pivotal trials in the fourth quarter. Additional data from the pivotal program will be available next year, leading to our regulatory submission in 2018, with commercialization anticipated in 2019. At the DDW meeting, we also presented Phase 2 risankizumab data in Crohn's disease. The results from the 52-week maintenance portion of a Phase 2 study were very promising, demonstrating that the drug was effective in maintaining clinical and endoscopic remission and response in patients who were in clinical remission at week 26. Risankizumab was well-tolerated, with no new safety signals detected during maintenance treatment. Phase 3 studies in Crohn's disease will be starting later this year. Later this year, we're also expecting to begin a Phase 3 study for risankizumab in ulcerative colitis. Additionally, we'll also see Phase 2 data in psoriatic arthritis, with Phase 3 studies expected to begin in the first half of 2018. Moving now to oncology, where we continue to make good progress with our hem/onc and solid tumor programs. Between now and the end of the year, we expect several important milestones. Earlier this week, VENCLEXTA received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for combination treatment with low-dose ara-C in treatment-naïve AML patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. This is the second Breakthrough Therapy Designation in AML and the fourth overall for VENCLEXTA. The Phase 3 study for this indication is already ongoing. In the coming months, we'll see data from the VENCLEXTA Phase 3 MURANO trial, which will support our regulatory application for broader use in the relapsed/refractory CLL population. We are also expecting additional IMBRUVICA data readouts later this year based on interim or final analyses from multiple studies. And we are anticipating regulatory approval soon for the use of IMBRUVICA in chronic graft-versus-host-disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy. If approved, this would be the first treatment specifically approved for chronic GVHD, a serious and potentially life-threatening condition with high unmet medical need. In the area of solid tumors, we'll see results from the TRINITY study, where Rova-T is being evaluated in third-line or greater small cell lung cancer, with regulatory submissions following shortly thereafter. At the recent ASCO meeting, we presented full data from the Phase 1 study of Depatux-M, also known as ABT-414, in glioblastoma multiforme, including encouraging overall survival and progression-free survival data. Later this quarter, we'll see data from a Phase 2 study of Depatux-M in second-line GBM that, if positive, would support regulatory submission. And finally, in the area of women's health, we recently completed our Phase 3 program of elagolix in endometriosis. We plan to present additional data from the extension study at the ASRM Congress at the end of October, and we remain on track to submit our regulatory application later in the third quarter. Our Phase 3 program in uterine fibroids is also well underway. We'll begin to see initial top-line results from the first pivotal study around the end of the year. So in summary, we've continued to see significant evolution of our mid and late-stage programs. The first half of the year has been very productive. And we look forward to the second half of 2017 and the large number of clinical and regulatory milestones. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our second quarter performance. Bill?
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. We are very pleased with our second quarter performance. Total net revenues were $6.9 billion, up 8.9% operationally, excluding a 90 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.42, up 12.7% compared to the second quarter of 2016 and exceeding our guidance for the quarter. HUMIRA had another outstanding quarter, with global sales of $4.7 billion, up 14.9% operationally. This performance is reflective of continued strong demand, despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs as well as anti-TNF biosimilars. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 18% compared to the prior year, driven by low double-digit prescription growth plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels were below half a month, as is our standard practice. HUMIRA's growth continues to be fueled by robust demand across all three segments, rheum, gastro and derm, and market share remains stable despite competitive dynamics. Internationally, HUMIRA had an exceptional quarter, with operational sales growth of 9.1%. This performance was driven by market growth as well as tender timing, which contributed nearly 2 percentage points to operational sales growth in the quarter. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the second quarter were $626 million, up more than 42% over the second quarter of last year. Robust sales in the U.S., which totaled $528 million in the quarter, were driven by our strong market positions in CLL as well as other indications, including mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenström's and relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma, which was approved earlier this year. Global Viekira sales in the quarter were $225 million, down versus the prior year. In the coming weeks, we expect U.S. and European regulatory decisions for our next-generation HCV treatment, MAVIRET. Based on the timing of reimbursement decisions outside the U.S. and managed-care contracting cycles in the U.S., we expect to see meaningful sales contribution from MAVIRET starting in 2018. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 16% on an operational basis in the quarter. And we also saw strong growth from Creon, which was up over 9% in the quarter. Reviewing the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 82.3% of sales compared to 81.9% in the prior year. This was inclusive of 80 basis points of dilutive impact related to partnership accounting. Adjusted R&D was 17.5% of sales, up 200 basis points over the prior year, reflecting increased funding of the pipeline, including incremental spend associated with the Stemcentrx and risankizumab transactions. Adjusted SG&A was 20.2% of sales in the quarter, down 200 basis points versus the prior year, driven by sales leverage and operational efficiencies. Operating margin was 44.6% of sales in the second quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points versus prior year. Net interest expense was $253 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 19.3% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.42, up 12.7% year-over-year. Turning to full year guidance, we continue to forecast full year adjusted EPS of $5.44 to $5.54 per share, representing growth of 13.9% at the midpoint. This guidance comprehends full year top-line operational growth approaching 10%. For U.S. HUMIRA, we continue to expect mid to high teens sales growth for the full year. Internationally, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth for HUMIRA. Given recent foreign exchange dynamics, we would expect full year reported sales growth for international HUMIRA to approach mid-single digits. For IMBRUVICA, we remain on track to achieve our full year expectation for global reported revenues of greater than $2.4 billion, with sales in the U.S. of more than $2 billion. In the last several weeks, we have seen a weakening of the dollar versus key foreign currencies. If these rates were to remain constant at today's levels, we would forecast no material impact from foreign exchange to full year sales. This currency movement would, however, have an adverse impact on gross margin due to hedges in place on key currencies. If exchange were to hold at current rates, we would forecast full year gross margin as a percentage of sales at 80.5%. We are forecasting full year R&D expense approaching 17.5% of sales, reflecting pipeline funding and the impacts of the Stemcentrx and risankizumab transactions. We expect SG&A of over 20.5% of sales, and this would result in an operating margin profile of approximately 42.5%, inclusive of the recent impact of currency movements. We continue to expect a net interest expense of approximately $1 billion. And the adjusted tax rate for the full year should be modeled at above 19%. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.36 and $1.38. This adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.22 of non-cash amortization and other specified items and represents year-over-year growth of 13.2% at the midpoint. We are forecasting operational revenue growth of approximately 9% through the third quarter. And if current exchange rates hold, no impact from exchange on sales in the quarter. For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the third quarter in the high teens. Internationally, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth for HUMIRA. For IMBRUVICA, we expect U.S. sales growth in the third quarter of approximately 30%. We expect gross margin in the third quarter to be approximately 80.5% of sales. This gross margin comprehends current exchange rates and is inclusive of the dilutive impact of partnered products. In closing, we delivered outstanding performance in the quarter, driven by our focus on strong commercial and operational execution. We expect to continue this momentum in the second half of 2017, putting us in a great position to deliver top-tier revenue and EPS growth for the full year. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, let's take the first question, please?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you. I just had a couple of pipeline-related questions. Michael, maybe for you, there seemed to be emerging questions about the safety of JAK inhibitors due to DVT and PE issues, which seem to have hobbled the baricitinib application at the FDA. In addition, we understand there is an upcoming panel meeting on XELJANZ on psoriatic arthritis, and maybe the issue relates to DVTs that were seen in post-marketing studies. So I'm just wondering what you can tell us in terms of the safety profile of ABT-494 related to DVT and PE issues. I know in sort of searching through the clinical database and there's not a lot of data yet, but we didn't see any information related to platelets. I'm wondering if that means anything. And then secondly, we did see a drop in hemoglobin seen in Phase 2 and just wondering if that could be related to anemia or any suggestions of off-target JAK2 inhibitor side effects, so if you could kind of put that into perspective. And then just lastly, on risankizumab and positioning of that relative to ABT-494, there are other IL-23 drugs, specifically guselkumab, that have just been launched. And I'm just wondering if you could talk about how you see the relative positioning of both risa (25:13) as well as ABT-494, particularly in GI, where both drugs seem to show very compelling profiles, and maybe if you could talk about those drugs, specifically risankizumab relative to other IL-23s that are also entering the market. Thanks very much.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, Jami. Well, thanks very much for that question. I'll try to take these one at a time. So with respect to the safety profile of our agent, upadacitinib, and DVTs and PEs, the short answer is we've looked. And we don't see anything that we'd consider a signal or rates that exceed expected background. But maybe to fully answer your question, it would be helpful to take a step back from for a moment and think about what we know and what we don't know. So based on Lilly's recent statements, we know that questions around DVT and PE appear to be the driver behind their CRL and that that concern seems to be driven by an imbalance during the placebo-controlled portion of their studies. We also know that RA patients are at increased risk of DVT and PE, and that these events are observed in virtually all Phase 3 programs in RA, regardless of the mechanism of action. And as you point out, we also know that there have been a number, I think, it's something like 18, post-marketing reports of PE with XELJANZ. Since RA patients are at an increased risk and XELJANZ has been on the market for several years, I don't think that that is necessary surprising. When you think about what we don't know, there are a number of things in that column. For starters, we don't know whether bari [baricitinib] does, in fact, increase risk. Here, the FDA has just asked for more data. We also don't know the detailed data that Lilly and the FDA are looking at. For example, what's the total number of cases, including not only the placebo-controlled portions but also the open-label periods? What are rates overall and are they increased? What's the nature of the cases? Is there evidence of a dose response or not? So we still have a lot to learn about bari, but I can tell you about our program. We've been monitoring for DVT and PE right from the beginning because we know that RA patients are at an increased baseline risk, as I just said. Because of this background rate, which is generally between about 0.3 and 0.8 events per 100 patient years you'd expect to see some PEs in any RA clinical program. In fact, it would be surprising if you didn't. So to evaluate them, you have to look at the other factors that I just talked about. Now, again, as I said, we've been monitoring for these events right from the start, but based on the recent history from bari we've gone back and we've taken another very careful look at all the data we've collected so far. And, as I said, based on that look, we don't see anything that we'd consider a signal or rates that exceed expected background, so our view of our program hasn't changed. Now, you asked about platelets. We've looked at that. And what we see with our agent are a tendency towards modest decreases in platelets with treatment. Now, that's not necessarily surprising, because platelets can behave in some patients like an acute phase reactive. (28:25) They can go up when there's active inflammation. And when you treat that inflammation, they can return back towards normal. And all of the changes that we're seeing are very modest and they're all within the normal range. So I don't know that I would really make very much of that right now. You asked about hemoglobin in Phase 2. And what I would say is in Phase 2, we studied a very wide range of doses, including doses that are much higher than the doses we're carrying forward in Phase 3. And we did that because we wanted to make sure that we fully explored the dose range and we got that dose selection right, because dose selection is critical in any Phase 3 program. At the doses that we're studying in Phase 3, we're not seeing significant changes in hemoglobin and AEs (29:10) of anemia are very uncommon and seen in all dose groups, including placebo. So we're not seeing issues with hemoglobin in our program. With respect to the positioning of these agents, maybe I'll let Rick make a few comments and then I may close it out.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Sure. Hi, Jami. I think if you step back and you think about what we're trying to accomplish in this particular area, obviously, we have a leadership position in immunology. We've been working on this strategy for a number of years now. Our goal was to bring forward a set of agents that we thought could restate standard of care in all the areas that we had a leadership position in. From the very beginning, we didn't believe that there was one mechanism of action that was likely to be able to do that, so we pursued multiple mechanisms of action. And now we have two assets that we believe can give us coverage with a differentiated profile within those areas. So if you think about the three major areas, RA, psoriasis and IBD, certainly as we look at 494 [ABT-494] and the data that we've seen thus far, we believe it fundamentally will have a differentiated profile, in particular in the TNF-inadequate responder population. We're excited and interested in what that data will look like and encouraged that we think that, that will be a profile that will be differentiated in the marketplace. And so, we think 494 is clearly the asset that will be our RA asset. In psoriasis, certainly the IL-23 risankizumab is certainly demonstrated in the Phase 2 studies, a significant differentiation versus other agents that are out there. And I'll have Mike talk specifically about the data here in a moment. So that's certainly the asset that we're targeting there. In IBD, these patients tend to rotate through therapies, because they do lose effect over time. And both of these agents, I think in our early data, it would suggest to us, we'll have good activity in IBD. And I think our strategy, although we have to see how the data plays out, will be that we will pursue both agents in this area. And that will give us the fullest level of coverage within this disease state and this is a disease state that still has a significant unmet need. And then, obviously, we're going to look at a number of other areas. And many of these other areas can be very significant opportunities. If you think about HS with HUMIRA, that's tracking to be a $1 billion indication for us. So many of these other areas will be significant opportunities as well, but that covers the major areas. Now from a go-to-market strategy and how we'll be positioning these products, it'll vary somewhat based on geography and based on other events, like the timing of biosimilar entries within those markets. But generally speaking, we view this portfolio of assets, HUMIRA and these two assets, as the way that we will compete in the marketplace. Certainly, we have the gold standard product in HUMIRA in these areas. It's really the flagship product. It will play an important role over the long term, as we've said. Even when we see biosimilars in this market, it'll be our goal to maintain our leadership position within this market. But HUMIRA doesn't work on every single patient. And I think the best way to think about it is this: despite how successful we have been with HUMIRA, we still have roughly a third of the market. When you add these other two agents into the mix of our portfolio, it should give us the opportunity to significantly grow our market share position, because we will then have a set of assets that should give us much broader coverage, from a clinical standpoint, across the patient groups in these areas to have agents that will be efficacious. Some will be follow-on agents. Some will compete head-to-head for new patients. It will depend a lot on the geography and the circumstances within that market. But we think this portfolio of assets in immunology will clearly give us an opportunity to be able to significantly increase our market share position in this area. We view this as a very exciting opportunity and one that can drive significant growth for the company going forward. Maybe, Mike, specifically talk a little bit about some of the data we've seen and the differentiation.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Certainly. So, as Rick mentioned, it's really the data that's going to drive the positioning. And we're very fortunate to have demonstrated very strong data from both of these programs. If you look at upadacitinib, we've seen get very good responses in Phase 2 and also in the first Phase 3 study, SELECT-NEXT, that we've top-lined. What we're particularly encouraged is the ability to drive responses at higher levels. And so that's getting patients to DAS, low disease activity DAS remission, for example. And we've seen very good performance out of both of our dose levels at those more stringent measures. We've also designed a very broad and very robust, very comprehensive Phase 3 program for upadacitinib in RA that will provide a lot of data and give a lot of time on drug so that we can very well characterize both the benefit and the risk profile of those agents. So I think the program that we've designed is going to be a real strength. We've seen good response in upadacitinib in other indications, as Rick mentioned, like inflammatory bowel diseases, where there's a real unmet medical need and so the breadth of that program, I think, will be very beneficial. If we move our attention to IL-23 and risankizumab, there are other agents in this class and it is a competitive space, but we were particularly struck with the Phase 2b data that we saw for risankizumab. We're driving very, very high levels of response and very high levels of response at a PASI 100 level, for example, that really are the best that have been seen in this field. And we did a head to head in Phase 2 and drove PASI 100 levels that were roughly double that of currently available agents. So I think those data are very strong. And when you couple that with the fact that we're able to achieve quarterly dosing and very durable responses, which have been a problem with past agents in psoriasis, I think that all shapes up to be a very strong profile. And, of course, risankizumab also provides strong data. We presented data in IBD at the DDW meeting, which showed very good responses in Phase 2. And we're moving forward with a very broad program for risankizumab as well.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Holford of Jefferies. Your line's open.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. Firstly, I wonder if you can give us an update on your thoughts as to the extent of excess cash generation over the next few years. I know we've been talking about that recently, and just how you're thinking about now prioritizing that between dividends, share repurchases, and M&A? I wonder if then also, you might like to comment on Hep-C and how you're going to try and approach that from a commercial standpoint in the U.S. You've talked about wanting to look at more open formularies, I think, going forward, but what's the chance of you actually achieving this and do you think that price will have to be part of the implicit offering there? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. Jeff, this is Rick. You know, I think on cash generation, obviously, we have a business that generates significant cash flow and that cash flow is only going to grow over time. I think the distribution of that and the priorities are consistent with how we've operated in the past. Certainly, our first priority is always reinvesting back in the business. And, obviously, we've done some significant acquisitions with Pharmacyclics, Stemcentrx and others. Risankizumab is a good example of other assets that we then license, so that's always a priority. Having said that, I would say that over the course of the last four years or so, we have filled out a lot of the major gaps that we had in our therapeutic strategies and we're looking more now for individual assets, rather than larger platform kinds of plays, but that's always the first priority. The second priority is we're committed to the dividend. We're committed to a growing dividend. I think we've demonstrated that with our actions going forward across the last four years. And then as far as repurchase, today, we obviously look at share repurchase, which we've done a significant amount even outside of that related to M&A, as a more opportunistic strategy. When we have excess U.S. cash, we tend to deploy it in that fashion. You commented on there's been a lot of discussion around it. I think if there were tax reform and we had greater access to our offshore cash in a cost effective way, then that would open up different opportunities for us to be able to deploy further cash, because I think our cash generation would certainly exceed what we would view as our need to be able to redeploy it back in the business. But we'll have to see how that plays out. I think it's a little tough to handicap at this point where that will go. As it relates to HCV, we're certainly excited about MAVIRET. I think it has a profile that is highly competitive in the marketplace. The markets are very different within the U.S. and outside the U.S. I'd say if you think about this product outside the U.S., it certainly gives us the ability to compete in the broader set of genotypes, which we haven't had in the past. And it certainly gives us the ability to be able to compete more effectively in markets that have a significant genotype 1a population, because the profile of MAVIRET is more highly competitive than Viekira was in those particular marketplaces. And so, we view that opportunity as significant. We have to get pricing and reimbursement in those countries. And if you look at markets that were primarily 1b, where the profile of Viekira was more comparable to the competitive offerings, we typically get shares in the 30% range, the 30% to 40% range. Now having said that, I will also tell you that we are seeing price come down outside the U.S. And so we're going to have to be able to – if we get share gains, which we probably will, some of that will obviously be used to offset price impact that we see in those markets. Within the U.S. market, it's a different type of market. As you know, on the commercial side of the business, much of that is under contract with the market leader on exclusive contracts. So we don't see a significant opportunity for that in 2017 and probably certainly even halfway through 2018. So we don't view that as a short-term opportunity. So a significant part of our strategy will focus early on in the U. S. in the public channels, because those will become available more rapidly. And so our go-to-market strategy will be one that's focused initially in that particular area where we think there is the greatest opportunity to be able to have an impact. Now HCV is an unusual market, in that, within the U.S., if you look at the public channels versus the commercial channels and you look at currently those patients that are available for treatment that haven't been treated already, it's roughly 70%-30%. About 70% of the patients are in this public channel, Medicare, Medicaid, VA, et cetera, and 30% are in the commercial channels. And so it's a significant opportunity. And it's the part of the market that's still growing, where the commercial channel tends to be flat to declining from a patient volume standpoint. So once we get approval, that will be the area of focus within the U.S. But as Bill said in his comments, we don't view this asset as having much of an impact in 2017. It will have a more material impact in 2018 and 2019.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: And just last quick add-on, if I can, on the pricing of Rova-T, there's a lot of pushback from investors on the sort of prices you might be able to charge for the two doses, especially in third-line small cell lung. Can you just give us any updated thoughts there on what kind of ballpark we should be in for modeling purposes? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Yeah. Well, I mean I think for our modeling purposes, during the acquisition we used pricing that was typical of a proprietary oncology agent. I don't believe there's anything in our data that has changed our mind around that. Certainly, what's going to be the most important thing is the data that we see come out of the trials and that will dictate I think the adoption of the agent to a much greater extent than the pricing. This is a pretty devastating disease, where there really aren't many options for these patients. And if Rova-T shows what we think it will show, I think this will be an excellent opportunity to be able to provide those patients with a therapy that isn't available today that gives them an opportunity to have a significant clinical improvement. And I think that will drive the adoption more than the price point.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line's open.
Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thanks very much for the questions; just two, both on HUMIRA. Maybe first EU biosimilar landscape, it seems like REMICADE is starting to get hit pretty hard. Can you maybe just compare and contrast how you see HUMIRA dynamics playing out as we look out to 2019 versus what we're seeing from Merck over the last few years and quarters here? My second question is just interested if you could share any high level comments on HUMIRA as we kind of think out to 2018 formulary and maybe pricing outlook. I believe if I go back to the 3Q 2016 call, you had mentioned you'd completed some negotiations for 2017 as well as 2018 season. It was basically business as usual with regards to HUMIRA. I just wonder is that view changed at all at this point? Are you still kind of seeing business as usual as we think about formulary positioning, et cetera, going forward? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. So, Chris, this is Rick. On the formulary front, you are correct. We obviously negotiated a number of contracts that were both 2017 and 2018. We never disclose, nor would we disclose, what percentage of the contracting falls into that category. But we are now in active negotiations for the remaining contracts in 2018. And I would tell you nothing is fundamentally changed as it relates to the access that we have assumed or the pricing of the asset or any of the aspects from a standpoint of managed care contracting. So you shouldn't assume any significant difference in any of our activities as it relates to formulary access or the structure of that access as well. As far as EU biosimilars, we obviously track it carefully. I wouldn't say it's my view that there's been a dramatic change in either REMICADE or ENBREL. The pricing has continued in the range that we've talked about in the past. If you look at their overall market share position, it obviously varies by country. And there are some countries where they have heavy penetration. But overall, the REMICADE biosimilar, the last data I looked at, a few weeks ago, would suggest that they have about 6% market share, and the ENBREL biosimilar, something less than 4%, 3.5%, 3.6%, something like that, was the last data I saw. If you look at it versus the brand, they're still in an area that's relatively modest. And the price erosion is pretty consistent with what we've expected, where you see in these tender countries, obviously, very high discounting, and, obviously, in some cases, a significant conversion to the biosimilar. The Nordics are a good example of that. But when you look at many of the major European countries, they have relatively modest up-take, and they have pricing in that 35% kind of range from a discounting standpoint. So I think it's relatively consistent with what we've seen and what we've been modeling for quite some time. And so it gives us continued confidence that our strategy, when that occurs, is one that should be highly effective.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Marc Goodman of UBS. Your line's open.
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC: Yes, morning. Two questions first. Can you talk about the gross margin? It seemed to be pretty strong in the quarter. I know you mentioned for the full year, but just talk about the quarter specifically? And then second, can you give us an update on Stemcentrx non-Rova-T activity? What's going on there? Thanks.
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: So, Marc, yeah, it was a nice quarter for gross margin. We've gone back and looked. Historically, Q2 does run a little stronger than the rest of the year. That's a function of product mix, to a certain extent. But that said, we continue to make pretty nice progress on this line, even in the face of the partnership accounting. If you back out partnership accounting, we are probably up about 120 basis points. Yeah, I think the main drivers, about a third of that was a favorable impact of exchange. But that still left 80 basis points to the good, and that was really a mix of product mix as well as just cost efficiencies.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: And this is Mike. With respect to the Stemcentrx pipeline beyond Rova-T, we continue to make very, very good progress. And one of the things that was really attractive about Stemcentrx was that it not only brought a lead asset, but it had a discovery platform that we thought we could capitalize and accelerate our presence in solid tumors. And we're seeing that play out. The scientific team there has been very productive. They've worked well with the broader scientific team at AbbVie. Our strengths really complement each other. We're driving that platform forward rapidly. We have a number of programs in the clinic, and we have a number of programs in late preclinical development, poised to enter early clinical development. And we could introduce as many as three to four programs a year into the clinic over the next couple of years from that platform, as we said in other settings. We're still tracking very well against that goal, and we feel good about the progress we're making.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Marc. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Umer Raffat of Evercore. Your line's open.
Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple, if I may. First, just to follow up on the ABT-494 question, can you just remind us exactly the number of cases of thromboembolic events you've seen either completed or in ongoing trials on a blinded basis, number one? And then secondly, just wanted to focus on HUMIRA, the recent news on the judge for the District Court trial, could that have an impact on the actual trial date versus Amgen? And then, also, Rick, you mentioned there's no significant difference in Managed Care contracting for 2018 for HUMIRA, but would you continue to expect the same pricing tailwind? And the reason I ask is I just find the dynamic around your key competitors on fake TNFs (50:31) not getting much price tailwinds lately. Thank you very much.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. This is Mike. With respect to 494, what we've reported so far is from Phase 2. And in Phase 2, there were two cases of PE that were in patients with a number of risk factors. One of those was a recurring case. Given the background rates that I talked about, it really isn't surprising to see a small number of cases like this, particularly in Phase 2, where the large majority of patients are on active drug. With respect to our ongoing trials, what we've said is that we're monitoring our data closely. We have a good understanding of the background rate, which is between about 0.3 and 0.8 events per 100 patient years, and we're not seeing anything that's elevated above that rate.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. This is Rick. Obviously, we haven't in the last year or so, talked much about the litigation strategy, for obvious reasons. We're in active litigation right now. I would tell you nothing has changed in the way of our assumptions around timing, but I probably won't comment much further than that, but I would tell you there's not any concern around a change in significant timing around the litigation timelines. As far as contracting is concerned, it's consistent with what I said to you a few moments ago. We don't see any significant change in the contacting strategy. And that would include what is common in this industry around price protection, which has some impact around your pricing. Having said that, I would say, as we did this year, we're going to be careful and conservative as we think about price going forward. And certainly, as we've looked at our longer range plan, historically, that's how we operated, but I'd say even in this last cycle, we have been even a little more conservative than we have been in the past because this has become such a heated topic in the U.S. But it's not a function of any things related to the contracting strategy. It's more a function of how we're trying to operate the business overall.
Umer Raffat - Evercore Group LLC: Thank you very much.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Omar. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line's open.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Thank you very much for taking the question. Two quick questions, one, you have the rights to the Galapagos cystic fibrosis program and you haven't talked about that much on this call, certainly, and recently. I'm wondering how you view the recent announcements from the Vertex program and whether that's changed your appetite for investing in the Galapagos program and your expectations and when you expect to start Phase 3 for that program. And then a sort of left field question for you, Rick, you're the only CEO that AbbVie has had. Could you talk a little bit about your succession planning and timing and what the transition is likely to look like and when that might happen, because there's not a lot of history there, how AbbVie's handled that? Thanks.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. This is Mike. I'll take CF first. You know, our CF program is a program that we feel very good about. It's still in early phase studies. And so for a company of our size, we don't always spend a lot of time talking about our very early phase work, but that doesn't mean that we're not excited about it. I think there's a real opportunity there. I think the target has a lot of the characteristics of things we're really good at doing, engineering very, very specific and high-quality small molecules together with our partner on this, Galapagos. I think there clearly is an unmet medical need. Obviously, there have been advancements in the field, and that's good for patients, but there's more room to go. And so we think that we can contribute there. With respect to the Vertex data, and the Vertex data are strong, but we expected those data to come out and we expected them to be strong. We still believe that there is headroom above that that can benefit patients, and we can help meet that need. It's our mid-phase trials that are going to provide that answer. And we and Galapagos are working diligently to move into that phase of development. With respect to Phase 3, I think it's a bit early to predict timing on Phase 3 right now.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. This is Rick. I'll answer your second question. Yes, I've been the only CEO of AbbVie, but AbbVie is only 4.5 years old. So, I guess, that's not too unusual. In fact, I'd say, if there were more than one, that probably would be a sign of something different, right? But on a more serious note, I think as you look at succession planning, it's obviously a critical issue for a company of this size. We have a very good, high-quality board of seasoned executives at the board level. We take succession planning very seriously. I'd say we view it as an active process that we continue to work on. But certainly once a year at a particular board meeting, we dedicate a significant amount of time to succession planning. We have a succession plan in place for the company, as most companies of our size would have, that's a planned structure of both internal candidates that we have and the development of those internal candidates. Obviously, there are always opportunities to go outside if the board were to choose that. We obviously also have an emergency succession plan, if something were to happen that would require that. And we have identified individuals that we fundamentally believe would be appropriate for that. So I can tell you, the board takes it seriously. It is an active process that we use. And I think I won't speak for the board. But as Chairman of the Board, I would tell you it's a process that I feel very comfortable with. And I believe it's very appropriate for a company of our size.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC: Terrific. Thanks.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Geoffrey. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line's open.
Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. One for Mike, so elagolix, how meaningful is extension study data to the overall profile? Clearly, duration of therapy could be a big lever. Want to get your sense as to persistent compliance trends, pretty much throughout the program, and what you think that could mean to the real-world use. And then, bigger picture question for Rick, you guys have made a lot of pipeline progress and have a number of launches for next year. So I want to get your sense as to how that has changed your strategy, if at all, in biz-dev. I think the hiring of Henry [Gosebruch] a few years ago signaled an emphasis on deals, but we haven't seen much activity of late. Thank you.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. This is Mike. I'll start with the elagolix question and hand it over to Rick. We've designed a program for elagolix that is going to provide a very large and very comprehensive database to guide real-world use. We have the initial efficacy periods, and those results were very strong. We've reported them in other settings. We have extension periods, which, as you point out, could be very important for informing duration of use. And then we have off-treatment periods, so that we can look at a number of factors that we'd want to examine as patients roll off of this therapy. And the results we've seen in each phase are very, very strong. What I would say is there's a real unmet medical need here. There hasn't been any innovation in this space in decades. And women's treatment options are very, very limited, so oral contraceptives are used upfront. They provide some women relief. And that's good, but we know that many, many women don't achieve necessary relief. Beyond that, there's no disease-specific intervention until you get all the way to the other end of the spectrum, either putting a woman in menopause with LUPRON or surgical interventions. And in-between, the only thing that doctors can do is give pain medicines and basically treat this as a chronic pain condition. And we know that the pain is severe enough that a large number of women go on opioid pain medicines for this condition. And so we think that elagolix is really going to offer a compelling profile to these women. And what it offers is the ability to titrate suppression of the hormonal lapses. (59:21) Instead of just an on and off switch, we can achieve different levels of suppression. And we've seen that that translates into improvement in pain, improvement in symptoms on a number of measures and a very favorable safety profile. So we're looking forward to moving forward with the regulatory submission, which will be later on this quarter. And we think it's going to be a real advance in this field. With that, I'll hand it over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Well, as you pointed out, we have a number of launches, not just next year, but over the next several years. And it's really the evolution of our pipeline playing out. When we launched the company, we put major emphasis around building a pipeline that could sustain long-term top-tier growth and we've been working diligently to get that done. And I think you're starting to see now the evolution of that reach a point where we'll be launching a number of these products over time. I'd say as I look at our commercial organization, I think we have an outstanding commercial organization. And they've been preparing for many of these launches now for several years. We obviously do it in phases. You'll start to see us increase investment in certain areas to prepare for those launches. And I feel good about how we'll enter the marketplace with a number of these new drugs and the impact that we can have. As far as deals are concerned, what drives our deal decision-making is really built around the strategy for the business. Within each one of the verticals, we have a strategic set of objectives that we're trying to accomplish. And we basically apply our deal focus and our BD activity against that strategy. And so as I said earlier, we've obviously added a number of large platform plays to the business to build-out our oncology franchise, which was an important part of our strategy going forward for the business was to build another major growth platform in oncology. And I think as I look at IMBRUVICA and I look at the Pharmacyclics acquisition and I reflect on what we thought at the time we did it and I look at where we are now, I can tell you I'm very happy with how that has played out. I mentioned some of the numbers that we talked about a moment ago about the kind of penetration rates that we're getting with IMBRUVICA. If you look at second-line-plus, so second, third-line and beyond, IMBRUVICA has achieved one of the objectives that we had was to get to 65% market share across the vast majority of those indications. And we're at or above in second-line-plus. In first-line, now, we're focusing a lot of attention in growing our position there. And you're seeing in CLL, we're ramping very rapidly in that area. We'll get some additional approvals, we believe, that will allow us to grow first-line across a number of other tumor types. And then, as you see the NHL line of indication start to play out, we've dedicated a sales force to that, because we believe going forward, that will be another significant growth driver for us. As we track towards what the overall objective was, which was greater than $7 billion of revenue to AbbVie, we're right on that trajectory and $5 billion by 2020. So I think it played out the way we hoped and expected it should play out. We constantly look at deals. Henry's team is doing a great job. I can't say that there's a lot out there that either fits what our strategic objectives are or has a value proposition at this point that is something that we are comfortable with from a return standpoint. And that really is what's been driving the lack of activity versus any strategic intent not to go forward on transactions. But as I said, we're primarily focused now more on individual kinds of assets that can fill out our portfolio. But they have to be things that we're comfortable with, from the standpoint of the potential for the asset, the probability that the mechanism will work, and then obviously, the value proposition that we'd have to pay for. If it's something that we can't get the return, then it's not something we're going to pursue.
Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got you. Okay. Thanks a lot.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Rick, just to follow-up on those last thoughts there, you've been very clear about the types of things you're looking to do. But how open-minded are you, if at all, about the potential for the big M&A that could address concentration and also create meaningful cost efficiency, not something you've sort of led with in your discussions around BD, but gauging your open-mindedness. This industry seems to be ripe for some larger combinations. Secondly, can you remind us what your commercial infrastructure is for women's health and how you might need to tweak that ahead of elagolix? And lastly, with the recent sizable judgment on the Low-T case, can you comment on your thoughts on liability in that area for the company? Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Sure. Obviously, we look at all different kinds of things, but what I would tell you is if you look at our growth – certainly, if you look at our growth over the last several years, and if you look at our going forward projections for growth across our long-range plan, this is a company that has performed extremely well, and we expect it to continue to perform well. Concentration was something that we had looked at as part of our overall pipeline strategy. We will fundamentally deconcentrate the business as we add more products, more pipeline assets and grow those assets to a sizable level. And you can start to see some of that with IMBRUVICA. IMBRUVICA is obviously contributing significant growth and will continue to contribute significant growth. As some of the additional oncology and other assets move into the phase where they're launched and starting to have a significant impact, you'll see further deconcentration. Now, one of the challenges has obviously been – it's a good challenge to have. We continue to grow HUMIRA at a very robust rate. And we're certainly not going to do anything to slow the growth down to deconcentrate. But that's not a bad problem. That's a good problem. And I think as we look at our strategy going forward of how we'll defend HUMIRA in a biosimilar world, we feel very comfortable with what that looks like and our ability to be able to do that. So I would tell you big M&A is not something that we are considering. And that's not to say it would never ever happen, because you never know in this world, but the reality is that is not fundamental to our strategy. Our strategy was always built around building out a strong pipeline around the verticals that we operate in and being able to drive to significant market share within those areas. As it relates to infrastructure on women's health, as you probably know, we currently sell as one of the indications for LUPRON, it has an endometriosis claim. Now, LUPRON is certainly not the ideal agent for this particular disease, because, obviously, it shuts down that access (67:15) completely and has all of the side effects that are associated with doing that, like bone loss and hot flash. So we have, I'd say, a modest-size sales organization, because it's really scaled to the opportunity that exists there. But, as I mentioned a moment ago, one of the things that I think we're very good at is planning out launches. So as we submit elagolix, there's a plan in place today to start to build-out the infrastructure that will be necessary to give the appropriate level of coverage. I can tell you elagolix is an asset that we are very excited about in endometriosis. We think it has a very good profile. And this is a disease that ultimately has significant consequences for the patients who have this. Opioid use, as an example, is significant within this population, which gives you some idea of how severe the pain is and difficult the pain is to manage. And so I think this will be an important drug for women who have endometriosis. And we'll obviously scale the organization appropriately to be able to deal with that. On the AndroGel case, yes, I would say it was a surprising verdict, from the standpoint that there was this punitive damages aspect to it, without really awarding any damages to the individual. From a legal standpoint, I think that's not only unusual, it's probably going to be a difficult situation to sustain over the longer term, but we need to work through that. I think the important part is on the other claims, obviously, the jury found in our favor. And I think that bodes well. We have a number of these cases, so we need to see how the other ones play out, but I'd say there's no fundamental change in the way we view the liability of this based on this single case.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Gregg. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Your line's open.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, hi. Thanks very much. I have two questions, one for Mike and one for Bill. So obviously, there have been a lot of questions about your JAK inhibitors PE and DVT rate, but when do you expect to publish percentages the way that we've seen for baricitinib? That was 0.47% and Galapagos was 0.16%. And then second, with respect to the timing for HUMIRA's gross margin to step up due to royalty reductions, Bill, I was just hoping that you could provide a little bit more color on that time. Thank you.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. So, this is Mike. I'll take the first question on upadacitinib and the rates of DVT and PE. So I think, as we've said, it's the overall rates that are really important. We continue to monitor those. We're well within that expected rate for the population. And, of course, one wouldn't expect to see something lower than the background rate for the population in any large clinical trials program. So when we have the aggregate data, we'll present the whole picture. And we'll show what those rates are. And we'll also show, at an appropriate time, the distribution in the control period. But really right now, we're very early on in un-blinding and reporting out our Phase 3 RA studies. With respect to those other rates, the rate that you quoted for Gilead, I think we'd have to really understand where that exposure comes from. Gilead is really just getting started in RA. Most of their data comes from Crohn's disease and other inflammatory bowel disease conditions, like UC, where the patient population's very different. They tend to be younger. The risk profile is different. So I think, at this stage, it's hard to use those benchmarks that you quoted as ranges. I think you have to look at the literature. You have to look at other sources of information. And we see a very, very consistent background rate of 0.3 to 0.8. You see that in the literature. We've done our own work in payer databases and we see that same rate. And we've seen that same rate across historical RA programs, regardless of mechanism of action. Some are ours. Some are other programs. So we think we have a really good handle on that rate. And what we're seeing right now is very, very consistent with nothing other than that background rate. When we have the data from our Phase 3 program, we'll present that whole picture.
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Hi, David. The royalty burden really lifts in two different phases. The first third of it lifts at the very end of 2017, so you see a P&L impact in 2018. The other two-thirds lifts at the very end of 2018, so you see the P&L benefit in 2019. And then in terms of quantity to model, we have said that that burden is about 5% to 6% of global HUMIRA sales.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, David.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: The next question comes from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions, so just two, one, going back to the 494 and the anemia comment you talked about earlier. It tells me you're not too concerned based on the dosage you're using, but do you think the anemia could be an issue as you look at more the GI indications, where I think patients can have a little bit more underlying anemia? And then second on HUMIRA in the U.S. side with biosimilars, my question is regarding the U.S. REMICADE biosimilar, which is the second entrant there. I don't expect it to have any impact on HUMIRA, but we were a little bit surprised by the degree of the discount that Merck took, presumably to get good traction with payers. So my question is just were you surprised by that, a 35% discount off the WAC price, a pertinent number two biosimilar into the market. And do you think that's what we should expect sort of going forward, as I think about direct competition to HUMIRA? Thanks.
Michael E. Severino, M.D. - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. So this is Mike. I'll take that first one with respect to 494 and anemia. You know, as I mentioned, in Phase 2, we explored a very broad dose range, including doses above what we would expect, to study in either RA or other indications like inflammatory bowel diseases. At the doses we're studying, we're not seeing a problem with hemoglobin or anemia. And we, of course, have data, not only in RA, but we have mid-stage data in inflammatory bowel diseases, so we don't see anemia as being a problem across-the-board for that program.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, and this is Rick. On the second question, the biosimilar question. Obviously, we are monitoring both the international activity here and the U.S. activity, not just in our particular categories, but in other categories as we look at biosimilars and how it plays out over time. I would tell you, frankly, I was a bit surprised, the market reaction about the 35%. If you look at all of the metrics in Europe, this is well within the range of what you would expect. I think it would be odd to think that a biosimilar could get much uptake in the marketplace with discounts that were significantly below this, because, remember, obviously, there are discounts applied to these products as part of either rebate structures or other discounts associated with them. So it's going to require a discount in this range to have any way to be able to compete. So I wouldn't say that discount is a surprise to me at all.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. All right. Thanks so much.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Vamil.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Well, that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.AbbVie.com. Thanks again for joining us.

Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2017 earnings call. AbbVie delivered strong performance with double-digit top- and bottom-line growth exceeding our guidance for the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 were up more than 11% versus the first quarter of 2016, and global operational sales growth was 10.1%, demonstrating the continued strength of our business. Humira continues to deliver exceptional performance with 15.8% global operational growth in the quarter. In the U.S. Humira grew 22.8%, driven by robust underlying demand, including prescription volume growth of 12%. Humira holds the number-one market share position across all three categories. Internationally, operational sales growth was 4.6%, driven by market growth across, again, all three categories. We continue to expect mid-single-digit operational sales growth for the full year internationally, despite the impact from new competitive entrants and indirect biosimilar competition which has been in the European markets now for several years. We continue to see strong momentum and growth from Imbruvica with global sales in the first quarter of $551 million, an increase of nearly 45% over the prior year. This performance was driven by continued uptake in first-line CLL, where we continue to see strong performance since our approval. In fact, the most recent market share data indicates that we now hold the leading position in new patient starts in the front-line segment, with more than 21% of patients starting Imbruvica as frontline CLL therapy. And given Imbruvica's duration of therapy, more than 30% of total treated front-line patients now use Imbruvica. We're also seeing continued strong market leadership in the second-line-plus setting across all indications. In addition to our commercial progress, we've advanced our efforts to expand the list of Imbruvica approved indications. This includes recent approval in relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma and our recent regulatory submission for chronic graft-versus-host-disease. We also continue to see good progress with the launch of Venclexta in our narrow initial indication of relapsed/refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion. Our second-line-plus market share is now approximately 20% in the U.S. Internationally, Venclexta is off to a good start, and as we've now launched into the two of the larger markets, Germany and France. We also saw a continued strong performance from several other products, including Creon and Duodopa. So overall, we're extremely pleased with our commercial performance and financial results for the quarter, and we're off to another strong start in 2017. Now moving on to our pipeline. As we disclosed last week, the Phase 3 studies evaluating veliparib in squamous non-small cell lung cancer and early stage triple-negative breast cancer did not achieve their primary endpoints, and therefore we won't be moving forward with these indications. This program carried a higher degree of risk, because we were testing a new hypothesis, that hypothesis being whether PARP inhibition enhances chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. While the outcome was not what we hoped for, we have not considered veliparib one of our nearer-term growth drivers. We have a number of late-stage de-risked assets in our pipeline. As we look forward to the remainder of 2017, we're exciting about the forthcoming clinical development and regulatory milestones. Mike will discuss our R&D pipeline in a more detail in just a few moments, but I'll briefly give you some highlights of the noteworthy events. Before the end of the year, you will see data from a dozen pivotal trials, including data readouts for our two late-stage immunology programs. Specifically, you'll see data from the first three of six registrational studies for our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, with results from two of these studies coming in the next few months, and we'll see data from our three pivotal studies in risankizumab in psoriasis later this year. In Oncology, we'll see data from Venclexta Phase 3 MURANO trial, which will support our regulatory application for broader use in the relapsed/refractory CLL population. We'll also see potential registrational data from a study of ABT-414 in second-line glioblastoma multiforme. We're also expecting several additional Imbruvica data readouts based on interim or final analysis across the number of studies. And we'll see results from the TRINITY study, where Rova-T is being evaluated as third-line treatment in small cell lung cancer. In the area of women's health, we'll begin to see late-stage data from our Elagolix program in uterine fibroids, with results from the pivotal study expected late in the year. We also expect regulatory action on several programs, including U.S., EU and Japan approvals for our next-generation HCV offering, and we are nearing the completion of our Phase 3 program for Elagolix in endometriosis and are on track for regulatory submission next quarter. There are so many significant pipeline advancements expected this year, 2017 is shaping up to be an important year for AbbVie, and one that will further reinforce the strength of our pipeline. So as I said a moment ago, we are encouraged with our strong commercial execution and financial performance. We've built a compelling de-risked pipeline, which continues to progress well and is poised to fuel growth over the long term, and we're off to an exceptional start this year and are well-positioned to continue to deliver top-tier financial performance in 2017 and well beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Rick. Today I'll highlight recent pipeline updates and discuss some of the key milestones we anticipate for the remainder of 2017. I'll start with our hem-onc programs, where we continue to make significant progress with both Imbruvica and Venclexta. Starting with Imbruvica, as we've outlined, expanding into new indications is an important driver of future growth. Earlier this year we added relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma to our growing list of approved uses, and we continue to make progress with other indications as well. During the quarter, we submitted a supplemental new drug application for the use of Imbruvica in patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease who failed prior systemic therapy. GVHD is a severe and potentially life-threatening complication that can occur in patients who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant. There are currently limited treatment options for this disease, and if approved, Imbruvica would be the first and only therapy specifically indicated for chronic GVHD. In Phase 2 data presented at the end of last year, 67% of patients who failed steroid therapy responded to treatment with Imbruvica, with one-third of the responders achieving a complete response and almost two-thirds substantially reducing steroid use. Based on these data, we expect a regulatory decision in the second half of the year. Later this year, we anticipate several key data readouts for Imbruvica, including data from an interim analysis in front-line mantle cell lymphoma, as well as additional potential interim analyses in other forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Moving now to Venclexta. We're expecting data from the MURANO study evaluating the combination of Venclexta and Rituxan later this year, which we believe will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL and help establish Venclexta as a foundational therapy in this patient population. The Phase 3 program evaluating Venclexta in front-line CLL is also ongoing, with studies been run in younger, more fit patients as well as older patients with comorbidities. These studies, as well as other combination studies with Imbruvica, are important parts of the Venclexta strategy to drive toward chemo-free regimens in CLL. We anticipate key data from the CLL14 study in older patients with comorbid medical conditions to be available in 2018. Beyond our core strategy in CLL, we are making great progress with our development programs to expand Venclexta across multiple hematologic malignancies. We have Phase 3 studies ongoing in multiple myeloma as well as AML, where we have received Breakthrough Therapy Designation. And these studies are progressing well, with key data becoming available in the 2019 timeframe. Later this year, we are also expecting additional data readouts from Phase 2 studies in indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which will inform decisions regarding advancement in these indications. I'll now turn to our solid tumor programs, where we continue to make good progress with our late-stage programs, Rova-T and ABT-414, as well as with our early-stage oncology pipeline. Starting with Rova-T, our registrational trial in third-line-plus small cell lung cancer, the TRINITY study, continues to progress nicely, and we expect data later this year. Our submission will follow soon thereafter, enabling a commercial launch in 2018. In addition to TRINITY, we have a comprehensive development program in place for Rova-T to evaluate this promising therapy in earlier lines of treatment in small cell lung cancer, as well as in other tumor types that express DLL3. The Rova-T program includes additional studies currently underway in small cell lung cancer, including MARU, a Phase 3 study evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting, and a mid-stage combination study evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and – with Opdivo and Yervoy in small cell lung cancer. And this quarter, we will also start the TAHOE study, a Phase 3 trial in second-line small cell lung cancer. Beyond small cell lung cancer, the neuroendocrine tumor basket study is progressing nicely, and we anticipate beginning to see early data from this study towards the end of this year. As we've discussed, the acquisition of Stemcentrx not only provided AbbVie a late-stage asset in Rova-T, but brought a highly attractive discovery and early development platform as well. In addition to Rova-T, we have four Stemcentrx assets in the clinic, and we are on track to transition several additional programs into human trials this year, adding to our growing oncology pipeline, which includes more than 35 late preclinical or early clinical stage assets. Beyond Rova-T and our other Stemcentrx assets, we're continuing to make progress with our solid tumor programs, including our antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme, ABT-414, which was granted Fast Track Designation earlier this month. At the upcoming ASCO meeting, we plan to present full data from the Phase 1 study of ABT-414 in glioblastoma, including overall survival and progression-free survival data. And later this year, we'll see data from the Phase 2 study in second line GBM that, if positive, would support regulatory submission. In our early-stage oncology pipeline, we continue to build capabilities and explore new technologies that will extend our reach in the solid tumor market. We're making good progress with our next-generation immuno-oncology programs and other novel approaches such as our bispecific technology, with a number of assets having recently entered the clinic and more study starts expected through the remainder of 2017. Moving now to our HCV program, where we recently received priority review from the FDA for our pan-genotypic next-generation HCV therapy. In the quarter we also received EMA accelerated assessment and priority review in Japan. Last week at the International Liver Congress we presented new results from our Phase 3 program, including data from the EXPEDITION-1 and ENDURANCE-3 studies, which together with previously reported data reinforce our next-generation therapies' potential to provide high cure rates and a shorter treatment duration for the majority of patients across all genotypes, including patients with compensated cirrhosis and those with genotype 3 infection. Results from EXPEDITION-1 demonstrated that 99% of patients with compensated cirrhosis achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment across genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. We also presented data from ENDURANCE-3 in patients with genotype 3, the second most common (16:22-16:33) genotype globally and the most challenging to treat. These results showed that with just eight weeks of treatment, 95% of genotype 3 patients without cirrhosis and who are new to treatment achieved SVR12 with our next-generation therapy. We're excited about the high cure rates across all major genotypes and the results in difficult-to-treat patients that we've seen in our Phase 3 program, and remain confident that our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free HCV therapy will be competitively positioned within this market. We remain on track for regulatory approval in the U.S., EU, and Japan later this year. Moving now to our immunology programs, where we have two very promising late-stage assets, risankizumab and ABT-494, each with the potential to significantly advance standard of care in a number of immune-mediated conditions. Risankizumab, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim, has the potential to provide best-in-class efficacy and increased dosing convenience with quarterly administration. Results from the Phase 2 study of risankizumab in psoriasis were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. These data show that selective blockade of IL-23 with risankizumab was associated with a superior clinical response compared to Stelara. In this study, approximately 2.5 times as many patients achieved PASI 100 with risankizumab compared with those receiving Stelara. The Phase 3 program in psoriasis is well underway, and we look forward to seeing data from three of the pivotal studies later this year, with commercialization expected in 2019. Earlier this month, we also published results from a proof-of-concept Phase 2 study of risankizumab in Crohn's disease. Results from this study show that patients receiving risankizumab achieved higher clinical and endoscopic remission rates than placebo, suggesting that blocking IL-23 could be a very promising therapeutic approach in Crohn's disease. 52-week data from the open-label maintenance portion of this trial will be shared in a late-breaking oral presentation at the upcoming DDW meeting in May. Phase 3 studies in Crohn's disease will be starting soon. This year we'll also see Phase 2 data in psoriatic arthritis, with Phase 3 studies expected to begin in the first half of 2018. Additionally, we are expecting to begin a Phase 2 for risankizumab in ulcerative colitis in the second half of the year. Moving now to our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, where we continue to make significant progress with our development programs in RA and inflammatory bowel diseases. At the upcoming DDW meeting, we'll be presenting data from the Phase 2 CELEST study in Crohn's disease, showing that treatment with ABT-494 demonstrated endoscopic improvement and clinical benefit as induction therapy in patients with moderate to severe refractory Crohn's disease. Based on these strong Phase 2 results, we'll be initiating a Phase 3 program later this year. We have two additional mid-stage programs for ABT-494, including an ongoing Phase 2 study in atopic dermatitis and a soon-to-begin Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis. Turning our attention to rheumatoid arthritis, we expect to begin seeing data from the first of six Phase 3 RA studies in the coming months, with top-line data from the SELECT-NEXT trial in patients who have failed conventional DMARDs expected in June, and data from the SELECT-BEYOND study in biologic inadequate responders expected later in the summer. We plan to present full data from both of these studies at a medical meeting later this year. We believe ABT-494 has the potential to be best-in-class with an optimized benefit risk profile, and we are particularly excited about this asset's potential in the difficult-to-treat anti-TNF inadequate responder population, a growing segment of the RA market representing roughly 35% of the biologic treated population. And finally, in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of the Phase 3 program for elagolix in endometriosis and are on track for regulatory submission next quarter. In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase 3 studies underway in uterine fibroids. This program is investigating the effect of elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. We anticipate beginning to see data from this Phase 3 program late in the year. Earlier this month we presented detailed results from the Phase 2 study in uterine fibroids at the meeting of the Society of Endometriosis and Uterine Disorders. These data demonstrated that treatment with elagolix provided superior efficacy and rapid control of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids compared to placebo, as well as improved quality of life. Treatment with elagolix was well tolerated, with hormonal add-back therapy substantially attenuating the side effects of elagolix on bone mineral density and hot flashes. Importantly, there were no abnormal endometrial findings, demonstrating that elagolix has potential as a chronic, uninterrupted treatment for this condition. We remain excited about this potential new medicine for women with both of these highly prevalent conditions, where there are few effective treatment options. So in summary, we've continued to see significant evolution of our mid- and late-stage pipelines, and we look forward to many important data readouts, phase transitions, regulatory submissions, and approvals later this year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Bill?
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. As Rick said, we had another quarter of outstanding performance, delivering strong top- and bottom-line growth. Total net revenues for the first quarter were $6.5 billion, up 10.1% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.28, up 11.3% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted EPS came in $0.02 favorable to our previously communicated guidance range for the quarter, the result of higher than forecasted sales and timing of spending. Humira delivered another quarter of strong sales growth with global sales of $4.1 billion, up 15.8% operationally. In the U.S., Humira sales increased 22.8% compared to the prior year, driven by volume growth in excess of 12% plus price. Wholesaler inventory levels were consistent between the quarters at less than half a month. Humira's growth has been fueled by robust demand across all three segments: rheum, gastro, and derm. In rheumatology, Humira remains the number one prescribed biologic. In the gastro segment, we continued to see double-digit prescription growth in the quarter despite new competition. Humira holds the market leadership position in treatment-naïve patients for both Crohn's disease and UC, where nearly half of new patients start on Humira. And in dermatology, double-digit volume growth was driven by our market leadership in psoriasis as well as strong adoption rates for HS, which was launched in late 2015. International Humira sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.6% on an operational basis and in line with our expectations. We continue to see good growth despite the entry of new competitors and indirect biosimilar competition, which continues to track in line with our expectations. Global Imbruvica net revenues for the first quarter were $551 million, up nearly 45% over the first quarter of last year, driven by penetration into first-line CLL and continued strong performance in other approved indications. We remain on track to achieve our full-year expectation for global reported revenues of greater than $2.4 billion, with sales in the U.S. of more than $2 billion. Global Viekira sales in the first quarter were $263 million, down versus the prior year. As we've previously communicated, we have seen market share loss and price erosion due to competitive dynamics within the HCV market. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 19.8% on an operational basis in the quarter, and we also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from Creon, which was up 22.8%. Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 79.9% of sales compared to 81.3% in the prior year. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin as a percentage of sales was negatively impacted by partnership accounting and exchange. Due to the seasonality of certain products, our gross margin ratio in the first and fourth quarters is typically lower than the second and third quarters. We continue to forecast a full-year gross margin ratio of approximately 81%. Adjusted R&D was 16.9% of sales, in support of our ongoing pipeline programs in oncology, immunology, HCV and other areas. On a year-over-year basis, R&D as a percentage of sales increased due to the spend related to the Stemcentrx and risankizumab deals, both of which closed in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted SG&A was 20.7% of sales in the first quarter, down 190 basis points versus the prior year, driven by sales leverage and operational efficiencies. The operating margin profile was impacted by R&D investment related to Stemcentrx and risankizumab, as well as the adverse impact of foreign currency. Adjusting for these items, the adjusted operating margin profile grew by 120 basis points versus the prior year. We continue to forecast a full-year operating margin ratio of approximately 43%. Net interest expense was $247 million and the adjusted tax rate was 18.2% in the quarter. The first quarter tax rate benefited from the adoption of new accounting rules for the treatment of taxes on equity compensation. This impact is most pronounced in the first quarter, given the timing of equity grants, and was contemplated in our guidance. First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.28, up 11.3% year-over-year. As we look ahead to the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.39 and $1.41. Our second quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.19 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. We are forecasting reported revenue growth in the second quarter of between 7% and 8%. Holding exchange rates constant at a current level, we would expect foreign exchange to have an unfavorable impact on sales growth of approximately 1% in the second quarter. For U.S. Humira, we expect sales growth in the second quarter in the mid-teens to high teens. Internationally, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth for Humira, with approximately 3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, resulting in low-single-digit reported growth. For Imbruvica, we expect U.S. sales growth in the second quarter to approach 35%. And with respect to the tax rate, future quarters should be modeled at above 19%. We remain on track to achieve our full-year guidance, including operational revenue growth of approximately 10% and adjusted earnings per share between $5.44 and $5.54. So in closing, we are very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in the quarter. We've driven top-tier revenue and EPS growth, while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for Q&A. Operator, we'll take the first question.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami, your line is open.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Rick, I have a theoretical question for you. We have written about AbbVie separating into two separate businesses for reporting purposes in order to close what we see as a substantial value gap, a Humira company and a growth company. The idea is to set up Humira as an earn-out company from which to pay a recurring special dividend to shareholders to alleviate persistent fears from biosimilar competition, while drawing attention to your substantial pipeline story. Assuming some form of corporate tax reform is passed, and I know that's far from a certain thing, how realistic is this scenario, and what is your appetite internally to do something like this? Do you have other priorities for cash, like M&A, stock buyback, or debt pay-down? Are those more important than a special dividend, does that even make sense? Because it seems to me that investors still see Humira is just a huge risk versus a monster cash flow generator. Just curious for your thoughts are? Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Hi, Jami, yes. Well, first thanks for the question. Maybe let me come at it from a broader perspective first, and then I'll specifically talk about how we think about it as it relates to Humira and AbbVie. If you listen to the framework of tax reform that came out yesterday, I'd say generally speaking, I find that incredibly encouraging for companies like ours, U.S.-based companies. It certainly would put us in a position where we'd be far more competitive to our foreign competitors, which make up a significant part of our peer competitive company base and it would certainly give us a lot more encouragement to invest in the U.S. and create U.S. jobs. So I find the discussion encouraging and I think it would be extremely beneficial for companies, certainly our industry and across other industries. Specifically as it relates to AbbVie, I'd say first I've read your report. I thought it was extremely well done and I'll tell you that I agree wholeheartedly with the thesis that you laid out in the report. And as you point out, we have a business that generates tremendous cash flow, and we anticipate that that cash flow is sustainable over the long term. That cash flow certainly, as it is generated, far outweighs what we would envision as what is required for us to reinvest back in the business. We're certainly going to reinvest back in the business, as we have historically, but I'd say as we project forward, we would be building cash offshore. And so, certainly it is in excess of what we would anticipate we would need for strategic reinvestment back in the business. I'd also say that as you point out in your report, we're significantly undervalued. We're undervalued from the standpoint of Humira and the benefit that it drives in the business, and certainly that's driven by the concentration that we have in Humira, and oddly enough, as we continue to drive Humira and show the success with it, I think that increases that pressure. Secondly, I'd say we're tremendously undervalued as you look at the pipeline that we have. As I mentioned in my comments, you're going to see a dozen pivotal trial results that are going to read out over the course of 2017. There aren't many companies in our industry that have those kind of catalysts going forward. And so as we look at it, if we were to get tax reform where we could get better access or more cost-effective access to our offshore cash, we're certainly going to be looking at ways to be able to appropriately deploy that cash. Dividend has always been important for us, and I can tell you we're committed to a growing dividend. The idea of a special dividend, I think, is a very unique idea and one that I think has strong merit. Certainly share buyback is another way to do that, but returning cash to shareholders to reward them for the tremendous success that Humira has had and will continue to have going forward is a high priority for us. So I'm encouraged, I hope we can move tax reform going forward in 2017 or early 2018, and once there is clarity around that, then we'll be looking at what is the appropriate approach to make sure that investors are rewarded for the benefit of the cash flow that Humira is going to generate.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just if I can follow up, Rick, in terms of priorities for cash, I mean many investors would look at the Humira concentration and say the only way to offset that is through further bolt-on acquisitions. Do you agree with that, or are you pleased with what you have and you would – in terms of usage of cash, just curious how you would prioritize? I mean, is it returning cash to shareholders, is that a higher priority right now than paying down debt, deploying cash to further acquisitions, how do you think about that?
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Well, as far as debt is concerned, I'd say it is not our intent to significantly pay down debt in the current environment. In the event that interest wasn't deductible, then I'd say that priority obviously would change going forward, but I'd say that's not a high priority for us. We believe we'll grow into the appropriate ratios; our credit rating is obviously important to us, and – but when you look at the growth of our business, we clearly think we can grow into that. As far as bolt-on acquisitions, what really we focus on is, we have a strategic roadmap of how we're trying to operate within the franchises. For the most part, I'd say we have the major platforms that we need. So we don't envision the need for large platforms. We did that work with both Pharmacyclics and with Stemcentrx, and we think we're well-positioned for that. There are certainly additional assets that we'd look for, but I'd say they look more like the BI kind of transaction or individual kinds of products or smaller groups of products would be a higher priority for us going forward. And so, as I said, I think there'll be significant excess cash that will build up over time, and I would say returning that cash to shareholders in some appropriate way will be a high priority for us.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Jeff, your line is open.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. I just have two for you. First of all, on ABT-494, I wonder if you could talk about your confidence in the safety and efficacy of this asset. Basically, in light of the setback that we've seen with baricitinib and any color you could give us on potentially why your asset might avoid some of the issues that they may have seen that's triggered the CRL? And then secondly, we do have an upcoming catalyst in terms of Humira patents with the IPR decision on the '135 patent. Wonder if you could give us a sense of your level of confidence around the outcome of that decision, and then also just the negative and positive implications in either case of the outcome? Thank you.
Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.: Jeff, this is Mike. I'll take the first part of that question. So obviously we've been following the situation very, very closely. Of course, we don't have access to the complete response letter or knowledge of Lilly's conversation with regulators. But we do have a very clear understanding of our own program, our own data, and our own extensive conversations with regulators here in the U.S. and in major jurisdictions around the world. And based on that, we remain confident in our program and don't see any read-through from the Lilly situation. We've designed a very comprehensive and robust Phase 3 program that will thoroughly characterize the efficacy and safety profile of both of the doses of ABT-494 that are being studied in Phase 3. And we remain confident in the data that we've seen, our Phase 2 data, we're very strong not only from an efficacy, but also from a safety perspective. An important issue here is dose selection, and we designed a very robust Phase 2b program that explored a wide range of doses across different patient populations, because dose response is not necessarily the same in an earlier population or an TNF-inadequate responder population, for example. And we ran Phase 2 studies in both of those patient populations. That allowed us to select doses that we think optimize benefit/risk, and as I said, we've designed a Phase 3 program that will fully demonstrate that benefit/risk and support regulatory decisions. So our level of confidence or enthusiasm on ABT-494 remains high and hasn't changed a bit this past week.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. Jeff, this is Rick. On the IPR, as we've said in previous calls, I mean we're in active litigation now, so we're not going to talk a lot about specifics around this. What I would say to you is, if you look at our level of confidence in what we've described to the market about our ability to protect Humira, it remains the same. And that confidence was built around a large portfolio of IP, it was never contingent upon any one set of IP or any single set of patents or individual patents. We have a large portfolio of formulation patents that have come under challenge and have been successful and successfully navigated through those challenges. We have now the beginning of these dosing patents, we have a large portfolio of dosing patents. We have dosing patents beyond '135 in RA, so beyond the ones being challenged. And so I'd say our level of confidence in the outcome, the overall outcome that we anticipated remains the same, and it remains high. Having said that, if I look at the pure statistics around IPR decisions, I would say the statistics are against you, right? More times than not, they're not upheld at an individual level. So – and I'm not going to speculate on what we think is going to happen in this one, we're going to get that answer fairly soon. I'm sure that if it's a positive reaction, we'll get a positive result, and it's not going to – if it's a negative reaction, we'll get a negative result. I think investors, what they need to focus on is the longer-term perspective, and I think what we have described to the market has played out consistently with what we described, both from a litigation timeframe standpoint and the broadness of our IP. And whoever – whatever biosimilars want to enter this market, they're going to have to navigate their way through that IP. And I still feel as confident as I did when we communicated that to you back in 2015.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Thanks very much.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Jeff. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is form Chris Schott from JPMC. Chris, your line is open.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thanks very much for the questions. Just had two regarding the TNF market. So first, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the U.S. kind of immunology market dynamics you're seeing right now? I think some of your competitors were highlighting a slowdown in the category in Q1; you obviously had very strong numbers. So just a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of overall market dynamics, something about category growth versus the share that you're able to achieve here? My second question was on the contracting cycle we're entering into. Just any more granularity on what portion of your business is already contracted out through 2018, versus how much is up for renewal, as we enter this next contracting season? I think you mentioned in the 3Q call that a good portion of the business was contracted for both 2017 and 2018, but just trying to get a little bit more granularity as we think about some of the news flow over the next few quarters? Thanks so much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. I mean, as far as the TNF market dynamics, they're obviously being affected by two major factors. One is what we've discussed in I guess the last two calls now, the impact that is happening as it relates to Enbrel in the marketplace. And then the second is really an IMS reporting issue, where IMS, a fairly significant account had blinded their data back in the summer of last year I believe. It is an account that we have very high share in, so we're over-indexed in that particular account. And although we're trying to make adjustments, or they're trying to make adjustments to the data, it obviously is depressing both the category and depressing what IMS reports as it relates to Humira. And so, that's just an anomaly in the data. It's going to correct itself as we lap it, and I think actually IMS is going to try to correct it at some point here going forward. They are publishing some correction factors now, and we obviously do the correction internally, because we have our own data that we know what is represented in this particular account, so we can add back that data into the overall market. And I'd say generally speaking, Humira continues to perform just like it has historically. In fact, if you look at – it's interesting, if you look at the last nine quarters in the U.S., I think on average, those nine quarters, we've delivered 22.4%. So Q1 is not any kind of an anomaly. It's right in line with what we would've expected. The majority of that growth is volume driven. You have to remember that in our case, as we look at the market from a quarter standpoint, we know exactly the units that we've shipped, we obviously know exactly the revenue that we've generated. We have very high specificity around what the inventory levels are in the wholesaler channel, and we obviously know what the calculations are for price. So we can dissect this performance very accurately, and I'd tell you that Humira continues to perform extremely well. Overall market share in Q1 is stable, I'd say slightly down in psoriasis, just down a tiny bit, and slightly up in RA. So those two are netting themselves out with stable market share. One of things that we look at very carefully is the capture rate of new patients, and that is stable to slightly up. And then obviously if you look at the performance of the brand in the U.S., and it's tremendous. So, I think we're still very, very comfortable with how the U.S. is performing, and we expect that performance to continue going forward, despite the fact that we are seeing new entrants into the marketplace. Internationally, we continue to perform as we have last year. I'd say first quarter looks a lot like last year. If you look at our overall revenue growth it's 4.5%, 4.6%. If you adjust for Venezuela, you're talking about high-single-digit volume growth. And you have to remember, that's despite the fact that there have been biosimilars now in the marketplace, indirect biosimilars in the marketplace, for an extended period of time. Remicade biosimilars have been in for a long time, and now Enbrel biosimilars have been in the market for a substantial period of time as well. So that gives you some idea of how we're competing in that indirect market, but I'd say we're pleased with what we see in that marketplace going forward. It's tracking as we'd anticipated. As far as contracting, I don't believe we have actually ever communicated what the split is between those that are 2017 and 2018 contracts. But I'd say, generally speaking we feel good about our contract position going forward into 2018. So I don't anticipate any change in our position as it relates to our formulary positions in the United States in 2018.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thank you, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc, your line is open.
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC: Morning. Two questions. First, can you just give us the latest thoughts on what's going on in the ACV market in the three different regions, and how you think that's going to play out over the next year or two? And then second, can you just remind us for elagolix, what's the hook for that product and why we're excited about it? Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. So, Marc, this is Rick. I guess I'll cover both of those questions. So maybe just repeat what you said about the three different regions. What were you referring to?
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC: Well, I was just saying that in hepatitis C, if you could just kind of go into what's happening in the three regions, what you're seeing, what are the dynamics, and how you think that'll change over the next year or two?
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: And regions, you mean the U.S., Europe and Japan, is that what you mean?
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, correct.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah. Well, I'll tell you the dynamics. There's certainly differences between those markets, but I'd say there's general themes that are also similar. So maybe I'll talk to the themes. We're seeing essentially two different dynamics that are playing out in the market. One is, we continue to see price pressure in the market; the third entry in the market has certainly played a stronger price strategy than we would have initially anticipated, but I'd say that is continuing as we see them roll out into many of the international markets. And so, there is pressure on price, and I'd say fairly significant pressure on price in those markets, and they're using price to many cases to try to get early access into the marketplace from a pricing or reimbursement standpoint. The second phenomenon that we're seeing is we're seeing that patient volumes are still trending down, although at a slower pace, so I think we are reaching some point of stability going forward. I think that's driven by a couple of different dynamics. One is, like in the U.S. as an example, many of the patients who were F3s and F4s have been treated, so now you have earlier stage patients. Some of those earlier stage patients are not as motivated to get treated. Some are still obviously undiagnosed in the marketplace, but I think it's primarily their motivation to be treated now, earlier on in their disease process. And then some who are still in the later stages are in environments that are far more difficult to be able to access. They might be IV drug abusers, they might be in the prison system, et cetera, and so that's part of what's driving the dynamics in the U.S. market. Outside of the U.S., you have funding cycles within those countries, and many of those countries funded for mostly F3s and F4s, didn't fund for earlier stage patients. And so, now we're going through the cycle of them dedicating funding for the number of people that they want to treat, and that clearly is coming down somewhat from what it had been in previous years. Having said all of that, I'd say this is still a very big market, and at the end of the day it's a market that's sustainable at a substantial level going forward, and I think our GP product, our next-generation product, will compete very nicely in that market. And you have to remember that up to this point, we've only competed basically in genotype 1. And so there's a big opportunity for us to be able to compete in the other genotypes going forward. And we're certainly excited about what we think this next generation product can do in the marketplace. It will be more of a 2018 impact than a 2017 impact, although we'll get approved in 2017. So I think it's an exciting asset for us. As it relates to elagolix, I'd say elagolix has the ideal profile for a new medicine in this particular area. Essentially – let's take the U.S. as an example. You have about 2.5 million women in the United States who suffer from endometriosis. Many people think that that number is low, that it could be as high as 4 million, because many of these patients are not diagnosed and physicians are hesitant to label them as having endometriosis when there's really no real benefit to doing that because there are no significant therapies. Many of these women suffer from significant pain. In fact, I would tell you that the opioid use in this population is relatively high. In the neighborhood of 35% to 40% of these patients use opioids to try to manage their pain level. And if you look at the profile of elagolix and the clinical data that supports that, it would tell you that elagolix has the opportunity to change the profile of the treatment of that disease significantly. These women are typically of an age where they're interested in at some point becoming pregnant. And so what they're looking for is an oral agent that's fast-on and fast-off. Ideally, you want a therapy that could basically treat these women for in the neighborhood of a year or longer. We think this profile has the ability to do be able to do that for the vast majority of patients. And so we think that's a profile that is very, very consistent with what the market would desire and what patients would desire going forward. It will be a market that you have to build over time, because we even saw in the clinical programs that you had to build awareness around this. So there will be an education process that is necessary in order to both educate physicians on the availability of this medicine when it becomes available, but also educate women to become activated and seek treatment when there weren't previous alternatives that could treat this disease. But if you look at the opportunity, this is clearly a multibillion-dollar product from an opportunity standpoint. And so we're excited about it. It'll move forward into registration next quarter, and we anticipate being able to get that product approved and on the marketplace and starting to build that market. So I can tell you, I'm very excited about what the opportunity looks like. This is a market we know well, because of our experience with Lupron in this segment, and certainly Lupron does not have the ideal profile for these women. So I think it's a market that we'll be able to have a significant impact with this product.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Marc. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Geoffrey Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey, your line is open.
Bradley P. Canino - Leerink Partners LLC: Thanks. This is Brad Canino on for Geoff. Another question on HCV also. With the launch of the G/P regimen looming, do you expect an initial pan-genotypic labeling given the latest data, and are the eight-week data for GT3 and GT1 also likely to be in the initial label at launch? Thanks.
Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.: So, this is Mike. I'll take that question. We feel very good about the data that we've generated across the program and across genotypes. If you look at our response rates, they're very high across both the common and uncommon genotypes, and in particular in some of the most difficult to treat patient populations, like genotype 3. And so, while it's difficult to speculate about a label, we think that the evidence that we've generated strongly supports pan-genotypic use of the product. And with respect to the eight-week data, I would make similar statements. The eight-week data have been very strong across genotypes, including in very difficult to treat patients like genotype 3 patients. There, it's been studied in genotype 3 patients at eight weeks who don't have cirrhosis and are new to therapy, but that's a very, very significant portion of the market, not only in the U.S. but around the world. And our results are very strong, and again, while it's difficult to speculate about a label this early in the process, we think the data supports the use of the regimen in that manner.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Brad. Operator, we will take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank. Gregg, your line is open.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. First, following up on your comments, Rick, on HCV, is AbbVie a believer in NASH as a large opportunity, and what are your plans there? Second, for Mike, how would you set the bar for what you hope to see in TRINITY, and can you express your confidence in whether that data is sufficient to file with? You sound very confident there. And third, Bill, can you comment a bit more on gross margin in the first quarter? I know there are timing issues and lumpiness, but it was the lowest level we've seen in quite some time. So can you provide a little more color on that? Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Yeah. So, Gregg, this is Rick. I'll take the first one, Mike will cover TRINITY, and Bill can cover the gross margin question. So on NASH, I mean certainly as you look at the prevalence of NASH, you look at the implications of it, this is a disease that certainly, if you could find the right therapy would be a significant opportunity. Again, it will be a market development kind of opportunity. Many of those patients are – the earlier stage patients are certainly in GPs and in internal medicine right now, with elevated LFTs as their only real symptom. So it would require some fairly significant market development work. I think if you found the right drug with the right profile, it's clearly a significant opportunity. It's one of the things that's on our target list. As I said, what we do from a business development or a licensing acquisition standpoint is we have a strategic roadmap within each franchise of what we're looking for. I can tell you NASH is on that roadmap. We haven't – we obviously have not found anything yet that has met the criteria that we're looking for, that gives us enough confidence for us to pursue an asset. We've looked at a number of different things, and we'll continue to look. We have some internal efforts at an early discovery level looking at some different mechanisms as well. But those are fairly early on. So, yeah, it's a nice opportunity for the right kind of drug, if we can find that drug with that profile.
Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay, this is Mike, I'll take the question about Rova-T and TRINITY. So what we know about small cell lung cancer is that treatment options are severely limited for these patients. We know that in the front-line setting, we can drive good response rates with traditional chemotherapy, but those responses aren't durable and patients relapse. And when they relapse, they're very, very difficult to treat. Second and subsequent lines of therapy have much lower response rates and very poor durability of those responses. In the third-line setting, where we're conducting the TRINITY study, for example, one-year survival is at best 12%, and many experts would put that number lower. So what we're looking for in TRINITY is something that really changes that picture, something that shows response rates that are different from the chemotherapy options and clearly differentiated – chemotherapy drugs response rates in the teens here – and responses that have the promise of being durable, and increasing that long-term survival to the greatest extent possible. And you asked about our confidence. We remain confident in Rova-T and TRINITY. Rova-T is supported by a very, very strong package of preclinical biology and early clinical data. And this is a situation where the early clinical data are predictive of TRINITY. We're essentially looking at the same endpoints in TRINITY that we did in the early studies. So we feel good about that asset and about the overall Stemcentrx pipeline.
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Gregg, it's Bill. So as you brought up, obviously our gross margin was a little lighter than last year, yeah, it was down 1.4 points. If you look at the impact of partnership accounting, and just to refresh your memory on that, the profit that we transferred to J&J related to Imbruvica, and actually the profit on Venclexta as well, ultimately gets booked up in COGS. So it actually dilutes our gross margin; that had about a 70 basis point impact. And then exchange had about a 30 basis point impact, and obviously exchange rates are going to move around. So it's difficult to call how that is in the future. So, if you back those out, we're really 0.4 points below last year; that's primarily product mix, I think you can hang a lot of that on HCV. We do typically see lower gross margins in Q1 and Q4, and that's all tied to the seasonality of Synagis, which is a very, very low margin product. So that certainly played into that number as well. We feel good about our 81% forecast on the year. I would tell you, you should expect to see a number in Q2 above 81%.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Gregg. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff, your line is open.
Paul Choi - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. It's Paul Choi. Thanks for taking our questions. First on the pipeline with regard to risankizumab, data that's coming out here, can you maybe comment on what other – what sort of metrics you'd be looking for in the psoriasis indication with regard to superiority versus some of the recently launched IL-17 agents that are out there in the market? And secondly, on the Crohn's trials that you're running, with regard to the data that you'll present at DDW, is this something that you think would potentially accelerate the Phase 3 trials that you're planning to start here in the near term? Thanks.
Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. This is Mike, I'll take those take questions. With respect to the risankizumab data, if we look at the Phase 2b data for risankizumab, it shows the strongest observed results in the category, which would include the IL-17s and the IL-23s. We had very high PASI 90 response numbers and very high PASI 100s, so complete clearance of skin disease in that program. And there were other features about the data that were very striking. First, we had very good durability response, and there's a very good administration, with the ability to drive quarterly administration in our Phase 3 program. So basically what we're looking for is a result in Phase 3 that is consistent with those Phase 2 data. The other thing I'd point out, with respect to other agents, is we run active comparators in our Phase 2b, now that's against Stelara not against the IL-17s, but we saw very high PASI 100 rates there. And as I pointed in out in my prepared remarks, PASI 100 was about 2.5 times higher for risankizumab as compared to Stelara in that Phase 2, and the results of PASI 90 were similar, that there were substantially higher PASI 90 response rates, about double that of Stelara. So we feel good about the competitive profile and the ability to drive that through Phase 3 and into the market. With respect to Crohn's disease, the data that we've seen are very encouraging. We're moving very fast already. So I'm not sure if the data at DDW accelerate that, but we're poised to move into Phase 3 and we feel that there's a lot of potential for this pathway in inflammatory bowel diseases as well.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Paul. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. David, your line is open.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. I have two questions, please. First, I was just hoping that you could frame how much total cash AbbVie had at the end of last year. I'm guessing you don't have your 10-Q out yet. And also, what percentage of that was offshore, so we can better understand how much you would plan to repatriate based upon current cash ex-U.S. And maybe you can also speak to the opportunity for borrowing ex-U.S. in the event that repatriation is allowed, to bring back more than the cash on your books. And then second, with respect to Imbruvica, would you please talk a little bit about new indication opportunities over the next few years, the market potential, and the timing of specific e-trial readouts for Imbruvica over the next year or two? Thank you.
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: Hi, David, it's Bill. So, cash on hand at the end of the year was about $8.2 billion, and as you said, we don't have our 10-Q up, but obviously the number is at least $8.2 billion this quarter, and you'll see that soon. Look what I would tell you in terms of geographic distribution of cash, obviously under the current tax paradigm, there is a penalty for bringing back cash, back into the United States. So what we try to do is only bring back that cash that is needed to cover our U.S. cash needs, and that's typically things like interest, the dividend obviously, and then our U.S. operations. To bring back cash above and beyond that is fundamentally inefficient from a tax perspective, so we tend to try to keep our cash, the majority of it, offshore. In terms of our ability to borrow in the event that there was some type of repatriation, that would be a one-time event. Look, what I would tell you is first of all, as Rick said, we're incredibly encouraged that there is talk now about possibly allowing repatriation of cash in a tax efficient manner. We think that's absolutely the right thing to do, just not only for AbbVie and the industry, but the country. We would certainly hope that that is on a permanent basis as opposed to a one-time basis. In the event that it was one-time and without specific limits, we would certainly look to take advantage of that to the greatest extent that we possibly could, and I think borrowing would be in the cards, given that following the closure of that window, we would have the ability to continue to generate robust offshore cash and quickly pay down that debt. So in the event that it went that way and we were permitted to do that, that is certainly something we would look at. That said, it's a little early right now to know definitively how this is going to play out, but we remain optimistic.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. On your Imbruvica question, David, maybe we'll – Mike and I will sort of try to cover the question. Let me just talk about the opportunity first, and then Mike can talk about the timing of the readouts. So I'd say before you jump into new indications, one of the things I think to think through is, a big part of our strategy with Imbruvica, and with the Pharmacyclics acquisition when we talked about it, was the need to be able to move up in the first line, and CLL all by itself is a very, very large indication. And the reason that is so important is because, remember the duration of treatment on Imbruvica is much longer than other therapies now. And the fundamental benefit that patients get from a PFS and an OS standpoint is driven by those patients staying on therapy for long periods of time. And so, as you move in the front-line, you get your greatest benefit for the patient by doing that, and obviously you get your greatest benefit from a business standpoint by moving up into those first-line patients. So even within the indications we're in today, driving towards first line, CLL is a very big opportunity, but the other indications moving into first line is a critical priority. Now, having said that – and I'd say the bulk of our LRP is driven off of that – having said that though, I'd say then if you look at two – three other large categories, they have different risks associated with them from a probability of success. But NHL, I'd say we have a significant amount of data, but NHL as a category is a very significant opportunity for us, and Mike can talk about the different trials that are in that particular area to support our efforts there. Relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients I think is another significant opportunity for us, just because of the size of that patient population. And those will all play out over the course of this LRP from the standpoint of timing of those trials and readouts of those trials and potential regulatory approvals in those areas. And then I'd say a very high risk, but obviously high reward if it were to play out, is the pancreatic study. That is one that we've heavily risk-adjusted, and so it's not something that we're counting on, certainly isn't something that investors should be counting on at this point. But if it were to play out in a positive way, obviously that would be a very big opportunity. So those, as we look forward, I think are the most significant opportunities to describe.
Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.: And this is Mike. So with respect to the framework that Rick laid out, we have a number of opportunities to move forward in lines of therapy. And one that we would expect to see data on later this year is mantle cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where we're anticipating interim data from a pivotal study in front-line, which would be an important step towards moving to front-line therapy there. In mantle cell, we also have combination work ongoing with Venclexta, and that combination has shown very strong results. And so those data would continue to mature over the course of the timeframe that you described. We're also going to see data in other forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma over the course of the next 18 or 24 months, including data in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, where we've seen good results in patients who have the ABC or activated B-cell phenotype of that disease, and also additional work in follicular lymphoma, which is the largest form of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Outside of NHL, we're making good progress with GVHD. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have the initial submission in but we have ongoing data generation in GVHD. So all of those data will mature over the course of the timeframe that you described. And then, at the back end of that two-year period, we'll start to see more data on multiple myeloma and other opportunities as well.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks very much.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, David. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from John Boris from SunTrust. John, your line is open.
John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions. Just on the – circling back to capital allocation on share repo, can you just give some transparency on what you purchased in the quarter and your thoughts about additional repurchases going forward, especially related to your comments earlier? And then the second question just has to do with the line extension behind Humira. I believe you launched a lower – low-concentration, less burning formulation in the EU. What's your planning and timing for launch of that in the U.S.? Any thoughts around the appetite for formulary uptake in the U.S.? Also your ability to do direct-to-consumer advertising? And lastly, just on how Roche's launch in the MS space and Lilly's launch into the diabetes space, that price discounts played a role, at least in terms of gaining access to formulary there. So, appreciate you taking the question.
William J. Chase - AbbVie, Inc.: So, John. It's Bill. On share buyback in the quarter, we bought back $500 million of shares. When you see our 10-Q you're going to see a higher number. We were also buying at the end of the year. About $300 million carried over between the years. So in the 10-Q it'll look like $800 million, but actually this year we bought back $500 million. It's not our intent at this point to buy back significantly more. That said, as I said earlier, to the extent that we find ourselves with an excess of U.S. cash, we do from time to time deploy that in the market and buy back shares, given that we've already incurred the tax inefficiency of bringing it back home, and we did do some of that last year. So yeah, some of this will wind up looking – we'll have to look to see what our U.S. cash balance looks like as we progress through the year. But right now, I think $500 million is all we have in our current sights.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: And then, as it relates to the new formulation, we have rolled out a new formulation outside the U.S. in a number of countries. We essentially have a country-by-country framework that we've laid out, of rolling that out. With a brand of the magnitude of Humira, obviously, we're being careful about how we roll that out to make sure there's no market disruptions. And in fact, because it is a new formulation, we have to change the footprint of our manufacturing to be able to deal with it, because it's a different manufacturing process for the API. And so we have to basically – it's like changing the engine on a 747 while you're still flying at 40,000 feet. We're being careful about how we're doing that, as we flex the manufacturing capacity that we have to make the shift over. And so over time we would anticipate that that formulation will be in all the major markets around the world, but it will take some time in order for that to happen. Your question on DTC, I'm not sure I quite understand. I mean, we obviously have an active DTC campaign now for Humira. We wouldn't anticipate a change in that as it relates to the new formulation, if that's what you were referring to. It's not that kind of a strategy that we've built here, although there is a benefit for patients from the standpoint of pain upon injection, but that's not part of the strategy that we built in place. And then as it relates to the launches of Roche and Lilly, I think every single market has a different set of dynamics. I'm certainly not an expert when it comes to diabetes, so I'm not going to speculate on what the right strategy is there. I would tell you in the markets that Humira competes in, essentially we've had many competitors come at a low list-price strategy, and that hasn't necessarily been as ineffective, because you have to remember that list price in this market is not reflective of what the actual patient or the individual employer pays for the drug. And so at the end of the day, that strategy doesn't seem to work well in this market, especially in a brand like Humira that has the attributes that Humira has. It can serve broadly a significant part of the patient population, both within a category and across multiple categories. It's really the strength of this brand and the clinical efficacy and safety of this brand that has driven its performance.
John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: So, Rick...
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, John.
John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Go ahead.
John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Yeah. Just on direct-to-consumer, will you be able to make a claim on TV that it's less painful and causes less burning?
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: I don't believe so, but regardless of whether we could or we couldn't, it's not our strategy to do that.
John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, John. Obviously we're cognizant that there are a number of peer companies reporting today, so we've got time for just one more question. Operator, we'll take the last question.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Vamil, your line is open.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, hi. Thanks so much for taking the question and squeezing me in here. So just two if I could quickly, one on veliparib, you mentioned obviously the news from the two trials, it's obviously not a key growth driver in the near-term, but just if you can just talk about what you see as the future role for that asset, and why is – why you're still continuing to develop it in the trials that are still ongoing? And then if you can just provide a little more color in terms of the impact you're seeing on biosimilars to Humira outside of the U.S., both in terms of the infused product and the injectables, that'd be helpful. Thanks so much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - AbbVie, Inc.: Okay. So maybe I'll cover the second question first. Because I'd say the trend outside the U.S. on biosimilars is very similar to what we've seen, relatively low overall market share, discounting that's within the range of what we predicted historically or slightly lower – slightly less discounting than what we had predicted. And so we've essentially seen the indirect competition pretty much stabilize out in these marketplaces. There has been some impact on price in certain markets outside the U.S., but that has pretty much played through at this point. And so I don't expect any significant changes in the activity in the rest of 2017, from a biosimilars standpoint, outside of the U.S.
Michael E. Severino - AbbVie, Inc.: So with respect Veliparib, as we've said on other occasions, we were exploring a different hypothesis with Veliparib. We know that Veliparib – or we know that PARP inhibitors play a role in treating patients with inherited mutations in DNA repair, germline BRCA mutation and similar mutations. But we didn't view it as a substantial opportunity for a company like AbbVie to come third or fourth to market in that population. Essentially, the medical need was met for those patients. So we were testing a different hypothesis, and that hypothesis specifically was whether PARP inhibition would augment DNA-damaging chemotherapy; that the first hit, if you will, didn't have to be genetic, that it could from that DNA-damaging chemotherapy. We've now seen across a couple of studies that that hasn't played out in the way we had initially envisioned. We see that in the triple-negative breast cancer neoadjuvant study and in the squamous non-small cell lung cancer study. And so, while that's not the result we had hoped for, we knew going in that this was a higher-risk, higher-reward sort of approach, and that the evidence while reasonable, from a preclinical and early clinical perspective, isn't entirely predictive in this setting. And so we knew that it was going to take Phase 3 data to answer the question. We've seen the first two readouts, and those studies did not meet their primary endpoint. With respect to ongoing work, we have ongoing studies, some of which will read out very soon. So we can't speculate about what those results might be, but we will complete the ongoing studies and update you on the progress as soon as possible.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea - AbbVie, Inc.: Thanks, Vamil.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. [Operation Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'm you may now begin.
Elizabeth Shea: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I want to remind you that some statements made today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie's operations is included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll briefly discuss our fourth quarter performance and our 2016 operational highlights. Mike will then provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D efforts, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2017 guidance in more detail. As always following our remarks, we'll have an opportunity to take your questions. We delivered another strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share coming at the upper end of our guidance range, despite an unexpected negative impact of foreign exchange, demonstrating the strength of our overall business. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 represented growth of 6.2% into the fourth quarter of 2015. Our performance in the quarter taps off another excellent year for AbbVie, for the full year we delivered more than 13% global operational sales growth and we increased our ongoing earnings per share by more than 12%. In 2016, we drove strong commercial, operational and R&D execution, resulting in industry leading performance on both the top and bottom lines. AbbVie's EPS growth for 2016 ranks us among the top growth companies within our industry. We saw exceptional growth in HUMIRA, which drove 16% global operational growth in the year, including U.S. growth of 24% and international operational growth of 4.3%. Despite increase in competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA remains the clear market leader and continues to perform very well across the rheumatology, dermatology in GI markets. We also saw strong momentum in growth to IMBRUVICA with full year 2016 sales in excess of $1.8 billion, a 67% increase over the prior year. We're continuing to drive strong uptake in CLL, our market segment that represents the largest revenue contributor IMBRUVICA's growth over our long-range plan, and major growth opportunity for the Company. We also continue to advance our clinical development efforts in other blood cancers, supporting robust long-term growth of the brand. Further expansion into NHL and other indications represents another major growth driver of IMBRUVICA. We continue to remain excited about the vast potential for this unique asset. Global Viekira performance which was below our original expectations generated over $1.5 billion in the year, and we had continued strong performance from other products within our portfolio. Over the past year, we've seen significant pipeline advancement and achieved a number of important developments and regulatory milestones. We've received approvals for several assets IMBRUVICA and first-line CLL including a label with overall survival data Venclexta and relapsed/refractory CLL with patients with 17p deletion; Zinbryta for relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis; and HUMIRA for uveitis, our 10th HUMIRA indication in U.S. We successfully completed registrational studies and submitted regulatory application for a number of key pipeline assets, including our pan-genotypic, next generation HCV therapy and IMBRUVICA in marginal zone lymphoma which received FDA approval last week. We also reported compelling data from several mid-and late-stage development programs that Mike is going to discuss in just a few moment. The progress we made with our pipeline including the data we share over the past year has further increased our level of confidence and de-risked many of our key R&D programs. Nemours assets in our late stage pipeline have the opportunity to generate multibillion dollar peak year sales and represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. We expect to see a significant number of regulatory and clinical mile stones for these assets in 2017, which again Mike will discuss in more detail. In 2016, we also augmented our portfolio and our pipeline through strategic licensing and acquisition activity. In June, we completed our acquisition of Stemcentrx, providing AbbVie an exciting late stage asset in Rova-T as well as the highly attractive discovery and early development platform. Rova-T represents a significant market opportunity as we advance in the first-line small cell lung cancer and other indications. In addition to Rova-T, the acquisition of Stemcentrx also brought with it a pipeline of additional clinical development programs, including four additional novel compounds currently in human trials, covering solid tumor from small lung cancer to ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer among other. We announced the collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop and commercialize risankizumab, an anti-IL 23 monoclonal antibody that has the potential to be a transformative therapy in a number of immune mediated diseases. We've entered 2017 with strong momentum, and we're committed to delivering strong results. Our full year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $5.44 to $5.54 positioned AbbVie to be among the industries leaders for EPS growth once again this year. We also continue to track towards delivering our long-term objectives, which will generate double digit EPS growth on average through 2012, putting AbbVie in a very tough of our peer group. So, in summary, we're pleased with our execution and performance, and we delivered an outstanding return of our shareholders. We've also demonstrated a strong track record of managing and overcoming challenges while still delivering on our expectations. We've established sustainable leadership positions in some of the largest and most attractive market segments, and we've built the compelling de-risk pipeline within these areas, which is poised to fuel long term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. In 2016, we significantly advanced and de-risked our pipeline and achieved a number of important regulatory mile stones. And we expect 2017 to be a very productive year as well with a potential for several regulatory submissions and approvals. Key data read outs and important phase transitions. Today, I'll highlight recent pipelines updates and discuss some of the mile stones we anticipate in the year to come. I'll start with oncology, an area where we are advancing our pipeline in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In the area of hematologic oncology, we continue to make significant progress with both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta. Since our last earnings call at the end of October, we along with our partner Janssen received approval for test of IMBRUVICA, as a chemotherapy free option for patients with marginal zone lymphoma who have failed prior therapies. With the approval coming two months ahead of the PDUFA date, this marks the seventh FDA approval and fifth major indication for IMBRUVICA. Currently, there are no other approved therapies specifically indicated for MZL, making IMBRUVICA the first FDA-approved treatment for this disease. We also received conditional approval of Venclexta in Europe for the treatment of CLL patients with the 17p deletion or TP53 mutation, as well as in CLL patients who have failed the chemotherapy and a B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor regardless of their mutational status. We along with our partner Roche Genentech are pleased to be able bring this new treatment option to patients in more countries around the world. At the recent ASH meeting, we presented data from 25 abstracts evaluating use of our portfolio blood cancer medicines. This included results from several studies to valuating IMBRUVICA across a number of hematology malignancies including long-term data in patients with CLL showing at nearly 9 out of 10 patients achieved complete or partial response at the five year mark. These data demonstrate the promise that IMBRUVICA holds as a CLL treatment that can offer a long-term progression free and overall survival. In addition, we presented favorable efficacy and safety data in two common types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma as well as new Phase 2 data in marginal zone lymphoma demonstrating the nearly half of patients with relapsed/refractory MCL respond to treatment with IMBRUVICA. And we also presented data in chronic graft versus host disease demonstrating complete or partial response in two-thirds of patients. For Venclexta, we presented data in a range of tumor types including Phase 1 safety and efficacy data in both, AML and multiple myeloma as well as results from mid-stage studies in follicular lymphoma and diffused large B-cell lymphoma. This coming year, there will be several key data readouts from our hematologic/oncology portfolio that could enable registration of both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta in new indications. For IMBRUVICA, we anticipate data from an interim analysis in front-line mantle cell lymphoma later this year as well as additional potential interim analysis in other forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Later this quarter, we expect to submit our U.S. regulatory application for the use of IMBRUVICA in patients with chronic graft versus host disease who failed prior systemic therapy. Chronic GVHD is a serious and debilitating complication of stem cell or bone marrow transplantation and with no approved therapies for the disease, there is a significant unmet medical need. We are also making progress in a number of important studies evaluating IMBRUVICA monotherapy and combination therapy versus regimen such as BR and FCR, often considered the gold standards in the treatment of CLL. In addition, studies are being run in different patient segments including young and fit patients and the watch and wait population. The results of these studies will add significantly to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA, providing physicians more evidence of its compelling clinical benefits in the front-line setting. For Venclexta, we're expecting data from the MURANO study later this year, which we believe will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL. Last year, we received approval for Venclexta's first indication as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL and the 17p deletion mutation, a small but medically important segment of the CLL market and an important first step for this exciting new treatment. Also last year, Venclexta received its third breakthrough therapy designation for use in untreated AML patients who are ineligible to receive standard induction with high-dose chemotherapy, and we recently began our Phase 3 program in AML. We look forward to additional data readouts and regulatory approvals for Venclexta in the coming years. I'll now turn to our solid tumor programs where we continue to make good progress with our late stage programs for Rova-T, Veliparib and ABT-414 as well as with our early stage oncology pipeline. In the Rova-T program, we expect to report data from the TRINITY study in the second half of the year with regulatory submission following soon thereafter. Additionally, in the latter part of the year, there is the potential for initial data from our basket study where we are evaluating Rova-T in a number of neuroendocrine tumors. We're also making good progress advancing new Stemcentrx assets into the clinic. As we expect to see up to four additional novel assets enter the clinic this year, adding to our portfolio of five clinical stage Stemcentrx program already underway. We've also continued to make progress with our other pipeline assets targeting solid tumors including our PARP inhibitor, Veliparib and ABT-414 an antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme. In 2017, we are expecting to see data from three Phase 3 studies of Veliparib, conducted a new neoadjuvant breast cancer in both the squamous and non-squamous forms of non-small cell lung cancer. We are also expecting to see data in the second half of this year for ABT-414 and second line glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. These trial results if positive would support regulatory submissions. In our early stage oncology pipeline, we are continuing to explore new technologies that will extend our reach into the solid tumor market. For example, our next generation immuno-oncology programs are designed to broaden and deepen responses beyond what has been with the first way of IL therapies. We’re using novel approaches including our bispecific technology to elicit T-cell activation in close proximity to tumor cells. Over the next 12 months, we expect to have as many as five next generation immuno-oncology assets in the clinic, which adds to our growing oncology pipeline of more than 35 late preclinical or clinical stage assets. Moving now to our immunology program, where we continue to make great progress with our two late-stage assets, risankizumab and ABT-494, both of which are tracking ahead of our initial development timelines. Risankizumab, our anti-IL 23 monoclonal antibody license from Boehringer Ingelheim has the potential to be a transformative therapy in a number of immune-mediated diseases, by providing best in category efficacy and increased dosing convenience with quarterly administration. Risankizumab is currently in Phase 3 development psoriasis with mid-stage trials ongoing in both Crohn's diseases and psoriatic arthritis. The risankizumab Phase 3 program in psoriasis continues to progress well, and we expect to see data from three of the pivotal studies later this year with commercialization expected in 2019. This year, we will also see a number of additional data readouts and important phase transitions for the risankizumab, including Phase 2 data in Crohn's disease, which is successful with trigger the start of the Phase 3 program later this year as well as Phase 2 data in psoriatic arthritis with Phase 3 studies expected to begin in the first half of 2018. Additionally, we are expecting to begin a Phase 2 study for risankizumab in ulcerative colitis in the second half of the year. Our selective JAK-1 inhibitor, ABT-494, is currently in Phase 3 development for RA and has the potential to be best-in-class with we believe will be an optimized benefit risk profile. This program is progressing ahead of schedule, and we will begin to see some data from the Phase 3 RA program later in the year. We are particularly excited about this assets potential in the difficult-to-treat anti-TNF and adequate responder population, a growing segment of the RA market representing roughly 35% of the biologic treated patient population. The development program for ABT-494 in gastrointestinal disorders is also progressing well, with the Phase 2 study in Crohn's disease ongoing and a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis, getting underway in the third quarter. Data from the Crohn's study should be available in the first half of 2017, with Phase 3 Crohn's studies starting later in the year. We also recently began a Phase 2 study to evaluate our oral selective JAK-1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis, which is expected later in the year. We continue to advance our early stage immunology pipeline as well with clinical programs recently initiated or expected to begin very soon for several key early stage assets, including our RORγt inverse agonists, our anti-TNF-Steroid ADC, our CD-40 antagonist and our JAK BTK inhibitor combination. Moving now to Virology where our emphasis is on addressing the remaining unmet medical need for our pan-genotypic next generation HCV regimen. We believe this objective can be accomplished with our once-daily oral combination of two novel antiviral that has demonstrated cure rates approaching 100% across genotypes with just eight weeks of therapy for the majority of patients. Last month, we filed our regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and Europe. Our U.S. application was submitted under breakthrough designation and the EU submission was granted accelerated assessment. We're on track to launch this new regimen in both the U.S. and EU later in the year, and we're also on track to submit our regulatory application in Japan later this quarter. In the area of women's health we're nearing completion of our Phase 3 program for Elagolix in endometriosis. Later in the year, we expect full data from both Phase 3 endometriosis studies including extension data, and also plan to submit our U.S. regulatory application in the third quarter. We remain excited about this potential new medicine for women with this highly prevalent condition with their few effective treatment options. In addition to endometriosis program, we have Phase 3 studies underway in uterine fibroids, and we anticipate beginning to see data from that program towards the end of this year. And lastly, in the area of neuroscience where we're focused on developing disease modifying therapies to treat neurodegenerative conditions, we recently began Phase 2 study in Alzheimer's disease and PSP with our anti-tau antibody. We see significant potential in tau-based approaches for delaying the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and look forward to one day being able to bring new treatment options to patients with these debilitating conditions. So, in summary, we continue to see significant evolution of our mid-and late-stage pipeline programs over the past year, and 2017 promises to be another very productive year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our fourth quarter and full year performance. Bill?
William Chase: Thanks Mike. This morning, I'll review the highlights of our full year 2016 performance, provide an overview of our fourth quarter, and then walk through our outlook for 2017. We had another year of outstanding performance delivering top and bottom line growth in 2016 that is among the highest in our industry. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.82, up more than 12% compared to 2015. For the full year, adjusted net revenues were $25.6 billion. As you aware in November, we saw a strengthening of the dollar which drove higher than expected negative foreign exchange in the quarter, additionally continued competitive dynamics in the HCV market had an impact on IMBRUVICA sales. As a result, sales for the year and the quarter came in at the lower end of our expected range. Despite these dynamics, full year sales growth was 13.3% on an operational basis, and we exceeded our EPS guidance for the year. Total adjusted net revenues for the fourth quarter were $6.8 billion, up 6.9% operationally excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange. HUMIRA delivered another quarter of strong growth with global sales of $4.3 billion, up 16.2% operationally. In the U.S. HUMIRA sales increased 23.5% compared to the prior year driven by volume growth of roughly 14% plus price. Wholesaler inventories remain below half a month in the quarter. International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.1% on an operational basis and in line with our expectations. For the full year 2016, global HUMIRA sales were $16.1 billion reflecting incremental sales of more than $2 billion. Full year sales of HUMIRA in the U.S. grew more than 24% with mid-teens prescription growth and a contribution from price in the high-single digits. International HUMIRA operational sales growth for the full year was 4.3% consistent with our expectations of mid-single digit growth. Excluding the impact of conditions in Venezuela, operational sales growth for the full year was approximately 7%. We continue to see good growth despite the entry of indirect biosimilar competition in the international markets. This exceptional performance was driven by HUMIRA's overall level of efficacy and safety, long physician experience and continued biologic penetration across disease categories. Its unique product profile and AbbVie's strong commercial execution has made HUMIRA the number one prescribed biologic, and it remains the undisputed market leader despite competition. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the fourth quarter were $511 million, up 49% over the fourth quarter of last year driven by strong prescription growth trends. For the full year, IMBRUVICA sales exceeded $1.8 billion in line with our previously communicated guidance. Global Viekira sales in the fourth quarter were $311 million, down versus the prior year and below our expectations. As we have previously communicated, we have seen market share loss and price erosion due to competitive dynamics within the HCV market. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease grew 26.7% on an operational basis in the quarter, and we also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from Creon which is up nearly 15%. Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter, adjusted gross margin was 81% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly a 150 basis point. In addition, adjusted gross margin reflects 50 basis points of unfavorable impact related to partnership accounting, equalizing for these impacts, the gross margin profile improved by approximately 250 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted R&D was 17.3% of sales in support of ongoing programs in oncology, immunology, HCV and other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 23.9% of sales in the fourth quarter and operating margin profile was impacted by R&D investment related to Stemcentrx and risankizumab as well as the adverse impact to foreign currency, equalizing for these impacts, adjusted operating margin profile improved by 250 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted net interest expense was $251 million and the adjusted tax rate was 20.2% in the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and other specified item was $1.20 up 6.2% year over year. As we look ahead to 2017, we expect full year adjusted EPS of $5.44 to $5.54, reflecting growth of 13.9% at the midpoint. This guidance excludes $0.89 per share of non-cash amortization and other specified items. On the top line, we expect revenue of approximately 10% on an operational basis. Holding exchange rates constant at current levels, we would expect foreign currencies have a 1% unfavorable impact on reported sales growth. Included in our top line guidance, our assumptions for our key products as follows, in 2017 we expect tumor to once again be an important contributor to our performance with mid-to high-teens growth expected in the U.S. Internationally, we are forecasting mid-single digit operational growth, if currencies hold constant with current raters reported growth would be in the low-single digits. For IMBRUVICA, we expect global revenues to AbbVie of greater than $2.4 billion with sales in the U.S. of more than $2 billion. We anticipate global Viekira of approximately $1 billion in 2017, while we are on track to launch our next generation HCV therapy later this year, based on a timing of managed care contracting cycles, we don’t expect to see meaningful sales contributions until 2018. Regarding AndroGel, we are forecasting 2017 sales of roughly $500,000. For Creon, we expect mid-to high-single digit sales growth. For Venclexta, we expect sales of approximately $125,000 million in 2017. As we previously communicated, our initial indication for Venclexta relapsed/ refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion addresses a $300,000 million market where IMBRUVICA currently holds more than 50% of the market share. Between both assets, we will hold a strong market leadership position in this segment. For Lupron, Synagis and Synthroid, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year. Regarding the P&L for 2017, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio roughly flat to 2016 inclusive of the dilutive impact of our partner products on gross margin. We expect 2017 to be a year of significant R&D investment as we provide the appropriate level of funding across our pipeline in order to fuel our future growth. This includes the incremental funding and budget annualization associated with this Stemcentrx and risankizumab programs. As a result, we are forecasting adjusted R&D expense of approximately 17% of sales. We expect adjusted SG&A to approach 21% of sales reflecting the benefit of sales leverage. In 2017 we are forecasting an adjusted operating margin profile of approximately 43% inclusive of the annualization of Stem and BI transactions. We remain committed to achieving the operating margin profile improvements that we have communicated in our long range guidance. We are forecasting adjusted net interest expense of approximately $1 billion for the full year, and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5% to 20% in 2017. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $1.24 and $1.26. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.23 of non-cash amortization and other specified items. We are forecasting revenue growth in the first quarter to approach 10% operationally. Holding exchange rates constant and current levels, we would expect foreign exchange to have unfavorable impact on reported sales growth of approximately 1%. For U.S. HUMIRA, we expect sales growth in the first quarter to exceed 20% over the prior year, and we expect U.S. IMBRUVICA sales in the first quarter to grow in the high-single digits sequentially over the fourth quarter. In closing, we're very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in the quarter and the full year. We've driven strong top tier revenue and EPS growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And we're well positioned for strong growth again in 2017. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we'll take the first question.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Your line now is open.
Jami Rubin: Thank you. I guess my first question is for you, Bill. On operating margins, we didn't see leverage this year in large part because of R&D expenses, and when we think about 2017, continued pressure on R&D as you are making significant investments from the partnership programs. But I think that the Company gave long-term guidance of operating margins approaching 50%. I'm looking at other companies that have a similar mix as you do, like Amgen; they have over 50% operating margins. You are well below that. Can you talk about how we should think about the evolution of operating margins going forward? Because the partnership -- IMBRUVICA will continue to put pressure on gross margins; how we think about that. And R&D as a percentage of sales, should that stay in the 17% of sales range? And how should we think about you guys getting to a 50% operating margin? Because that's a long ways away from where we are right now. Then I have a follow-up question for you, Rick. Just if you could comment on FDA's interchangeability guidance. Anything that surprised you, anything that gives you pause in terms of timing, and in terms of impact to the HUMIRA franchise once biosimilars come to the market. Thanks.
William Chase: On your operating margin question, first of all, I think we've made enormous progress on operating margin, if you look at where we've come since spin-off, and we certainly did last year in the third quarter -- or I'm sorry, 2015 in the third quarter communicate our intent to hit 50% by 2020. Everything as we look at it right now is still on that plan. Obviously, we're in the process of pulling the other new LRP, and we're going to look at it again, but that's our goal as a management team and we certainly are constructing a path to get there. If you look at '17 relative to '16, we're showing improvement. We had said in our long range guidance that we'd anticipate 100 to 200 basis improvements per year; it is true in '17 we're coming up a little shot of that. But you've to recognize that the annualization of Stem and BI as well as the required investment on those programs has pretty much added about a 120 basis points of dilution. So, if you back that out we would back within that range and what we communicated back at the end of '16 before we did Stem and BI. So, we think it's -- the base business is showing the right level of performance, and obviously we're having the opportunity to invest in those two very important programs and still deliver operating margin expansion. So, we're quite pleased with the number in '17. In terms of how we get to 2020 target of 50%, you have to recognize that we first and foremost have the royalty stack on HUMIRA rolling off, that will have impact on the P&L in '18 and '19, just as we've communicated before but to remind you that royalty stack is 5% to 6% of global HUMIRA sales to one-third of the stack disappears at the end of '17 with P&L benefit in '18, two-thirds at the end of '18, P&L benefit in '19. So that will give you some idea of how that flows in, and then we are always committed to driving more efficient supply chain. We're enjoying those benefits right now and we have enjoyed them since then as well as other cost containment programs. We have pretty I'd say strong targets internally to deliver on those, and then finally you can't overlook the importance of sales leverage across this P&L. Most notably '18 and beyond as we start launching new products, and we start getting the full indication to lead Venclexta, and again obviously HUMIRA in the U.S., we anticipate growth throughout that period. So, when you add all of those things up, even despite partnership accounting which we think will present about 200 basis points of drag. We feel that we got enough positives in the mix to drive that share -- of that operating margin profile goal.
Richard Gonzalez: Good morning, Jamie, it's Rick. So, interchangeability, I think as we all know the FDA has communicated for some time that they were going to come out with this guidance by the end of '16, so I think the timing of it was, was as expected. We got a chance to go through it, I think it clearly reflects that interchangeability is a higher standard than biosimilarity, it describes that biosimilars will have to do a three-way switching study between the biosimilar and the innovator, and it strongly suggests that those studies be done with U.S. reference products, as the comparator. I'd also say that FDA devoted a considerable amount of time in the guidance to packaging and the delivery system or the device differences and potentially depending upon what those differences are, it could require a human factor studies in order to demonstrate that there's no significant difference between the biosimilar and the innovator's product. So, I think as we step back and we’re continuing to obviously analyze this, when direct biosimilars come into the marketplace, we’ve said that our strategy will be a strategy that's designed to maintain market share while maximizing the profitability of the brand. That remains the same, and I think unlike small molecules where the erosion curve is really driven by retail pharmacy substitution which is what makes it so challenging. On a small molecule very little or almost none of biologics go through retail pharmacy, they go through and are dispensed through specialty pharmacy where your formulary position is really what dictates what product is dispensed, not the individual pharmacy. So, I don’t think it fundamentally changes that part of the strategy. As far as the competitive dynamics, I think it's too early, I mean we don’t believe based on what we know that any of the single-switch studies they're being done now would meet the standard. But we'll have to see how the competitive dynamics play out as people look at this and start to design programs in order to try to achieve interchangeability and so, and it will need to see how that plays out over time.
Jami Rubin: Can you just, Rick, throw out a guesstimate as to when you would expect an interchangeable biosimilar to be introduced to the market?
Richard Gonzalez: Well that's probably not something I just want to guess on. Yes, obviously, there are significant issues that play through your question. First and foremost, it's one of the biosimilars on the market to begin from a standpoint of our IP protection, and we remain committed to the position that we took back in 2015 that we believe our portfolio of IP will protect HUMIRA within the U.S. until 2022. And so beyond that, it's difficult for me to project based on where we are today, because I am not aware of anyone doing a study that would be compliant with what's described here. That doesn’t mean it does not happen, it's just I am not aware of it.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Jeffrey Holford of Jefferies. Your line now is open.
Jeffrey Holford: Rick, I wonder if you could just comment with your thoughts around pricing exposure for your company with regard to every single time we get a tweet or a comment out the new government here, the new president, your stock does seem to get impacted the most of those amongst your peer group. Can you just talk about what you see as some of the biggest potential issues that could get discussed, whether it's dual eligibles or direct price negotiation and just how exposed you think your company is relative to others? The second question is on IMBRUVICA. Just Q4 just seemed a little light in the U.S. just against the volume trend. Can you just let us know if there's any factor there, like destocking, that impacted in quarter at all? Then just lastly, we are all expecting HUMIRA biosimilars in 2018 -- October 2018, I think is the date that we are mostly all looking at -- but you only give us HUMIRA numbers ex-U.S. So can you just help us at all; geographically, what's the mix of exposure in the territories from 2018 October in what you would expect biosimilars to be in the market ex-US and what percentage you wouldn't? Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: All right. So, Jeff, maybe let me talk a little bit about pricing or reforms in the Affordable Care Act, there obviously are a lot of things out in the environment slowing around but there is not a lot of specificity yet. So, it's probably one difficult and two an appropriate for me to try to speculate on what some other changes might be. I think as we look at our business and the mix of our business, certainly, we are being conscious of pricing our products and way that is responsible and you have seen that. I think what is important for all of us in the innovation pharmaceutical space is to continue to demonstrate the value of the medicines that we have. And in many cases as you know, these medicines actually reduce overall healthcare class and pharmaceuticals are still a relatively more percentage of the overall spend within the healthcares system the Medicare system. Specifically when we look at our business, I think most of our medicines are underpinned by strong evidence base that they're not only clinically very important and very effective, but also provided good economic value proposition for the system itself and we see that in the usage that get and fully socialized systems where they can determine, what products they use into the extent of that they use those systems. You see products like HUMIRA do extremely well in those markets. Additionally, if you look at our business overall, it's not heavily weighted towards Medicare that only about 12% of our total revenues going to Medicare. So, we are not overly, heavily weighted within that sector. But I would say while our goal will be is to continue to advocate for access to innovative medicines for all patients, across all the channels, and I would hope that one of the things that as we look at reforming the Affordable Care Act that we could deal with, is the burden that donor hold and copays put on seniors in the Medicare program because I think that creates a lot of the challenge that we see. So, we'll have to see how it plays out. I mean I think some of the effort in this area I think, will benefit over the long haul that we've to see some more of the details. So, on IMBRUVICA if you actually look at IMBRUVICA, it continues to perform extremely well. And global sales were $511 million in the quarter. The U.S. was 434; that's up about 47% year-over-year. Full year we were above the guidance that we gave, slightly above the guidance we gave of $1.8 billion, that represents 67% growth. If you look at the IMS prescription growth, it's up 38% in the quarter versus the prior year, and if you look quarter-to-quarter it's up about 6%, which we think is more indicative of the growth of the brand. That was if you look at just pure revenue in the two quarters, that was about $15 million or $20 million with a channel or inventory that occurred in the third quarter, the depressed revenues in the fourth quarter. So that's essentially what you see when you look at the sequential growth quarter-to-quarter; as we look at fourth quarter as Bill mentioned in his comments, we're forecasting sequential growth in the high single-digit range -- I'm sorry in the first quarter in the high single-digit range. But it's overall we're very pleased with how IMBRUVICA is going, it continues to track where we had hoped or slightly ahead. So, we're very comfortable with IMBRUVICA. And then you're last question is on the mix of biosimilar impact outside the U.S., actually for the vast majority of our countries, the fourth quarter of 2018 is the time at which biosimilars will be able to enter the marketplace, and as far as the geographic mix. That'll be driven by the competitors; how they launch, when they get access? Maybe one other things, that would be indicative or least directionally helpful is to look at the biosimilars that are in the marketplace today. So, if you look at the Remicade biosimilar, I think they're in about 66 countries today, at least 50 countries have reimbursement or pricing for those biosimilars. They have about just under 5% of the overall market and they have about just under 25% of the molecule share, after being on the market for several years. If we look at the Enbrel biosimilar which has only been in the market for a shorter period of time; today they're approved in about 34 countries, they're pricing in 19 countries -- pricing reimbursement in 19 countries. The latest data says that they had just over 3% share of the overall category and about 14% or 15% share of the molecule. So, I think directionally that gives you a feel for how it will probably roll out, that's consistent with what we had assumed when we provided guidance back in 2015 when we described to you what we thought the erosion curve would look like. We continue to monitor this and we feel comfortable with what erosion curve continues to look like.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line now is open.
Chris Schott: Great, thanks so much for the question, just had two here. First, can you elaborate on your HUMIRA volume expectations in the U.S. for 2017? It looks like another very strong year of growth again. Can you talk a little bit about price versus volume mix? And then which indications in particular are driving the growth for this year? My second question was a higher level one on immunology. You obviously have a very significant position with HUMIRA. You've got two important late-stage assets with the JAK and the IL-23, but it does seem like the competitive pressures in this space are growing. We've got new mechanisms. We've got biosimilars ex-US. We've got what seems like increased payer focus on the category. So how do you see that all playing out going forward? And do you think there's any risk that we see something similar happen here that has happened to diabetes, where we get more restricted formularies, we get more intense competition among the various players? I guess some high-level thoughts on how you see that space playing out. Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. So, maybe I'll cover most of this and then Bill you can talk a little bit about the mix. I mean, if you look at HUMIRA maybe first on the competitive standpoint, this has been a highly competitive category for us quite some time. I mean I think there's something like 14 different mechanism, there were 10 or so for the last four or five years. It's really driven by -- the growth in this category is really driven by the performance of the brand, the breadth of the brand, the safety and efficacy of the brand, and the overall growth in biologic penetration that the underlying market continues to grow. I don't see those dynamics changing. Certainly, there's been a lot of discussion around the competitive nature of this market. We certainly operate in a competitive environment. We work very closely with payers to ensure that we’re striking the right balance. We've obviously negotiated all of our managed care contracts for 2017 and maybe even for 2018 as well, so I don’t see anything on the horizon today that would give me pause as to the fundamental trajectory of HUMIRA, and as I step back, the U.S. where we probably have the best market share data. If you look at our market share overall it's increased slightly, rheumatology has increased the most and it’s the largest category, we're up about a half a point overall. In rheumatology, we're roughly flat in derm and GI. One of the most important leading indicators for your growth is what your first line share is doing. So, if you look at RA, our first line share's about 40%, if you look at psoriasis as an example our first line share, if you include Otezla, it's just under 40%, And if you exclude Otezla which really competes in the mild to moderate, not where we compete then it’s just under 60%. So, very significant first-line share, and then if you look at GI between Crohn's and UC, our first-line share is about 55%. And so we continue to see very strong performance based on both our execution and obviously the performance of the brand. So, I'd say we have a high level of confidence in how HUMIRA's going to perform going forward. Bill, anything you want to add?
William Chase: So, Chris, picking up from there, obviously our guidance on HUMIRA in the U.S. is mid-high-teens and I think the way you want to think about that is continued volume in low double digits, high single digits. Price will have more of an impact earlier in the year and that's why we are guiding first quarter above 20% and then but we expect that volume to remain low double digit throughout the year.
Operator: Thank you. Next question is from Marc Goodman of the UBS. Your line now is open.
Marc Goodman: In the past you've talked about the amount of SG&A spend you have done on HUMIRA. Can you just give us an update on where that is for 2016? And then second, for M&A, Stemcentrx was a platform deal. Are you looking for more platform-type deals or should we be expecting more of these BI one-off type product deals as you look at M&A this year? Thanks.
Michael Severino: So, Marc, I'll pick up SG&A on HUMIRA. There is really the nothing about that business that has been negative and we will lead us to pull back on SG&A. Now, obviously, we are thoughtful, when we had the discussion about SG&A on HUMIRA, we said that largely the required base was in place. Obviously, though, we do have things like merit, inflation those sorts of things when we are always looking for ways to make our spent more efficient, but there is nothing about that the performance of the brand that will pull back on SG&A. I think it's also important to recognize that we have a pretty sophisticated rigorous process of evaluating ROI on every one of our SG&A program, and certainly if you look at the growth that HUMIRA has contributed in the quarter and the year and forecasted in 2017. And you can see why we will be confident that ROI is still holding up and that investment as wise.
Richard Gonzalez: As far as transactions or acquisitions or licensing opportunities, I mean you continue to active, but as we said when we did the Stem transaction for the next year or half from that point we said we wouldn’t be looking for any kind of platform any kind of transaction it would be more individual products. I mean what really drives our efforts here is the strategy we have within each one of the verticals. We have a very specific set of price area would an each one of those verticals of assets that we are looking for. And as we signed those kinds of opportunities then obviously we purse those opportunities it’s a today we don’t view that we need any kind of a platform play or technology within any of those verticals and so I think you can assume more individual products whether they be straight at acquisition or such structure that is more similar today to the IL23 transaction that we did. I think that’s what you should expect.
Operator: Next question is from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open.
Gregg Gilbert: Rick, back on the subject of price, we are hoping you could clarify whether your pledge to stick to single-digit price increases also means just one per year. And do you agree with some of your peers' beliefs that the U.S. system is broken as it relates to the subject of list price versus actual net price growth? And shifting over to Mike, I was hoping you could share a little bit more color about your Phase 2 Alzheimer's compound. I realize it's early, but when will you learn something more meaningful that would inform your willingness to move it ahead? Is it final Phase 2 data or are there other sort of key break points within then that we could hear about in the next year or two? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: So on price as I communicated in our talk at JPMorgan's convention, we will only do one price per year and all brands will be under double digit so all increases will be single-digits and so we'll only do one. So we've obviously done one our rate on most assets and that will be it for the remainder of the year. On the system been broken, if you look at this -- I don't know if the system is broken, I think the perception that list price increases are what the -- is what gets passed along to the patients in the way of cost, it -- I mean clearly that is not the case. Very little of our revenue goes at list price. I mean it's a tiny-tiny percentage. But there're other people along the value chain who obviously participate in the overall cost of the system, and so the follow through of any increase is usually much lower than the overall increase and so I think it is a misconception that many people take when they look at list price increases whether they're ours or anybody else's that those are reflective of what the brand is actually being able to achieve in the marketplace, so I think that's just the reality of the system.
Michael Severino: With respect to our Phase 2 in Alzheimer's disease, we're very excited about this program which is our anti-tau antibody and tau is a protein that is very tightly correlated to dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, and our antibody is thought to block the spreading of this pathology through the brain, and so we think it holds great promise as potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. We just started Phase 2 right now basically and so it's going to take a bit of time before we get to meaningful data readouts. I think that the way we've designed the study, there are a number of opportunities for us to see data along the way. So, we can learn meaningful things certainly before we get to the end of a large Phase 2 study, but I think it's too early today to predict when along the course of that study that might be. Obviously, it's a program that we're going to be focused on and we're going to drive as quickly as possible.
Operator: Next question is from Geoff Meacham of Barclays. Your line now is open.
Geoff Meacham: Sticking with the pipeline, Mike, just had a few for you. Can you give us some perspective on Elagolix? Just based on the extension study, what do you think the real world duration of therapy may be? Then just back to the tau program. I saw on the trial design that there's a screen for beta-amyloid by PET scan. Are you guys also looking at tau imaging in that study? Does that have much value, in your view? And then you mentioned tau being the marker of disease progression. I wanted to get your perspective on looking at tau as the marker versus beta-amyloid. And some would argue that time a patient sees tau accumulation, they may be too far gone, but I wanted to get your thoughts on that. Thanks.
Michael Severino: With respect to Elagolix, the ultimate duration of therapy is going to be part of the regulatory discussion and labeling discussion around that molecule, so I think it's early to predict an exact duration, but we have an extensive clinical trials program, one that included both extension studies for a longer duration of therapy and off treatment periods. So, we believe that will have the datasets to optimally support strong duration of therapy at the time of launch, and we're also pursuing post-launch Phase 3B programs to further extend both that data set and ultimately to extend duration of therapy, we believe through our approaches such as our add-back program. So, I think, it's early today to give you a concrete answer, but I think we're going to have the data to support the duration of therapy. Turning to the tau study, the a-beta imaging in that protocol is necessary to ensure that the patients who are enrolled in the study do in fact have Alzheimer's disease, and we know that if one doesn't take that measure that there are other forms of dementia that look clinically similar to Alzheimer's disease that could be enrolled essentially in error. Those patients wouldn't be expected to benefit from the therapy aimed at Alzheimer's pathology, and so that's the rule there, it's a little bit different than the response biomarkers that are being incorporated in our trial and in many others in the Alzheimer's field. We have a range of biomarkers in our program and a range of clinical measures that we think will allow us to interrogate this and those include imaging markers. We think we're going to have the data set to make a decision out of this trial. With respect to the correlation of tau with neuronal dysfunction, what we know about a-beta and tau is that the pattern of the pathology is different between the two. A-beta pathology peaks very early and is essentially stable at the time that disease progression occurs. It also doesn't correlate particularly well with the area of the brain that exhibits dysfunction. What we know about tau is the rise in tau pathology tracks much more closely with both neuronal dysfunction and clinical symptoms making, it very tightly linked in time to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. It's also very tightly linked in space with respect to the progression of Alzheimer's disease. So, there are these regional variants where you have different regions in the brain that are primarily affected and if you look at a-beta in those patients, the distribution of a-beta is essentially unchanged across them, but if you look at tau, tau pathology is most permanent in the areas where there is neuronal dysfunction. So, we think that those data will indicate a strong role of time for tau and a strong role for our mechanism. Ultimately of course the Phase 2 study and downstream studies will answer those questions definitively.
Operator: Next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line now is open.
Mark Schoenebaum: Thanks for taking my question. First, big thanks to Liz and the team for all the help she gave, in my absence, to my team. Really appreciate that, Liz. My question -- and I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks. But just for rest of world HUMIRA, would it be possible for you to just give us very clearly the quarter-on-quarter, that is sequential, volume change as well as the quarter-on-quarter, that is sequential, 3Q versus 4Q, change in price? And then this was sort of covered in the last -- in some ways in the last questions. But on the U.S. side, you have obviously, as you said earlier in response to a question, you have committed to limiting gross price increases for HUMIRA. I'm wondering how, in a general sense, we should think about trends for the gross to net that is the discounting that occurs. Would that be expected to rise, fall, stay the same? Maybe help us think through that over the next couple years in this new pricing environment. And if you are willing to, can you give us the average gross to net for 2016? Thank you. In the U.S.
William Cha: So, Mark, it's Bill Chase. I will start with sequential questions on HUMIRA. Price was pretty flat sequentially rest of world. Volume was up about 2% rest of world. So, the numbers were pretty good.
Richard Gonzalez: I think on gross demand I mean we have never communicated the growth in that before and for competitive reasons we just don’t think that’s something it's appropriate for us to communicate Mark. As far as trends are concern as we indicated I think it was in the third quarter call. We have negotiated all of our managed care contracts for '17. And there was not a significant change or I would say very good change in the gross to net, between those two. Some of those are both '17 and '18 and some are just '17. So, I would say there is relative stability in gross to net going forward, at least for the next year and half two years I'll say. Obviously the environment can change, but that’s the view of it right now. As you go back to the OUS, as you look it sequentially, I think we had this discussion maybe a year or so ago I remember. Outside the U.S. because there are tenders in certain places where, the quarters can jump along quite a bit. And so sequential growth quarter-to-quarter sometime is not a very good indicator of the overall growth of the brand in time. So that’s the only caution I have. If you try to understand or they how is it actually performing in the back drop of the bio similar which maybe what you are trying to understand. I essentially gave to an earlier question, some of the latest biosimilar data. The latest date that we have of the three month market share for the biosimilars, they had a very modest impact thus far. And we would expect that to continue going forward. If you look at our international HUMIRA business in 2016 and you just out the onetime impact for Venezuela for the devaluation of Venezuela. As Bill said in his comments, the brand is going from a revenue standpoint about 7%. If you actually look at volume is probably two points higher than that. So, high single digit volume growth and that’s indicative of what we are seeing across most major markets where we operate, in the back drop of having Remicade and Enbrel biosimilars in many of those markets.
Operator: Next question is from Geoffrey Porges of Leerink Partners. Your line now is open.
Geoffrey Porges: Bill, could you just give us a sense of your current cash position and the US/OUS cash? And then, in light of the suggestions about tax and sort of thing, have you flexibility to move manufacturing or any of your assets back to the U.S.? And is that something that you've contemplated as you are going through the proposals?
William Chase: Sure. So, at the end of the quarter we had about $8 billion of cash, and I think it's always safe to assume the vast majority that is overseas given that to hold cash in the U.S. under current tax paradigm is somewhat on economical to us. So, we try to keep that cash offshore. In terms of our ability to manufacture in the event that there is a tax paradigm that favors U.S. manufacturing, look, if you look at our manufacturing assets mostly our HUMIRA, which is the main point of I believe your question. We've got manufacturing facilities in the U.S., the original plant the HUMIRA was manufactured is out in Massachusetts. We also have manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico. So, obviously, we'd have to look closely to whether Puerto Rico is considered part of the U.S., which we obviously think it should be, but if that was the case then it would really be no requirement to move our supply chain around drastically.
Operator: Next question is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Your line now is open.
David Risinger: So, I have a couple of questions, some of these topics were discussed. But first, Rick, I was hoping that you could just paint a picture for us for HUMIRA patent litigation to watch ahead and how we should think about it. Just what some of the key inflection points are to watch? And I'm talking about litigation here, not the IPRs. I think everybody is pretty clear on the IPR actions that are forthcoming in late spring/early summer. Second, with respect to the tau antibody, I believe that the Phase 2 that you have discussed as having just started completes in 2020, that it's scheduled to complete in 2020. I just wanted to confirm that and I think you mentioned that there could be an interim assessment, but wanted to confirm the timing for that Phase 2 conclusion. And then finally, with respect venetoclax, could you just provide the fourth-quarter sales? Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: So, Dave, this is Rick. Because we're in the active phase of litigation now, obviously I can't provide you a lot of color on how that will proceed, I mean obviously we're actively involved with Amgen on that litigation; you see now publicly when the trial date is scheduled for, which was consistent with the timeline that I think we discussed when we provided the longer term guidance, and so I think it's tracking on a path that ultimately is consistent with what are expectations were. And obviously as others file, we'll be going through a process with them, which will be somewhat similar to the Amgen process and we'll have to see as that plays out but nothing that I can give you color on. On the IPRs although you said excluding the IPRs, I guess the one thing I would point out on the IPR, it's just -- it's another form of this, right. We've had two IPRs now on some of our formulation patterns, broad formulation patterns; we were successful and prevailed on those. We've two more that are coming up now on method-of-use patents in the RA area, some of our method-of-use patents in RA are being challenged. I think one thing that's important for investors to understand, the strategy that we have in place is not one that hinges on one or two patents. I mean at the end of the day we have a portfolio patents, and its 110, and it is that portfolio patents that provides us confidence that ultimately we can protect the position which HUMIRA based on all the innovation that we've done and the investment we've made in HUMIRA that's a very broad portfolio of IP that protects it. And so regardless of which way the IPRs go this strategy is not hinged on one or two patents. So that will play out over the course of this year and the rest of the litigation will continue to play out, but I think that's important perspective for investors to have.
Michael Severino: With respect to the Phase 2 study for our tau antibody program, the completion date that would be listed on clinicaltrials.gov is the date in which the study would conclude, if it went out to the final analysis. With the Phase 2 study such as this one, there are opportunities to learn along the way as I mentioned a bit earlier. There are interim assessments. It's too early today to predict the exact timing of those assessments. But there will be opportunities along the way between today and that 2020-2022 timeframe for us to learn a lot more about the tau program and obviously as we learn more we’ll communicate better.
Richard Gonzalez: On venetoclax, I think it’s probably more indicative to look at the overall revenue so far in 2016. It was roughly $20 million, so relatively modest and I think there are couple of factors that you have to think through there, as Bill mentioned in his comments this is a 17p deletion is a relatively small market it's about $300 million, today IMBRUVICA between 50% and 60% of that market so other asset has a very significant share position. In addition when you start patients up because you set them up in dose, the initial month or so therapy is at a reduced cost because of the way the product is priced because it's priced on a milligram basis, and so essentially you step the patients through. So, when you're in the early phase of starting patients up then you generate less revenue because you're taking them through the start up phase. If you look at where we are right now our exit share was about a little over 20% or so, 20-22%. So the combined share between IMBRUVICA and venetoclax is significant obviously in this segment and we’re starting 80-90 patients a month on average roughly.
Operator: Thank you. Your last question is from Chris Raymond of Raymond James. Your line now is open.
Chris Raymond: Just another pipeline question, maybe for Mike, on veliparib, so just curious; the literature paints maybe a less certain role for PARP inhibition in indications like lung than, say, ovarian cancer. And this year I think your first pivotal data is likely in lung. You've got squamous and non-squamous trials reading out. I wonder if you could maybe comment on that and maybe help expectations as these readouts happen. The preclinical potency data seems to suggest that other PARPs are maybe more potent than your molecule and I think I've detected a decent amount of discount assigned to veliparib by investors because of that. I wonder if you could maybe comment on that dynamic as well. Thanks.
Michael Severino: Okay, so with respect to veliparib, as you point out the role for PARP inhibition in germline carriers of BRCA mutations would be either breast cancer or ovarian is really quite clear. And of course veliparib is registered based on single-arm studies in BRCA germline carriers. We have chosen to follow a different development path, specifically because we didn’t think it made a lot of sense for us to take our PARP and try to follow other into relatively a small although medically important indications like those BRCA germline carriers, that not need had already been met in our view. So, we are testing a different hypothesis. We are testing the hypothesis that first hit doesn’t have to come from a germline mutation, that in the setting of DNA damaging chemotherapy particularly platinum-based therapy. The role of DNA repair mechanisms become more important and that PARP inhibition may have an effect. Now, there is still preclinical rationale for this. The Phase 2 data were supportive of it, but it really is that Phase 3 question to answer, and so we have broad phase 2 program that will begin to readout over the course of this year. And the read out this year will be in a couple of areas neoadjuvant breast cancer as well as in two non-small cell lung cancer studies. So, we will start to see over the course of this year whether that broader hypothesis is going to play out. We do also have a study in ovarian cancer that study is just not as advanced as the non-small cell lung cancer study. With respect to potency, I think it's very hard to determine whether preclinical potency assays such as the ones that have been used for PARPs are going to translate into the clinic. Potency can vary based on assay conditions and number of other factors, and we believe the clinical activity is ultimately what will define the role of these PARP inhibitors. And in our early phase studies, we saw good single-agent activity in line with the degree of PARP inhibition that we would have hoped to have achieved.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. [Operation Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elizabeth Shea: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I want to remind you that some statements made today are or may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.

AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Gonzalez: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning I'll discuss our third quarter performance, recent operational highlights, and I'll also share some high-level perspective regarding our growth profile for 2017. Mike will then provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will provide additional color on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of this year. 2016 is shaping up to be another very strong year, with operational revenue growth year-to-date of nearly 16% and EPS growth through three quarters of 14.6%. This follows a very strong 2015, where we delivered operational revenue growth of 22% and EPS growth of 29%. Based on our confidence in the performance of the business going forward, today we'll provide a view of 2017 which will once again demonstrate strong underlying performance. Our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, representing growth of 7.1% versus the third quarter of 2015. Our results included global operational sales growth of 8%, reflecting continued strong performance from our on-market business, led by HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, as well as other products in our portfolio. HUMIRA continues to drive robust performance, delivering global operational growth of more than 12% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across the three major market segments. In rheumatology, HUMIRA continues to hold the number one market share position with year-over-year share gains. In dermatology, we're seeing mid-teens volume growth, and we're maintaining a very strong number one market share position with a 15-point lead over the number two competitor. And in GI, we continue to see strong double-digit volume growth. Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its strong position, despite indirect biosimilar competition, which is tracking in line with our expectations. We also continue to deliver on our oncology strategy. IMBRUVICA's performance in the quarter was outstanding, with third quarter global revenues to AbbVie of just over $500 million. We're continuing to drive strong uptake in CLL. In the second-line-plus-CLL market, we continue to hold the leadership position, with more than four of 10 patients starting treatment with IMBRUVICA. And in the front-line setting, our market share position is steadily increasing, with nearly one out of five patients now starting IMBRUVICA as first-line therapy. While we're pleased with this performance, we're still in the very early stages of our trajectory in the front-line setting. We're making progress in a number of important comparative and combination studies, evaluating IMBRUVICA monotherapy and combination therapy versus regimens such as BR and FCR, often considered the gold standards in the treatment of CLL. These studies are being run in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population. And the results will add significantly to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA and will provide physicians with more evidence of the compelling clinical benefit in the front-line setting. Additionally, in other approved indications, including mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenstrom's, IMBRUVICA holds the market-leading position in the relapsed/refractory segments. In geographies outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience strong adoption in Europe and Canada and has recently been launched in several new markets, including Japan. While CLL clearly represents the largest revenue contributor to IMBRUVICA's growth over our long-range plan, new indications will also augment our performance. To that end, there is potential for several IMBRUVICA regulatory submissions and approvals over the next few years, including relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma, which is currently under regulatory review; chronic graft-versus-host disease, which we expect to submit for approval in the first half of 2017; front-line mantle cell lymphoma, which will add to our existing indication in relapsed/refractory MCL; as well as relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and front line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For several of these indications, IMBRUVICA will be the only approved treatment, underscoring the importance of this therapy for patients. Collectively, these new IMBRUVICA indications represent a significant incremental revenue opportunity for AbbVie. Mike will provide an update regarding some upcoming data flow for several of these potential new indications. Earlier this year, we received approval for Venclexta monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL who harbor the 17p deletion, a relatively small subset of the refractory patient population. In partnership with Roche/Genentech, we're continuing to make good progress with our launch within this indication, with Venclexta now added to the NCCN guidelines and continued progress with formulary access. Physicians are gaining experience with the therapy, and we look forward to additional data next year in the broader relapsed/refractory setting. We also saw a strong performance from several other products in our on-market portfolio, including Duodopa, Creon, and international Viekira. In addition to our strong financial results, we have continued to advance our late-stage pipeline. Last week, at the ASRM meeting, we presented positive data on Elagolix in endometriosis, including additional results from our two pivotal studies. Results from these trials will support our U.S. regulatory application, which is on track for submission in 2017. We're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV combination, which is on track for commercialization next year. Based on the data we've shared to date, we believe our next-generation HCV therapy will address the remaining unmet medical needs within this market, with high SVR rates across genotypes with eight weeks of therapy. We're making good progress with the risankizumab program, which is in development in partnership with BI. We recently completed, ahead of schedule, patient enrollment for the pivotal studies in psoriasis, with data from three of these trials expected in 2017. We recently launched ZINBRYTA, for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and are in the early stages of our rollout in collaboration with Biogen. And we've also continued to advance assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. We recently started a basket study evaluating Rova-T in several neuroendocrine tumors where DLL3 is expressed. And we also initiated a regimen selection study for Rova-T in front-line small-cell lung cancer. Based on our performance year-to-date, we're raising our full-year 2016 guidance to $4.80 to $4.82 on an adjusted basis, reflecting growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. Over the past several months, we've received a lot of interest regarding our expectations for 2017. While we're in the midst of our annual planning process, based on the continued strength of the business and especially HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we're now at a point where we can provide some high-level direction regarding our top and bottom line growth expectations for 2017. We expect low-double-digit operational growth in 2017. 2017 will be another important year of investment in R&D, as we expand our leadership position in immunology and hematological oncology and also build our position in solid tumors. As a result, we expect EPS growth of roughly 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. We'll outline our detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Since our inception in 2013, we've delivered strong financial results, and we're well-positioned to deliver industry-leading growth again in 2017 for the third consecutive year. We continue to be proud of our strong execution, and we remain committed to our long-term strategic and financial objectives, which we outlined for you in October of 2015. AbbVie represents a unique investment opportunity, offering both compelling growth, along with a strong return of capital to investors, including a rapidly growing dividend. To that end, today we announced our board of directors declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 per share to $0.64 per share, an increase of over 12%, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2017. We view the dividend as an important aspect of our investment identity and as a sign of our confidence in the business going forward. Since the company's inception in 2013, AbbVie has increased its dividend by more than 60%. In summary, the strategy we've put in place puts news a position to deliver strong top and bottom line performance. We've established growth platforms in some of the largest and most attractive segments, and we've built a compelling pipeline in these areas, which will contribute significantly to our performance in the years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. Once again, we had a very productive quarter in R&D, with significant progress across a number of programs. Today, I'll highlight key pipeline events that occurred during the quarter, as well as some of our upcoming milestones. I'll start with oncology, an area where we are advancing our pipeline in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Turning our attention to solid tumors, we continue to make good progress with Rova-T. We recently began enrolling patients in two new studies, a Phase I, eight-arm basket study in a broad set of narrow endocrine tumors, and a Phase 1/2 regimen-selection study in front-line small-cell lung cancer. We expect to start seeing data from both studies in the second half of next year. The Rova-T program in relapsed/refractory small-cell lung cancer is progressing well. We continue to see good results from the ongoing Phase 1 study, with patients still alive more than two years after receiving just two doses of Rova-T. Enrollment in the TRINITY study, our confirmatory third-line registrational trial in small-cell lung cancer, is also going very well. And we expect the study to be fully enrolled within the next month. Data from TRINITY will be available next year, which will trigger the submission of our regulatory dossiers. We are also on the cusp of starting two additional Rova-T studies, MARU, the Phase 3 registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting, and the Phase 1/2 combination study, evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in small-cell lung cancer. We expect both trials to be up and running by the end of the year. We're also making good progress with other assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. In addition to Rova-T, we have four assets in the clinic and are on track to transition up to five additional programs into the clinic over the next year. This will add to our growing oncology pipeline of more than 35 late preclinical or clinical stage assets. I'll now turn to our hem/onc programs. In the quarter, we announced our U.S. regulatory submission of a Supplemental New Drug Application for the use of IMBRUVICA in previously treated patients with marginal-zone lymphoma, a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which accounts for roughly 12% of NHL cases. There are currently no approved treatments specifically indicated for patients with marginal-zone lymphoma, and we expect a regulatory decision in the first half of 2017. The data that supported this regulatory submission will also be presented at the upcoming ASH meeting in December. Additionally, at ASH, we'll present data from the registration-enabling trial in chronic graft-versus-host disease, as well as data from several other IMBRUVICA studies across multiple blood cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. We've also made significant progress with the development of Venclexta, which was approved earlier this year in the U.S. under priority review for its first indication, as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with the 17p deletion mutation, a small but medically important segment of the CLL market and an important first step for this exciting new therapy. Earlier this month, we received Canadian approval for Venclexta in previously treated CLL patients with the 17p deletion mutation, as well as in patients with no other treatment options regardless of their mutational status. We also received a positive opinion from the European CHMP for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutations. The CHMP also recommended approval of Venclexta for patients who have failed both chemo immunotherapy and a B-cell inhibitor, regardless of mutational status. Venclexta has demonstrated strong efficacy, driving deep levels of response and durable disease control, both as monotherapy and in combination with Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Earlier this year, Venclexta received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We're expecting data from the MURANO study in the first half of next year, which will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL. The breakthrough designation and the upcoming MURANO data are important milestones for Venclexta that will expand use to the broader relapsed/refractory CLL population. We remain excited about the long-term potential for this molecule and believe that Venclexta will be effective across a range of blood cancers. We're particularly encouraged by the opportunity in AML, as the data generated to date have demonstrated clear signs of efficacy. Earlier this year, Venclexta received its third breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with AML who are ineligible to receive standard induction with high-dose chemotherapy. We're moving quickly with Venclexta's development in AML and expect to begin our Phase 3 programs by the end of the year. At the upcoming ASH meeting, we'll also present Venclexta data in a range of tumor types, including Phase 1 safety and efficacy data in both AML and multiple myeloma, as well as results from the mid-stage CONTRALTO and CAVALLI studies in follicular lymphoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively. As we look ahead to 2017, there will be several additional key data readouts from our hematologic/oncology portfolio that could enable registration of both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta in new indications. For IMBRUVICA, there are a number of planned interim analyses that could potentially lead to regulatory filings, including data in relapsed/refractory, follicular lymphoma, front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and in front-line mantle cell lymphoma. And for Venclexta, as I mentioned, we'll see data from the MURANO study, which will support a broader Venclexta label in CLL. Now we'll move on to our immunology programs, where we continue to make great progress with our two late-stage immunology assets, risankizumab and ABT-494. As Rick mentioned, we have fully enrolled the Phase 3 psoriasis program for risankizumab and will begin to see data from these pivotal studies toward of the end of the next year. Interest in the psoriasis program has been very strong, as evidenced by the fact that we fully enrolled the four Phase 3 studies in just seven and a half months, well ahead of our planning assumptions. The registration trials in Crohn's disease are expected to begin next year, and we also intend to move risankizumab into late-stage studies in both ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis by the end of 2017. The registration-enabling studies for ABT-494 in RA are also progressing very well, and we remain on track for data readouts from these Phase 3 studies during the first half of 2018. The development program for ABT-494 in gastrointestinal disorders is also progressing well, with a Phase 2 study in Crohn's disease ongoing and a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis getting underway in the third quarter. Data from the Crohn's study should be available in the first half of 2017, with Phase 3 Crohn's studies starting later in the year. We also recently began a Phase 2 study to evaluate our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis. I'll now move to virology, where we're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV regimen. This program was designed to investigate a faster path to cure for all genotypes types of HCV and to address treatment areas of continued unmet need. Based on the data we've presented today, our once-daily pan-genotypic regimen is highly effective and has the potential to cure the majority of HCV patients in just eight weeks. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation for our next-generation regimen, for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV who have failed previous therapy with directly acting antivirals in genotype 1. This designation is an important step in our efforts to bring our pan-genotypic regimen to market. At the AASLD meeting in November, we'll be presenting pivotal data from our next-generation regimen, including results from eight-week cohorts in non-psoriatics, as well as data in patients who have failed prior DAA-containing regimens. We expect to submit the NDA for our next-generation HCV regimen to the FDA by the end of this year and file the marketing authorization application with the EMA in the first quarter next year, and we remain on track for commercialization in the U.S. in 2017. We believe that AbbVie's pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free HCV therapy will be competitively positioned and will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market. Finally, in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase 3 endometriosis program, with regulatory submission planned for 2017. The Elagolix clinical development program includes the largest clinical trials conducted to date in endometriosis, with nearly 1,700 patients in two pivotal trials. At the ASRM Congress earlier this month, we presented detailed results from two pivotal studies, demonstrating that Elagolix reduced menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared to placebo. We also presented research on the economic and healthcare costs associated with endometriosis and endometriosis-related surgery in women in the United States. These data support AbbVie's continued efforts to pursue a regulatory filing of Elagolix as a potential new treatment option for the most prevalent symptoms of the disease. In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase 3 studies underway in uterine fibroids. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. We anticipate beginning to see data from this Phase 3 program late next year. So in summary we are very pleased with the progress of our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016 and into 2017. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Bill?
William Chase: Thanks Mike. This morning I'll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016. In the quarter, we delivered strong operational sales growth of 8%, excluding a little more than 0.5% of unfavorable impact from foreign currency. We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share guidance, delivering growth of more than 7% compared to the third quarter of 2015. HUMIRA delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, with global sales of more than $4 billion, up 12.1% operationally. Globally we continue to see strong volume growth across all therapeutic segments. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 16.7% compared to the prior year. The growth rate in the quarter was negatively impacted by 4 points due to higher customer ordering patterns in the prior year, a reversal of what we experienced with second quarter growth rates. Normalized for this, HUMIRA performance in the quarter exceeded 20%, comprised of low-teen prescription growth and single-digit price. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month across all periods. On a year-to-date basis, HUMIRA U.S. sales growth exceeds 24%. For the fourth quarter, we forecast sales growth in excess of 20%, which will contribute to our full-year forecast of above 20%. International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.5% on an operational basis. Biosimilar Remicade has not had a material impact on performance, and the Enbrel biosimilar continues to perform in line with our previously communicated assumptions. We continue to forecast HUMIRA international operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. HUMIRA's unique product profile and AbbVie's strong commercial execution has made HUMIRA the number one prescribed biologic, and we continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA as market leader around the world. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the third quarter were $501 million, up nearly 65% over prior year, driven by increased penetration in relapsed/refractory CLL and other indications, as well as continued uptake in first-line CLL where we launched earlier this year. Global Viekira sales in the third quarter were $378 million, down versus the prior year. Our international business delivered operational sales growth of nearly 31% in the quarter, driven by new launches and continued uptake. In the U.S., as we communicated earlier this year, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entrance of a new competitor in the market. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 21.4% on an operational basis in the quarter, reflecting robust international growth and a modest level of U.S. sales. We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from Creon, which was up 16.6%. We are in the early stages of our commercial launches of Venclexta and ZINBRYTA, which had modest sales impact in the third quarter. We have begun our commercial rollout of Venclexta with our first priority being to ensure adequate physician training and to give physicians an opportunity to gain experience with a dosing ramp. As we've outlined, our initial indication for Venclexta, relapsed/refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion, represents a fairly small market segment, estimated to be roughly $300 million. IMBRUVICA currently holds a strong market leadership position in this segment, with well over 50% share. However, Venclexta is an asset that offers significant growth potential over the longer term. It in the next several years, we expect to augment our label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expand in earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies. The next major milestone for Venclexta will be the submission of data from the MURANO trial to regulatory authorities, which will expand the addressable patient population from Venclexta to all relapsed/refractory CLL patients, a much larger patient population. This will add meaningfully to Venclexta's growth, beginning in 2018. Additionally, we expect further augmentation of the Venclexta label beginning in 2019, with the potential for first-line data and expansion into additional blood cancers. In August, we launched ZINBRYTA in the U.S. The ZINBRYTA label requires the establishment of an appropriate REMS program, and we are on track with the required physician certification and training. While we're very early in the launch, we're encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest. For example, in the U.S. more than 80% of our high-priority physicians have been certified through the REMS program, enabling them to begin prescribing. Based on the approved labeling, we expect ZINBRYTA to be used as a third-line agent, offering a unique mechanism of action, compelling efficacy, and convenient dosing. Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter. The adjusted gross margin was 80.7% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 110 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the profit transfer for IMBRUVICA, which is booked as cost of goods sold. Adjusting for these impacts, the gross margin profile improved by approximately 170 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted R&D was 16.5% of sales, supporting pipeline opportunities in oncology, immunology, HCV, and other areas. Adjusted SG&A was 21.4% of sales in the third quarter, down 160 basis points from the prior year, as we drive operational deficiencies (sic) [efficiencies] (30:49) while maintaining our investments in our growth brands. Adjusted operating margin was 42.8% of sales, down 210 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of exchange, the operating margin profile improved 120 basis points versus the prior year. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted operating margin target of greater than 50% of sales by 2020. Net interest expense was $250 million in the quarter, and the adjusted tax rate was 19.9% in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.21, up 7.1% year over year. Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date and our confidence in our momentum going forward, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.80 to $4.82, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. We are also updating our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance range to $3.74 to $3.76, which includes $1.06 per share of noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items. Regarding the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.22 of noncash amortization and other specified items. We expect high single-digit operational sales growth with minimal foreign exchange impacts in the quarter. In closing, we delivered strong performance in the quarter. We've driven strong top and bottom line growth, while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And, as Rick outlined, we're well-positioned for strong growth again in 2017, as we expect to deliver low double-digit operational revenue growth and EPS growth of 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance should place us among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. And, underscoring our confidence in the business going forward, today we announced a 12.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2017. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we'll take the first question.
Operator: [Operation Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ms. Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Ma'am, your line is open.
Jami Rubin: Thank you. Rick, a couple questions. My first question is more sort of a broad industry question, and maybe you can talk about what you're seeing from your perspective. Obviously, there is tremendous concern in the marketplace about structural change to pricing. We saw McKesson highlight significant moderation in price increases next year, which caused them to lower their guidance. Novo significantly lowered their expectations. Amgen talked about TNF pricing basically going away. From your vantage point, what are you seeing, and maybe you can share with us changes that we should anticipate in our models with respect to net pricing for HUMIRA in the U.S. going forward? Secondly, we appreciate the early commentary and color on 2017 guidance, 13% to 15% earnings growth. However, that is a little bit below consensus. Maybe if you could just step back – you gave us 2020 guidance a couple years ago; maybe you could just step back and help us think about the cadence of earnings growth. AbbVie's a different company from the industry average just given the looming competition to HUMIRA. Maybe if you could just help us think about the growth of this company over the next five years, how you're thinking about it? What you see relative to the plan that you put out a couple years ago? Thanks very much.
Richard Gonzalez: Sure, Jami. So this is Rick. Thank you for the questions. I think as you look at price, certainly the rhetoric on price has been more intense than we've seen it in a number of years, and some of that is driven by the political environment, and some of its driven by more fundamentals. I think if you look at our business specifically, our business is primarily a volume-driven business. That's not to say we don't benefit at all from price. But clearly the vast majority of our growth comes from volume. And the key, I think, for our entire industry is to continue to drive innovation and innovative products in general. And innovative pharmaceuticals, I think in general, tend to save the healthcare system money over time. And I don't know that we've done everything we should do to be able to make sure that, one, we get that message out and, two, maybe support that message a little bit better than we than we have in the past. And so I think that's the key for the industry going forward. And that's the thing that we need to focus our attention on. And if you look at the products that we've been successful with, I think they have a good economic value proposition. HUMIRA's a good example of that as well. And so what I'd say as we look at our planning process, just as we have in previous years, we tend to plan conservatively when it comes to price and then evaluate the market environment at the time that we ultimately get close to that period of time and make a decision around what is the appropriate pricing strategy. And our guidance in 2017 and our long-range plan are both reflective of that philosophy. That philosophy hasn't changed. I think if you look at the 2017 EPS forecast that we gave you, I'd say that there's two things in the consensus that are important to look at. One is, if you looked at consensus, I don't believe everyone has rolled into their model the full year R&D expectation for the BI and the Stemcentrx acquisition, and so obviously that was not reflected in the overall consensus numbers. The second thing is if you look at gross margin, the consensus number's gross margin profile is off. And we've communicated that a couple of times. And where it's off is trying to calculate what the partnered products' contribution will be. And I think if you look at those two factors, if you look at the top line, what we're communicating is very close to what the top line is. If you look at our overall operating expenses, certainly SG&A, R&D's a little bit higher, SG&A, probably be a little bit lower, but net-net, probably a little bit higher. But the difference that you would see would be in the gross margin profile. The other thing I'd say is if you look at that level of performance based on everything that we see, it will rank us certainly in the top tier if not number one. Obviously, we have to see what others report, but based on consensus that's out there today. So we're delivering another year of truly outstanding performance. As far as what we communicated to you from the long-range plan back in October, as I said in my formal comments, this is consistent with what we communicated. I'd say we're still on track to be able to deliver what we expected. And in fact, if anything, I'd say HUMIRA is probably ahead. I think there was a lot of surprise when we first communicated the $18 billion for HUMIRA. There's obviously less surprise now to that number based on our overall performance. And so I think we're tracking on what we had communicated. We're absolutely committed to delivering a 50% operating margin by 2020. And that's despite the negative impact that we will see from the partner products. And we're committed to be able to drive that average compounded growth rate of EPS that we communicated, as well as our top line. And we continue to have a lot of confidence in the business going forward. As we look at the pipeline rolling out, the assets in our late-stage pipeline, I think, are continuing to advance in a way that is consistent with what we thought back then, and those assets are starting to roll out now, as Venclexta, as an example, gets a broader label. That's going to be a very meaningful contributor to our overall performance. And a number of other programs are continuing to advance. Risankizumab as an example, I think, is ahead of schedule by a significant amount of time. 494 continues to advance very well. And so generally what I'd say is we're very confident in what our outlook looks like, and it's consistent with what we communicated to you back in October of 2015.
Jami Rubin: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Holford from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.
Jeffrey Holford: Oh, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just want to ask you, Rick, just to comment on a couple of things said by Amgen yesterday. So they have an expectation for flat net pricing for their TNF in 2017. Do you have a similar expectation built into your guidance for 2017 for HUMIRA? I wonder if you can give us a bit more color on that. And then beyond 2017, do you already anticipate that that flat net pricing in the U.S., if that's what you consider for 2017, actually becomes negative maybe in 2018, 2019? Just wondering what you've considered in your midterm plan. And then also, Amgen seemed to communicate yesterday evening that they won't launch at risk in 2017, and indeed whilst the legal process is going on. Is that your interpretation of what they were saying also? And how long you think do you think that that legal process going to go on for? I don't know if you have any court dates yet. Thanks very much.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. Thanks, Jeff. So I'm not going to necessarily give you the absolute color on what our assumption is in 2017 as it relates to price. But I'd say we don't have a consistent view of the TNF market to the one that was described by Amgen. And I think every product obviously has a different perspective in the marketplace. Maybe it's worthwhile to walk through HUMIRA in a little bit of detail, because I know there's always a lot of interest in it, and that'll give you, I think, a perspective of where we stand overall. I mean, if you step back and you look at where HUMIRA is, take the international market first, HUMIRA continues to perform as we've described it, despite the fact that we've seen the launch of Enbrel biosimilars in that market now for about seven or eight months, I would guess, maybe nine months, something like that, that they've actually been in the marketplace. They've had a very modest impact. We're delivering mid-single digit growth, as we've described to you. In fact, this quarter was about 4.5%. Now, the interesting thing is, if you adjust for the impact of Venezuela, which will be a one-time impact in 2016, the underlying growth of our international business for HUMIRA is 7.6%. So good, strong growth. It's primarily volume growth because you typically have negative price in those international markets. So I'd say HUMIRA's performing exactly where we would have expected it to perform in the international markets. If you look at the U.S., the U.S. has had just truly outstanding growth. If you looked at the past six quarters, on average, HUMIRA has averaged about 25% growth. The last two quarters, second and third quarter, if you average the two of them together, the growth was 21.7%. If you make the adjustment for the ordering patterns that Bill described, third quarter was just over 20% growth. And, as Bill indicated, we're forecasting 20% growth again in the fourth quarter. The October weeklies are consistent with that. We obviously pay a lot of attention to HUMIRA. And so this brand continues to grow extremely well. And the vast majority of that growth is volume. If you look at market share in the U.S., we continue to perform well. Probably the best way to look at market share would be, if you track it at the beginning of 2016 and look at it through the latest data points that we have, which would be September data points, the overall market share for HUMIRA is about 31.8%. It's up 0.6% over that period of time from January through September. Rheumatology, our share is 26.8%; it's increased a full point over that period of time. Gastro and derm, our market share remains basically flat at 43% and 35% market share. And so this brand continues to perform extremely well in the marketplace. And it's because of the attributes of this product and how well it is accepted by physicians and by patients. We're continuing to see good market growth. There's an anomaly in the IMS data because a large managed-care organization has blinded their data, but it's still in the base. But what I would tell you is that if you look at script growth on HUMIRA, it's above 13% when you make the appropriate adjustments. And the market's growing high single digits, around 9% or so. So prescription growth continues to be extremely robust. And then if you look at our formulary position, we just finished our 2017-2018 negotiations. We're pleased with how those negotiations sorted themselves out. We basically had the same level of strong market access for HUMIRA that we had in 2016. Net price, which we don't talk about a lot, but what I can tell is you there was only a very minimal, almost no change in net price between the 2016 contracts and the 2017 and 2018 contracts. And all other attributes of the contracts, like price protection, are consistent – basically consistent with what we've had previously. And so we feel good about our access in the marketplace. And so I think you can expect that HUMIRA's going to continue to perform well. I mean, every brand has its own set of issues that it has to deal with, and I'm certainly not in a position to be able to talk about their brand. But what I am in a position to talk about is how HUMIRA's performed and how we expect it to continue to perform going forward. Price is something that, as I said, we look at it very carefully every single year, and we make a determination as to what we think is appropriate. And we'll do the exact same thing this year. We typically build in a conservative level of price into our planning assumptions because we don't want to be exposed in any way, and in the information that we provided you thus far, it includes that level of conservative assumptions built into it. As it relates to the comments on the litigation, that's not something I can talk about in a lot of detail. I would've interpreted their comments to be the same as the way you interpreted them. I don't think that's a big surprise. At the end of the day, when you look at the magnitude of our IP portfolio and you look at the risk of launching at risk against that portfolio, that would be a high-risk proposition for anyone, and we've made our intentions very clear about, we plan to enforce our IP against anyone who attempts to enter the marketplace, and that we would – if someone chose to make a decision to launch at risk, we would seek a PI. And I think the power of our IP, I think, is very clear in the marketplace. So hopefully that was responsive to your question.
Jeffrey Holford: Thanks very much.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, operator. We'll take the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Christopher Schott: Great. Thanks very much. Just two quick ones here. First, Rick, just to clarify that comment you made on HUMIRA net pricing for 2017. I know you don't talk a lot about price, but just to make sure I heard that right, did you say minimal to no change in net price? Is that basically implying you're not seeing net price up in 2017, or is that referring to the kind of realized price increase? I just wanted to make sure I heard that one right. The second one was just talking about formulary dynamics. I think some payers have talked about wanting to move to more indication-based pricing and have talked specifically about the TNF category. Just interested in your thoughts on that, and is that anything we should be seeing from you either in 2017 or 2018 as you're going through these formulary discussions? Thanks very much.
Richard Gonzalez: Well, as I described to you before, Chris – so we are through the 2017 and 2018 negotiations now. Now, that doesn't mean you can't open something up. But at the end of the day, we have completed all of our negotiations at this point for the 2017 and 2018 contract periods. My comment on net price was essentially, as you go in and you negotiate for your next contract, typically there is pressure to take your rebates up, right? So that's – if you put any price increase and the fall-through of price increase aside, it's what would you increase your rebates by over that period of time? That's what my comment was designed to address, that there was minimal to no change from that perspective. Any price will flow through based on the normal dynamics of how that would occur. And, as I said, it was consistent with what we had in place from any levels of price protection in 2016. So it's basically business as usual for us going forward in 2017 and 2018. As far as indication-based pricing, I mean, I think that's a phenomenon that originally started in the area of oncology, where you could have an oncolytic agent that had very different activity or efficacy in one type of cancer versus another, and is the value proposition the same? If you look at HUMIRA typically across the areas that we compete, HUMIRA is typically the gold standard in most of the areas that we compete in. I'd say generally speaking we have seen some interest in indication-based pricing and potentially doing that. That's not something that, as I said, I think fits well for HUMIRA because of its broad applicability and its level of performance across the range of indications that it has. But it's certainly something that has been of interest. I don't see that as a fundamental issue in the contracting that we've seen go forward for 2017 and 2018, at least for HUMIRA.
Christopher Schott: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Your line is open.
Andrew Baum: Hi. A couple of questions, please. Could you help me just further categorize the slowing HUMIRA growth, given the biosimilar impact is obviously going to be pretty limited given the geography and limited time that the other TNF biosimilars have been the market. How much is competition from the IL-17s in the psoriasis class? How much is saturation of indications? And how much is mandatory price reductions outside the U.S.? And I know you've given earnings guidance for next year. I wonder whether you'd like to give revenue guidance for HUMIRA. Second, AbbVie's enjoyed a mutually positive relationship with the PBMs. In general, do you anticipate any change between the relationships between the PBMs and the pharma industry given the political focus on the PBMs on the lack of transparency, as well as the ongoing attorney general investigations? And then finally, for Mike, could you tell us what percentage of patients on IMBRUVICA run into problems with atrial fibrillation or coagulopathy? I'm obviously thinking about future competition from Astra's acalabrutinib. Many thanks.
William Chase: So Andrew, in terms of HUMIRA, if you look at the overall growth rates outside the U.S., I can't give you a complete slice of what IL-17s are doing specifically, because it impacts market by market. But broadly, when you look at our assumptions that we had around biosimilars and the underlying growth of the markets, things have been progressing very, very well. So you look at major markets across Europe, we've got market growing in the low teens, no changes there. And if you look at HUMIRA share, very, very minimal change year over year. Biosimilar Remicade has not had a major impact on the brand in any way whatsoever. And Enbrel, as we had told you at the beginning of the year, we anticipated a 2 to 3 percentage growth impact, but that was more or less based on the pricing that we expected the biosimilar to come in at. So the biosimilars have been performing very much in line with our expectations. The new entrants to market – look, it's something we're watching very closely. But the reality is, those new entrants tend to get slotted as for patients that are ultimately anti-TNF failures. And so while they are ultimately gaining some traction in the market and they're picking up market share, I don't think you should read that through as a direct erosion to the market share of HUMIRA. Again, in fact, we've got a very, very strong market share position across those markets.
Richard Gonzalez: I think, Andrew – this is Rick. When you say the brand is slowing, I'm not sure whether you're referencing what Bill said in his comments about the prior-year inventory levels or you're just looking at, as in the U.S., as I said in my comments a moment ago, we've averaged over six quarters about 25%, and the last two quarters are more in the 21% range. There's obviously fluctuation from quarter to quarter. But if you look at the dollar contribution across those quarters of growth, it's fairly consistent. And there's always ins and outs, but at the end of the day, as the brand gets bigger, the percent growth is going to go down, and the brand has obviously grown significantly across that period of time. If you look at the IL-17s of some of the other brands, as I mentioned in the market share, our market share in derm is roughly flat. We clearly have the leadership position in that segment. And I think as we look at the dynamics within that market, just to reinforce what Bill said, it's typically the number two player that's getting the bulk of any erosion in their market share with the entrance of a new mechanism like a 17, as an example, because it is usually the second-line failure that they tend to get their market share from. And so HUMIRA has not had as much as of a negative impact based on that because we're typically the first TNF that is used in those indications. On the PBMs, obviously we try to have good relationships with all of our customers, whether they be managed care organizations or PBMs. They are professional relationships. I think PBMs serve a very important purpose. They obviously allow plans to be able to have formularies that they can help manage, and that's the role that they play, and we play an important role with them in being able to supply them with products that can go on those formularies, and so I think it's a typical business relationship. And on IMBRUVICA, I mean, I don't know that we commented specifically about the rates. They're obviously relatively low rates. Mike, do you want to add anything?
Michael Severino: Well, I think we can comment on the clinical trial experience as probably the best ability to assess the rates. And there the AFib rates have been in large data sets, so big Phase 3 studies, on the order of about 6% to 7% on a number of – across the studies that make up our label. And there is a background rate, of course, for AFib in that population as well, which runs in the low single digits. And for bleeding events, we're seeing bleeding events in about that same range of patients. And, again, there's a background rate in the population. With bleeding, most of the episodes of major bleeding that we've seen in our clinical trial program have generally been associated with other precipitants, so trauma or other events that might be associated with bleeding. And, again, there's a background rate there as well.
Andrew Baum: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Andrew. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Vamil Divan: Great. Great, thanks so much for taking my questions. So two questions I have. So one on HUMIRA. You've talked obviously kind of how you see things relative to the longer-term guidance you gave last year. I just had a question more on the longer term, because I think there's been a lot of expectation that once there is biosimilar HUMIRA available in the U.S., because of some of the relationships you have with the PBMs, that the erosion of HUMIRA may be relatively slow. I'm wondering if any of this sort of rhetoric and discussion around drug pricing and transparency around drug pricing, does that change your view on the tail for HUMIRA after we have biosimilar entry, whatever year that entry actually occurs in the U.S.? And then my second question, a couple of your key pipeline products are also in the autoimmune [indiscernible] oral JAK and your IL-23. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the dynamic there, because there's obviously competitors ahead of you in both of those spaces. You're going to be entering what appears to be pretty competitive and maybe price-sensitive markets as well. And you will not have the same sort of dominant position that you've enjoyed with HUMIRA. So how do you think about the opportunity to get into those markets coming behind competitors, with price again being a potential issue? Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: Yeah, I mean, based on the long-term expectations, as we've communicated to the market before, we don't anticipate biosimilar competition in the U.S. market for quite some time. And so I think we have a strategy that we have developed that we will put in place at the point at which we see biosimilar competition in any market around the world. We'll obviously implement that strategy outside the U.S. potentially earlier, in an earlier timeframe. And that strategy is designed for us to be able to maintain our position going forward. I think it's far enough out in the U.S. that we will have to see how the dynamics play out. I don't anticipate anything significantly changing that strategy based on how we would employ the strategy, based on the debates that we see going on and the market dynamics going on. I'll have Mike maybe talk a little bit about the JAKs and the IL-23s from a performance standpoint, but what I would say from a market standpoint is we have always tried to position that our follow-on products would be significantly differentiated versus others in the marketplace. And we've designed our clinical trials to be able to produce that level of differentiation. And I would expect that if anything we would be in a better position based on our experience and our position in this market to be able to launch these products successfully into the market as companion products behind what will be a workhouse product like HUMIRA. We still anticipate that HUMIRA will be the workhorse product that will handle the vast majority of the volume, particularly in the beginning, and these products will fit into different segments going forward in a complementary way, and I think that gives us an advantage, not a disadvantage, in the marketplace. Mike?
Michael Severino: Yes, this is Mike. What I would add is, as a leader in immunology, we have a very clear understanding of the profile that we believe will be competitive, not only today but in the future and in the timeframe that these products will launch. And when we look at, in the case of the two molecules you mentioned, the Phase 2b data to make a decision on either advancement or in-licensing, we kept that profile in mind. And I think each of those assets stands up very well to that understanding of what we'll need to be competitive. With the JAK, for example, that's why we focused on differentiated efficacies, strong efficacy in very difficult-to-treat patient populations, and very, very strong data at the higher-levels response, endpoints like remission, low disease activity, durable ACR70s, and the like. And for risankizumab, it was it was really the same thought process. We looked at those data and we believed, based on a very substantial set of clinical trial results, that the efficacy there was truly differentiated. And we can point, for example, to the approximately 50% posi 100 response for risankizumab in Phase 2b with very favorable pharmaceutical properties of that agent, very favorable dosing that we believe is attainable in Phase 3 and in registration. So we're keeping that profile in mind, and we're advancing assets that we believe will be competitive in the future.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is open.
Geoff Meacham: I wanted to switch gears away from HUMIRA a little bit and talk a little bit about IMBRUVICA. And curious if you can give us any commentary post the first-line approval just with respect to durational therapy, dose interruptions. Clearly extended treatment is clearly one of the big value drivers here for IMBRUVICA. And then just for Elagolix, just wanted to get your perspective, updated perspective, just given a new competitor in the marketplace about the value of having add-back or not and what that means in terms of differentiation in the women's health market. Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: This is Rick. I think on IMBRUVICA, if you look at our performance in first line, we're obviously pleased with the ramp that we've seen so far. I mean, we're ramping fairly rapidly to about 20% now of the overall market. The duration of therapy, I think we've communicated historically, has been in the area of about 75% of the clinical trial experience. I haven't seen the data in the last couple of months, but I think in first line it's consistent with that, and it has been increasing slightly in the relapsed/refractory area. But it's certainly at a very respectable level and certainly isn't anything that we're concerned about at all. I mean, it's certainly at a level that we would expect it to be going forward. And so I think the adoption of IMBRUVICA in that first line, I think the speed of adoption in that first line is an indication of the power of the data that we've seen in RESONATE-2 and physicians' receptivity to that data, both from a PFS and an overall survival standpoint. That's really what's driving a lot of the usage of this product. And I think as we expand and provide even more data, we should continue to see the ability to be able to penetrate that first-line market to an even greater extent. Elagolix?
Michael Severino: With respect to Elagolix, we're obviously aware of the competition and keep a close eye on competition across all of our franchises. But we feel very good about the position we have with Elagolix. We have a substantial lead, having completed two Phase 3 studies, and competition is considerably behind that in terms of timing. And we're going to continue to drive that program forward. The efficacy and the safety results that we see, we view very favorably. We think they support the value proposition that we had in mind when we entered into Phase 3. And we're going to continue in subsequent studies, in post-registration studies, Phase 4 work, if you will, to continue to define that profile. Add-back could be an important part of that profile, and we are pursuing that. And there may be other strategies to continue to enhance the value proposition for Elagolix. Then we're going to be driving forward with that aggressively.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Geoff. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS. Your line is open.
Ami Fadia: Hi. This is Ami Fadia; I'm on for Marc. Most of our questions have been answered, but I'll ask three quick follow-up questions. Firstly, on HUMIRA for the quarter, if you look at the sequential sales in 3Q versus 2Q, there was weakness sequentially, but if you could help us understand what might have driven that, that would be helpful. Secondly, just with respect to your long-range guidance for EPS growth, how should we think about the 15% growth over the longer term? Right now it's sort of ranging in the lower double-digit range. When do you expect to see the spike more closer to the mid double-digit range? And then thirdly, on Rova-T, could you elaborate a little bit on the basket study? What are you looking to see there? That would be helpful. Thanks.
William Chase: Ami, it's Bill Chase. HUMIRA's kind of a difficult brand to look at on a sequential quarter basis. First of all, it's a very well-established brand – growing rapidly, but well-established. If you go back and look over the years, it is not unusual in the U.S. or abroad to see a general flattening out over the summer and then an acceleration back in the back half of the year. And that is the pattern that we're seeing this year. Now, could there be some degree of inventory between Q2 and Q3 that's impacting that sequential growth? Yeah. I mean, look, minor moves flow – impact that sequential. But really at the end of the day when we look at the brand, and we look at the dynamics around the brand, and we look at the prior year destock that we saw in the second quarter, and the subsequent restock in the third quarter, there is nothing that is alarming us about this third quarter. You have you to remember that our second quarter results had 26.7% growth. That was largely related – that difference from the 20% was largely related to a destocking event in the second quarter of 2015, and we're just seeing the impact of the restock in the third quarter of 2015. So we actually feel very, very good about it. We're guiding fourth quarter above 20%. We feel very, very good about our full-year forecast.
Richard Gonzalez: On the EPS, so 2015 we delivered EPS growth of 29%. And this year, the midpoint is about 12%, right?
Elizabeth Shea: Yeah.
Richard Gonzalez: Now, you got to remember, that 12% has the dilution associated with the Stemcentrx transaction and the dilution associated with the BI transaction. So that's certainly weighing on this year. We're guiding next year to be 13% to 15%, so that's certainly in the range of the 15% area. And then nothing has changed that gives me any concern that we won't achieve the number that we talked to you about on average across that period of 2015 to 2020, that we can average that kind of a compounded growth rate. But I'd say, thus far, if you look through 2017, you'd say we're at or above that range, across the average, including the dilution of those two transactions. And then Rova-T?
Michael Severino: Yeah, this is Mike. With respect to the basket study for Rova-T, so this is a study that has eight arms, and each arm looks at a different type of the tumors that have neuroendocrine features and share the same underlying biology as small-cell lung cancer. Examples of these tumor types might be the large-cell component of non-small-cell lung cancer, a form of pancreatic cancer that has neuroendocrine features, subsets of colorectal cancer and metastatic melanoma, for example. So each of these eight arms is going to look for response rate in refractory patients with those tumors. And when we see a response rate that we view as indicative of good activity, we would then have the ability to expand out both those cohorts and start additional studies that could be registration-enabling, following the same conceptual strategy that we did with Rova-T and small-cell. Of course the nature of what each registrational program would look like would be tailored to the individual tumor type. But this is a study that could rapidly trigger additional registrational work in those other tumors as we see signs of activity.
Ami Fadia: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Ami. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Scotti of Evercore LSI (sic) [ISI] (1:11:32). Your line is open.
John Scotti: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple, please. So I apologize for touching on this I think the third time, but I just want to make sure I'm absolutely clear. So when you say minimal to no change in net price from 2017 to – 2016, 2017, 2018, just to be clear, so what you mean is that the gross-to-net spread on HUMIRA you don't anticipate widening, but you will still continue to capture at least some net price growth? Or is it that you do not anticipate on capturing any net price growth because gross-to-net spreads are widening? And then also, I was also curious on the P&L management this quarter, particularly on the SG&A side, which came in a little bit better than expectations. So where are those cost savings coming from, and are they coming from HUMIRA? Are you reducing your global footprint on HUMIRA ahead of the biosimilar entry? If not, just curious where they're coming from. Thank you.
William Chase: Okay, so, John, just to clarify on the price, the net price comment refers to what happened to net price before any future price actions. Okay? Now, what we're not saying is that there will be no net price increase next year. We still have within our contracts the ability to raise price and see a positive impact on the P&L from those actions. The net price actually has to do with, without any future price increases – which, by the way, that isn't how we're modeling the year, what we would expect – price would be an a constant basis without price increases. The contracts allow us to take net price. And any net price increases, any price increase that we took, would have a positive impact on our bottom line. That's the way you need to think about it. That said, in 2017, we are planning conservatively, as we always do. We're approaching the 2017 guidance with the exact same philosophy on how we plan for price increases that we have in the past. So hopefully that helps out. And then from a P&L management standpoint – look, the SG&A ratio, we're very pleased with. It's really a couple different things. There is a leverage impact from the rapidly growing top line that obviously we've been delivering over the last few quarters. That said, we look at our spend. We're looking at admin very, very closely. We're looking at the productivity of all of our SG&A investments, as you would expect us to. And we fund projects based on an ROI and a return. And if they have positive ROI, we find a way to get the money in the right places to deliver the return. In terms of HUMIRA, we are not backing off our spend on HUMIRA. The spend on HUMIRA has been the driver of the spectacular growth that the brand has put up. And all of those programs are very, very high ROI, which as you can see – as you can imagine based on the sales growth.
John Scotti: Thank you.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, John. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Alex Arfaei: Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. Most of my HUMIRA and price questions have been asked and answered. Just looking out at pipeline and business development opportunities, what are your thoughts about either developing or pursuing CAR-T products to augment your hematology pipeline and maintain your leadership? That seems to be where we're going with a lot of hematologic malignancies. Thank you.
Michael Severino: So this is Mike. With respect to CAR-Ts, obviously there's been a lot of activity. It's still early days for the use of those agents in later-stage trials and obviously not yet being registered agents. And there's also a lot of work that is going on to try to figure out what is the right functionality that one would want to build into a CAR-T to optimize its applicability across a range of both hematologic and other tumors. And so we're keeping a close eye on the space. As a leader in immunology with our very strong presence in oncology, obviously there are a lot of skills that we bring to the table that we think we could apply to CAR-Ts. And we'll continue to monitor that area closely, both with our internal work and keeping an eye on the external environment.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Alex. Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: Thank you very much. I believe HUMIRA's IP estate has increased by 30 or so patents from this point last year. Last year you gave us a very nice chart of the nature of the patents and the expiration dates. It was page 14 of your slide deck. In general terms, can you detail the nature of the additional 30 in terms of the type of patent they are and the expiration dates? And then, secondly, AstraZeneca has saying they could file acalabrutinib for an indication by the end of this year, but I'm not aware that they have identified that indication. Does AbbVie have any competitive intelligence on what AstraZeneca might be up to? Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Yeah, Steve. This is Rick. On the IP, off the top of my head, I can't give you all of the dates of the incremental 30 patents. We continue to work on our patent estate. So I think maybe off-line we'll try to get back to you with whatever we are able to provide you. And then, Mike, do you want to talk about AZ?
Michael Severino: Sure. This is Mike. And we've certainly heard the comments that you're referring to by AZ, but we agree that they've not been very specific. I don't think we can really speculate on what they have in mind. What I can tell you is with ibrutinib, we're moving forward very aggressively, very rapidly across a number of fronts, moving to front line in CLL, advancing our programs in other areas like non-Hodgkin lymphoma. So we're really focused on raising the bar there and making sure that we're driving IMBRUVICA as rapidly and aggressively as we possibly can.
Elizabeth Shea: Thanks, Steve. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at abbvieinvestor.com. Thanks again for joining us.
Operator: Participants, the call has concluded. You may now disconnect. Thank you.

Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered another strong quarter with results well ahead of our expectations including adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, representing growth of 16.7% versus the second quarter of 2015. Our results in the quarter included strong top-line performance with global operational sales growth of 18%, reflecting robust growth from several products in our portfolio, including HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA among others. We're pleased with our outperformance in the quarter and progress year-to-date. We've driven outstanding commercial, operational and R&D execution resulting in strong top and bottom line results. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, we're raising our full-year 2016 EPS guidance to $4.73 to $4.83 on an adjusted basis reflecting growth of 11.4% at the midpoint. As I mentioned, several products within our portfolio are driving robust growth. HUMIRA continues to drive strong performance delivering global operational growth of more than 17% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across all three market segments. In rheumatology, HUMIRA is the number one prescribed biologic and we continue to grow our share position in the face of new competition. And in dermatology and gastro, HUMIRA continues to hold a strong market leadership position demonstrating double-digit growth year-over-year. We also continue to be pleased with the strong IMBRUVICA performance, which is tracking in line to slightly ahead of our expectations following our approval for first line use in CLL. IMBRUVICA has achieved the number one market share position in all approved disease indications in second line and second line plus treatment. And since we received the FDA approval of IMBRUVICA as a first line treatment for CLL late in the first quarter, IMBRUVICA has already gained a market share position in first line in the mid-teens and the third position in the market. And the share, continues to steadily increase with approximately one of every six patients now receiving IMBRUVICA as a front line therapy surpassing FCR which is generally considered the gold standard for young and fit CLL patients. This market share and the strong momentum underlying its performance further reinforces our confidence in our long-term expectations for IMBRUVICA. That supported our decision to acquire Pharmacyclics last year. We also saw a strong performance from several other products in our portfolio including Duodopa, Creon and Lupron. Each of these therapies within our marketed product portfolio continue to deliver durable performance. Global VIEKERA sales in the second quarter were $419 million, up 8.2% on an operational basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by our international business. In the U.S. as we described on our first quarter call, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entry of a new competitor into the HCV market. We are nearing the completion of our registrational studies for our next generation pan-genotypic HCV combination. Based on the mid-stage data, we've disclosed to-date, we believe that our new HCV combination will be highly competitive. The data illustrates that this therapy can deliver cure rates approaching 100% across genotypes. And we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an eight-week treatment option. We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half and we remain on track for commercialization next year. In addition to our strong financial results, we continue to advance our strategic priorities and have made excellent progress with our R&D pipeline. Mike will cover the pipeline in more detail in just a few moments, so I'll only mention a few highlights. Importantly, we successfully completed the acquisition of Stemcentrx. We've been impressed by the caliber of talent we've welcomed from Stemcentrx, and the transition has been seamless. The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically and financially compelling opportunity for our company, giving AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors and an extremely exciting late stage asset in Rova-T. The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in hematological oncology. We are moving rapidly to advance Rova-T in its lead indication, third-line small cell lung cancer. And we continue to feel confident about our 2017 BLA filing strategy and launch in 2018. We're also rapidly advancing studies to evaluate Rova-T in earlier lines of therapy for small cell lung cancer including combination studies with both chemotherapy and immuno-oncology agents. Earlier this week, we jointly announced a clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of Rova-T with BMS's immuno-oncology agents in small cell lung cancer with trials beginning this year. We're pleased to be partnering with BMS to bring innovative new therapies forward that have the potential to significantly improve the survival of patients with small cell lung cancer, a disease with devastating outcomes. We've also continued to make significant progress with our hematological oncology portfolio. We're building upon our strong position with IMBRUVICA in treating blood cancers with VENCLEXTA. During the quarter, we received the first FDA approval for VENCLEXTA for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL who harbor the 17p deletion, a difficult-to-treat form of the disease, typically associated with poor prognosis. The approval for this transformative therapy was granted under breakthrough therapy and priority review designations, and the launch is still in its early stages. Although this first indication is a relatively small patient population, it is important to provide patients with this difficult-to-treat disease a new therapy with strong clinical results, and it's also important to give positions an opportunity to gain experience with a particular initial dosing regimen of VENCLEXTA to ensure patients receive the benefit of this therapy. We expect data from the Phase III study evaluating VENCLEXTA in a broader set of relapsed/refractory CLL patients to read out next year supporting our regulatory submission for an expanded label covering all relapsed/refractory CLL patients, a much larger population. Like IMBRUVICA, we believe that VENCLEXTA will be effective across a range of hematological malignancies with high unmet need, and we're actively evaluation additional indications including acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma among others. We also continue to make progress across other important areas of our pipeline. During the quarter, we presented positive results from mid-stage study of our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. The pivotal program for risankizumab is in psoriasis and it's underway and enrolling very well. And in partnership with Biogen, we recently received FDA and EC approval for ZINBRYTA, for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. We plan to launch ZINBRYTA in the U.S. in August. In summary, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and the significant advancements in our pipeline. As we outlined at our recent R&D day, we have eight late-stage assets which have been significantly de-risked, and have the potential to drive meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. We continue to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success, with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes and strong commercial performance. We intend to build on this momentum to drive a high level of performance across our operations in the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for some additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP: Thank you, Rick. We had another very productive quarter from an R&D perspective. With significant progress on several programs, including the FDA approval of VENCLEXTA for its first indication in patients with relapsed relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion mutation, as well as the FDA and EMA approvals of ZINBRYTA for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Today, I'll highlight additional updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the second half of 2016. I'll start with our oncology portfolio, an area where we are growing our already strong position in hematologic malignancies, as well as establishing a strong foundation in solid tumors, which was significantly accelerated by our recent acquisition of Stemcentrx, and its lead asset, Rova-T. At the ASCO meeting in early June, we presented data from a Phase II trial in small cell lung cancer that demonstrated that Rova-T monotherapy drove a one-year survival rate of 32% in DLL3 positive patients. Almost triple that of historical third line standard of care at 12%. In addition to the impressive one-year survival, Rova-T showed the most compelling single-agent activity in terms of overall response rate, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in third-line small cell lung cancer. The patient population where our first pivotal trial for registration is rapidly enrolling. The confirmatory third-line registrational trial which is called Trinity began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016 with commercialization expected in 2018. We are also quickly advancing Rova-T in the studies to support front-line treatment in small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The first-line development program includes a Phase I/II regimen selection study that will be used to inform future Phase III pivotal trials evaluating various combinations of Rova-T and chemotherapy. The regimen selection study is expected to begin next quarter. The first line program also includes the (13:10) study, a Phase III registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front line setting. We expect to have this study up and running by the end of the year. We are also advancing an 8-arm basket study evaluating Rova-T in a range of neuroendocrine tumors where DLL3 plays an important role. This study is on track to begin this quarter with data expected next year. Given that many of these tumor types have low survival rates and limited treatment options available, there may be an opportunity to explore single-arm studies to support accelerated approval. As Rick mentioned earlier this week, we announced a clinical collaboration with BMS to evaluate the investigational combination of Rova-T with OPDIVO and with OPDIVO and YERVOY in small cell lung cancer. We believe that combining Rova-T with these checkpoint inhibitors could drive enhanced and sustained efficacy above what that which either approach could offer individually. Preclinical evidence and biological rationale supports our prioritization of efforts to combine Rova-T with IO agents, and we believe these combinations have the potential to establish a new standard of care. We expect to begin the Rova-T/IO combination study by the end of the year. In addition to Rova-T, we've also continued to make progress with our pipeline assets targeting solid tumors. In particular, our PARP inhibitor Veliparib and ABT-414 an antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiform. We presented Phase I data for both of these assets at the recent ASCO meeting and anticipate data readouts from registration enabling studies for both programs over the next 12 months. We also continue to make good progress with our hematologic oncology portfolio. In the second quarter, the FDA updated the IMBRUVICA label to include new data from two Phase III trials supporting expanded use in patients with CLL and SLL, including overall survival data from both the RESONATE-2 and HELIOS trials. IMBRUVICA is also being evaluated in mid to late stage trials for several additional indications. With timing of data readouts and potential regulatory submissions dependent on event driven analysis of ongoing studies. In June, IMBRUVICA received breakthrough therapy designation as a potential treatment of chronic graft-versus-host-disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy marking the drugs fourth breakthrough therapy designation. The FDA also granted IMBRUVICA Orphan Drug Designation for the same condition. The breakthrough designation was based on clinical data from a Phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA for the treatment of patients with steroid dependent or refractory chronic GVHD. Our registrational study in graft versus host disease is underway with data expected late this year or early 2017. We've made significant progress with the development of another important strategic asset, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor VENCLEXTA, which is being developed in collaboration with Roche. VENCLEXTA was recently approved under priority review for its first indication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with 17p deletion. Earlier this year, VENCLEXTA also received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. The Phase III MURANO trial which will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL is fully enrolled with data readout and regulatory submission anticipated in 2017. Additionally, we have an active Phase III program evaluating VENCLEXTA in treatment-naive CLL patients with studies underway and progressing well. Like IMBRUVICA, we believe VENCLEXTA will be effective across a range of blood cancers including AML and multiple myeloma. We recently started a Phase III program evaluating VENCLEXTA in combination with standard of care in multiple myeloma and we anticipate moving forward with Phase III development in AML by the end of the year. In addition to the elements of the program I've described, we continue to be excited about the ongoing clinical evaluation of combinations of IMBRUVICA and VENCLEXTA, which we believe have the potential to drive profound responses and minimal residual disease negativity in a number of clinical settings. Now, I'd like to turn our attention to the immunology portfolio where we have two late stage assets, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody risankizumab, and our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494. Each of these assets has the potential to significantly advance standard of care in immune-mediated conditions such as RA, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, covering the major market segments where we currently have a leadership position. ABT-494 is currently in Phase 3 development for rheumatoid arthritis, where we are studying the asset in six pivotal trials. Our JAK inhibitor has the potential to be best-in-class with what we believe will be an optimized benefit risk profile. Our development strategy is aimed at delivering a comprehensive label to cover multiple lines of therapy from first line use in methotrexate-naive patients to use in patients with inadequate response to biologics, where the highest unmet need remains in this market. Data from the ABT-494 Phase 3 RA program is expected in the first half of 2018, with commercialization targeted in 2019. We have also accelerated the development of this important asset in gastrointestinal disorders. Our Phase 2 study in Crohn's disease is well underway and data should be available internally later this year. This will enable a decision to advance to Phase 3 development by the first quarter of next year. You can expect to see the data from this Phase 2 Crohn's study at DDW next year. In addition, we recently initiated a Phase 2 study in ulcerative colitis with data expected in 2018. Risankizumab is another strategically important late-stage immunology asset. This anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, which we licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim earlier this year, has the potential to be a transformative therapy by providing best-in-class efficacy with increased dosing convenience. Risankizumab is currently in Phase III psoriasis trials, and in mid-stage development for both Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. Interest in the Phase III psoriasis program has been strong, and enrollment is progressing very well. We continue to expect data from the registrational program in 2018. At the Digestive Disease Week meeting in May, we reported encouraging results from a Phase II study of risankizumab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease, a particularly difficult-to-treat population given that the majority of these patients had previously failed treatment with one or more TNF antagonists. Based on these strong results, we intend to move rapidly into Phase III studies in Crohn's disease with registration trials commencing later this year or early next year. Another technology that we believe holds great promise is our proprietary bispecific antibody platform. We've introduced a number of these assets into the clinic in both our immunology and oncology therapeutic areas. Based on our early-stage studies, we've established proof of concept across several programs, demonstrating that these antibodies possess good drug-like properties, and delivered the desired pharmacodynamic effects. And we've learned how to successfully and consistently manufacture them. We recently evaluated data from one of our bispecific programs in development, ABT-122, our combination anti-TNF and anti-IL-17, in Phase II trials for RA and psoriatic arthritis. The data demonstrated that ABT-122 was well tolerated with a safety profile that was comparable to HUMIRA. In the mid-stage psoriatic arthritis and RA studies, ABT-122 showed ACR20 response rates as high as 75% and 82% respectively, demonstrating that the platform worked well with clear evidence of biologic activity. However, the simultaneous inhibition of IL-17 and TNFα do not produce the strong synergistic effect necessary to differentiate ABT-122 from other candidates in our pipeline, such as ABT-494 and risankizumab. As a result, we have made the decision not to pursue further development of this asset. While in this particular setting, we didn't see the high level of differentiation we were seeking, the validation of the bispecific platform gives us confidence to continue to advance other programs with different mechanisms of action. Also in our immunology portfolio, we continue to make progress with vobarilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor nanobody being developed in collaboration with Ablynx for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Earlier this month, Ablynx announced positive top-line results from a Phase II monotherapy study demonstrating that this asset improved symptoms of RA. We expect results from a second Phase II study evaluating use with methotrexate in the third quarter which will allow us to determine next steps for development of this asset. In the quarter we also made significant progress in other key therapeutic areas and are on track to advance several programs in the second half of the year. In virology, our next-generation HCV program is progressing well. Early in the quarter, at the International Liver Congress, we presented new data on our pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes one through six, including data on treatment durations as short as eight weeks. The data illustrate that with eight weeks of treatment, 97% and 98% of genotype one through three patients without cirrhosis treated with AbbVie's next-generation regimen, achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks. Additionally, 100% of genotype four through six patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR 12 with 12 weeks of treatment. Overall, we believe that AbbVie's next-generation HCV therapy will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market. We continue to expect to see results from the Phase III trials in the coming months. And we remain on track for commercialization next year. And in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase III endometriosis program with regulatory submission planned for 2017. Earlier this year, we announced positive top line results from the second of two replicate pivotal Phase III clinical trials evaluating Elagolix in premenopausal women who suffer pain from endometriosis. The results show that after six months of continuous treatment, both doses of Elagolix met the studies co-primary endpoints with Elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain at month three and month six. We plan to present detailed results from both Phase III studies including extension study data up to 12 months at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in October. And our Phase III studies in uterine fibroids are underway and progressing well. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. So, in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs including more than 20 new products or indications in late-stage development or under regulatory review. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our second quarter performance.
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Mike. This morning, I will review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016 inclusive of the recently completed Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration. We're very pleased with our strong second quarter results. In addition to delivering strong operational sales growth of 18%, we exceeded the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.06 and delivered growth of nearly 17% over the second quarter of 2015. As Rick mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA with global sales of more than $4.1 billion, up 17.7% operationally. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased nearly 27%. We continue to see mid-teens prescription volume growth across the brand fueled by robust demand in the rheum, derm, and gastro market segments. In the quarter, we also saw a low-single-digit benefit on the growth rate as a result of customer buying patterns versus the prior year quarter. Channel inventory levels in both the second quarter of 2015 and 2016 were below half a month. International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% on an operational basis and exceeding our prior guidance of 3% operational growth for the quarter. Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its market leadership position. We continue to see only modest overall market share gains for biosimilar REMICADE in major markets in line with our planning assumptions. And while still early in the launch, the ENBREL biosimilar continues to perform in line with our assumptions. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $439 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $384 million and our international profit sharing was $55 million. Global Viekira sales in the second quarter were $419 million. This reflects weaker quarter-over-quarter sales in the U.S. due to competitive dynamics offset by our performance in international markets. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease grew nearly 29% on an operational basis in the quarter continuing to grow by double digits internationally with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected. We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from both Creon and Lupron, which were up 13% and 11% respectively. As Rick noted in the quarter, we received approval for two new products, VENCLEXTA and ZINBRYTA. We launched VENCLEXTA early in the quarter in its initial indication for relapsed/refractory CLL patients with the 17p deletion, which represents a smaller addressable patient population in the U.S. We have begun a measured commercial rollout to ensure adequate physician training and we expect a modest level of VENCLEXTA sales for 2016. For ZINBRYTA, we plan to launch in the U.S. in August. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 81.9% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 160 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition including the profit transfer for IMBRUVICA. Adjusting for these impacts, gross margin profile performance improved by approximately 140 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted R&D was 15.5% of sales, reflecting funding action supporting the pipeline, as well as the impact of both Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration. Adjusted SG&A was 22.2% of the sales in the second quarter, down 290 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 43.9% sales, down 30 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange and the Pharmacyclics acquisition, operating margin profile performance improved 370 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $225 million and the adjusted tax rate was 20.1% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $1.26 up 16.7% year-over-year. Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.73 to $4.83, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 11.4% at the midpoint. This includes the previously communicated $0.28 of dilution related to the Stemcentrx acquisition and the BI collaboration. We are also updating our 2016 GAAP diluted EPS guidance range to $3.82 to $3.92, which includes $0.91 per share of noncash intangible asset amortization expense and other specified items including acquisition costs and accounting impacts associated with Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration. On the top-line, we expect full year sales approaching $26 billion. Foreign exchange dynamics have run favorable relative to our initial projections and we are now forecasting approximately 1% of negative top-line impact from currency for the full year. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect U.S. HUMIRA operational sales growth of more than 20%. And we remain on track with our previously communicated full year guidance for international HUMIRA with operational growth in the mid-single digits. We now forecast an adjusted gross margin profile approaching 81% impacted by stronger performance of hedged currencies in 2016. The gross margin profile also reflects 130 basis points of impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition. Excluding this and the year-over-year exchange impacts, the gross margin profile is expected to improve relative to 2015 by roughly 190 basis points. We are now forecasting R&D expense of more than 16% of sales reflecting our increased R&D investments related to the Stemcentrx acquisition, and the BI collaboration. And we expect SG&A to run at approximately 23% of sales. We now forecast an adjusted operating margin profile approaching 42% on a full year basis. We remain committed to delivering on our 2020 targeted operating margin forecast of above 50% of sales. We are now forecasting net interest expense of approximately $925 million for the full year, above our original guidance of approximately $800 million, as a result of the debt we issued for the Stemcentrx acquisition. And we expect an adjusted tax rate in the 20% to 21% range in 2016. Regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.16 of specified items and noncash amortization, and includes the dilutive impact of Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration. We are expecting high single digit operational sales growth, excluding a modest negative foreign exchange impact in the quarter. So, in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth while also advancing on our strategic priorities and our pipeline. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we'll take the first question.
Operator: Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Jeff Holford of Jefferies. Sir, Your line now is open.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Thanks for that. I'll start with a question for Rick, please. So, Rick, there's clearly substantial trapped value in the company because of the uncertainty for investors around HUMIRA. And you've made positive steps to deal with this through building new growth drivers through R&D, aggressive business development as well as making clear your long-term expectations regarding HUMIRA. Even so, despite great quarters like today, we're still seeing the shares trade at a substantial discount to peers. So, is there anything else that's up for discussion in terms of how you can unlock the trapped value in the company whether it's through different capital allocation, separation of your oncology platform given the valuations they can carry these days or anything else? Second, then for Mike, I wonder what does your collaboration with Bristol on Rova-T tell you about what they are thinking regarding their positioning of their OPDIVO-YERVOY combination in small cell lung cancer? And then last, maybe for Rick again, we're expecting that you'll be in place by Q4 to initiate patent litigation against Amgen. And it will be beyond just the dosing and formulation patents that have been more widely discussed today. Are those still reasonable expectations? And do you think investors will be reassured when we see what other patents Amgen has agreed that they are potentially infringing out of the patent bounds? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So, Jeff, this is Rick. I'll cover the first and third one and then I'll have Mike cover the other one. So, on the untrapped value, what I would tell you is that if you look at our PE, I think what you've seen and if you look at the range of companies in our peer group, there are obviously companies that have a much lower PE for a variety set of reasons and there are companies where the, have higher PEs and the median PE is certainly above where we are. So, there's certainly a level of overhang that's associated with the biosimilar uncertainty around HUMIRA. And I think what we have laid out for investors is a clear strategy that we put in place starting back in 2013 of how we were going to deal with that. Ultimately, we have a large portfolio of IP around HUMIRA and we certainly expect that to be able to protect the asset as we described back in October. We have now added to the portfolio two fundamentally differentiated new assets in 494 and risankizumab. And you're seeing some of that data play out, and so, that we fundamentally believe that those will allow us to ultimately be able to grow through what will obviously be at some point a biosimilar impact both internationally, as well as in the U.S. And then, we've spent a considerable amount of time building a robust pipeline that we've shown at our R&D Day and in other events that had the ability to be able to ultimately generate a very significant revenue opportunity that would allow us to grow through even the most bearish impact that's out there from an analyst standpoint around biosimilars. So, I think, we've done the things that we think are important to be able to communicate and then ultimately, build a strategy to be able to drive the business from a growth perspective because that was the charter that we set for the company when we launched. And, I think we've demonstrated that were capable of doing that. I think it will take some time for the litigation strategies to play out and for investors to continue to gain confidence. Having said that, we constantly look at different kinds of alternatives that we think truly are value-enhancing to shareholders but also value-enhancing to the business itself. And we'll explore all of those in time to determine whether or not they make sense. I mean, I think, if anything, we've probably been on the proactive side of going out and building new growth platforms and other kinds of things to be able to sustain the business going forward. And we have seen the PE improve, and we would certainly expect that it will continue to improve. I mean, if you look at our performance, both currently as well as going forward as we projected it in our LRP, we will perform in the top tier of our peer groups and we would expect that we'll start to see the PE reflect that to a greater extent going forward as the litigation strategy plays out more. On the third question, and I'm sure there will be other questions around the litigation and I'll apologize in advance that this won't be a very satisfying answer for you but it certainly I think you'll understand why. We're now in the very active phase of litigation around HUMIRA biosimilars. And therefore, we're not in a position where we're going to be able to provide a lot of color. And we're certainly not in a position where we can do this play-by-play strategy of how we're going to deal with every aspect of it. That just wouldn't be a smart thing for us to do. What I can reiterate is this. Back in October, we outlined in detail the extensive portfolio of IP that we have for HUMIRA and our confidence in that IP and it goes beyond any one single patent. And I can tell you we remain confident in that IP portfolio and we've made it very clear that we intend to vigorously defend all of our IP against anyone that potentially infringes it. And, so that process will play out. So, as I said, it's just not prudent for us now in this space to ultimately lay out in detail the play-by-play. And, so we're just not in a position to be able to do that.
Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP: Okay. So, this is Mike. I'll take the question about the BMS collaboration. So, I think that, first of all, we're very fortunate that after many years, without much progress in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, there are very promising mechanisms coming forward, our own Rova-T, as well as the data that have been presented recently in immuno-oncology. And I think that offers real benefit for patients downstream. What I would say about the way the two companies are thinking about these assets, I think that the speed which the deal came together really speaks for itself. And that collaboration would not have been possible in this short period of time if we were thinking about the assets very differently. As we've said, in other settings, when one is thinking about the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer, there are a couple of treatment goals. The first is that one needs to get disease control because these patients present very ill with very rapidly progressing disease. And Rova-T has shown in its Phase II studies that it can do that and it can do that with a defined course of therapy. We also believe that the data strongly supports that the responses with Rova-T will be durable. Now, when one thinks about other treatment goals, it would be desirable to have a long-term surveillance on board after one achieves that initial strong and durable disease control and we believe that IO agents can play a real role there. And so, the collaboration with Bristol will test this. And we believe will provide very exciting data for patients with small cell lung cancer in the future.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Thank you.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Jeff. Operator, next question please?
Operator: Next question is from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Your line now is open.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Can you hear me?
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Yes.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I assume you can hear me. Anyway, I have a couple of questions. First on the outlook for hep C. Rick, I think you had said earlier obviously VIEKIRA underperformed in the U.S., outperformed internationally. But how are you thinking about the opportunity for next generation hep C given what clearly has been a more challenging pricing environment? And I'm just wondering if you still stand by your $3 billion forecast? And secondly, on Stemcentrx. When do the next two assets for Stemcentrx enter the clinic? Now, is that this year and for which indications? And wondering what we will see potentially at ESMO? And Michael, just maybe if you can explain. I'm still getting a lot of pushback from investors who are unclear about the value of Rova-T just given that the response rate that we saw at ASCO was a bit lower than what we saw at World Lung, I think creating question marks around the durability of response. Thanks very much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Jami. This is Rick. I'll take the hep C question that you had. Certainly, as we said in the first quarter call, we have seen an impact of the new entrant into the marketplace. I'd say we've seen it primarily in the public channels, particularly I'd say the VA, and it really boiled down to a pricing strategy and ultimately we decided that we were not going to match the lowest price, the eight-week price, that was out into the marketplace. And therefore, we lost a significant amount of share. I mean, at our peak, we probably had close to 40% share, and now we have share that's more down in the single-digit range. So, I'd say that's the vast majority of the impact that we've seen. There has been some price impact also that played through but the greater impact is clearly share loss in that public channel primarily. And so, as we look forward to next generation, I think as we look at the profile of that asset, obviously from a clinical performance standpoint, it is everything we would have hoped it would be. Based on the data that we've seen so far, I think it will be a highly competitive asset. It will also provide, because it is pan-genotypic, an opportunity to be able to bridge across all of the genotypes, and in particular in the United States, genotype 2 and genotype 3, where Sovaldi essentially had a strong position in the marketplace, and so this will even that playing field. So, we fundamentally believe that next generation will allow us an opportunity to be able to grow our share. If you look outside the United States, as an example, and you look in countries where there is predominantly a 1B population, but even in some countries where there's a significant 1A population, our market shares in most of those countries are in, I'd say, on the low end, 30%; on the high end, sometimes as high as 70%. So, we compete very well, and the profile of 1B is certainly much more of a competitive profile to the alternatives that are available outside the United States. And so I think it gives you an idea of our ability to be able to perform in those markets. So, we would hope, and I think expect, that next generation will allow us to be able to gain share in those marketplaces. Your $3 billion, you are probably going back to the first prediction and I think we anticipate that we would get back into that range. But I'm going out of the business of predicting HCV at this point. I think what I would say is despite the impact that we've seen in the U.S. from a share standpoint, I think it shows you how fundamentally strong the overall business is because we've taken a fairly substantial hit in the U.S. on HCD (sic) [HCV]. But, yet, we continue to perform at a very high level and offset all of that impact and are now raising guidance on top of that. So, the balance of our entire business and in particular I'd say HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA right now gives us the ability to be able to do that. And so, we're not dependent upon that single asset performing at a certain level. Mike?
Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP: Okay. So, with respect to the Stemcentrx questions. Rova-T, the objective response data for Rova-T have been very consistent in our view across the various reports over the last several months. And they've ranged from about 39% into the mid 40% range. And that really just relates to the cut of the data, whether one is using initial investigator reports or subsequent adjudicated assessments of objective response and doesn't bear on durability of those responses in any way. And the objective response rate and, importantly, the clinical benefit rate have both remained very high. The one-year survival has also been very consistent in the 30%-plus range across the data cuts, which gives us a very good feel for the durability of those responses. And in this heavily pre-treated patient population, the best estimate – the most rigorous but also the highest estimate of one year survival is about 12% and in many cases it may actually be lower than that. And so, that 30% number we view as very important. So, we don't see anything concerning with respect to the durability of the responses with Rova-T. So, with respect to the remainder of the Stemcentrx pipeline, there are actually five programs in the clinic now, one of those is Rova-T, two are the Pfizer-partnered programs, PTK7 and Ephrin-A4. And then, there are two other programs in the clinic for solid tumor indications, but we haven't disclosed those targets or the particular tumors of interest at this point in time. In addition to those five, there are five additional assets that will enter the clinic over the next 12 months to 18 months, so by the end of 2017. In the areas of initial interest when one looks at the tumors that we're treating today, will obviously be small cell. There's also a focus on ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer among others.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Jami. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line now is open.
Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much for the questions. First one is just can you elaborate a little bit more on biosimilar dynamics in Europe? Now that we've had some additional experience with both Remicade and early with Enbrel. Just how are volume and price dynamics shaping up there and the impact to HUMIRA? Second was on HUMIRA and maybe the derm business. It sounds like very strong performance in the quarter. But the environment overall seems to be getting more competitive here with the IL-17 seeing some nice uptake. Are you seeing any impact to the business from these competitors? And just how do you think about the outlook for that part of the franchise over time? Thanks very much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Great. Chris, this is Rick. So, I'll cover those. So, let me start with the biosimilar impact because, as you said, we've seen biosimilars certainly with the Remicade biosimilar in the market for quite some time and now we're in the early phases of the launch of Enbrel biosimilars, particularly in the European areas. So, if you look at Remicade, there are Remicade biosimilars now in roughly 60-plus countries, like 62 countries. About 50 of those, a little more than 50 of those, have pricing and reimbursement. So, they are actively involved in marketing the product in those countries. If, we've studied it very carefully, if you look at the overall share of biosimilars it's less than 5%, it's about 4.5%. If you look at their share of Remicade, it's about 20%, 22% something like that. It varies a lot. So, I'd say it's very high in tender based countries like a Norway, Denmark, Poland is an example. Very high market share in those. If you go more into the traditional Western European markets, more like in the 20% to 25% share of the Remicade market. And, the discounting has played out to basically range in the tender countries fairly high, I'd say that 50% to 70% kind of range from a discounting standpoint and then the rest of the market probably in that 30% to 40% kind of range. It hasn't had any impact on us at all. Remicade because it's an infusion product in most of those countries doesn't compete in the same space that we compete in. So, then, you move over to Enbrel. So, Enbrel is approved now. The Enbrel biosimilar is approved in about 32 countries. There's pricing and reimbursement in about a third of those countries right now. We've seen much lower discounting than what we've expected, I'd say. It ranges from as little as low-single digit discounting to maybe up in the 30% to 35% range in non-tender countries, and kind of the high 30%s to high 50%s in the tender countries. Again, it's playing out similar to the way we saw the Remicade biosimilar. So in the tender countries, they are having higher share like the Norways and the Denmarks, Germany, Sweden, single digit kind of share. So, really no substantial market share impact but it's too early in the process for us to see that. I'd say the strategy that we anticipated and the one we put in place seems to be working well but it's the early rounds and you can see it in the performance of the business. You can see HUMIRA's continuing to grow in the international markets. And as you back out the Venezuela impact, you can see that it's actually growing in the 6% or so range, 6.2% range. And so, we're continuing to see good, strong growth in those markets. And so, I'd say the early rounds are working like we had anticipated they would. But we need to give it some more time and see how it plays out. But it's a good opportunity for us to see how our strategy is working and be able to modify that strategy. So, that's essentially the biosimilar impact that we see. Nothing different than what we had expected. Now, let me move over to derm and the impact on 2017. I'd say, overall, we're very happy with our performance in the derm space. So, if you look at the U.S., I'll talk specifically about the U.S., we've seen TRx's grow. In fact, accelerate over the course of time. I mean, if you go back to the early part of 2015 or even look at the average across 2015, we had kind of low double-digit TRx growth. In first quarter and second quarter that's accelerated to like 17% or 18% TRx growth in derm. And so, we're seeing nice strong growth in that segment of the market. If you look at our revenue, a very similar kind of profile, we had strong double-digit growth and now it's accelerated fairly dramatically probably about 10 points to 15 points above what it had been running at. If you look at market share, our overall market share is pretty stable to maybe slight down, 1.5% or so. As we analyze it, it is really driven extensively by the Otezla experience where we're seeing a lot more patients, particularly moderate and sometimes mild patients coming into the category. And so, therefore, the category is growing faster and so that dilutes our market share position. We when pull Otezla out, and we looked at our market share, our market share looks relatively stable. In particular, if you look at PsA, our overall share has been stable in the U.S. at about 32%. If you look at Rheum PsA, it's actually increased about three points, which is the larger part of the PsA market, it's about 75% of the overall PsA market. And even the AS PsA has increased about two points. Psoriasis as I said, it's down about one-and-a-half points to two points in total, but it's more driven by Otezla. So, overall, we feel very good about how the business is performing across all the indications but certainly in derm as well.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Chris. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Next question is from Marc Goodman of UBS. Your line now is open.
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. I was hoping you could give us a flavor for managed care coverage for the key products for 2017, I mean, it's obviously, specifically HUMIRA. And then, could you just give us an update on how you're thinking about AndroGel this days? Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Well, managed care, I mean, we're in really the thick of the negotiations for the 2017 and 2018 timeframe. So, I'm not necessarily going to talk about a lot of specifics because we're in active negotiations on a number of those contracts. But what I would say is HUMIRA has typically had a very, very strong position on managed care and we're not anticipating anything different going forward. But it would be premature to basically talk about a lot of specifics around the contracting, but, I'd say, we feel good about how it is sorting out. On AndroGel, I guess I'm trying to better understand your question. Are you thinking more about follow-on products or are you thinking about the durability of it?
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah. Both. Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. Well, we don't necessarily have a follow-on product. We had some programs that we had been working on and that we ultimately decided to stop. And so, it will be running this franchise out. We're treating it as a typical LOE kind of an asset. And it's performing better than what we had expected but ultimately there will come a time where it will suffer more impact from generic competition. And so, we're basically dealing with it as we would deal with most assets, smaller molecule kind of asset LOEs where we take a large part of the cost out of the product. And manage it for maximum profitability.
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: And Marc, we do continue to see market shrinkage. We've been very pleased with the way that the share has hung in there. And obviously, it's been a nice story this year but we got to watch how this thing plays out as the LOE dynamics proceed.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Marc. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: Next question is Andrew Baum of Citi. Your line now is open.
Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. You've obviously done few very substantial deals within the oncology segment with Pharmacyclics and Stemcentrx. Could you just outline what your appetite is and how you see your oncology franchise broadening out over the next few years? Is it now pausing to integrate the two transactions and set up the trial programs that you need? Or is the appetite still there and you see additional opportunities to address other facets of oncology?
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay, Andrew. This is Rick. So, I'll cover that. And maybe Mike can jump in on some specifics. When we went into – when we made the decision that the core future growth franchise on top of immunology was going to be oncology, we made a decision that we would invest in a way to try to build leadership positions in certain areas where we thought we had core competencies that were complementary to being able to perform in those areas. So, specifically, we started with hematological oncology based on the assets that we had internally as well as the opportunity that existed with Pharmacyclics. And our goal was to be basically build a position where we thought we could drive to a leadership position within that category. So, if you look at the assets we have today including IMBRUVICA and where we think VENCLEXTA will be able to expand to, it would tell us that we should have an opportunity to be able to bring forward innovative therapies in roughly 65% of the overall market in hematological malignancies. And I'd say that's an area where we feel comfortable with what we have. Now, having said that, if we found unique opportunities, I'd say particularly in the acute leukemia side, assets or technologies or a drug that we thought was particularly attractive in an area where we didn't think we had a strong asset already, certainly we would pursue that kind of an asset. But I'd say from a platform standpoint, we feel very good about what we have in hematological malignancies, both internally as well as the addition of Pharmacyclics that we did a year or so ago. On the solid tumor side, as we've said before about Stemcentrx, one of the things that was attractive to us is we have a number of efforts internally to be able to identify new targets, and so we have an effort internally to be able to do that. We obviously have a collaboration with Calico, and part of the work that their doing is to identify new oncology targets, but we wanted a more fundamental base platform for solid tumors, and one of the things that attracted us to Stemcentrx is we believe they have that. And we're excited about that opportunity and Mike talked earlier about the number of candidates that will be moving out of that platform; and I think it's impressive what they've accomplished. And, so, that has built what we fundamentally believe will be the core platform for us in solid tumors, in addition to what we already have. We certainly continue to look for, again, now, more individual kinds of technology plays or assets that might be complementary to that, but we're not looking for another big platform. I don't know. Mike, would you want to add anything?
Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP: I agree with that certainly. When we look at what we've built in terms of the hematological malignancies platform, I think we have the assets we need to drive standard of care not only in the short term, but also, in the longer term. And then when one considers what we've built on the solid tumor side both internally through Stemcentrx and through our partnership with Calico, we feel good about the pipeline opportunities that we'll be able to bring forward over the course of the next several years. We'll always keep our eyes open particularly for earlier technologies, earlier programs things that can add to those efforts, but we feel good about the engine we've built.
Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Andrew. Operator, we'll take the next question please.
Operator: Next question is from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore. Your line now is open.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC: Sorry about that guys. I always have trouble picking up my phone this week. I had a couple of questions. The first is related to Elagolix. There are competitors on the horizon; you're well ahead. There is a drug out there I think from Takeda that's been licensed to be developed in the U.S. and the owners of that drug say it's better than Elagolix because it's QD, once a day, and you can – it's more potent. And most importantly, you can co-formulate it with Add-back. So, I'd love for you to give us your view on Add-back. Is it attractive to have co-formulation or are you guys at a disadvantage or not? And the other question I had was kind of an off the rails question, but I know Henry joined you guys a while back and a lot of people on the Street say great things about him. I'm just wondering will he ever be investor facing? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So, Mark, this is Rick. And I'd say we feel very good about Henry. Specifically, I'll talk myself. Specifically, I feel very good about having Henry as part of the leadership team. And certainly, yeah. I mean, over time I think we will bring Henry in. It will be most relevant when we're talking about those kind of areas where we has direct responsibility for. But Henry has already become an integral part of the leadership team and has contributed significantly. So, Mike, do you want to cover Elagolix?
Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP: Certainly. So, with respect to Elagolix, as you pointed out, Mark, we have a substantial lead, having completed our two pivotal Phase III studies and already being in the process of collecting longer-term data that are necessary to define benefit risk. And we think that is a real advantage for our program, and one that we're going to continue to drive as we drive forward for example with the Add-back program to further enhance the understanding of how we can use Elagolix to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids. With respect to some of the issues you brought up on competitive programs, we don't really view potency as a primary driver here. In fact, the most potent agent in this access is Lupron and the problem is in fact the degree to which that shuts down the access. We're trying to achieve a fine titration of dose. And we believe Elagolix has the properties to allow us to do that. With respect to co-formulation, with Add-back, there is nothing that would prevent us from co-formulating with Add-back as well and we believe over time, there may be a number of strategies that could be used to protect bone and so we'll have flexibility to employ many, many different strategies. So, we feel very good about the position of Elagolix. We think it's an important treatment option and we think that it's going to make a real impact on endometriosis. With respect to relative advantages of a Q day formulation, I think that again depends on the dose one ultimately selects. And I think, when we look at the overall profile of Elagolix, we remain convinced that it's very strong.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC: Can I say one more thing?
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Sure.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore Group LLC: Oh, sorry. Yeah. I wasn't sure if I was muted. Hey – and one shout out to Liz, congrats on getting the IR seat. Thanks for all the help. She's doing great.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we'll take the next question.
Operator: The next question is from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Your line now is open.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So, maybe two. You touched on this a little bit at your R&D day, but just around multiple myeloma and some of the work you guys are doing there and you touched a little bit on VENCLEXTA and moving that one in there. A little bit more just thoughts around that given such a competitive space and what you see as the advantages of moving into there. And then, the other one which you didn't touch much on at the R&D day and I think it's overlooked a little bit is veliparib and there's been a lot of discussions around the PARPs recently. Just curious if you can kind of maybe refresh us on sort of what you feel is the competitive advantages that you may hold or where that's going to sort of fit in relative to the other PARPs that are either on the market or in development? Thanks.
Michael E. Severino - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP: Okay. So, the first part of the question related to multiple myeloma and we have the potential to pursue myeloma with a number of assets in our portfolio. VENCLEXTA has clear potential there and we're advancing that program rapidly as we mentioned during our opening remarks. IMBRUVICA also has potential, as do a number of the molecules in our pipeline. It is a competitive space. One can prolong survival to a much greater extent today than was possible a decade ago. But we still don't have curative therapies. Patients ultimately fail therapy and progress which means that we need new mechanisms that aren't cross-reactive that provide durable disease control. And we think we have a number of those in our pipeline. So, we're aware of the competition certainly. But we think we have therapies that will further the standard of care in that disease and we'll be driving clinical programs forward to demonstrate that. With respect to veliparib, so veliparib is a molecule that is an important part of our overall oncology efforts. It's in Phase III studies across a range of tumor indications. We have a bit of a different hypothesis around the way veliparib should be used than perhaps some of the others who are developing PARPs. We are not focused solely on the use in patients with germline BRCA mutations or other HRD deficient tumors. We are exploring the hypothesis in our Phase III program that PARP can augment DNA damage in chemotherapy; essentially that the first hit doesn't have to come from a genetic hit. It can come from a therapeutic hit that is DNA damaging which would increase the importance of DNA repair mechanisms. That hypothesis is being tested in a range of Phase III programs in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer and in ovarian cancer. And those studies will start to read out in 2017. We'll have a number of important data readouts which will tell us the role that PARP can play there. So, we haven't focused on it as much in recent investor days and that's largely because it is in a quiet period where the studies are up and running. We're generating the results but you'll hear a lot more about PARP in 2017.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Vamil. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.
Operator: Next question is from the David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Your line now is open.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. I have two questions. First, with respect to payers, they are starting to talk about trying to contract for individual indications. And obviously, one area they might be thinking about is alternatives to HUMIRA for certain indications from new drugs that have potentially better profiles than HUMIRA in certain indications. Could you just comment on your perspective on contracting for individual indications in autoimmune disease? And then, second, Rick, I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more detail on the sort of timing and specifics surrounding the patent litigation steps? So, obviously, you're not going to comment on individual patents or individual patent strategies. But as I understand it, there will be immediately after Amgen gets approval of its biosimilar, immediately after that occurs, there will be a wave of patent litigation that kicks in and I was just hoping that you could provide a little bit more perspective on how investors should think about that, and what they should be expecting? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. So, this is Rick. So, let me start with the payer question that you had. Indication-based pricing, I think, first evolved primarily in the oncology space. And it was driven, I think, by certain efforts to say, you'll have an oncology agent that has very strong efficacy in a certain disease, and might have significantly lower efficacy in another disease, and why would I pay the same for this strong efficacy as I would for relatively modest efficacy? I think that was how the concept originally evolved. As we look at HUMIRA, and we look across all of the major indications at least, with every single indication, there's obviously some variation between the competitive profiles. But I'd say, in general, HUMIRA tends to perform across those broad set of indications in the top tier. And so that is how we view it. So, indication-based pricing wouldn't be something that we think is very applicable for this specific asset in this particular class. And we haven't seen it take off much prior to this, and we'll have to see how it plays out over time. There are a lot, it may sound to you like it's a fairly innocent issue around timing and the steps and what should play out, but I would tell you, it's not that from a litigation standpoint. And so I'm just going to need to take the same position I did before. We're not in a position to be able to give you a lot more color. Certainly, we've made it clear what our position is going to be. And I think that will become clearer as the steps play out. But I can't give you a whole lot of color on the timing or what the alternatives would be.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, David.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Operator, we have time for one last question.
Operator: Okay. The last question is from Gregg Gilbert of Deutsche Bank. Your line now is open.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. I want to go back to Bill's comments on HUMIRA growth in the beginning. Clearly, prescription growth has been very robust. But you're also enjoying a really nice pricing tailwind. And I think the net price benefit you saw in the U.S. was about 10% which required, I think, a 20%-plus lift price increase over the year-ago period. So, I'm curious how you would expect that dynamic to play out, both list price increased magnitude and frequency going forward, the ability to realize net price and how you're thinking about that? Seems like a very robust high set of numbers for such a big product. And lastly, Bill, since we don't have a 10-Q, perhaps you could provide cash flow from ops and receivables if you have those handy, would appreciate that. Thank you.
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Sure. Gregg, I think probably the best thing to do is dissect the U.S. number on the quarter for you. And I think that will give you a good sense of the overall dynamics of the brand. And then I'll back up and talk a little bit about the business in general. Obviously, the brand is performing very, very well in the U.S. We grew at 26.7% in the Q. Script trends, the way we see them, we're in the mid-teens for the quarter. Our price was up – it was actually up in the single digits. And then, as I said in my comments, we did see a modest impact from differences in customer order patterns. Again, we run this business at less than half-a-month inventory. But it gets a little tough to call at various times and we did see a little bit of demand differences between the Q. We had a little bit lower inventories in the second quarter of 2015 relative to 2016. So, I think the way you got to think about this is mid-teens growth from script and single-digit price. And when you add those up, you can pretty much get to the 20% number that we've guided to. From a overall price standpoint, look, I would say if you back up and look at our growth on the quarter of 18%, the majority was volume. Across the total book of business, we had a price impact of less than 4%. So, the strategy that we've actually employed for the business and certainly with our new products launching is this is going to be a product, company that's fueled by volume and not price. Obviously price, we do have an opportunity in certain markets to take it, but I would not say this is a company that is heavily dependent on price. And then, as we look out over the LRP, we tend to scale down our price expectations in the U.S. because we think that's the prudent way to model.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. And the only thing I'd add is – on the inventory discussion that Bill had, it's important to keep in perspective both periods were under a half-a-month, but even relatively small variations in a day here or a day there can have some impact on the growth rate. So, what Bill was describing is that the prior period had a inventory level that was below 0.5, right, but it was lower than what the inventory level was this period, which was also below 0.5.
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: From a cash flow and receivable standpoint, again, we're still working on the Q, so I'm not going to specifics there other than to say that cash flow remains very robust and frankly from a receivable standpoint we're collecting fine. So, but I can't give you specifics at this point in time.
Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Liz Shea - Head-Investor Relations: Thanks, Gregg. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a reply of the call, please visit our website at abbvieinvestor.com. Thanks again for joining us.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Henry Gosebruch, our Chief Strategy Officer, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. In addition to our earnings release this morning, we have also issued a press release announcing our acquisition of Stemcentrx. You can find a set of slides on our website that provide an overview of the transaction. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie's operations is included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to the forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll discuss our first quarter performance and provide an overview of the Stemcentrx acquisition, which we announced earlier today. Mike will provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2016 guidance in more detail, including the financial aspects of Stemcentrx' transaction. And as always, following our remarks, we'll take your questions. We delivered another strong quarterly performance, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.15, representing growth of more than 22% versus the first quarter of 2015. Our results included strong operational sales growth of 22.4% driven by a number of products across our portfolio. This includes HUMIRA global operational growth of more than 19%, strong growth from IMBRUVICA, continued global uptake of VIEKIRA, and strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including CREON and DUODOPA. We also continued to deliver improvements in our operating margin profile. In addition to our strong financial results, we also advanced several of our key strategic priorities. Late in the quarter, we secured FDA approval for IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL. We're roughly one month into our first-line launch, and we're pleased with our progress to-date. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, recently published an updated view of its guidelines, granting IMBRUVICA a category 1 recommendation for certain CLL patients, the highest recommendation assigned by the organization. We are also approaching the one-year mark for Pharmacyclics, and we continue to be very pleased with the progress we've made to-date. The Pharmacyclics team continues to rapidly advance trial activity, exploring IMBRUVICA across a broad range of tumor types. IMBRUVICA offers significant growth potential through its expanding list of indications and lines of therapy, and we remain excited about the vast potential for this unique asset. Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for another transformative therapy for the treatment of CLL. Venclexta, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, was approved for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL who harbor the 17p deletion, a difficult to treat form of the disease typically associated with poor prognosis. Based on the level of efficacy in this patient population, the FDA granted the approval under its Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review designations. Since the beginning of the year, we've also reported compelling data from several development programs, including positive top-line results from our second pivotal Elagolix trial in endometriosis and strong data from our next-generation HCV program. Mike will provide updates on both programs during his remarks in just a few moments. We also augmented our pipeline with a late-stage asset with a global collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop and commercialize an anti-IL-23 currently in Phase 3 development for psoriasis and mid-stage development for several additional indications. The agreement provides AbbVie with another potential best-in-class late-stage asset adding to our immunology pipeline, which includes our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, currently in Phase 3 development for RA as well as several other biologics that are in mid-stage trials. Based on its potential for best-in-class efficacy, we believe the BI asset could generate multibillion dollars in peak year revenues across several immune-mediated diseases. Clearly, the most notable and exciting news today is our planned acquisition of Stemcentrx. We could not be more pleased to have this talented group of individuals join our organization. We have been tremendously impressed with their accomplishments to-date, and their innovation and expertise will drive strong benefits for AbbVie going forward. The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically compelling opportunity for our company, our shareholders and the patients which we serve. Over the past several years, we've taken a number of steps to build and strengthen our position in oncology research and development with the objective of becoming a leading oncology company. We've advanced numerous promising pipeline assets, including our BCL-2 inhibitor for blood cancers and our PARP inhibitor, an anti-EGFR antibody drug conjugate in development for solid tumors. We've strengthened our discovery efforts through collaborations with leading academic and other institutions around the world. We've added top talent to our R&D organization. Last year, through the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, we obtained IMBRUVICA, a first in class BTK inhibitor which has already achieved blockbuster status and is on a trajectory to achieve multibillion dollar peak-year sales. And as I mentioned earlier, we just launched our internally developed Venclexta, which adds another transformational therapy to our hematological oncology franchise. We view oncology as a significant pillar of growth for AbbVie going forward. And as we evaluate all opportunities, we do so with the desire to balance near-term performance while continuing to build a portfolio of assets that will generate strong growth in 2020 and beyond, supporting our commitment to drive top-tier performance over the long term. So that brings me to our announcement today, the acquisition of Stemcentrx, which gives AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors and an extremely exciting late-stage asset in Rova-T. The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in hematological oncology. Stemcentrx' proprietary solid tumor platform leverages cancer stem cell biology to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets. The company has demonstrated a track record of successfully engineering and manufacturing antibodies and antibody drug conjugates for those targets. Stemcentrx' lead asset is Rova-T, a DLL3 targeted antibody drug conjugate. DLL3 is a novel target expressed in several tumor types, including small cell lung cancer, an aggressive and difficult to treat disease. Small cell lung cancer accounts for roughly 15% of all lung cancers, and more than 60,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the major developed markets. DLL3 is the first predictive biomarker associated with drug efficacy in small cell lung cancer. It is highly expressed in a majority of small cell lung cancer tumors as well as cancer stem cells, and is not expressed in normal tissue. Predictive biomarkers help identify which patients have the potential to benefit from a therapy. Rova-T is currently in registrational trials for third-line small cell lung cancer. There's a significant unmet need for this patient population as the treatment landscape has not changed for several decades. In fact, there is currently only one approved treatment for second-line small cell lung cancer and no approved agents for third-line use. The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with this type of cancer is unfortunately very low at approximately 6%. Last year at the European Society of (sic) [for] (10:49) Medical Oncology Meeting, Stemcentrx presented exciting Phase 2 results in small cell lung cancer, including data that illustrated an overall response rate of 44% in a DLL3 biomarker-defined population. Rova-T also demonstrated a clinical benefit rate of 78% in this refractory and difficult-to-treat set of patients. Response rates were similar in third-line and second-line patients with a manageable safety profile. These landmark data represent the first time a biomarker targeted therapy has shown significant efficacy in small cell lung cancer. Additional data from a broader set of patients and longer-term follow-up, including compelling overall survival results, will be disclosed during an oral session at the upcoming ASCO meeting in June where the abstract has been selected as a Best of ASCO presentation, a distinction only 1% of abstracts receive. Given the very promising efficacy in third-line small cell lung cancer, Stemcentrx recently filed for FDA Breakthrough designation for this setting. Based on the compelling data and the significant unmet need in this patient population, we're certainly hopeful that we will be successful in obtaining this status. Stemcentrx has moved rapidly through clinical development in third-line small cell lung cancer, from the initiation of the first in-human trials to the recent start of the registration-enabling study. Based on the expected completion of the ongoing registrational trial, commercialization of this indication is expected in 2018. Stemcentrx is also moving to rapidly advance into front-line small cell lung cancer. Mike will provide more detail on the planned first-line program in just a few moments. Like HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we believe Rova-T has the potential applicability across a broad range of indications and tumors. In addition to small cell lung cancer, expression of DLL3 indicates Rova-T may be useful across multiple solid tumor types, including metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme, as well as some prostate, pancreatic and colorectal cancers, among others. There is a significant subset of patients whose tumors are positive for DLL3 expression within this broader set of tumors, representing more than 65,000 patients treated annually. We plan to evaluate Rova-T across numerous indications, leveraging our R&D infrastructure and global clinical trial organization to move rapidly and efficiently. The acquisition of Stemcentrx also broadens AbbVie's oncology pipeline with a portfolio of earlier-stage candidates focused on novel oncology targets. In addition to Rova-T, the Stemcentrx pipeline includes four clinical candidates being evaluated in trials across a range of solid tumors, as well as two additional INDs for new targets planned for 2016 and a broad portfolio of validated pre-clinical targets. Stemcentrx also enhances AbbVie's oncology discovery capabilities. The technology platform that identified Rova-T and the other assets in the Stemcentrx pipeline has strong potential for continued asset generation and will strengthen AbbVie's discovery and development efforts in solid tumors going forward. So as we summarize the transaction, the addition of Stemcentrx is strategically compelling. The acquisition is highly complementary with our growing hematologic oncology franchise and existing portfolio of solid tumor assets. The lead asset, Rova-T, represents a multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity with revenue potentially approaching $5 billion as we advance into first-line small cell lung cancer and other indications. Rova-T has the potential to have a dramatic impact on our growth over the long term. Additionally, Stemcentrx' existing pipeline of additional assets in their R&D engine will augment our future development efforts in solid tumors. Stemcentrx adds to AbbVie's long-term growth prospects, providing another compelling growth platform that will further diversify our revenue base beginning in 2018 and will enhance our EPS growth starting in 2020 and beyond. Stemcentrx fits well within our overall strategy. We have now assembled a significant number of late-stage assets which have been significantly de-risked, have multibillion dollar potential and the potential to drive sustainable growth in 2020 and beyond. Assets including IMBRUVICA, Venclexta, ABT-494, ZINBRYTA, Elagolix, the next-generation HCV combination, our recently in-licensed anti-IL-23, and now Rova-T. All of these assets have a high probability of regulatory and commercial success. In closing, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and strategic advancement. We continue to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes, and we look forward to additional important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. We're off to a strong start this year, and we intend to build upon our momentum to drive a high level of performance across our operations and deliver strong growth in 2016. And we remain committed to delivering on the long-term objectives that we outlined last year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: Thank you, Rick. We had a very productive first quarter from an R&D perspective, with a number of important data readouts, Phase transitions and regulatory approvals, as well as licensing activity. This morning, I'll provide color on some of the key highlights. I'll start by saying that I certainly share Rick's enthusiasm for Stemcentrx, which brings us a promising late-stage program with Rova-T, a pipeline of earlier-stage candidates and a platform technology that will enhance our future solid tumor discovery and development efforts. We very much enjoyed our dialogue with the Stemcentrx team as we've gotten to know them over the past several months, and we've been impressed with the individuals and the innovative platform they've built. Stemcentrx has established an impressive track record. The company's first three clinical stage drugs each represent novel targets with single agent activity demonstrated in the early phase trials in small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, all difficult-to-treat solid tumor indications. Stemcentrx's highly productive discovery effort is driven by the company's core technology, which utilizes a library of more than 700 patient-derived tumor xenograft models and leverages cancer stem cell biology to identify and validate therapeutic targets that would be overlooked by other methods. This platform has yielded impressive results to-date, and we are excited about the potential for continued asset generation, which will aid AbbVie in our R&D efforts going forward. The company's lead asset, Rova-T, represents a significant opportunity not only through its lead indication third-line small cell lung cancer, but also through the potential for expansion into the front-line setting, as well as other types of cancer where DLL3 plays an important role. Stemcentrx has a broad development program for Rova-T currently underway. We've been impressed with the speed with which Stemcentrx has moved through the clinic. It's been roughly four-and-a-half years since target identification and less than three years between filing the Rova-T IND to the initiation of the registration study in third-line small cell lung cancer. The confirmatory third-line trial, which is called TRINITY, began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016, with commercialization expected in 2018. We view the Rova-T small cell lung cancer program as significantly de-risked with a high profitability of success. In addition to the overall response data presented at ESMO last year, which showed an overall response rate of 44% in DLL3 positive patients, the profile of Rova-T is supported by longer-term data, some of which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO meeting. These updated data include promising overall survival findings that compare favorably to historical controls. We believe the full body of data generated to-date are highly compelling and strongly support the value proposition of Rova-T. Stemcentrx is also moving rapidly into front-line small cell lung cancer with Rova-T. The company is on the cusp of initiating a study designed to select the optimal regimen for the front-line registrational program. This four-arm trial will evaluate several permutations of Rova-T and standard-of-care chemotherapy, including both monotherapy and combination arms. Given the compelling data we've seen in small cell lung cancer to-date, we believe there is a high likelihood of successfully moving into earlier lines of therapy. Stemcentrx is also evaluating an eight-arm 400 patient basket study, which will look at Rova-T as monotherapy in patients with a range of tumor types that share neuroendocrine features, including malignant melanoma, medullary thyroid cancer, glioblastoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and forms of prostate cancer and other solid tumors. This study is on track to start enrolling patients this quarter. Additional first-line studies are planned, including a Phase 1 study to assess the safety of Rova-T in combination with antibody therapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, which is on track to be initiated during the second half of 2016. Clearly, prior to the Stemcentrx acquisition, AbbVie was already focused on establishing a strong position in oncology. Since the company was established in 2013, we've added 10 new oncology assets through internal advancement or partnership efforts. The Stemcentrx acquisition accelerates our objective of becoming a leading oncology company. We look forward to spending more time discussing Stemcentrx, including their pipeline, at our upcoming R&D Day in June. In addition to the Stemcentrx acquisition, last week we also announced two early-stage oncology collaborations, including an agreement with argenx for a novel immuno-oncology target, GARP, and an agreement with CytomX to develop Probody drug conjugates, a platform which provides another differentiated opportunity to combine with our strength in antibody drug conjugates. Beyond oncology, as Rick noted, we also recently entered into a global agreement with BI to develop and commercialize risankizumab, an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody in Phase 3 development for psoriasis, and mid-stage development for several additional indications. The collaboration positions this promising asset as AbbVie's lead investigational compound in psoriasis, and complements our robust immunology pipeline. Recent Phase 2 study results for risankizumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis showed improved efficacy over STELARA, a commonly used treatment for this life-impacting skin condition that was included in the study as an active comparator. Specifically, the strong head-to-head results showed that at 12 weeks 81% of patients treated with 180mg of the BI compound achieved PASI 90, more than double the rate achieved by patients treated with STELARA. And 50% of the patients treated with the BI compound achieved complete skin clearance, or PASI 100, versus just 17.5% of the STELARA-treated patients. We're pleased with this level of efficacy as our immunology development strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies with the goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. Beyond the impressive efficacy, this asset also has the potential to offer a favorable dosing profile with subcutaneous quarterly administration. The BI compound is also currently in Phase 2 development for psoriatic arthritis in Crohn's disease, with plans to initiate a Phase 2b study in psoriatic arthritis in mid-2016 and the potential to transition into Phase 3 development in Crohn's disease next year. We will present mid-stage Crohn's disease induction data at the upcoming Digestive Disease Week, or DDW, meeting next month. We've also disclosed positive results for several late-stage programs, including, most recently, additional data on our next-generation HCV regimen. Earlier this month at The International Liver Congress in Barcelona, we presented data on our pan-genotypic, once-daily, ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes 1 through 6, including data on treatment durations as short as eight weeks. The data illustrate that with eight weeks of treatment, 97% to 98% of genotype 1 through 3 patients without cirrhosis achieve sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment. Additionally, 100% of genotype 4 through 6 patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment. We also presented late-breaking data showing our next generation combination drove 100% SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment without ribavirin in treatment naïve genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. While recent advancements in HCV treatment have resulted in high cure rates for many patients, there remain distinct areas of unmet need, including patients with genotype 3. These new data illustrate the potential of our next-generation combination to address this need. Another area of unmet need is patients who have failed previous therapy with direct-acting antivirals, or DAAs, as retreatment options for these patients are limited. We presented data showing that 95% of genotype 1 patients who failed previous therapy with DAAs achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of therapy without the need for ribavirin. The mid-stage data we've disclosed to-date indicates that our new HCV combination can deliver cure rates approaching 100%, and we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an eight-week treatment option. We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half of this year and we remain on track for commercialization next year. We also announced positive top-line results from the second of two replicate pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Elagolix in pre-menopausal women who suffer pain from endometriosis. Trial results showed that after six months of continuous treatment, both doses of Elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints with Elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain at month 3 and month 6. We intend to present detailed results from both Phase 3 trials at a medical conference later this year, and we will complete the clinical database in anticipation of a New Drug Application submission for endometriosis in 2017. We also continue to advance the Elagolix development program in uterine fibroids. During the quarter, we initiated a Phase 3 program investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. As Rick noted, we received two important approvals within our hematologic oncology portfolio as well. The expansion of the IMBRUVICA label into first-line use for CLL and the initial approval of our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta. With IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we now have two therapies on the market for the treatment of CLL addressing a range of patient types. We continue to advance our development efforts for IMBRUVICA, Venclexta and several other assets in our oncology pipeline. We'll present data across a wide range of studies at the upcoming ASCO meeting. We've built a strategic portfolio of oncology assets, including multiple mechanisms of action, that have significant potential alone and in combination. So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical assets, including more than 20 new products or indications in late stage development or under regulatory review. We look forward to covering our full pipeline in more detail at our R&D Pipeline Review to be held in Chicago on June 3. We hope you will join us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Bill?
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thanks, Mike. As Rick said, we are very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Net revenues were up 22.4%, operationally, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin profile by 300 basis points to 43.1% of sales. We reported adjusted earnings per share results of $1.15, up 22.3% over the first quarter of 2015. Strong operational revenue growth in the quarter was in line with our guidance for growth of just above 20%. Foreign exchange had a negative 4.2% impact on revenue in the quarter, also in line with our guidance of roughly 4% negative exchange. We continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of more than $3.5 billion, up 19.2%, operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales were nearly $2.2 billion, reflecting exceptional growth across all three major categories: rheumatology, gastro, and derm. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were nearly $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.6% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact from exchange. This exceeded our previous forecast of 3% operational growth. Currency reduced reported international HUMIRA sales by 9.2%. While early in the launch, the Enbrel biosimilar is tracking in line or favorable to what we had modeled. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $381 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $325 million, and our international profit sharing was $56 million. Global VIEKIRA sales in the quarter were $414 million. The launch of Viekirax, our two-drug, once-daily, ribavirin-free combination for patients with HCV genotype 1b is underway in Japan leading to a continued higher mix of international sales on the quarter. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 36.7% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw continued double-digit growth internationally for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales, as expected. Global Creon sales were $150 million, up 18.2% operationally. Creon continues to maintain its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with the majority of the market share. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 81.3% of sales in the first quarter, which was impacted by the Pharmacyclics transaction and year-over-year impacts of foreign exchange. Excluding these impacts, the ratio was up over 200 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to show improvement in our adjusted operating margin profile, which increased to 43.1% of sales, up 300 basis points. Excluding the impacts of Pharmacyclics and foreign exchange, operating margin improved over 600 basis points versus the prior-year quarter. The majority of this improvement was driven by efficiencies and our rapidly growing top line. Adjusted R&D was 15.6% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline assets. Adjusted SG&A was 22.6% of sales in the first quarter, down significantly from the prior year on a profile basis, contributing to continued improvement in operating margin leverage. Adjusted net interest expense was $200 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 20.7% in the quarter. First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash and tangible amortization expense and specified items, were $1.15, up 22.3% year-over-year. During the quarter, as a result of the economic conditions in Venezuela and the lack of availability of U.S. dollars at the government's official exchange rate, we changed the exchange rate we use in Venezuela to the floating DICOM rate. This resulted in a charge of $298 million related to a devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. This will also impact revenue booked for products sold in Venezuela. I would like to now walk you through the financial aspects of the Stemcentrx transaction. We are acquiring Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion, with the consideration to be paid out as $3.8 billion in equity and $2 billion in cash. The use of equity in this transaction reflects Stemcentrx' management and board of directors' desire to retain a stake in the asset, as well as achieve a tax-deferred structure. Upon closing, we plan to execute an accelerated share repurchase program to reacquire all of the newly-issued equity. We anticipate the transaction to close late in the second quarter. We are forecasting $0.20 of dilution in 2016 as a result of the transaction, which represents a half year of R&D operating and interest expense. We plan to provide specifics on Stemcentrx's impact on our P&L profile during the second quarter earnings call in July. We expect the transaction to generate positive operating margin beginning in 2019 and EPS accretion starting in 2020. Given these facts, we are updating our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.62 to $4.82 to reflect the Stemcentrx transaction. This range reflects EPS growth of 10% at the midpoint and includes the previously-communicated $0.08 dilutive impact of the BI collaboration announced last month. It excludes $0.75 of intangible amortization and specified costs. Specified items related to the Stemcentrx acquisition will be quantified and included on our second quarter call. Regarding the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 to $1.21. This excludes roughly $0.18 of specified items and noncash amortization and includes the BI and Stemcentrx dilution impacts. We are expecting mid-teens operational sales growth, excluding a roughly 2% negative foreign exchange impact on the quarter. As a result, we are expecting low-teens sales growth on a reported basis. We are forecasting 3% operational growth for International HUMIRA in the second quarter. Excluding Venezuela, this growth would have exceeded 5%. We currently expect a negative 4% currency impact on International HUMIRA in the second quarter, resulting in a modest decline year-over-year on a reported basis. However, we remain on track with our previously communicated full-year guidance for HUMIRA outside the U.S., including the mid-single-digit operational growth expected internationally. So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion, while also advancing on our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Bill, and we'll open the call for questions, now. Jay, we'll take our first question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We'll now being the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Good morning, everybody, and thanks very much for taking my questions. So, just for Stemcentrx, just because it's a company we all don't know so well, can you just help us a little bit more on the valuation? Was it primary driven by the last financing round that you cite or other things in terms of peak sales expectations of visible assets that's driving that? Secondly, also, just on that transaction, how much data beyond what's been publicly disclosed, i.e. some of the data perhaps that's coming to ASCO, was management able to see before agreeing to this deal? And then, my last question is just around the upcoming IPR decisions. Can you just confirm timing and expectations there, 18th of May, and do you expect these decisions to be consolidated? And then, just secondly to that, there's a patent adjustment out there that potentially takes the 135 patent out to 2028. If and when that's granted, which seems to be procedural, will you extend your HUMIRA exclusivity guidance on the back of that? Thank you very much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Hi, Jeff, it's Rick. So, I'll take, I guess, all of those questions. So, as it relates to the valuation, I would say it had nothing to do with what their prior round valuation was. That's not how we do acquisitions. Essentially, how we do acquisitions, and you probably recall this from the Pharmacyclics discussion that we had, and I think it's typical within our industry how it's done, is you build a model that ultimately projects out what you think the company and assets can do. And then, off of that model you determine what the return would look like at various price points, what the NPV would look like and, ultimately, you have a threshold at which – the way we do it is we have a threshold at which we say we won't go above. And then, we get into the process and ultimately try to validate those assumptions and make a decision as to whether or not we want to go forward. And if we want to go forward, then we'll obviously negotiate as hard as we can to try to get it at the lowest possible price, but most of these are a competitive kind of situation. So what I would tell you about this transaction is that I believe it is at a very good valuation for us. It has a good NPV based on the base case, which was essentially on second- and third-line small cell lung cancer and a couple of other indications, and it has significant upside if we move to first-line or more broadly across those cancers that are DLL3 positive. Now, those trials are ongoing, so we don't have that data; so we didn't necessarily build all of those in. If that were to occur, you probably saw there's a CDR for first-line that the investors would receive. But I would tell you first-line will have a very, very strong NPV above and beyond what we factored in here. But with the base case, this has a very good NPV and a very good IRR. So I can just tell you I feel good about the valuation. As far as the data is concerned, we have seen a significant amount of data above and beyond what is public now. We obviously need to be careful about what we talk about, because some of that data will be presented at the ASCO meeting. I think we've given you a pretty good idea of what you're likely to see at the ASCO meeting, but I can tell you that we have seen all the data that was available to the management team and we're impressed with that data. So I can tell you I'm very, very excited. We've looked for quite some time, now, for a solid tumor platform play, and they're hard to find in this market. And I think if you look at the productivity of this group and the novel therapeutic targets that they have been able to come up with, and their hit rate on those targets is significantly above industry average, and the way they approach it is pretty impressive, and the fact that this is focusing to a great extent on cancer stem cell. And I think there's a strong belief that if you can knock out in certain cancer stem cells, you can dramatically impact the course of that disease for those patients. And I think the data will speak for itself when it's available, and you can take a look at it. So we're impressed with this. I think – we think Rova-T is a very good asset and gives us a good strong position in solid tumors going forward. On the IPRs, as we've said before, we're not going to talk a lot about the process now that we're in litigation. I can answer maybe one or two of these questions. We don't have the ability to predict the timing. You have the date correct, that you described. So it should occur sometime no later than that date. We don't know whether they'll be consolidated or not. And we're not going to comment on the issuance of the patent and what we would do in that scenario. Okay?
Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC: Thanks very much, and congratulations on the deal.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Yeah. Thanks, Jeff. Next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple on the deal today. Maybe first, can you just talk about the competitive landscape for the DLL3 target or just other companies working on cancer or stem cells as an ADC target? Second question was on the $0.20 of dilution this year. I'm just trying to get a sense of what this is going to look like out in 2017. Should we be thinking about something larger than $0.40 as we get the full year impact and as you ramp R&D associated with these assets? And then, the final one was just, post this deal, can you just give us some sense of the position the company is to pursue larger transactions if the right opportunity were out there? Should we think about Stemcentrx is the type of size and profile you're looking for? Or could you look to get more aggressive as the year kind of – or as we go to 2017 if the right deal is out there? Thanks so much.
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: So, this is Mike. I'll take the first question with respect to the competitive environment for Rova-T and some of the other programs that Stemcentrx has been working on. And what I'll say is that one of the things that really impressed us with Stemcentrx is the novelty of their platform. They've invested early in this technology. They have developed great expertise. And they are out in the lead in all of the areas that they're pursuing. So DLL3 is out in the lead. It's demonstrated very compelling results, and we think it's an asset that has tremendous promise and will really change the standard of care. And I think if you look at all of the programs that Stemcentrx is advancing, there's a high degree of novelty and very strong signs of activity from the first three clinical programs. So, we vary – we feel very good about their position in the competitive environment.
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So on the dilution, as we've said, the $0.20 this year represents roughly a half year of the current burn rate that Stemcentrx is showing as well as the additional financing costs. I think 2017, we need to get in and look at the clinical programs, but obviously we are going to invest appropriately on Rova-T and the other assets in order to maximize the value of the asset. What's nice about this transaction, though, is in 2018 we're going to be bringing a product to market. And we think, given the clinical data that has been shown so far, we're going to have a fairly impressive uptake on Rova-T. And that will offset that dilution pretty quickly. And in 2020, we see the deal being accretive.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Chris, this is Rick. The only thing I'd add on the – I know what you're trying to do. You're obviously trying to model – or incorporate into your model what the R&D impact will be on 2017. I think that's what you're trying to do, based on your question. And I'd say, as we factored in this number and as we look at 2017, it certainly incorporates the assumptions that we've made around the expansion into other tumors that are DLL3 positive. It incorporates what Mike described as the first-line trials that ultimately they're pursuing with Rova-T. The one part that it probably does not include at this point, and we just need to work on it some more, would be we also believe that this could be a synergistic strategy in first-line with immunotherapy. And they have walked us through a plan where, potentially, as an example, Rova-T could be a highly specific debulking agent on the front end for DLL3 positive patients in small cell; and knocking out the stem cells in the process, which traditional chemotherapy does not do today. And then, you would get the disease under control and debulked and you would follow it with immunotherapy for longer-term maintenance. And so, they've laid out some plans around that, and that has not been incorporated to this point. So that would be the only thing. Now, we obviously have a significant R&D budget and we would look at how we normally do R&D – is we add everything up, and then we make a decision where we draw the line, and we're going to be conscious of that. So I'm not telling you that would be incremental, but what I'm telling you is that's the one thing that's outside the scope of what's in the current R&D planning assumptions. So, hopefully that gives you some clarity around that. On the M&A front, similar to the comments that I made earlier, we have been looking for a solid tumor platform. I think we made that somewhat clear that that was something we were interested in doing. I would say this came in at a valuation that was significantly below the numbers that we had flagged before. But we are looking to balance near-term performance against making sure that we build a significant portfolio of assets out in that 2020 and beyond period that can contribute to delivering strong EPS growth and strong revenue growth. But I'd say where we are right now is we have a lot of things going right now and we've filled a lot of the needs that we have. And so, I would not expect that we will go out and do another significant transaction. And – obviously, Pharmacyclics was a significant transaction, but I'm talking about even a transaction of this size. So I think for the next, certainly, 18 months or so, if we were to do anything, it would probably be more of a BI kind of transaction, more of a single asset; might be an in-licensing kind of a transaction. And I think, based on the fact that we have delivered some level of dilution here, we would have to be in position we would absorb the dilution going forward. So, hopefully, that answers your question.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's great. Thanks so much for the color.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: All right, thanks. Next question, please, operator.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. I just want to follow up on some of the Stemcentrx questions; and congratulations. But clearly the whole, sort of, stem cell based focus has been fraught with challenges, and I'm just wondering maybe if you could reply to the specific questions. What gives you confidence that findings from mouse models translate to human cancers? And also, what gives you confidence that small cell lung cancer data will translate to other tumor types? And was also curious to know how Stemcentrx's ADC technology differs from other ADC players. And then, a follow-up question, and sorry about this, but just to follow-up on an earlier question, if you could kind of play out the scenario of the upcoming IPR, which investors are obviously highly focused on, what is the right analytical framework, Rick, that we should think about this in the event that, A, the IPR is heard, or it is dismissed, just in relation to the overall IP picture and duration of HUMIRA? Thanks very much.
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: All right. So, I will – this is Mike. I will take the first of those, and then Rick may want to add some follow up. So with respect to cancer stem cells, what I would say is we've had a fair amount of time to get very comfortable with the platform that Stemcentrx has developed. And we believe that they are doing something really novel here. In terms of understanding how mouse models might translate into human clinical trials or, ultimately, clinical benefit, we certainly recognize that that translational leap is often fraught with peril, but in this case we don't have to wonder. We've seen the first three assets move into the clinic showing strong activity. And so, they have demonstrated with their first three clinical assets activity in small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. So there are human data to back up their hypothesis, not only one time, but three times in a row; and, obviously, being right three times in a row in this business doesn't happen by chance very often. So with respect to our confidence that small cell lung cancer will transfer to other cancers, the set of cancers that we're talking about all share neuroendocrine features, as does small cell. And Stemcentrx has done a large amount of work to understand the role that DLL3 plays biologically in these tumors. And we know, based on the work that they have done, that DLL3 is playing the same role across these tumors. And so, that's why we have much greater than average confidence that what we're seeing in those preclinical studies in other tumors will translate into the basket study that they are running. So, as Rick said, we've seen a lot of data here and we feel very good about this opportunity. With respect to the ADC landscape, Stemcentrx has shown that they are very good at generating highly selective monoclonal antibodies that make good reagents for ADCs, and they also have the linker technology and the toxin technology all fully integrated within their company to rapidly produce these ADCs. And, again, I would say that their clinical track record speaks for itself. So with that, I'll turn it over to Rick for the other questions.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. I mean, I guess the only thing I'd add on that first set of questions, Jami, is the reality is human data trumps everything else in our business, right? So I think you can interpret from that we had to get comfortable with the human data that we saw and the impact that it had to make the decisions that we made. And as that comes out, I think you'll draw your own conclusions, obviously, but I think that will be informative as it comes out for you, okay? I want to make sure I understand your IPR question, so I'm going to ask you to ask it one more time.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. So I just want you to kind of frame the landscape for us, because investors are hyper-focused on this upcoming Coherus IPR. If the IPR is thrown out, I think that's pretty clear. But if it is heard, help us to understand the significance of that in the context of your overall IP surrounding HUMIRA.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Thank you. If you think about this process, the process we will go through is that the Patent Office makes a decision whether or not there is enough evidence to even review the patent. That's the process that's going to occur here in the May-June timeframe with the IPRs. And so, all it is is, is there enough in the claim of the company challenging the IP to even make a decision to review it? If the Patent Office decides that is the case, then they will review it; and there'll be a process that we go through that's well documented of how we defend the patent, and the process that the challenger would go through as well. That takes about 12 months. So at the end of 12 months there would be a decision on the patent. And depending upon which way that decision went, if it went for us, then obviously the patent would be upheld and would be, obviously, strengthened dramatically. If not, then we have the right to appeal. So that's the process. And I think that essentially defines sort of the implications of the process. If it gets turned down on the front end similar to what the formulation patent with Amgen did, then obviously that creates a very significant hurdle for the company that's challenging it. So those are the implications of it.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Jami. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much, and congrats on the news this morning. I have three questions. First, with respect to Stemcentrx, could you just talk about how you plan to integrate and retain the employees now that they're going to be part of a much larger pharmaceutical company. Second, could you explain the Stemcentrx-Pfizer partnership and how you expect that to evolve? And then, as an aside, AbbVie doesn't talk much about your 50-50 funding along with Google of Calico, but obviously you have made a significant investment there and Calico is quite an interesting company given its leadership. Could you just update us on the pipeline at Calico as well, please? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So, David, this is Rick. I'll take probably the first of those and maybe some part of the second. I may ask Henry to chime in on the second part. And I'll take the Calico one for you. So, I mean, obviously, an important part of these kinds of companies is retaining the people. And – particularly, when you think about this kind of a company where a lot of the intellectual property of the company is that, right? It's the intellectual horsepower of the people. And I would say we have been interacting with Stemcentrx, now, for a number of months, well before this process started. And so, we've had a chance to get to know the team and get to know the leadership within the team. And they had a decision to make, right? They could have gone down the IPO route. They could have collaborated with somebody and gone down the IPO route, if they wanted to. And I think, based on the kind of asset they have in Rova-T, they certainly would have had – even in a tough IPO market as it is today, I think they would have had the ability to be able to do that; or they could do a transaction like the transaction we ended up doing with them. And I think one of the deciding factors for them was what they're really good at and what they love doing is essentially going in and discovering novel markers and creating drugs; so, going through the discovery and early development process. And they demonstrated they can do that in a highly efficient and effective way, and they can do that very, very rapidly. If they went down the IPO route, they had to basically build all the other infrastructure that a fully-integrated business would need to have, including all the commercial and medical affairs and global clinical development groups in order to be able to execute a fully-integrated strategy. And I think as they looked at that, I think they had confidence that they could do it, but it would be a tremendous amount of effort on their part and their leadership team to be able to do that. When they looked at coming together with us, they ultimately said, look, we can do the part that we think we're great at and we can plug in to what you already have for all those other things, the global clinical development group that we have, the medical affairs group that we have all around the world, the commercial organization that we have all around the world. And so, I think they perceived it to be a win-win. So I think that's the first thing. Winning their hearts and their minds through that process, I think, was an important aspect of it. Second aspect of it was that, obviously, the CVRs – all of the leadership team and many of the employees have either ownership in the company or they have – and they have stock options, right? So these CVRs are pretty important to them. They can extract a tremendous amount of value through that process if they deliver against those CVRs, and I can tell you that's a pretty healthy financial incentive for them to stay and execute against those. And I can tell you, in the interactions that I had with them – we had with them, I should say, I can tell you that's an important point to them. Third thing is they wanted this stock transaction. Now, they wanted it somewhat for tax purposes, but they also wanted it because they wanted to believe that they could share in the upside. And some of what they agreed to do with their options only reinforced that, meaning their Stemcentrx options and what they we will become and how that value will be derived. And so, I think there's a very high likelihood that we will retain the key people in this, and I think they like our culture and they like the environment that we're operating in. And so, I'd tell you I have a fairly high level of confidence. And I think Pharmacyclics demonstrates – we have retained all of the key clinical development people. And I've spent time, Mike has spent time with that team. I think they're very happy being part of AbbVie and they get to execute their strategy that they wanted as an independent company as well or better than they could have as an independent company. So I feel pretty good about that, but it's an important point. On the Pfizer transaction, it's something we want to be careful with because I'm not sure what their confidentiality agreement is. Henry, you want to comment anything on it?
Henry O. Gosebruch - Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Just to be clear, Pfizer does not have any rights to Rova-T at all. We did put out some slides this morning and you see that there's four additional assets in Phase 1. And obviously, there's a number of late pre-clinical assets behind there. Two of these assets Pfizer has some rights to, but we really can't go into further details on how those deals are structured; but again, to be clear, that is the extent of the Pfizer relationship.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And of the two assets, they can opt-in.
Henry O. Gosebruch - Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President: Correct. They can opt-in back in one of them.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, therefore, we can opt-in back on one of those if we choose to. So I think that probably gives you as much as we can give you around the Pfizer compounds. On Calico, I'm going to have Mike talk a little bit about the pipeline, but that is a transaction that we did about a year or so ago, now. And when you look at the individuals that Calico first started-up with, Art and Hal and others, they've assembled a very talented team. And that's – that was the big reason that we ultimately decided to do something with them. But essentially what we have is we co-fund a discovery effort to find new innovative targets in a number of different areas. Oncology is one of them; diseases of the aging is another. Neurodegenerative diseases is another area that ultimately we have a lot of interest in. And the way it works is, essentially, we can opt-in on anything that's discovered there, and there's a point at which we take it over. We have commercial rights to it, and then there's basically a 50/50 profit sharing arrangement between us and Calico. So, essentially, we have rights to anything over a certain period of time that is discovered within Calico. Mike works closely with the team, so I'm going to ask him to talk a little bit more about progress that they're making.
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: Sure. So one of the things that I think is very important to note in the Calico collaboration is that there's a very strong scientific and cultural fit between our teams. And that was one of the real drivers behind doing that deal. The Calico team is obviously very talented. They have a long and very successful track record. Our teams are working together very well. We're advancing a number of programs. But, of course, we do need to keep in mind that these are early discovery programs that have been initiated in the last 12 months to 18 months. So we intend to move very quickly, but it takes a bit of time before programs are ready for clinical introduction and the sort of news flow that would – you'd expect to hear in this sort of setting. So what I would say is the cultural fit is great. We've made great progress building up a set of programs in the areas that Rick mentioned that I think are a very good fit for our overall strategy, and we remain very optimistic about the Calico partnership.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: All right. Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Marc Goodman, UBS. Your line is now open.
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC: Yes, morning. Maybe we can talk a little bit about just the business for a sec. VIEKIRA was a little bit weak. Maybe you can talk about the U.S. versus international, how Japan is doing. U.S. seems to be falling off quite a bit; I mean, we're just losing share. Give us a sense of what's going on there. Second, HUMIRA in the U.S., I was just curious – obviously, we've seen quite a few price increases if you look out over the past 12 months, and I was curious whether you are still being able to get the same amount of price dropping to the bottom line as you have been in the past, if there was more pressure on that? And then, third, can you give us an update on what we're going to see at ASCO for the broader portfolio? Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, Marc. Okay. So, this is Rick. I'll take VIEKIRA , and Bill can take the HUMIRA question, and we'll have Mike cover the ASCO question. So, VIEKIRA, let me start with Japan. I mean, Japan is continuing to track consistent with our expectations, so I think there's nothing all that remarkable from Japan. It's a good market, and our profile within that market is a good profile. The U.S. has certainly been more challenging. I would say that it's a combination of several factors, some volume loss as well as some price loss. As Merck has entered the market, we know that they set the list price lower than the other products in the marketplace. That strategy, initially, I think we interpreted as a strategy that would go after medical exceptions, because medical exceptions historically are in at more of a list price point. And so, they have the lowest price, essentially, on a medical exception basis. And they have been somewhat successful in gaining some of those medical exceptions. So that's part of the issue. The second part of the issue, though, is they have been more aggressive than we anticipated from a pricing standpoint, particularly in the public segments, the VA in particular. And as we looked at that, we ultimately made the decision that we were not going to compete with the lowest overall price in the VA. We did adjust our price down, but we didn't adjust it down to the very lowest price. And that has caused us to obviously lose price, but also lose volume. And we had a fairly significant share of VA. So I think it is those factors playing out. And I would say that, based on where the U.S. is going, it is unlikely that we will achieve the $2 billion number that we described earlier. I think a number that you should be thinking about now is more in the $1.6 billion range; globally, I'm talking about. And you can look at this quarter as an example. Even though VIEKIRA was weaker than we expected, we obviously beat our EPS number and achieved our revenue numbers. So I talked to strength of the rest of the business; and that's the nice thing about our business is we have good balanced performance across a number of different assets. And so, when one thing doesn't go as well as we had hoped, then others can pick up the slack. So we will not be changing our guidance based on this. We've factored that into our going-forward guidance in 2016 and we're comfortable with the guidance that we've provided you, but those are the facts around VIEKIRA.
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: So, Marc, on HUMIRA pricing in the U.S., look, obviously, we continue to put up pretty impressive numbers in the U.S. If you look at Script trends, it was up over 16%. So there's a – the majority of the increase in Q1 is related to volume, but price is a component. Now, the category has taken some price in the last four months or five months; we did as well. And we don't see any major shift relative to what we've been experiencing over the last few years, but obviously we're keeping our eye on it.
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: So with respect to ASCO, we'll obviously be seeing the Rova-T data that we've talked about in small cell lung cancer, which is a Best of ASCO presentation. Venclexta also has a Best of ASCO presentation, which comes from the program in AML in combination with hypomethylating agents. There are nine additional abstracts for Venclexta that'll be presented, updating across the range of studies that are being conducted with that molecule in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other settings as well. You'll start to see additional data from ADCs that we're introducing into the clinic. There'll be updated data on ABT-414. You'll start to see data on some of our newer ADCs and we continue to have a number of programs that will be moving into clinical development in oncology. So, overall, we're going to be active at ASCO and, of course, we're also having our R&D Day to coincide with the timing of ASCO. So you'll see a broad update on our pipeline there.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Marc. Appreciate it. Operator, next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Baum, Citigroup. Your line is now open.
Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Hi. Three questions, please. First, on the Stemcentrx transaction, could you provide a little bit more detail on the earn-outs? The press release references milestones, and you mentioned in passing the first-line indication, but if you could provide some more granularity that would be great. Second, I would imagine this was a competitive auction just given – well, especially as Stemcentrx just got a finance professional as their CEO and there's several high-profile tech investors involved. Perhaps, you could just give us some sense of the competitive dynamics as you think about valuation. Second, in reference to your comment on your IL-23, you highlighted it as your priority compound in psoriatic arthritis. What's the future of ABT-122? Do you intend to proceed in either psoriatic arthritis, or is psoriasis or in RA for that compound? And then, finally, more broadly, now that you've got a lung candidate in your oncology pipeline, how you think about augmenting that compound going forward.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Andrew.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, Andrew – Henry, why don't you cover the milestones, and then we can talk a little bit about first-line.
Henry O. Gosebruch - Chief Strategy Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. Hey, Andrew. So there are in total $4 billion of milestones. $2 billion relate to the first-line approval that Rick talked about. So that approval is $2 billion and is qualified by a favorable position in the guidelines at the time. And as Rick talked about, we believe that would create significantly more value than that $2 billion. In addition, there is a second $2 billion, and that relates to four individual $500 million milestones, so totaling $4 billion, and those are for the commencement of registration trials for additional assets in indications that would be at least $1 billion in revenue potential. So that is $500 million each for a total of $2 billion, and then with the first-line, $4 billion in total.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: So, on those second set of milestones, just to be clear, they're individually earned, right? So if they take one asset and they move it through and we take it to a registration study and we determine that that asset in that indication would generate a commercial asset that had greater than $1 billion worth of revenue, then we would pay them $500 million. And then, if they do a second one or a third one and a fourth one, they can get up to four $500 million milestones. So that's how the contingent – or the contingent payments are laid out. On the competitive dynamics, it was a competitive process. It was relatively blind to us, so we don't know who the other competitors were; but we do know there were other players that were involved. And I'd say it ended up being us and one other player at the very end who were competing for the asset through that process. And ultimately, as I told you on the valuation, it's consistent with what I described to you before. If you look at what we are paying in the base case for this asset and you look at the base case forecast without first-line in it, it has a significantly positive NPV and well above the threshold at which we look at the cutoff for IRRs. And so, this is a transaction that we feel very comfortable with from a financial standpoint. And we've obviously built-in the upside for first-line because we don't have data on first-line right now. And we're not going to – we didn't want to be in a position where we're paying for something that we didn't know what it was going to look like. We were very comfortable with second- and third-line because we saw data that supported that – human data that supported that. I do believe, based on everything I've seen, and I think Mike and others believe that there is a high probability this asset will move into first-line; but we're going to pursue it aggressively. And if they do, they will get the incremental reward and we will, obviously, get the incremental award of being able to move into that. And we have specified where – how the guidelines have to characterize the asset: that it would be a broad-based first-line agent in order for that milestone to be paid. On the BI and ABT-122, Mike, why don't you cover that?
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: Certainly. So the BI compound, which is now called risankizumab, the IL-23 antibody, is our lead asset in psoriasis, and I think the data clearly bear that out. And I think, based on what we know about the pathway, it makes sense to make that same statement about psoriatic arthritis. We're very pleased with the data we've seen today. We think there's really tremendous potential for that asset. With respect to ABT-122, which is our IL-17 TNF DVD, we are going to be seeing mid-stage data internally the middle of this year; so, shortly. We'll probably be in a position to present that externally around the ACR timeframe. And so, we'll make a decision when we have those data. But what I can say is, to move forward with those molecules, it would have to fit our strategy with that molecule, with ABT-122. It would have to fit our strategy to raise the bar in the standard of care. So we would be looking through differentiated efficacy compared to not only what we have in our own portfolio, but what's available externally. And so, we'll be making that decision later on this year. With respect to your question about our presence in lung cancer, we've said for quite some time that we want to build our presence in solid tumors. I think the Stemcentrx acquisition clearly does that. It gives us a broad platform as well as a very promising lead asset and other clinical assets behind that. And so, we're going to continue to build on that presence, not only with the development engine that comes from Stemcentrx, but with our internal pipeline. And I think you'll see that we have a number of programs that could be applicable to lung cancer and other solid tumors that will be moving through the clinic, shortly.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. And then on the M&A, it's consistent with what I described earlier. We'd be looking for those kinds of assets. We continue to evaluate things that are in the marketplace. We've built a fairly extensive pipeline internally and – but obviously we continue to look on the outside for those assets that look interesting. And – but it will be of a profile – an investment profile of what I described to you a moment ago.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Andrew.
Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Jay, we'll take our next question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.
John Scotti - Evercore ISI: Good morning. This is John Scotti in for Mark. I just have a few questions, if I may.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Hey, John.
John Scotti - Evercore ISI: First – hey, Larry. The first on Stemcentrx. So I recall last year when you purchased Pharmacyclics with IMBRUVICA, you gave a lot of helpful color on how you built up in your model to the peak sales – your end-user peak sales estimate for IMBRUVICA. You sort of broke out by indication, line of therapy, and gave some color on risk adjustment. Do you think you could do the same thing here for Rova-T and the $5 billion number you've put out there in terms of what year do you model peak, are you talking small cell alone, other indications and sort of give some more granular color on how you built up to that number? And then the second question, now that you have purchased Stemcentrx and you've in-licensed the IL-23 from BI, can you give a little bit more color on how you see the R&D line evolving over the next few years? So, specifically, with regard to 2020 guidance, are you going to be able to keep – hold, essentially, the greater than 50% non-GAAP operating margin guidance that you've given previously or should we expect that to have to come down a bit below what you've given? Thank you so much.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, John.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. As far as the model, obviously, we went through the model in some level of detail around Pharmacyclics, one, because of the magnitude of the investment that we were making, and we described what supported that investment and how we built up the model. What I characterized for you already basically tells you how we built this model, right? It's built primarily around second- and third-line small cell, which we believe has a very high probability of success. So you can imagine we've risk-adjusted it, accordingly, at a high probability of success. It does have a couple of other smaller indications where we believe there is a very high probability of being able to extend it into some of these other cancers that we described. I wouldn't say that has a significant impact on it, and those are risk-adjusted, accordingly. It doesn't have first-line in it, and the milestone, or the CVR, is basically driven off of what we think the value would be and the return would be appropriate for first-line; and it doesn't have any other of these other milestone-driven POCs that would come forward. So I think that's roughly the same kind of guidance. We gave share and some other kinds of things, and we've obviously built the model around those same kinds of assumptions. But I think, in this case, we'll wait to provide that at a later date once we get closer to a launch of the asset in 2018. On the R&D line – or I think really what you're asking is are we still committed to delivering 50% or greater in 2020? And the short answer to that is, yes. We've looked at it. We've carefully looked at the commitments we've made around the compounded growth rate and the revenue projections as well as the operating margin profile that we communicated last year, and we're still absolutely committed to delivering against that.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks a lot, John. Operator, we have time for one final question, please.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Alex Arfaei, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions. Rick, just following up on some of the earlier questions, the Street has obviously taken a significantly more cautious view relative to your long-term guidance, particularly for HUMIRA. Do you see anything changing in the near future that would allow investors to have more confidence in your long-term guidance? And I guess what I'm asking is, basically, are we going to go through this long drawn out process where we're going from one HUMIRA hearing to another? Or do you see a point where it becomes clear that you can hold off HUMIRA biosimilars in the U.S. for as long as you believe you can? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: I think there's two ways to look at it. I mean, first of all, if you look at the guidance that we provided back in, I think it was October 29 of last year, and you look at what happened to the consensus numbers, what you'll see is they shifted out roughly a year. I think the mean now is probably – if you look at where people are assuming biosimilar impact in the United States, it's probably in that 2019 – Larry, correct me if I'm wrong here, that 2019 timeframe; so, it moved out from about 2017 to 2019. And I'd say one of the things we track to try to understand how the market is perceiving that guidance is we track what our stock performance has been versus our peers over that period of time. And I saw it just the other day. It may have changed in the last couple of days a little bit, but we're the number one performing stock since that point in time. So I think it was around 14% appreciation, or something like that; 15% appreciation. So I think it did have a positive impact. Having said that, I would agree with your point that there's still this overhang and this overhang is built around different catalysts. As we've said before, we've given a lot of clarity in that review of what our IP strategy is and the confidence that we have in our IP strategy. How the market will relate to that, that's a little harder for me to describe or predict, I'd say. But certainly, I think, as it plays out, I think the market will basically start to better understand what our position is. And certainly, as you have more confidence around that, I think you will see the sentiment change. I think the bigger issue – and I think Rova-T and the IL-23 are two good examples. Look, we obviously have a point of view of what we think is going to happen. We've communicated what that point of view looks like, I think, in very clear terms. That doesn't mean that everybody believes that point of view. But what I'd say is, if you look at even the bear case on HUMIRA, which we certainly don't agree with, and you look at this pipeline that we've now assembled of assets that have a very high profitability of success, I think even in the most bear case possible, most people would look at that pipeline and say, they should be able to grow through whatever happens. Now, obviously, we have a different view of what we think is going to happen, but even if you look at – at least the models I've looked at that have the worst case built into them, when I look at our pipeline and the probability of success of those assets I described in my formal remarks, and you just add them up and risk-adjust them based on the data you've seen and the commercial success you would expect from those assets, I think a reasonable person would draw the conclusion that you can grow through that. And I think that ultimately will be the calculus that investors are going to have to make.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Alex. And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at abbvieinvestor.com. Thanks, again, for joining us.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Also on the call with me are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie's operations is included in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll briefly discuss our fourth quarter performance, and our 2015 operational highlights. Mike will then provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will discuss the quarter, and our 2016 guidance in more detail. As always following our remarks, we'll take your questions. We delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter, with results ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, representing growth of 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2014. Our fourth quarter performance caps off a very strong year for AbbVie, with sales and earnings well above our original projections for the year. We delivered 22% global operational sales growth in 2015, and we increased ongoing earnings per share by more than 29%. We've driven strong commercial, operational, and R&D execution, resulting in industry-leading performance, with both strong revenue growth and improvement in our operating margin profile. AbbVie's EPS growth for 2015 ranks us among the top growth companies in our industry. Clearly, 2015 was a year of excellent performance. We delivered outstanding results from our current portfolio, with strong growth from HUMIRA, which drove 19% global operational growth in 2015, including U.S. growth of nearly 29%, and international operational growth of 8.6%. We saw continued strong momentum from IMBRUVICA, with full year 2015 sales in excess of $1 billion. Global VIEKIRA performance, although below our original expectations, generated more than $1.6 billion in its first year on the market and we had strong performance from other products in our portfolio including Creon, LUPRON, and DUODOPA. Over the past year, we've seen significant pipeline advancement and achieved a number of important development and regulatory milestones. We secured approvals for several assets including HUMIRA as a treatment for HS, our once-daily HCV combination in Japan, and our partner received approval for elotuzumab for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. We successfully completed registrational studies and submitted regulatory applications for a number of programs including venetoclax for relapsed refractory CLL, IMBRUVICA for first-line CLL, ZINBRYTA for multiple sclerosis and HUMIRA for uveitis. We successfully completed mid-stage clinical trials and transitioned into the registration enabling phase of development for several key programs including our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494 in RA, our pan-genotypic next-generation HCV combination Elagolix for uterine fibroids and ABT-414, our antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme. We also reported compelling data from several development programs including Elagolix pivotal data in endometriosis, the HELIOS and RESONATE-2 IMBRUVICA data which we anticipate will be reflected in the product label this year and venetoclax data in several cancer types including robust results in CLL and AML. In fact, the data we presented on venetoclax this year has resulted in three breakthrough therapy designations, a status granted by the FDA when clinical evidence indicates that a medicine may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies. We believe venetoclax has significant potential across a wide range of blood cancers with the first of potentially numerous indications coming in the first half of this year. The progress we've made with our pipeline including the impressive data we've shared over the past year has further increased our level of confidence and de-risked many of our key R&D programs. Numerous assets in our late-stage pipeline have the opportunity to generate multibillion dollar peak-year sales and represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. 2016 promises to be another milestone filled year with significant activity across our pipeline which Mike will discuss in more detail here in just a few moments. In 2015, we also augmented our portfolio and our pipeline through strategic licensing and acquisition activity. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics provided a major new growth platform in a key strategic area, hematological oncology. IMBRUVICA which is now a blockbuster therapy offer significant growth potential towards existing and expanding list of indications and lines of therapy. We remain excited about the potential for IMBRUVICA and we are pleased that our thesis is playing out as we expected. Within the hematological oncology segment, we have invested strategically to build a portfolio of medicines with the potential to transform the care of a large range of malignancies. Our portfolio includes three novel mechanisms of action; BTK inhibition, Bcl-2 inhibition; PI3 kinase dual inhibition. These mechanisms are either on market, under regulatory review, or in registration enabling trials. We're well positioned to build upon our leadership in this category with unique combinations of these and other agents. Over the past year, we've delivered a strong return of capital to our investors, including a rapidly growing dividend, which is growing 42% since our inception, as well as share repurchase. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, returning cash to shareholders while continuing to add strategically to our pipeline. Following our acquisition of Pharmacyclics last year, our focus in the near-term is on continuing to augment our therapeutic areas of focus especially oncology and immunology. We evaluate opportunities that fit our strategic criteria and can deliver strong returns. In 2015, we also drove improved efficiency across our operations, delivering significant operating margin expansion while continuing to invest in R&D and SG&A to drive future growth. We have delivered a significant level of margin expansion to-date, and we remain committed to doing more to improve our operating margin profile going forward. Our focus on operating efficiencies will drive our adjusted operating margin profile to greater than 50% by 2020. We've entered 2016 with strong momentum which we intend to build upon to drive a high level of performance across our operations and strong growth. Our full-year 2016 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.10 represents growth of 16.5% at the midpoint, positioning AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for EPS growth once again this year. On our third quarter conference call, we outlined our long-term guidance for a number of key metrics including our expectations for top and bottom line growth and margin expansion over our five-year plan. We remain committed to delivering on these long-term objectives which will generate double-digit EPS growth on average through 2020. So, in summary, we're pleased with our strong execution and significant advancements we made in 2015. Over the past year, we've demonstrated a strong track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes, and we look forward to numerous important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. We've consistently delivered on our commitments and are positioned for another year of strong growth. We've built a strong foundation, and we're focused on generating top-tier financial performance in the years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on R&D programs. Mike?
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: Thank you, Rick. In 2015, we significantly advanced and de-risked our pipeline and achieved a number of important regulatory milestones. And we expect 2016 to be a very productive year as well with a potential for several regulatory submissions and approvals, key data readouts, and phase transitions. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs including more than 20 new products or indications in late stage development or under regulatory review. Today, I'll highlight recent updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the year to come. I'll start with hematologic oncology, an area where we have invested heavily and are uniquely positioned. As Rick mentioned, we have built a strategic portfolio of assets including multiple mechanisms of action that have significant potential alone and in combination. The development program for our flagship oncology product, IMBRUVICA, continues to progress nicely. Our next opportunity for label expansion is in the first line CLL setting. Data from the RESONATE-2 trial in treatment-naïve CLL patients recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed treatment with IMBRUVICA resulted in an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression versus chlorambucil with 87% of patients remaining on single agent IMBRUVICA treatment at 18 months. Additionally, treatment with IMBRUVICA showed an 84% reduction in overall mortality. We believe RESONATE-2 represents a practice-changing study that will set a new treatment standard for many treatment-naïve patients. We submitted a supplemental new drug application to the FDA which is currently under priority review and we anticipate approval in the first half of 2016. IMBRUVICA is also being evaluated in mid to late stage trials in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, graft versus host disease and pancreatic cancer. At the recent ASH meeting, 65 IMBRUVICA-related abstracts were presented, including data from several studies and potential new indications. And there is potential for data flow and possible regulatory submissions this year for several indications including treatment-naïve mantle-cell lymphoma, relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, and treatment naïve diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with timing dependent on event-driven analyses of ongoing studies. In the area of immuno-oncology, ongoing trials evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with checkpoint inhibitors are progressing well, with a potential to see proof-of-concept data in solid tumors over the course of the year. Another important strategic asset in our oncology portfolio is venetoclax, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, which has demonstrated strong efficacy, achieving deep levels of response and durable disease control, both as monotherapy and in combination with Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Venetoclax is currently under priority review for relapsed/refractory CLL, including patients whose tumors harbored the 17p deletion mutation. And we expect FDA action in the first half of 2016. At ASH, we presented data in the relapsed/refractory CLL patients in combination with Rituxan, showing an overall response rate of 86% and a complete response rate of 47%. Additionally, minimal residual disease negativity in the bone marrow was observed in 55% of all patients treated with the combination. We're very encouraged by the depth of the responses driven by combination therapy in this patient population. Based on these data, earlier this month the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for venetoclax when used in combination with Rituxan. We also believe BCL-2 will be effective in other hematologic malignancies. We recently presented encouraging venetoclax data in treatment naïve AML patients over 65 years of age who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. The early data showed combination treatment with venetoclax and hypomethylating agents resulted in complete response rate of approximately 71%, which is roughly double the response rate that would be expected with the current standard of care. And based on these promising results, earlier this week the FDA granted the third venetoclax breakthrough therapy designation. We are moving expeditiously into registrational trials for this indication. In addition to IMBRUVICA and venetoclax, we are developing a dual PI-3-kinase inhibitor, Duvelisib, currently in late-stage development. In collaboration with our partner, Infinity, we'll see data on Duvelisib in relapsed/refractory NHL and CLL in the second half of the year with potential regulatory submissions to follow. We're well positioned to continue to evolve the treatment landscape in CLL and other blood cancers by exploring novel combinations including the programs in our pipeline and other mechanisms with the goal to achieve deep, durable disease control and/or remissions while reducing or eliminating the use of toxic chemotherapy. To that end, we have numerous combination trials underway or starting n 2016. This includes our Phase III study of a chemotherapy-free combination of venetoclax and Gazyva in first-line unfit CLL patients. This study is underway and enrolling well. A large Phase III study is being initiated in collaboration with the German CLL working group to evaluate treatment with venetoclax in combination with a variety of therapies including Gazyva and IMBRUVICA in previously untreated, fit CLL patients. This study, which we expect to initiate midyear, will assess the ability of venetoclax-based combinations to drive achievement of minimal residual disease, which has been associated with improved survival in CLL patients. To augment ongoing investigator-sponsored and collaborative group studies evaluating venetoclax and ibrutinib combinations, we are designing company-sponsored studies to evaluate the combination in first line CLL patients. In addition, AbbVie and Genentech are finalizing plans to pursue registrational studies evaluating combinations of venetoclax with proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma and, as I mentioned previously, in combination with hypomethylating agents in AML. Finally, we are preparing to initiate a dose finding study evaluating venetoclax and Duvelisib in patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies. In addition to our work in hematologic oncology, we have also been investing in a number of programs for the treatment of solid tumors, including our PARP inhibitor, veliparib, with five Phase III studies underway in lung, breast and ovarian cancer, and ABT-414, which is in development for glioblastoma multiforme, or GBM. GBM is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. Previously reported interim results from a Phase I clinical trial of ABT-414 showed that roughly 25% of patients with EGFR amplification or the B3 variant treated with ABT-414 in addition to standard of care achieved an objective response. These results illustrate a level of efficacy not typically seen in this difficult to treat cancer where historic data of response rates in our refractory population have been less than 10%. Later this year, we'll see additional data for ABT-414 and second-line GBM. If the data are consistent with the earlier studies, these trials could represent a path to a regulatory submission in the second half of 2016. In parallel, larger randomized comparative registrational trials are ongoing in first and second-line GBM. We also have an active program focused on driving the next wave of immuno-oncology development beyond checkpoint inhibitors. We recently entered into a collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center focused on the discovery and development of new immuno-oncology therapies. Through this agreement, we're pairing MD Anderson's cutting edge pre-clinical translational and clinical capabilities with our strength in biology, protein engineering and chemistry with a goal to accelerate the development of new medicines. We anticipate a number of immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic this year and we look forward to sharing more details on our strategy in this area at our R&D Day in June. Moving on to immunology, our strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies with a goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. We have multiple mid and late stage pipeline assets with best-in-class potential. In late 2015, we initiated a Phase III program in rheumatoid arthritis for our selective JAK-1 inhibitor, ABT-494, following positive results from our mid-stage clinical trials. We are particularly excited about the results of ABT-494 in a difficult-to-treat population, anti-TNF inadequate responders, a growing segment of the RA market. Results from the BALANCE-I trial in this patient population recently presented at ACR illustrate the agent's potential to be a best-in-class therapy with ACR20 responses up to 73% and ACR50 responses up to 44%. Additional data from our Phase II program will be presented over the course of 2016 and we expect to commercialize ABT-494 in 2019. We also have additional immunology candidates in development and we'll see mid-stage data from multiple programs in 2016. Finally, in immunology, we continue to innovate with HUMIRA. Last year, we received the EU and U.S. approval for a new formulation of HUMIRA. Additionally, we have submitted regulatory applications for an improved HUMIRA Pen device. And our U.S. and European regulatory applications for uveitis are currently under review with decisions expected in the second half of this year. Moving now to virology where our goal is to develop a next-generation asset that offers high cure rate in ribavirin and ritonavir-free regimen. Mid-stage data indicate that our new pan-genotypic combination can deliver cure rates approaching 100%. And we believe the majority of patients will be well-served with an eight week treatment option. Late last year, we initiated a comprehensive registrational program including six global Phase III studies. We'll start to see data from our registrational trials later this year. And this combination is poised for commercial entry next year. In neurology, we're focused on therapies for the treatment of conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, MS, and other neuro-degenerative conditions. ZINBRYTA is our first in class investigational biologic for relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis which is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe with the regulatory decisions expected in the first half of 2016. The filings are based upon strong pivotal trial results which demonstrated patients treated with ZINBRYTA had a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapse rates versus AVONEX, an established standard of care. Given the product profile, novel mechanism of action and its once monthly subcutaneous administration, we believe ZINBRYTA has the potential to be an important therapeutic option. Last year, we entered into a collaboration with C2N Diagnostics to develop and commercialize a portfolio of anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of serious neuro-degenerative disorders. Last year, we initiated a Phase I program in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, and we remain on track to start clinical development with C2N in Alzheimer's disease in 2016. Finally, Elagolix is our compound in Phase III development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Our goal with Elagolix in endometriosis is to bring to market an oral therapy that provides a high level of efficacy, with minimal menopausal side effects such as hot flush while preserving bone health. We reported positive results from our first pivotal trial in endometriosis last year, and plan to report top line results from the second pivotal study in the first quarter of 2016. We also plan to present more detailed findings from both registrational trials at the ASRM Meeting in October. We also recently initiated a Phase III program investigating the effect of Elagolix on bleeding related to uterine fibroids. So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline, and are on track to advance several programs in 2016. We've built a promising late-stage pipeline comprised of potentially transformational medicines, which will fuel our future growth. We look forward to covering our full pipeline in more detail, and an R&D pipeline review to be held in Chicago during the 2016 ASCO Meeting in June. We hope you will join us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the quarter, and our 2016 guidance. Bill.
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Thank you, Mike. This morning, I'll share with you the highlights of our full-year 2015 performance, provide an overview of our fourth quarter results, and then walk through our outlook for 2016. We had a strong performance in 2015, allowing us to raise our full-year EPS guidance range twice during the year and ultimately deliver sales, margin expansion, and earnings projections that exceeded our original expectations. For the full-year 2015, adjusted net revenues were $22.8 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. We expanded our adjusted operating margin profile to 42.3% in 2015, up 610 basis points for the year. And as Rick mentioned, we reported adjusted earnings per share results of $4.29, up more than 29% for the year. Turning to the fourth quarter, total adjusted sales were $6.4 billion, up more than 24% on an operational basis. Unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced sales growth in the quarter by 6%. HUMIRA delivered global sales of $3.8 billion in the quarter, up 16% operationally excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales were more than $2.3 billion, increasing nearly 21%, reflecting exceptional growth across all three major categories: rheumatology, gastro and dermatology. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were nearly $1.4 billion in the quarter, up a strong 9.7% on an operational basis excluding an unfavorable impact from exchange. Global HUMIRA sales for the full-year 2015 were $14 billion, up 19.1% operationally versus the prior year. International HUMIRA sales in 2015 increased 8.6% on an operational basis. Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $343 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $295 million and our international profit sharing was $48 million. Since the closing of the Pharmacyclics acquisition on May 26, IMBRUVICA has driven $754 million of new revenue for AbbVie, and we are pleased with its progress. A significant portion of our valuation for Pharmacyclics is attributed to advancing in the first-line therapy in treatment naïve CLL patients and the submission of the strong RESONATE-2 data to the FDA this quarter bodes well for this assumption. Global VIEKIRA sales in the fourth quarter were $554 million. The international launch has exceeded our planning expectations resulting in a higher mix of international sales again this quarter. As expected, VIEKIRAX, our two-drug, once-daily ribavirin-free combination for the treatment of genotype 1b in Japan launched late in the fourth quarter. Global sales of DUODOPA, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease grew 24.4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw continued double-digit growth internationally for DUODOPA with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected. Global DUODOPA sales for the full-year 2015 were $231 million, up 23.5% operationally versus the prior year. Global Creon sales were $185 million, up 22.8%. Full-year sales of Creon were $632 million, up 22.5% versus 2014. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with roughly 70% share. Global LUPRON sales were $235 million in the fourth quarter, up 15.6% on an operational basis. For the full year, global LUPRON sales were $826 million, up 9.3% exceeding our expectations. LUPRON continues to hold the leadership position and maintains significant share of the market. Turning to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 80.5%, excluding amortization and other specified items. Excluding the impact of Pharmacyclics, we saw a nearly 100-basis improvement year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, adjusted R&D was 15.9% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 23.9% of sales, contributing to continued improvement in our operating margin profile. Operating margin in the quarter was 40.1% of sales compared to 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusting for the negative impacts of foreign exchange and the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, operating margin increased by 540 basis points. As a reminder, the fourth quarter margin profile is generally the lowest of any quarter during the year. This reflects seasonal product mix impacts from higher sales of products like SYNAGIS, a lower-margin partnered product. Net interest expense was $199 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.13, excluding non-cash amortization expense and specified items. On a GAAP basis, we posted EPS of $0.92. As we look ahead to 2016, we are confirming our previously issued full-year adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $5.10. This guidance excludes $0.42 per share of non-cash amortization and non-cash Pharmacyclics acquisition impacts, as well as $0.03 per share of other specifieds. On the top line, we expect mid-teens revenue growth on an operational basis, excluding roughly 2% negative impact from exchange. Included in our top line guidance, our assumptions for our key products as follows: HUMIRA has averaged well over $1 billion of annual growth for a number of years. In 2016, we expect HUMIRA to once again be an important contributor to our performance with high-teens growth expected in the U.S. Internationally, we are forecasting mid-single-digit operational growth, reflecting the latest market dynamics including the launch of a biosimilar for Enbrel. For IMBRUVICA, we expect revenues to AbbVie of at least $1.8 billion. We anticipate global VIEKIRA sales of approximately $2 billion for the year. This level of sales includes significant international growth with a full year's of sales in Japan. We expect continued double-digit growth for DUODOPA, including an increased U.S. sales contribution. As mentioned on previous calls, we anticipate a gradual ramp for product sales in the U.S. as physicians continue to get more familiar with the product. For SYNAGIS, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth in 2016. Regarding AndroGel, we're forecasting 2016 sales of roughly $500 million. For Creon, we expect high-single-digit sales growth. For LUPRON and Synthroid, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year. And we expect declines in several products with continued lipid franchise erosion as well as negative market trends in HIV and other mature products. Turning back to the P&L for 2016, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 82%. We are forecasting R&D expense above 15% of sales and we expect to see sales leverage with SG&A levels at approximately 23% of sales, well below the 24.6% booked in 2015. As a result, in 2016, we are forecasting an increase in our operating margin profile of 100 basis points, reflecting ongoing initiatives and sales leverage. Excluding year-over-year impacts of foreign exchange and Pharmacyclics, this operating margin improvement would exceed 300 basis points. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $800 million for the full year, and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% in 2016. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $1.13 to $1.15. This guidance reflects growth of approximately 21% at the midpoint. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.11 of non-cash amortization and specified items. We are forecasting revenue growth in the first quarter just above 20%, excluding roughly 4% negative exchange. While our full-year outlook for international HUMIRA growth is mid-single digits, in the first quarter, we anticipate an operational international growth rate of 3%. This is the direct result of a difficult comparison to the prior-year quarter where we posted a 15% increase for the brand due to shipment timing. So, as we look back, we're very pleased with AbbVie's performance in our first three years as an independent company. In 2015, we delivered sales, margin expansion, and earnings well above our original outlook, and we expect to build on that momentum in 2016 with industry-leading growth and an exciting pipeline. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Bill, we'll now open the call for questions. Sheryl, we'll take our first question, please.
Operator: All right, sir. Thank you. Our first question comes from Mr. Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks very much and thanks for the questions.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Sure.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: First one here, just any perspective on the recent Amgen IPR decision on your formulation patent and what that means for HUMIRA. And maybe while we're talking about IP, maybe – any touch as well on the Coherus and BI filings on your dosing patents. That will be my first question. Second one, the mid-single digit growth for international HUMIRA, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the drivers and assumptions there. Specifically, what are you anticipating in terms of pricing or volume competition when we think about biosimilar Remicade and Enbrel? Thanks so much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Hi, Chris. It's Rick. So, I'll cover those two. Let me do the HUMIRA one first. So, as we mentioned in our previous call, we are anticipating that we will see indirect biosimilar competition outside the U.S. meaning Enbrel biosimilars outside the U.S. this year. So, if you think about our growth rate, we finished this year internationally at about 8.6% and we're guiding for next year at about mid-single digits. And you can break it up into sort of two components. One would be obviously as the brand gets a little bit bigger, the growth rate as a percentage is slowing down a bit. And then we have built in what are a set of assumptions of what kind of price impact we might see from Enbrel in certain markets, particularly in Europe I would say. And that represents about 2% of our growth. So you can think of it coming down about 2% based on that. So that's the HUMIRA piece. On the Amgen IPR and the other IPRs, I think in general across all of the litigation aspects of HUMIRA, I think it's important to recognize that we have now entered a new phase of our biosimilar strategy. And in our third quarter call, we laid out a detailed explanation of our patent estate in an effort to really provide the investment community with a comprehensive set of information around the IP and what we thought the litigation timelines would look like going forward. What I can tell you is nothing has changed from that assessment. We still believe in everything that we've described to you as part of that. But now we're in the active litigation process with other players, whether that be IPR litigation or other kind of litigation that will start to play out. And it's just not prudent for us to lay out for the world a play-by-play analysis of our positions around this. That's just not the – that's not the smart thing to do from a litigation standpoint. So what I'd tell you is I'd reiterate the points that we made before. We have a large, robust portfolio of IP. We have done significant work from an innovation standpoint in this area, and we have prosecuted all of this IP based on the work that we've done and the investment that we've made, and we feel good about the IP in our portfolio. And as we've said before, we intend to vigorously defend our IP, and this is going to need to play out over time. We're certainly pleased with the decision of the patent office, but we're not going to basically do a play-by-play on this because that potentially could jeopardize our position.
Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC: All right. Thanks very much.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Chris. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ms. Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs. Ma'am, you're line is open.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. I just want to talk about U.S. HUMIRA sales this past quarter. I guess, 20% or 21% was a bit below consensus expectations. If you look at volume growth and price contribution, that should have led to slightly higher growth. I'm wondering if you can talk about what is happening to net price increases, are they sticking? And with respect to your high-teens guidance for U.S. HUMIRA sales in 2016, what again are your assumptions for price? Thanks very much.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Jami.
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hi, Jami. It's Bill. Look, I think we've seen spectacular growth numbers out of HUMIRA in the U.S. all year long, and certainly Q4, 21% isn't a bad number. And if you look at the market, TRx growth right now in the quarter was about 13%. From an inventory standpoint sequentially quarter versus quarter, it stayed roughly flat at a little less than half a month. But one thing that is impacting this number is we had slightly higher inventory numbers in the channel in Q4 2014. And if you adjust that out, it pretty much gets you back to where guidance had us. So we haven't seen anything on this brand that would lead us to pause and restate our expectations. And as I said in the call, in my comments, we're expecting high-teens growth, so it's going very well. From price perspective, it's normal for these sorts of products to take price increases towards the end of the year or the beginning of the year. We certainly have done that at the beginning of the year. So there is going to be a price dynamic on HUMIRA in 2016, and we want to see how things pan out as the year progresses above and beyond that.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And Jami, this is Rick. The only thing I would add is much like the discussion we had last quarter about international third quarter, if you look at our ordering or if you look at our growth rate patterns over the last several years, what you'll see is typically fourth quarter is a little bit lower from a growth standpoint. But I think what you're asking is are we seeing any kind of a slowdown in the U.S.; we're not. The U.S. is performing very robustly. We guided, I think, at the beginning of this year to about the same number, high teens, and obviously overachieved that. So I mean, we feel very good about the performance going forward with HUMIRA.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Jami.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Marc Goodman of UBS. Sir, your line is open.
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC: Yes. Good morning. You mentioned the HUMIRA price increase which was like 10-ish%. How much of that is actually flowing through to the bottom line this year that you project and how has that changed as far as the growth scenario in the past couple of years? And then second, if you could talk about hepatitis C a little bit. Obviously, the U.S., there's one dynamic and obviously with Merck coming in, they got approved. They set their pricing last night. If you could comment on that. And then secondly, if you could talk about Japan, where we are and how it's doing. I know you didn't have a lot of Japan in the quarter, but now it's been a good month and a half later. So, maybe you could just give us a sense for how Japan is doing in the ramp and how much Japan is going to be a piece of that O-U.S. this year.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So, let me take the HUMIRA price piece. I understand all of the focus on price. I mean, I think all of us in this industry recognize all of the headlines we've seen around price and I think an important perspective to step back and think about for our business. This is not a business that is highly dependent upon price, our business I'm talking about. So if you look at our operational growth in 2015 of 22%, only 2% of that was price across the business. And if you look at HUMIRA, roughly around 25% of the overall growth is driven by price. Now, you do have certain managed care contracts that have some level of price protection, so all the price doesn't fall through at 100%. And depending upon where the price increases are and the magnitude of those price increases, less of it will fall through in a later price increase, as an example. But overall, the vast majority of our growth, whether it be HUMIRA or other assets in our pipeline, is driven by volume growth, and I think that's an important perspective for the investor community to understand. As far as HCV is concerned, as we've planned out for 2016, I'd say the Merck label came in pretty much spot-on what we had expected, so I think it's within our expectations. We have built into our assumptions for HCV a level of competition and some level of price competition. We're going to have to see how that plays out. We don't believe we have any exposure there at all, so we're not concerned about that. But we have built in what we believe is an appropriate level of both price and volume competition that we could see in the marketplace in 2016. Japan, to your point, we launched very late in the fourth quarter, and so far I had an update just a week or so ago from the team, Japan is going well. It's tracking on our expectations.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Marc. Next question please, Sheryl.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI: Hey, guys. Thanks. Wondering if I could take a left turn here away from hep C and drug pricing and talk a little bit about your pipeline, which is arguably not discussed a lot on the Street. So, number one, I'd love to – and also competition. So, first of all, I'd love to get your thoughts on there's been a lot of news in the JAK space. I'd love to get your thoughts comparing baricitinib to 494. I'd also love to get an update on how you're thinking about ABT-122 and ALX-0061. What's the next step, when we make a next step? And if possible, throw in a comment about ACP-196 versus IMBRUVICA. This molecule has obviously come into the headlines after AZN paid, I think, $7 billion for it. Thank you very much.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Mark.
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: Sure, Mark. This is Mike. I'll take those questions. Your first question was about our JAK franchise and competition. I think that if we look at JAK inhibitors, there had been a fair amount of enthusiasm several years ago that actual results didn't live up to expectations for the first generation of those molecules, such as tofacitinib. But the current generation, I think, have very nice profiles. And I think baricitinib has generated a nice profile based on the data that we've seen today. We'll see more as they proceed through the regulatory review. And I think the class is going to get used over time. What we see with this class is, it tends to start slow and build over time and work from more resistant patients up to all the other lines of therapy, and we see that with therapies in RA and in immunology in general. So when I compare the two, I feel very encouraged by the results that we've seen with ABT-494. We've seen very strong efficacy, not just at the ACR20 level, but at much higher levels of response, ACR50, ACR70, DAS remission, et cetera. And we've seen that across two large Phase IIb studies, including a TNF-inadequate responder study, and those are the results that I mentioned in our opening comments. And there, we see a level of response in TNF-inadequate responders that we believe has the potential to be best-in-class. And so if you link that up with what I said about how RA dynamics play out, those data can be very important, and we believe that that is a big opportunity for this molecule. We do believe over time that 494 will certainly have use in earlier lines of therapy. But when you look at the balanced profile of 494, we feel very good about it. So moving on to ABT-122 and Ablynx, those are in mid-stage trials, and we'll see data from ABT-122 mid-year, and from Ablynx towards the back end of the year. And once we have those data, then that'll be the time to make decisions about next steps, so we'll be sharing those data as soon as it's reasonable to do so after we get them.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI: What are the hurdles for success in those trials?
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: Well, our general approach has been that we believe we need to raise the standard of care. So what we're going to want to see is something that is over and above the level of efficacy that can be achieved with comparable agents, if you will. So ABT-122 combines 17 in TNF, so you're going to want to see something in the disease populations we've studied in RA and in psoriatic arthritis. It's better than one can get with those mechanisms alone. And Ablynx is another approach at IL-6, you'll see something that's better than the existing therapies that are out there. Now, obviously, these aren't comparative studies, but we'll have the data, we believe, to make those assessments and to determine whether we will advance those programs this year, as I've said. So, with Acerta, there certainly has been a lot of talk about Acerta given its relatively early stage of development. What I would say, first and foremost, is we've set a very high bar with IMBRUVICA. We've set a very high bar with efficacy and also with safety. I quoted some of the numbers from RESONATE-2. We don't believe we've left any room on the table for there to be a story of improved efficacy. And we feel very good about the safety profile of IMBRUVICA. With Acerta, we're looking at much earlier data. We're looking at Phase Ib, Phase IIa studies. I think the study that's garnered the most attention is about a 61-patient dose rising study with an expansion. And it's really just not possible to compare those very early trials to a molecule like IMBRUVICA which has multiple phases of readouts and has been on the market now for a considerable period of time. So we'll see as their programs continues to progress, what they're able to demonstrate. They have comparative studies, so a readout in a couple of years' time, and I think that's really the first time we'll be able to make any sort of comparative assessment. Those are open-label studies, and that's a limitation of them. And I'll also add that Acerta's comparative studies are in relapsed/refractory patients, and IMBRUVICA is moving to the front-line over time. And that momentum is going to keep up. So we feel very confident in our position with IMBRUVICA.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI: Thanks a lot.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: The only other thing I'd add is – this is Rick.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI: Hey, Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: When we did the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, we did it with the knowledge of Acerta. So we thoroughly reviewed, based on the information we had at that time, the compound and evaluated whether or not we thought it was a risk. And I think one of the things to keep in mind is a follower strategy in oncology, at least historically, has not worked very well. And the reason it doesn't work very well is if the innovator keeps advancing the bar, the regulatory environment changes on the follower and what they need to do to be able to get their approvals, it's more difficult, takes more time, it's more expensive because it can't do single arm studies to get approval. The second thing I'd say is there seems to be two theses out there. One would be improved efficacy, one would be improved safety profile, particularly around bleeding and AFib. I wouldn't say that those are issues that are inhibiting our ability to be able to advance the brand and standard of care today. But what I'd also say is as we have evaluated it, we believe that the vast majority of the data would support that those are on-mechanism side effects. And so we'll have to see what their data proves out and we'll have to see what their inclusion and exclusion criteria is on the trials that they run to make sure it's a balanced view to be able to demonstrate what the bleeding AFib rate would be. And remember, we didn't see AFib in IMBRUVICA until we got to something like 1,500 patients or so. And I think we saw bleeding at about 500 to 600 something like that, right? So we have to see a lot more data to see a real signal, and it has to be in the population that's consistent with the population that's being treated. And we'll see what the data looks like, but I think the evidence today would suggest that those are on mechanism. And so we'll have to see how it plays out, but I would tell you that we're confident in our position with IMBRUVICA.
Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI: Thanks, Rick.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Mark. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is open.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks very much. So, I wanted to go back to the positive IPR decisions. Could you please characterize the breadth of those two patents, the 157 and 158 patents which were surprisingly upheld? Specifically, you must have an opinion on the likelihood that other biosimilar manufacturers beyond Amgen will infringe these patents because it's challenging to make a stable monoclonal antibody without infringing. And then second, I'm interested in your perspective on duration of therapy for IMBRUVICA currently and how you expect that to evolve with new indications. And then also if you could share any thoughts on venetoclax on that front with respect to expected duration of therapy as well, that would be very helpful. Thank you.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, David.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Yeah. David, this is Rick. On the IPR part, I guess what I'd say is it wasn't surprising to us. We obviously have a pretty high level of confidence in the IP. As far as others that would infringe, I mean, we're certainly not in a position to be able to answer that question because we don't know what their formulations are. I guess the best place to get that answer would be to ask them. But as I said, we're not going to talk a lot about how we're positioning things and how we plan on running the IPR process going forward. The most important thing here is that we prevail. And I realized that probably doesn't give you great comfort, but you have to recognize our responsibility is to make sure that we put the best position forward and that we don't tip off our opponents in this process as to what our strategy is. And so I apologize for that part of it, but that's the tradeoff we have to make here. And you're going to see more of this play out over time and I think you'll get a feel for it and you can get other people to evaluate what you think that will look like from an IP standpoint, although I'd say much like this particular patent, some people opine that they didn't think it was very strong and you saw at the patent office made their decision, right? So, I think that's about all we can talk about as it relates to the litigation. The second would be on duration on therapy on IMBRUVICA. If you look at the duration on therapy today, I'd say it's tracking on what we expected as part of the original deal model that we put together. To give you some flavor for that, I'd say it's about 75% of the clinical trial duration. It has been increasing over time. There are a number of elements that basically we've analyzed and have programs in place. Some of those are payer-related and some are other kinds of things that we have to continue to work through. I think one of the things that will be extremely helpful is the RESONATE-2 data here because now you have absolute data that supports that if you keep these patients on therapy for a longer period of time, then you get very good outcomes. And so I think not only from the standpoint of allowing us to be able to move into front line, but as another piece of strong, credible evidence that maintaining therapy over a longer period of time gives patients the benefit they were looking for. One of the things that we did see is in certain physician populations, from a duration standpoint, when blood counts improved, some physicians would take patients off of therapy. And obviously, that's not something that we would want. And so I think RESONATE-2 is a strong supporting set of data that will help give physicians the knowledge and information they need to be convinced that they should keep them on therapy even though the blood counts have improved. And then on venetoclax, I don't know. Mike, can you talk at all about that? I mean, it's a little hard to tell at this point.
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: Yeah. I think – this is Mike. With respect to duration of therapy with venetoclax, I think it's early to make a statement because we're treating many different populations now in clinical trials. We have a large number of patients continuing on therapy, so those mean durations of therapy are increasing as the data set matures. So, I think we can't give a specific number. I think what we can say is that the responses we're seeing are very good. We're keeping patients on therapy. There's good durability of those responses. And as the data set matures and as we move to a label, I think we can update you on that.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, David.
David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question, please, Sheryl?
Operator: Our next question comes from Ms. Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Ma'am, your line is open.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. It's actually – this is Vamil. Thanks so much...
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Vamil.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): ...for taking my questions. Hi. How are you doing? I get it. All sorts of interesting moves with my name. But anyways, a couple of questions if I could. One, just in terms of hep C, I appreciate the comments you made for next year and how are you looking to that. Can you give us a sense have you've seen any impact on prescription trends from the label change that you had to make back near the start of the fourth quarter and if that's impacted things at all? And then maybe on the pipeline again, I appreciate all the comments that were made earlier also in response to Mark's question. Maybe if you could just streamline things a little bit and just flag, if you could, the two or three most important data releases that you think investors should be focused on for AbbVie between now and your June R&D day? Thanks so much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Vamil, this is Rick. I'll take the HCV one. We have seen an impact. Maybe the best way to describe it would be this, you saw what our revenues were in the fourth quarter. We had flagged that the $3 billion running rate in the fourth quarter that we thought we – I flagged that we might miss it, but we would be relatively close and that is what we have been tracking against for the fourth quarter. I'd say in the fourth quarter, there were two impacts, and one of them is going to be a label change. That's why I'm going through this explanation for you. So one was the VA volumes stayed very low through the fourth quarter because of the funding issue in the VA. And so that was one of the impacts. But then the second was, what we saw from collateral impact on the label. And I'd say we lost about one share point. So there was some bleed-over impact to other segments because the Child-Pugh B isn't worth one share point. It has stabilized now at that level. And so, I think the impact has flowed through, and we've assumed that in what we've built for 2016. But that's been the overall impact.
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: And in terms of data releases to keep an eye on, as we said in our remarks, we're going to see results from the Elagolix endometriosis second pivotal study in the first quarter. We'll top line that, so that'll obviously be something to keep an eye out for. At EASL, we'll present a large amount of data on our next-generation hep C program, including 8-week and 12-week components of our Phase II program. So that'll be something to keep an eye on. And at ASCO, I would look to our data in CLL in venetoclax, and also AML and venetoclax as updates that we can keep an eye out for.
Vamil K. Divan - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Vamil. We'll take our next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking the questions.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Good morning.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Obviously, there's quite a bit of skepticism about your 2020 HUMIRA guidance. And given what you said today about Europe and the fact that biosimilar competition will only increase there, can you help us understand how you get there, basically help us bridge the difference between where consensus is right now to your expectation for greater than $18 billion by 2020 for HUMIRA? And then I'm curious about what are some of the things that you'll be looking for during the upcoming Remicade biosimilar FDA panel? Thank you.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So, Alex, this is Rick. If you think about what we described for you on the 2020 HUMIRA guidance ex-U.S., we basically said that we would see direct biosimilar competition in the fourth quarter of 2018. We'd have some impact from indirect biosimilar starting in 2016. I described earlier in the call what that impact assumption is for 2016. It will obviously have a flow-through impact into 2017, as that expands and basically flows through. But then, if you think about the erosion curve that I described on the third quarter call. So what we said was internationally, the brand will peak in 2018 and then it will gently start to decline and if you get to the end of 2020, it's down about 15% or so. That's a combination of volume and price. Now, I'd also tell you that because the category is still growing, obviously then the growth would have been there and some of that growth went to a biosimilar player. So it basically says, that about 30% of the total opportunity would have gone over that period of time. And, that's the point at which we see some level of stabilization going forward. So I think that's the way you would characterize it, and although we don't have direct knowledge of how each analyst builds consensus around their international and U.S. sets of assumptions, what I would say is the biggest difference between consensus and our forecast is that some people are still forecasting that HUMIRA sees biosimilar competition in the United States. The number is too big to be anything other than that, the change. So after our guidance, what we did see is we saw HUMIRA move up pretty significantly, but not all the way out to our 2020 forecast. So there are still some individuals who are assuming that they see biosimilar competition, probably now in that 2019 timeframe it's pretty much slid out to. So it's the difference between that and ultimately our assumption that we'll get through 2020 to 2022, right? And I think that's the biggest single impact. As far as the Remicade panel, I think as we've talked about internationally we've been watching this play out in the international markets and studying it carefully. And as we've indicated to the marketplace many, many times before, we're not seeing a direct impact on HUMIRA. And obviously, if you look at our growth rates in 2015 and you look at our growth rate in the fourth quarter, I think that's indicative of the fact that we're not seeing any substantial impact as well. And so we wouldn't assume that there would be an impact in the United States either. It really fits in a different category. I think the one thing that will be interesting to look at in the panel is we have assumed in our planning assumptions that biosimilar players get extrapolation. We don't agree with that. We think it's important for any drug to be tested in the indication that it's going to be used in and generate some clinical data. But I'd say we plan from a conservative standpoint that we will see extrapolation in all the major markets around the world. I think as we go forward here, if somehow we got an indication that that were not going to be the case in the United States that would be a positive to us. So that's one of the things we'll be looking at.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Alex. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.
Operator: All right, sir. Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Steve Scala of Cowen. Your line is open.
Stephen M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you. You mentioned the $2 billion in VIEKIRA sales in 2016. That is less than annualizing Q4 2015 sales, which were already a bit held back as you described a couple of minutes ago. So it seems as these expectations – or you're expecting a slowdown quarter-over-quarter in 2016, despite the launch in Japan. So, where are you expecting to see the pressure? Secondly, where specifically in Merck's hep C label does AbbVie see competitive advantages for VIEKIRA, if any? And then lastly, what has been the uptake of the new formulation of HUMIRA in the EU? Thank you very much.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. Steve, this is Rick. I'll take the first one. So, you are correct that if you look at what we're guiding going forward, it is less than our fourth quarter annualized. And that is our intent. I'd say there's two factors there. Let's be honest, we've had trouble predicting this number. And so we wanted to go into 2016 with a number that we had a very high level of confidence that we could hit, so that's certainly a component of it. The second component is we are assuming some level of competition from Merck. So, we'll have to see how it plays out, but I would say we're going to set this one at a number that we have a high level of confidence that we think we can deliver, and I'd much rather surprise you on the positive than sit here and apologize on the miss. And Mike, why don't you cover the label?
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: Okay. Well, so recognizing that the Merck label has just come out, what I would say is we would look particularly at the impact of RAVs on response. And this is something we've been saying since the Phase III data were presented. The U.S. label recommends RAV testing for Merck and guides both regimen and treatment duration based on that. And with VIEKIRA, that's not the case. And also when we look at our next generation regimen and we look at activity in a number of pre-clinical systems in viruses that carry those resistance mutations we see very high levels of activity for our agent. So we think that that's going to be a strength for our programs going forward.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And then on your last question, we have not launched the new HUMIRA formulation internationally or in the U.S. We need a new pen device for this formulation. And so we have submitted the pen in both jurisdictions. We'll have to wait for that to get approved, once that's approved then we'll make our decisions on launching those.
Stephen M. Scala - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks. Next question please, operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from John Boris of SunTrust. Your line is open.
John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the results.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Thanks, John.
John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: First question has to do with the Japanese market. Are you anticipating any impact to your franchises from price decreases in Japan in April? The second question, what percent of HUMIRA revenues in U.S. and ex-U.S. come from rheumatoid arthritis? And can you give some color on timing around when the pen might see or secure approval? And then last question just has to do with ABT-494. It seems that competitively baricitinib and the developers there have latched on to an important area of diabetic nephropathy that appears to have an effect; that would be a very large untapped market. I'm sure you'll talk about this in June, but any thoughts around further broadening the development outside of RA for ABT-494? Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. So, John, this is Rick. I'll take the first one. So the Japanese market price adjustments, we are aware of it, it has been communicated to us. So it's built into our 2016 guidance. I don't think it's something we can tell you because really the Japanese authorities need to release that, not us. But I'd say it was in the range, slightly lower than we would have expected. So I think it's fine and as I said it's in the guidance already. But we are aware of what the number is. The HUMIRA indication mix, it was RA you said?
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Yeah. RA, John, right now is just a bit under 35% of global sales.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And then the pen devices, they were submitted recently. So we're thinking second half of 2016.
John T. Boris - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thanks.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: And then ABT-494, Mike?
Michael E. Severino - Executive Vice President, Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer: Sure. This is Mike. So with respect to broadening out ABT-494 development, we obviously believe that ABT-494 has broad potential in RA. In other immunologically mediated conditions, we have programs underway in inflammatory bowel disease, and I think the data support that we're likely to see a good effect there. With respect to diabetic nephropathy, it's an intriguing idea. It's certainly something we consider. And perhaps that is a good topic for our R&D Day in June.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, John. Appreciate the question. Next question please, operator?
Operator: Our next question comes from Colin Bristow of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Morning, and thanks for taking the questions and all the useful color. So first on HUMIRA, just in the 4Q, can you comment specifically or at least qualitatively on the level of rebating in the quarter and how it compares year-over-year and sequentially? Second on hep C, can you give us some idea of the number of contracts perhaps as a proportion of 2015 which you secured with exclusivity for 2016? And then thirdly, and sorry if I missed this, but on the HUMIRA ex-U.S. front, can you give us an update on the impact you're seeing from biosimilar Remicade? I think previously you said around 3% share. And then just following on from that theme, how do you anticipate the threat from the biosimilar Enbrel given that it's an injectable versus an infusion? Thanks.
William J. Chase - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Colin, it's Bill Chase. On the rebating around HUMIRA, obviously, we don't go to any great lengths explaining the levels of rebating. What you need to think about with our pricing dynamic on HUMIRA is price increases in the latter half of the year tend to have less of a fall through that's related to basically pricing caps in certain programs. So to the extent that we take price later in the year, our rebate goes up for those particular programs, but I don't want to get into any specific numbers around that at this point in time.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: On the HCV contracting, when we originally launched and the exclusive contracts that we had were multiyear contracts with the exception of the Medicaid contracts which many of those are annual contracts, get bid out on a yearly basis. So I'd say, certainly, the majority of our business is under a multiyear contracting strategy. On HUMIRA, Remicade, I may not have heard the question correctly, but we haven't communicated that it had a 3% impact, in fact it had virtually no impact on our business. Overall, if you look at their overall biologic share is somewhere around 3%, but the vast majority of that has come from Remicade. And then Enbrel is what I described earlier that we are anticipating about a 2% impact from a growth rate standpoint. The majority of that, the vast majority of that is price. There are certain markets where there will be a price impact.
Colin N. Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Colin. And operator, we have time for one more question please.
Operator: All right, sir. Our last question comes from Mr. Andrew Baum of Citi. Sir, your line is open.
Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you. Three questions, please. Firstly, you've expressed previously your confidence in the robustness of the 135 patent within the U.S. and I know it had a very lengthy prosecution history to attain inclusion in the USPTO. Could you contrast that with the withdrawal of the similar patents from Europe? What underpins the confidence in the U.S. building on the lengthy prosecution, if you'd like to comment? Second, perhaps if you could go into a little bit more detail in terms of the reference pricing for anti-TNF agents within Europe. What was the thinking of the impact of Enbrel in dragging down the prices of the category? And then finally, just on Acerta's BTK inhibitor, do you believe that they infringe AbbVie's intellectual property? Thank you.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Andrew.
Richard A. Gonzalez - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: Okay. On the 135 patent as I said before, I mean we're not going to go through a lot of detail back and forth. But one thing I do want to clarify is remember, IP in Europe is different than IP in the United States in how it is ultimately prosecuted. The second thing is, it's important to remember that although we withdrew the parent patent, we did it because there was one particular assay that we had a second patent that didn't have that question and therefore we pulled that patent in order to basically just focus on these other patents. So it's not like we withdrew it because we were concerned about it. And so ultimately – but that is not an issue from a U.S. standpoint, and I think that's probably as much as we're going to talk about it. Reference pricing, obviously part of what I indicated earlier is reference price, but I'd say also there are some markets where there could be some hospital negotiations also that could have an impact here. And so we factored in what we think is certainly a conservative number. But I think it's an appropriate number to be able to ultimately plan for 2016. And then on Acerta BTK, the IP, again, we have significant IP in this area. And if we believe Acerta infringes that IP, we'll enforce the IP.
Andrew S. Baum - Citigroup Global Markets Ltd.: Thank you.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: Thanks, Andrew.
Larry Peepo - Vice President-Investor Relations: And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen a replay of the call, please visit our website at abbvieinvestor.com. Thanks again for joining us.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Larry Peepo: Good morning and thanks for joining us today. Also on the call with me is Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President Business Development, External Affairs and General Counsel; Michael Severino, Executive Vice President of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I'll remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie's operations is included in our 2014 Annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.  We want to remind you that we issued two separate news releases this morning in advance of today's call and have also posted slides on abbvieinvestor.com that supplements some of the content we'll be covering this morning. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Gonzalez: Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. As Larry mentioned, we'll be covering two topics on the call this morning. I'll briefly discuss our third-quarter 2015 performance highlights and Bill will walk you through the quarter in a bit more detail. I'll then discuss the Company's long-term strategic and financial objectives that we outlined this morning, including our expectations for growth and other financial metrics over our long-range plan. As always, we'll provide ample time to answer your questions. We delivered another quarter of strong performance with third quarter results well ahead of our expectations. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.13, representing growth of nearly 27% versus the third quarter of 2014. This is the third consecutive quarter of delivering roughly 30% EPS growth. Our results in the quarter included operational sales growth of more than 26%. Before I provided an overview of our highlights in the quarter, I'll briefly provide our perspective on the recent update to our U.S. VIEKIRA label. As you're likely aware, last week, we updated the prescribing information to reflect a change in the use of VIEKIRA in certain patients with advanced cirrhosis. Specifically, Child-Pugh C patients. VIEKIRA went from not recommended to contraindicated. VIEKIRA was and remains contraindicated in Child-Pugh C patients. In addition, the updated label recommends a clinical and laboratory assessment for patients with cirrhosis to ensure that those with decompensated disease are identified. Turning now to the other quarterly events. In the quarter, we advanced several important strategic priorities, continued to enhance operational efficiency and achieved a number of clinical and regulatory objectives. Our third-quarter performance was driven by growth from several product in our portfolio, including strong growth from HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, continued uptake of VIEKIRA and continued growth from Creon and Duodopa. We also continued to improve efficiency across our operations delivering roughly 640 basis points in operating margin expansion this quarter versus the prior year, achieving an operating margin of 44.9%. I'll discuss our commitment to further drive this metric in the context of our long-term financial objectives in just a few moments. We continue to be very pleased with the advancement and de-risking of our mid- and late-stage pipeline. During the quarter, we reported positive data, advanced programs into the regulatory approval cycle and received approval for several assets. Last month, we reported positive top line results from two Phase 2b studies of our selective JAK1 inhibitor. We believe ABT-494 has a very compelling profile, with a potential for best in class efficacy even in the most difficult to treat TNF inadequate responder patients, and with once daily dosing. We'll present the full results from the two mid-stage trials in an upcoming medical meeting and are on track to initiate the Phase 3 studies by year-end. We also reported positive top line findings from a Phase 2b trial of elagolix in patients with uterine fibroids. Preliminary results from the six-month study demonstrated that all of the treatment arms achieved the study's primary endpoint. Based on these findings, we plan to advance elagolix into Phase 3 development for fibroids, with initiation expected in the first quarter of 2016. We recently submitted the U.S. regulatory application for IMBRUVICA as a therapy in treatment naive patients with CLL. In June, we announced the top line results from the Phase 3 RESONATE-2 trial comparing IMBRUVICA monotherapy to chlorambucil in patients aged 65 or older. The results illustrate that treatment with IMBRUVICA significantly improved progression-free survival and multiple secondary endpoints, including overall survival in first-line therapy. As we've said, a significant portion of our valuation for Pharmacyclics was attributed to advancing into first line treatment, and while we assumed a very high probability of success, the RESONATE-2 data provides strong evidence of IMBRUVICA's efficacy in a frontline setting, further de-risking this component of our model. The trial results will be published in a peer reviewed medical journal and presented at an upcoming medical meeting, and we anticipate a regulatory decision to use in treatment naive first-line patients in the first half of 2016. Given the robust results, we have a high degree of confidence that IMRUVICA will be very successful as front line therapy. We also recently completed our U.S. regulatory submission for venetoclax or ABT-199 in relapsed/refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion. We also recently received regulatory approval for our two pill, once daily HCV therapy in Japan. We expect to receive reimbursement and launch in Japan in the next month or so. Late last month, we submitted our regulatory application for a once daily formulation of VIEKIRA PAK in the U.S. Finally, during the quarter, we received regulatory approval for HUMIRA as a treatment for HS and we submitted our U.S. and European regulatory applications for HUMIRA as a treatment for uveitis. In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong results exceeding our guidance range for the quarter, and we raised our full-year 2015 outlook to the upper end of our previous guidance range, reflecting growth of roughly 28%. Our results year-to-date demonstrate the significant progress we've made towards our objective of delivering industry-leading growth. I'll discuss our strong outlook for 2016, as well as our longer term financial commitments after Bill covers our third quarter results in more detail. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?
William Chase: Thank you, Rick. This morning, I'll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2015. As Rick mentioned, in addition to delivering strong top line growth in the third quarter, we again exceeded our earnings-per-share guidance range with growth of nearly 27% versus the third quarter of 2014. Operational growth on the top line was very strong at 26.2%, excluding a 7.8% negative impact from foreign exchange. Reported sales were up 18.4%. HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.6 billion, up 19.6% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA as the market leader around the world. On a reported basis, currency had a negative 7.5% impact on global HUMIRA sales, and reduced international HUMIRA sales by 16%. U.S. HUMIRA sales increased 30.4%. We've seen acceleration in market growth this year in the U.S. with HUMIRA driving strong growth across the gastro, rhum and derm segments. Wholesale inventory levels remained constant at roughly half a month. Internationally, HUMIRA sales increased 7.1% on an operational basis in the third quarter, roughly double the rate of growth we reported in the second quarter. HUMIRA's momentum has not been adversely impacted by the Remicade biosimilar. We continue to see only modest overall share gains for the biosimilar in the major markets, in line with our planning assumptions. HUMIRA's list of indications continues to grow with recent EMA and FDA, approvals for HS. HUMIRA is also currently under regulatory review for uveitis with approval expected by the end of 2016. Global peak year sales for HS are expected to be approximately $1 billion per year, while uveitis sales are expected to reach several hundred million dollars per year. For the full year 2015, we now expect global HUMIRA sales growth in the high teens on an operational basis, an increase from previous guidance of mid-teens operational growth. This reflects a forecast for you U.S. growth approaching 30% and high single-digit international operational growth. This was the first full quarter of IMBRUVICA sales since the closing of the Pharmacyclics acquisition and global sales were strong at $304 million. U.S. sales were $267 million and our international profit-sharing was $37 million. For 2015, we continue to expect Pharmacyclics to add more than $750 million to our top line through revenue occurring after the May 26 closing date. Global VIEKIRA sales in the third quarter were $469 million. The international launch has continued to exceed our planning expectations and has resulted in a higher mix of international sales this year. As Rick mentioned, we recently received regulatory approval in Japan for our two drug, once daily, ribavirin free combination for the treatment of genotype 1b. We anticipate launching in Japan next month following the traditional 60 day reimbursement review cycle. We also saw a strong performance across a number of our other products including Duodopa, Creon and Lupron. Turning to the P&L profile, we are pleased with our progress in the quarter as we showed continued improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 83.3%, driven by exchange, operational efficiencies as well as product mix. Adjusted R&D was 15.4% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline asset. Adjusted SG&A was 23% of sales in the third quarter, down from the prior year, contributing to continued improvement in our operating margin profile. We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 44.9% of sales, up 640 basis points versus the prior year quarter. After adjusting for a modest negative impact from Pharmacyclics, more than 500 basis points of this improvement was driven by efficiencies and P&L leverage. Net interest expense was $197 million, reflecting the impact of debt issued in connection with the Pharmacyclics acquisition. The adjusted tax rate was 21.9% in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $1.13, up nearly 27% year-over-year and exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.74. Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $4.26 to $4.28. This reflects EPS growth of approximately 28% at the midpoint. This guidance excludes $1.10 per share of intangible amortization expense, deal costs, integration and other specified items. We expect fourth quarter revenue growth on an operational basis in the low 20% range, excluding approximately 5% negative impact from exchange in the quarter. For the full year 2015, we are forecasting an operating margin of 42% to 42.5% of sales, and as Rick noted, today, we provided a 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $4.90 to $5.10. We'll provide more detail regarding this guidance as we normally do, on the fourth quarter call in January. So, in conclusion, we're pleased with the drivers of our strong performance, further demonstrating the quality of our results in the quarter, and thus far in 2015. We've driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion, while also advancing our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to deliver top-tier industry growth this year and in the coming years. With that, I'll turn it back to Rick to walk you through our long-term strategic objectives.
Richard Gonzalez: Thanks Bill. As a reminder, we have posted slides to our website which you can use to follow along. My remarks regarding our long-term strategy generally coincide with the presentation. Today, we'll share with you some of the key assumptions from our long-range plan which we review annually with our Board of Directors. Over the past couple of quarters. There has been an increasing level of interest from investors for more detail on our views regarding a variety of topics, including AbbVie's long-term growth prospects over the next several years, our ability to expand margins, our expectations around biosimilars and our pipeline prospects. Additionally, as we evaluated our long-range plans, expected performance versus Wall Street's consensus, there is a clear gap in revenue and EPS growth. Based on these dynamics, we decided it was appropriate to provide investors with a clear view of our expected performance and the significant drivers of that performance. Turning to Slide 3, our mission when we launched as an independent company was to create an innovation driven patient focused specialty biopharmaceutical company, capable of achieving sustainable top-tier performance through outstanding execution and a consistent stream of innovative medicines. Our actions, since our inception have clearly supported that mission. We've built an innovation driven culture, attracting top talent, focused on developing new products to address some of the most serious health conditions. We delivered outstanding performance from our promoted portfolio. This includes, HUMIRA, where we have accelerated growth and developed a comprehensive strategy for the future. Our heightened level of R&D investment has generated above industry success rate with positive clinical data and regulatory outcome from a number of development programs. Our pipeline now has a number of late stage de-risked assets with multibillion-dollar potential. We acquired Pharmacyclics, providing a major new growth platform in a key strategic area, and significantly strengthening our long-term growth prospects. We have placed a significant focus on driving operating efficiencies with impressive results to date. We've built shareholder value and confidence with investors based on consistent strong performance and we've delivered strong return of capital to investors, including a rapidly growing dividend. Our actions have placed AbbVie in a position to achieve top-tier performance, and you clearly see that in our results. As I mentioned earlier, our current guidance projects EPS growth of more than 28% in 2015. Our fundamental strategy is strong and we've built an excellent foundation. As you can see on Slide 4, since 2013 we have consistently delivered strong financial results, including acceleration across key financial parameters. We've generated significant top and bottom-line growth and robust operating cash flows. Turning to Slide 5, despite our enhanced level of R&D spend as you can see on this slide, which has grown substantially since we were a division within Abbott. We've driven significant improvement in both gross and operating margin profiles. We remain focused on further margin expansion, and I'll outline our commitments to enhancing these metrics in just a moment. Moving to Slide 6, we've also established a strong track record of delivering on our financial commitments, consistently meeting or exceeding our earnings estimates. We're proud of this outperformance, and we remain disciplined in achieving our stated objectives. As noted on Slide 7, AbbVie's total shareholder return since separation is nearly 76%, a result that places AbbVie in the top third of our peer group. These strong returns have created more than $35 billion of value for our shareholders, and a market cap of nearly $90 billion. Turning to Slide 8, while we've demonstrated a very strong track record of historical performance, we're also committed to delivering top-tier results in the years to come. As we evaluate our prospects over our long-range plan. We believe we're well-positioned for success. We're strategically positioned in attractive, high-growth market segments and based on continued strong performance from our existing portfolio of on market products, including our flagship brands HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, as well as growth from our pipeline products, we expect to deliver top-tier revenue growth through 2020. Today, as you can see on Slide 8, we're providing guidance for total company sales of approximately $37 billion in 2020. This reflects 10% top line sales growth on average over the five-year period. This guidance includes estimated global HUMIRA sales of more than $18 billion in 2020, which we believe appropriately captures the expected biosimilar dynamics globally. I'll share more detail on our comprehensive strategy to continue our leadership position in immunology later in these remarks. Additionally, we expect AbbVie's IMBRUVICA revenues to reach approximately $5 billion in 2020, driven by continued growth within the hematological oncology market, and our pipeline has the potential to achieve nominal peak revenues of nearly $30 billion by 2024. This estimate excludes new HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA indications and sales from our next-generation HCV combination, which are considered on market products, for the purpose of this calculation. We have the potential to launch more than 20 new products or indications through 2020, including seven approvals that will contribute in 2016, and beyond. I'll discuss some of these promising programs today but we will be covering our full pipeline in more detail at an R&D pipeline review to be held in Chicago during the 2016 ASCO meeting. As I mentioned, our significant focus on operating efficiencies has resulted in strong improvement of our gross and operating margin profiles. The Company is committed to driving continued expansion of operating margin and is targeting an adjusted operating margin of greater than 50% by 2020, with an average of 100 basis points to 200 basis points of improvement per year. AbbVie also remains committed to returning cash to shareholders, through a strong and growing dividend. To that end, today, we announced that our Board declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.51 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of approximately 12% beginning with a dividend payable in February 2016. Our commitment to top line growth and continued operating margin expansion will drive double-digit earnings-per-share growth on average through 2020, and today we're issuing strong full year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.10. This outlook represents 17% growth versus 2015, at the midpoint and positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for EPS growth again next year. Turning now to Slide 9. To accomplish these goals, we have narrowed our focus, and positioned AbbVie for a leadership in extremely attractive market segments. Our core areas of therapeutic focus include immunology, where we have a strong leadership position, across rheumatology, GI and dermatology. We're leveraging our scientific leadership and expertise to develop next-generation biologics and small molecules that elevate standard of care. We have multiple pipeline assets in mid- to late-stage development with best in class potential. The oncology market represents an $85 billion segment projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 12% through 2020. Within this market, we have a developing leadership position in the hematological segment with IMBRUVICA and we have several other mechanisms in development, including our BCL-2 PI3 kinase and our anti-CS1 antibody drug conjugate. We also have an emerging pipeline of assets for the treatment of solid tumors, including our PARP inhibitor, Veliparib and ABT-414 for glioblastoma multiforme. Virology also represents a large and durable segment for us. We've established a foothold in the marketplace with our current offering VIEKIRA. Our emphasis is on continuing to evolve HCV treatment, and our next-generation combination is poised to deliver meaningful improvements relative to currently available therapies. Earlier this year, we disclosed preliminary results from a Phase 2b study of our next-generation protease inhibitor ABT-493 and our next-generation NS5A inhibitor ABT-530. The interim data showed non-cirrhotic genotype 1a and 1b treatment-naive and experienced patients receiving the ribavirin free therapy for 12 weeks, achieved SVR 12 rates of 99%. The dose we intend to pursue in Phase 3 drove SVR 12 rates of 100%. Preliminary results from the eight-week treatment cohort were disclosed last week. These data show that 34 of 34 or 100% of genotype 1 patients achieved SVR4. We'll share additional results from our next-generation combination at the AASLD meeting next month.  Neurology represents a large market with significant unmet need. We're focused on developing disease modifying therapies for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative conditions. Our existing portfolio includes Duopa for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease and Zinbryta which is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe for multiple sclerosis. We're also placing focused investment in our late stage programs in women's health with elagolix, and renal disease with atrasentan, as well as early-stage programs in cystic fibrosis. Endometriosis and uterine fibroids are both highly prevalent conditions and elagolix has demonstrated promising results in the treatment of both of these conditions. Now turning to Slide 10, based on our long-range plan for our marketed product portfolio, and our risk-adjusted pipeline, we're targeting total revenue of approximately $37 billion in 2020, reflecting a top line compounded annual growth rate of 10%. As you can see, our estimates are roughly $5 billion above the current Wall Street consensus. Our 2020 target revenue is based on a number of performance drivers. We expect HUMIRA to continue to be a strong growth driver, adding close to $4 billion in sales by 2020. AbbVie's IMBRUVICA revenue will reach approximately $5 billion by 2020. Our HCV franchise will remain a significant contributor to our long-range plan. Our pipeline will add more than $4 billion in risk-adjusted sales and Duopa will reach blockbuster status globally. Turning now to Slide 11, we expect several key products within our current marketed product portfolio to add significant growth in the years to come, including HUMIRA, IMBRUVICA, HCV and Duopa collectively will add $10 billion in incremental sales by 2020. Growth of HUMIRA will be driven by continued biologic penetration across disease categories and new indications. I'll talk more about our planning assumptions around HUMIRA growth and the impact of biosimilars in just a moment. IMBRUVICA's growth in this timeframe will be predominantly driven by increasing penetration within our currently approved set of indications and movement in the frontline use for those indications. The RESONATE-2 data further reinforces our view that IMBRUVICA will be a highly successful agent in frontline therapy for CLL. Growth will also come from label expansion into new hematological cancer, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Growth in our HCV franchise will be driven by continued uptake of VIEKIRA PAK across geographies, including Japan, the second largest HCV market globally, and we expect to commercialize our next-generation HCV offering in 2017, which will be a pan-genotypic once daily, ritonavir and ribavirin-free combination. Given the significant global prevalence of this disease, we expect the HCV market to be very durable, well into 2020. As I said, we forecast Duopa will achieve sales greater than $1 billion globally by 2020, and finally other products in our on market portfolio including Creon, Synagis, Lupron, Synthroid represent steady and durable sales contributors over our long-range plan. Turning to Slide 12, our growth outlook for HUMIRA is based on a thorough analysis of the global market dynamics and the strategy that we've put in place. We've taken what we believe is a realistic view of the market and the competitive environment over the next five years, and expect global HUMIRA sales in 2020 to exceeded $18 billion. Turning to Slide 13, we have a comprehensive strategy in place, which we believe will allow us to protect and grow our leadership position in immunology. Our multifaceted strategy is comprised of HUMIRA intellectual property, enhancements to HUMIRA, innovation, including a robust immunology pipeline and strong commercial execution. Turning now to Slide 14, we're planning conservatively with respect to the timing for European biosimilars and for planning purposes expect direct HUMIRA biosimilar competition upon expiration of our compound patent in Europe in October 2018. However, we are pursuing additional IP in Europe and expect the situation to evolve over time. Again, though, the guidance we've outlined today excludes any potential benefit from our IP in Europe. Turning to our U.S. patent estate, as you can see on Slide 14, we have built a robust portfolio of intellectual property. Beyond our composition of matter patent, we have more than 70 additional later expiring U.S. patents related to HUMIRA. The vast majority of these patents which reflect significant innovation and investment were granted by the U.S. patent and trademark office within the past two years. These patents expire between 2022 and 2034. The size of AbbVie's patent estate is a direct consequence of the ground-breaking work of AbbVie scientists in a new field of biologics. Small molecules drugs have been around for many decades, but therapeutic antibodies are much newer, larger and more complex. Because they must be made in living organisms, biologics are more difficult to manufacture. In addition, because they are foreign proteins that are introduced into the human body, biologics present unique challenges in terms of formulation and treatment. Not only is the field new, but HUMIRA itself was a new type of biologic. It was the first fully human therapeutic antibody ever approved by the FDA. The development of HUMIRA was unchartered territory. Those efforts resulted in the United States Patent Office granting AbbVie dozens of patents covering HUMIRA. The coverage of our later expiring patents includes methods of use for the drug in all HUMIRA indications, methods to formulate the drug, and methods to make the drug, as well as other aspects of the HUMIRA product such as the delivery device. Any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of HUMIRA will have to contend with this extensive patent estate, which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously. With respect to formulating the drug, we have patents on formulating the HUMIRA antibody, that also expire no earlier than 2022. Biologic drugs must be administered intravenously or as injections and can be difficult to formulate properly. Given our extensive experience with HUMIRA, these patents cover not only our commercial formulation, but also other related formulations that biosimilar companies might employ. 14 patents have been issued covering different formulations of HUMIRA. With respect to making the drug, we have important patents on the methods of manufacturing HUMIRA that expire no earlier than 2027. The living cells that produce biologic drugs such as HUMIRA can be sensitive to small changes in the manufacturing process. Minor differences in manufacturing process can affect the nature of the biologic drug and even its clinical effect. 24 patents have been issued covering methods of manufacturing HUMIRA and HUMIRA compositions resulting from those methods. Today, I'll focus on those patents which cover using the drug, otherwise known as method of treatment patents. While AbbVie's formulation and manufacturing patents for HUMIRA also have broad coverage, without further information on the biosimilar we cannot know with certainty, the extent to which these patents will be infringed. Now turning to Slide 15. Since the biosimilar statute requires the biosimilar to obtain approval for one or more indications previously approved for the innovator drug, and have the same route of administration, dosage form and strength, we know biosimilars will infringe these method of use patents. We have method of treatment patents covering all the indications for which HUMIRA has been approved. These patents do not expire until 2022 or later. These patents reflect the development work of more than 100 clinical trials, spanning 18 years. As discovered through this work and reflected in the HUMIRA label, different diseases require different treatment regimens, which AbbVie discovered following significant investment in clinical development. These patent in uses have been key to the success of HUMIRA. They have opened up new and better treatment options for an increased patient population and improved the quality of life for those patients. Our method of treatment patents cover the approved dosing regimens for each indication and are not mere refinements of previous dosing regimens, which is often the case with method of treatment patents in the small molecule arena. Furthermore, biologics like HUMIRA are more complex and unpredictable by their nature than small molecules. As such, Biologics present unique challenges in terms of treatment. One challenge was the fact that HUMIRA targets TNF alpha, a protein that plays an important role in the human immune system. It is critical to find the right balance in terms of blocking the harmful effects caused by excessive TNF alpha without interfering with the normal functioning of the immune system. This made the development of safe and effective methods of administering HUMIRA all the more difficult, and because HUMIRA was the first human therapeutic antibody ever approved by the FDA of any type, the work by AbbVie scientists was unprecedented. In total, putting aside the composition of matter patents on HUMIRA, there are 22 issued patents directed to the treatment of TNF mediated diseases that expire in 2022 or later. Additional applications are pending and still being examined in the patent office. Again, a biosimilar company will have to contend with our method of treatment patents for every indication for which it seeks approval, as well as our formulation and manufacturing patents which are not limited to any particular indication. Turning to Slide 16. As you evaluate the timeframe for a potential U.S. biosimilar market entry, it is important that you consider the legal process and the likely timeline for resolution. While it's always difficult to estimate the precise duration of the litigation process, the average time to trial for a patent action is nearly 3.5 years. Appeals to the Federal Circuit Court usually take one year. So, based on similar cases, the total litigation timing may be as long as four or five years. At risk launches, when a company launches a generic product before patent expiration and before a final determination that a patent is invalid or not infringed, are relatively rare due to the potential exposure. Because of HUMIRA's success such damages could be extremely large. Of course, we can't know how other companies will evaluate that risk. However, in the event a biosimilar attempts to launch at risk, AbbVie will seek injunctive relief. For the reasons we've already discussed, biosimilars will necessarily infringe our patents. Given the unique properties of HUMIRA and the lack of any prior experience with fully human monoclonal antibodies these patents are strong. Courts considering request for preliminary injunctions have considered these factors important and have granted injunctions where they are present. Turning now to Slide 17, another important aspect of our immunology strategy is our pipeline. This includes both enhancements to HUMIRA as well as our promising pipeline of new products in development, which are designed to restate standard of care in each of our areas of leadership. We have two new indications for HUMIRA that will contribute significantly to the product's continued growth. We also recently received approval in Europe for a new formulation of HUMIRA, which provides meaningful patient benefit, including lower levels of pain, versus the current formulation, and we are submitting regulatory applications for an improved HUMIRA pen device which we expect to introduce in 2016. Finally, we are continuing to work on developing proprietary delivery technologies and devices to further enhance the product. Behind HUMIRA, we have a pipeline of mid and late stage immunology assets in clinical development. AbbVie is the clear leader in immunology. It is a category we understand extremely well and our performance is reflective of our deep expertise. As we embarked upon developing a set of next-generation assets, we did so with our knowledge of the type of breakthrough profile a new drug would require in order to achieve a significant market share position. Each of the assets that we have in our immunology pipeline has the potential to deliver that type of market changing product profile that we're targeting. We're very pleased with the mid-stage results from our selective JAK1 inhibitor ABT-494, which shows the potential to be best in class in RA with high efficacy once daily dosing and a favorable benefit risk profile. We're particularly excited about the results of ABT-494 demonstrated in the most challenging patient population, the anti-TNF inadequate responders. Given that anti-TNF therapies have been available now for nearly 2 decades. This patient population has grown over time. In fact, the population currently represents roughly 35% of the U.S. patient population. We are rapidly moving ABT-494, the Phase 3 studies, and it is our goal to launch this asset into the U.S. market well in advance of any biosimilar entry. Our large and experienced commercial organization which currently represents HUMIRA will promote ABT-494 and our other immunology pipeline assets upon their U.S. commercialization. We have tremendous confidence in the organization's ability to successfully represent these assets. We also believe our DVD antibody platform holds tremendous promise in the treatment of certain immunity conditions. ABT-122 is our combination anti-TNF anti-IL-17, two proven mechanisms which is currently in Phase 2 trials for RA, and psoriatic arthritis. Our earlier development work with the platform has established that our DVDs have favorable drug-like properties, similar to monoclonal antibodies and can be manufactured reliably. We'll see data from the mid-stage trial in RA in early 2016 and results from our study in psoriatic arthritis later in the year. If the results are positive, we will quickly advance ABT-122 into Phase 3 development. We're also working to advance several other early and mid-stage immunology programs including our partnered anti-IL-6 Nanobody and we continue to explore the LMA landscape for assets that fit our target product profile. Moving on to Slide 18, HUMIRA's unique product profile and AbbVie's strong commercial execution has HUMIRA the number one prescribed biologic with the highest commercial prescription market share, including the highest percentage of new patient starts. HUMIRA holds the preferred or co-preferred position on managed care of more than 90% of U.S. covered lives. Patients, physicians and payers recognize the meaningful clinical and economic value of HUMIRA as a treatment option for the broadest set of immune mediated diseases. We've demonstrated that treatment with HUMIRA is more cost-effective and saves payers on downstream costs associated with diseases like RA, Crohn's and psoriasis. Moving on now to Slide 19. As I said, we've taken what we believe is a realistic view of our prospects of our long-range plan. Given the competitive landscape, potential for biosimilars and other factors. Our plan is built around a key set of assumptions that vary by geography. Let me start with international. Internationally, we are planning for mid-single digit market growth over the long range plan. Our plan assumes some limited erosion upon Enbrel biosimilar launches starting in 2016. As outlined, embedded within our guidance is an expectation for HUMIRA ex-U.S. biosimilar launch in the fourth quarter of 2018, with the expected pricing and market share performance for such products. We anticipate moderate erosion from direct HUMIRA biosimilar competition beginning in 2019. In the U.S. our long-range plan assumes that U.S. markets deliver mid to high size single digit market growth driven by roughly a 4 point increase in biologic penetration. Despite competitive entries we expect HUMIRA will only experience minor erosion of market share over our LRP, and as we've outlined, we believe the litigation process and our intellectual property estate will protect HUMIRA from biosimilar entry until 2022. Our LRP also assumes successful penetration of new HUMIRA indications and then our immunology pipeline will begin to contribute new revenues with commercialization of ABT-494 in 2019 and other assets to follow. It is our expectation that AbbVie's immunology pipeline will contribute nearly $8 billion in nominal sales in 2024, with ABT-494 a significantly de-risked asset, representing roughly half that expected contribution. Now, moving to Slide 20 and moving on to our oncology portfolio, as we've said, we acquired Pharmacyclics and IMBRUVICA represents a pipeline in a molecule with significant growth potential through its existing and expanding list of indications and lines of therapy. This transformative therapy has already secured approval for the treatment of four indications and there are more than 25 company-sponsored clinical studies to evaluate IMBRUVICA as a treatment for a wide range of additional cancers. In its first year on the market, Pharmacyclics and our partner have driven market-leading performance and therapeutic uptake of IMBRUVICA, clearly demonstrating the strength of the medicine's attributes and its clinical profile. We expect IMBRUVICA to achieve blockbuster status in 2015, with AbbVie's projected IMBRUVICA revenues growing to approximately $5 billion in 2020. IMBRUVICA, has vast potential for label expansion and future indications. It is currently being evaluated in mid and late stage trials in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma. We are also encouraged about IMBRUVICA's potential in graft-versus-host disease based on data from an earlier stage study, and if IBRUVICA demonstrates clinical value in solid tumors there would certainly be significant upside to our expectations. We recently initiated a phase 3 trial evaluating IMBRUVICA and pancreatic cancer, and we're currently studying IMBRUVICA in other solid tumour types in combination with immuno-oncology, including early-stage studies in breast and lung cancer. Turning now to Slide 21, our acquisition of Pharmacyclics significantly accelerated AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology. With IMBRUVICA, we've established a leadership position in the haematological oncology market, which is poised to nearly double to $50 billion by 2020. We're well-positioned to build upon our leadership in this category with other promising assets in development. Beyond IMBRUVICA, we have several other products in development that have the potential to offer differentiated efficacy in a wide range of blood cancers. Our BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax is in late stage development for CLL, and mid-stage trials for several other cancer types, including NHL, AML and multiple myeloma. Duvelisib is a mid and late stage trials for CLL and NHL, and we have an innovative antibody drug conjugate in early development for multiple myeloma. Given our broad portfolio, we believe, we have the potential to continue to evolve the treatment landscape with combinations of these and other mechanisms. Our goal is to markedly improve efficacy by achieving deep, durable disease control or remissions while reducing or eliminating the use of toxic chemotherapy. We recently completed the design for our first clinical trial evaluating Venetoclax in combination with IMBRUVICA and Gazyva in first-line CLL and we expect to initiate the study in the first half of 2016. We also have an active discovery program with the objective to drive the next wave of immuno-oncology development beyond checkpoint inhibitors. We're particularly focused on the use of our bispecific biologic platform to support conditional activation of the immune system in the vicinity of tumour cells, and we're leveraging the emerging science of soluble T-cell receptor technology as well. We anticipate multiple immuno-oncology assets moving into human trials in 2016. Moving to Slide 22, the assets in our pipeline stay in attractive especially categories. All told, we have more than 50 products or indications currently being evaluated in human trials with more than 20 currently in registrational trials or under active regulatory review. Turning now to Slide 23, we built a robust pipeline comprised of potentially transformational medicines in large markets with profound unmet medical need. Our pipeline has the potential to deliver nearly $30 billion in nominal new revenue by 2024. Several products currently in late stage development have the potential to be multibillion-dollar assets that will offer growth and top line diversification. We also have numerous programs in early stage development underway that have the potential to come to fruition in the later years of our long-range plan. Now turning to Slide 24. Over the past year, we've seen data from numerous key assets that have further increased our level of confidence in all likelihood of clinical, regulatory and commercial success. Based on our progress, we have significantly de-risked a large number of major development programs that now have a very high probability of success. For example, our first registrational study for Venetoclax in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17P deletion met its primary endpoint and is currently under regulatory review. As mentioned earlier, the frontline data for IMBRUVICA in CLL were robust and our regulatory applications are under active review. Regulatory submissions for Zinbryta and MS are well underway, supported by a large registration program that showed the novel biological superior versus an active comparator. We've seen positive data from several Elagolix studies in endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Our partnered asset, Elotuzumab is currently under regulatory review for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, following receipt of breakthrough designation. We disclosed top line data from our selective JAK1 inhibitor ABT-2494, illustrating its potential for best in class efficacy in RA even in the most difficult to treat TNF inadequate responder patients. We have successfully completed the HUMIRA uveitis pivotal trial with filings currently under regulatory review, and we announced top line data from our next-generation HCV program illustrating its potential to offer a highly competitive profile. Turning now to Slide 25. We made significant progress with our pipeline and we anticipate continued advancements between now and the end of 2016. As you can see noted on this slide, we have numerous product approvals, data readouts, registration submissions and phase transitions anticipated over the next year or so. Now turning to Slide 26. The continued growth from our existing portfolio combined with the risk-adjusted sales contribution from our pipeline will drive top-tier revenue performance over our long-range plan. This level of revenue growth puts AbbVie near the very top of our expanded peer group based on current consensus estimates. Turning now to Slide 27, in addition to the strong top line growth we also expect to deliver significant margin expansion in the years to come. Our focus on driving operating efficiencies to date has resulted in strong improvement in both gross and operating margin profiles. On this slide, you can see the significant level of margin improvement that we've delivered since our first quarter as an independent company. Turning to Slide 28. Our continued focus on operating margin will drive further expansion with a projected operating margin of greater than 50% by 2020 and an average of 100 basis points to 200 basis points of improvement per year. Expansion will be driven primarily by ongoing efficiency programs, optimized manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses, productivity initiatives and supply chain, and the reduction of HUMIRA royalty expense in 2017 and 2018. Additionally, we'll see continued sales leverage from our rapidly growing top line. Our guidance for 2020 operating margin incorporates approximately 200 basis points of diluted impact partnered assets, including IMBRUVICA, Venetoclax, Zinbryta and Synagis. As you can see on Slide 29, this powerful combination of revenue growth and margin expansion, positions AbbVie as one of the top EPS growth companies among our expanded peer group. Turning now to Slide 30. AbbVie generates significant cash flow, which we expect will grow in 2016, and beyond. So far in 2015, we have repurchased $6.25 billion of shares, including the ASR associated with Pharmacyclics acquisition, and we have $3.45 billion remaining on our current buyback program. As I mentioned earlier, today, we announced that our Board has authorized a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. Since 2013, we've increased our dividend by more than 42%, and we intend to maintain a strong commitment to growing dividend going forward. We'll also use our strong cash flow to continue to augment our pipeline through strategic licensing, acquisitions and partnering activity. Over the past several years, we've added numerous promising assets to our portfolio and we continue to focus on identifying compelling programs that fit our strategic criteria. Turning to Slide 31, since we became an independent company in 2013, we've consistently delivered on our commitments, and we are positioned to deliver more than 28% bottom-line growth in 2015. A level of performance that puts us at the top of our peer group, and as we look at 2016, we're once again poised to deliver top tier financial performance with EPS growth of 17%, the midpoint of our strong guidance range. Based on our 2016 midpoint, AbbVie will have grown its EPS by roughly 60% in just three years. Across our long-range plan, we're projecting our EPS growth to average nearly 15%, again putting AbbVie in the very top of our peer group. In summary, we're well-positioned to deliver strong top and bottom-line performance through 2020 and beyond. We've established growth platforms in some of the largest and most diffractive market segments, including immunology, oncology, virology and neurology and we build a compelling pipeline in these areas which will contribute significantly to our performance in the years to come. Our commitment to top line growth and expanding our operating margin to greater than 50% will generate double-digit EPS growth on average through 2020. We've built a strong foundation and we are committed to delivering top-tier financial performance. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Larry. Larry?
Larry Peepo: Thanks, Rick, and we'll now open the call for questions. Operator, we will take our first question please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jami Rubin: Thank you, and wow that was a lot of detail, Rick. It's going to take time I think to digest it all, but I know that we certainly really appreciate it. First question is this, was wondering if management's comp is tied to the long term targets. Secondly, it seems that the biggest delta between the Street and your guidance on HUMIRA is timing of a biosimilar launch. Wondering if you could comment on that and also if you could comment on Amgen CEO's comment on his earnings call, where he said that HUMIRA has IP and Amgen has to respect that. So, is it the case that the Street's coming around to your view on the strength of your IP and the timeline of 351(k) pathway regulations or has something really changed in terms of your confidence with IP? Thirdly, and I'm sorry for this but, with your operating margin guidance growing to over 50% by the end of the decade, it looks like that's really coming or driven by strong revenue growth not by operating cost cuts. Can you confirm that and obviously in a sort of a bear case scenario, how much flexibility do you have to reduce your SG&A? We all know you're spending a lot on HUMIRA and having a really good return on investment, but if that changes, how much flexibility do you have? Thanks very much.
Larry Peepo: Thank you, Jami.
Richard Gonzalez: Thank you Jami for all those questions. So, we'll cover each and every one of them. Let me start with the management comp. I mean, I think similar to probably the other companies in our industry, the vast majority of the executive team's comp is in long-term incentive that's associated with the appreciation of the stock. So, I'd say we're directly linked to that. In addition to that, for the top people within our company, we have two levels of incentive plans. One, is basically focused on the short-term plan year and then we have one, which is a longer term plan that basically is designed to hit a three-year out target, where you would set things like this operating margin target and so the bottom line is yes, I mean, there's perfect alignment between all of these metrics and how people will be rewarded against those. To your second question, which was, is the GAAP primarily the timing of biosimilars? I'd say, that's accurate for the most part. There's probably more penetration and more growth in the indications in general that are built-in versus the Street but the more significant part is the assumption that we're making around the timing of U.S. biosimilar entry. As far as the Amgen CEO, I read the comment. I find the comment encouraging, but I'm not going to comment specifically on what they said. I think, to your point about, is the Street just now coming around to our point of view, I mean, in fairness much of this IP has only really come out in the last two years and I think both competitively that is now something that people who were interested in coming up with a biosimilar are having to evaluate. So, it's not like they had a lot of time. The Street certainly didn't have a lot of time to be able to evaluate that as well. I'd say, secondarily look, there was no advantage to us going out early and touting that either. We were to make sure that our strategy was in a position that was solid and where we wanted to be and we worked hard over the last three or four years to get our strategy in place and we're at a point now where we're confident to be able talk about it, and you heard my words, so you probably can't be much clearer about what our intent is and so at the end of the day, I think, in fairness to the Street you now have all the information you can determine your point of view around that. I'd say on the confidence in the IP, we have a high level of confidence in the IP, and so I think we feel very good about our position and if anything, our tendency, when we do our long-range plan is to be a little bit on the conservative side. I'd say the Europe assumptions that we're making as an example, I think are clearly conservative. There's far more opportunity for upside than there is downside and that's normally how we try to build our forecast because, we want an opportunity to be able to make sure that we achieve those. On the operating margin, I think what your question was, was, is it almost all driven by sales leverage? No, and I think, the way to think about it is this, so, in Bill's comments, we guided to the end of this year being 42.5, because remember the fourth quarter will have high Synagis sales and we'll also have a full quarter of IMBRUVICA. So, we have more partnered revenues in the fourth quarter. So that tends to be dilutive as I described. So we'll exit this year somewhere around 42.5, but then I think that the way to think about the target that we've set here is you have to back out the dilutive impact over the five-year LRP, which is about 200 basis points. So you back down to about 40 as your starting point. So you're going to go to 40 to something north of 50, so about a 10 point improvement. If you look at that 10 point improvement, and I've Bill here with me, roughly 25% of it comes from the royalty reduction on HUMIRA that will occur between '17 and '18, about 30% of it comes from cost reductions, cost management kinds of programs and the remainder comes from the leverage that we see of a fast growing top line with expenses being managed at a significantly lower growth rate. That's how you ought to think about it.
Jami Rubin: Okay. Super helpful. Thank you, very much.
Larry Peepo: All right, thanks Jami. Next question for us please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeffrey Holford from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.
Jeffrey Holford: Thanks very much and thanks to the team. It was a very comprehensive midterms outlook today, which I mean really sets out your positioning on HUMIRA and the rest of the business very clearly. So, now obviously the debate on HUMIRA will continue and it seems that the linchpin near term is the achievement of an injunction against any would be at risk launches. We've recently heard from Amgen, regarding at risk launch and we certainly heard that also from other large biosimilar players, but could you be more specific on the trigger starting perhaps on the infringement process and the injunction process so we can think better at the timing of those. Are they more likely to be tied to filings or FDA approvals? So, that's the first piece. Second on 2016 guidance, it would just seem to us that you're potentially implying you do not expect to increase the $3 billion exit rate for the hep C franchise in 2016, if you could speak to that too. Then just last, you talked about being ready for larger deals again by 2017. To be clear, the current guidance does not include anything for additional M&A, just to be clear on that and then, can you tell us a bit more about substantial share repurchases that might be part of your midterm plan too, at least as a backstop if you can't find substantial M&A targets? Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: I'm actually going to have Laura address your first question Jeff and then I'll cover the rest.
Laura Schumacher: With respect to the trigger for the filing of litigation, there's a process that's laid out specifically in the statute, which there has been litigation over whether or not that process is mandatory or not. From our standpoint, we are anticipating that in the event that there is a biosimilar applicant, they will or won't choose to follow that process, at some time to be not mandatory, should they choose not to follow that process upon notice of the filing of the application, of course, we would initiate the litigation. With respect specifically to an injunction against an at risk launch, that injunction against an at risk launch would be triggered upon the approval of a biosimilar and of course we would then request that the court enforce our IP. As Rick laid out earlier, we intend to vigorously enforce the IP and we believe we have a very strong case for an injunction. First of all that we believe any biosimilar applicant will infringe at least certain of our patents, because in order to follow the -- to be classified as a biosimilar they will need to have the same dosing regimen as the innovator product. As to validity, we think we have a very strong case on validity given the uniqueness of HUMIRA and the fact that HUMIRA was the first fully human antibody approved by the FDA, and there was nothing known about its effectiveness or its optimal dosing regimen at the time that we did extensive clinical work, trial, investment et cetera. So, we believe in the event that there was an at risk launch, we would have a very strong case for our preliminary injunction. Also, as you know, in the event a biosimilar would choose to launch at risk, the damages for such a launch, should it be found to be violative of our patents would be very significant.
Jeffrey Holford: Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay, thanks Laura. So, let me take the M&A question. Yes, the guidance that was laid out today doesn't cover any significant acquisition activity or licensing acquisition activity. So obviously, as that played out, we would look at -- based on the significance of it, we would make a decision how we would with that. Something we could manage or something that we could not and then we would obviously pass that into our guidance and communicate it appropriately. As we talked about before, I'd say that our focus for the next couple of years is more trying to fill out our portfolio of assets within the therapeutic areas that we're in. We don't anticipate a large transaction in that timeframe and nothing has changed around that front, and that kind of gets to the whole share repurchase. Although, I'll have Bill talk about that just for a moment as well, but ultimately, how we look at share repurchase versus M&A is we're trying to manage between those two to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity to be able to do the things that we need to do for the business longer-term and share repurchase is more of an opportunistic kind of approach. So, Bill, is there anything you want to add to it?
William Chase: No, I mean, obviously, if you look at this long-range plan, there's going to be pretty robust cash generation. As we get out a couple of years, that can clearly fund larger M&A if we deem that's necessary. To the extent that, that an opportunity isn't readily apparent, well then, we'd certainly have to look at other things to do with that cash and share repurchases could very well be part of that.
Richard Gonzalez: So on the 2016 guidance, I mean, obviously, we've just gone through our planning process for 2016, and the way we do planning is we build everything up from the bottom up, product by product, and we make determinations as to what we're going to assume for each product based on a set of assumptions that we think are absolutely realistic and so we have an HCV number that's in our 2016. We tend to be a little bit on the conservative side when we build these up so that we have the flexibility to make sure that for any unforeseen events, we have the ability to be able to manage our way through those and I'd say, this plan is no different than previous ones that we built, but specifically, for HCV, I'd say HCV will have some growth built into it year-over-year because just the gadding [ph] of how the countries have rolled out over time internationally you're going to get year-over-year and we're just launching in Japan now, well, we're not launching. We will be launching shortly in Japan now and Japan's a significant opportunity for us. So it will create a year-over-year growth driver for us as well. So, I'd say there is growth built into the HCV franchise, but let me specifically talk maybe about this $3 billion running rate, because I know I made that prediction in the early part of the year. If you look at where we are right now, what I would tell you is, we're going to be close, but we're slightly below that right now in the fourth quarter. At least as what we had built into our current guidance for the year and is the function primarily of the fact that -- in the beginning of the year, the number of patients being treated was significantly higher. We've seen that trend down. We've seen some changes in VA, in the United States. So, I'd say, we're going to be close. We could make it, but we might miss it and as I said, we tend to build conservatively what we have in the fourth quarter right now is slightly below that.
Jeffrey Holford: That's great. Thanks very much.
Larry Peepo: All right. Thanks Jeff. Next question for us please, operator?
Operator: The next question comes from Mr. Mark Goodman from UBS. Sir, your line is open.
Mark Goodman: Yes, morning. 494, $4 billion in 2024 is a pretty big number. Can you help frame how you're thinking about that and then secondly, just AndroGel continues to be a little stronger than we think, why is that? What's going on behind the scenes? Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: 494, based on the profile that we've set up. I would say $4 billion of risk-adjusted revenue for an asset that has that profile in that timeframe isn't a stretched number from our perspective at all. When you look at the level of response you have in the TNF inadequate responder patient population, which as I said in my remarks represent about 35% of the U.S. patients, we assume it's something similar to that in Europe. It's a little more difficult to get to the data in Europe. It's a sizable population and it's in the population that has relatively limited number of options available to it. In addition to that, when you think about how biosimilars will ultimately roll out, I think it's a good assumption to assume that biosimilars are going to capture some portion, maybe a significant portion but at least some portion of the new patients. So they're going to be generating more TNF inadequate responders. Now, they might rotate to another TNF after that but, a proprietary product will have an opportunity in a biosimilar world to go after those nonresponders, and so that's a very significant opportunity. In addition to that, obviously to my comments about our organization representing this product will be a goal to be able to take the appropriate patients and try to move them to the appropriate kinds of therapies. So, patients that aren't responding as well on HUMIRA, obviously we would want to move them to 494 as an alternative. So when you look at all of that, I'd actually say that the $4 billion number is not a number that we're uncomfortable with.
William Chase: And Mark on AndroGel, clearly it has performed better than the Street was thinking and frankly it's performed a little bit better than we were thinking. The market still is in decline. However, what you're really seeing is less uptake or less impact on the brand from the generic 1% formulation. It's something we're just going to have to keep our eye on, but so far so good.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Mark. Our next question please operator?
Operator: The next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks very much and thanks for all the details today. Just had three quick ones here. First, following up on Jami's question. If for whatever reason the HUMIRA IP falls and sales end up closer to say consensus than your $18 billion target, is a 50% margin realistic in that scenario? I'm just trying to get a sense of like where margins could go in that downside case, that's not the scenario you laid out, but just trying to understand that. Second, just thoughts on what happened earlier this year with Amgen and Sandoz with NEUPOGEN. Are there any learnings, similarities or differences that we should apply when you think about the HUMIRA situation? Then finally, on the longer term, international HUMIRA targets, could you just give us a little bit more color on the type of erosion you're assuming given biosimilars for Enbrel and potentially HUMIRA over that window, just how much price and volume impact are you kind of reflecting here? Thanks very much.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. So, I don't know that the 50% margin target would be realistic in a more catastrophic kind of situation. What I would tell you is, we've obviously laid out contingency plans by country, because this will be rolled out by country obviously, right as biosimilars enter those countries and we have an erosion curve that we built by country and if the country starts to fall below that erosion curve, then we'll do what we always do and that is, we will manage the expense base accordingly. So, we have the ability to be able to manage and offset the profitability like we would do with any type of LOE. So at the end of the day, I think know whether or not it had a 50% margin target or not, we would put a contingency plan in place that would allow us to try to maximize profitability or preserve profitability under that scenario. Having said that, what I will tell you is, we have a high level of confidence in what we've built here and we don't build LRPs that we don't believe we can achieve. Again, we're not showing you anything different than what our internal LRP says that we present to our Board every year. So, at the end of the day, I can tell you, we have a high level of confidence that we can deliver against what we've put here. The learnings from Amgen. I'm assuming you're talking about sort of the whole IP and litigation process for Amgen. I'm going to have Laura address that for you.
Laura Schumacher: With respect to the Amgen Neupogen litigation, a lot of the debate in that litigation surrounded whether or not the pre-litigation exchange process, whereby patents and information were exchanged between the innovator and biosimilar, whether that was a mandatory process or a voluntary process, and ultimately, as I said previously, we're not anticipating from a timing standpoint that there will be a litigation exchange, it will be something that the biosimilar applicant will choose to participate in or not. With respect to the underlying patent infringement litigation with Amgen and Neupogen, our litigation, our patent estate is very different than that. In that case, there's very few claims and patents and ours is as we've said before, we have over 70 patents, many of which, certain of which will be infringed and some of which may be infringed. So, we'll have to see when we know more specifically about what formulation and/or process that particular biosimilar applicant uses.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. Thanks Laura. Then on the European erosion curve, obviously as part of this planning process we have built a very specific erosion curve for both Europe as well as the United States when we get beyond 2022. So, what I would say to you is, I'll walk through the European one or I'll walk through the international one, I guess more generally. What I'd say is, it's fairly complex, because there are lots of different variables if you think about it right, you're going to have countries rolling out at different times as they enter those countries and they get pricing approval within those countries. Not every country is exactly the same, how you get pricing approval. So, there's sort of this gated period where you go across country by country as biosimilars would enter it. The second thing is, you have to layer in what our strategy will be, and we've built a strategy by country. There will be countries where we choose to take price erosion to maintain all of the patients, new patients and well-maintained patients. There may be countries where we choose to only keep well-maintained patients, and do something different from a pricing standpoint. So, there's some complexities around that. Then the third point that I'd say to you, that's very important as you think about this, because I'm going to walk you through what the erosion looks like here in just a moment, is when a biosimilar enters the international market, these markets are still growing. As I said, they're growing like mid-single-digits and so as I described to you what the erosion looks like, the number I'm going to give you is lower than what they could actually capture or the price erosion might ultimately translate to, because they will take a certain portion of that market growth within those markets. So having said all that, I think the simplest way to think about the erosion curve is this, if you think about international HUMIRA sales, they will peak in the forecast we laid out for you here, all the financials we've laid out, they peak in 2018 and from 2018 then they start to decline, and if you move out two years to 2020 which is the year we're characterizing for you, the erosion of the international HUMIRA business is about 15% to 18%. Now, having said that, the impact or the opportunity lost, that probably is the best way to think about would be greater than that, because without biosimilar competition, HUMIRA would've continued to grow in those international markets beyond that period of time, and so it probably sounds a little lower than you would've expected, but it's because you have to think about it in those two components, part of the component is it will take some price out of the market which will reduce market growth, the other component is and they take some new patients. So, they're taking some of the market growth out that way, but just say what is the impact on AbbVie? It is the brand peaks at that point and it declines about 15% over that period of time.
Chris Schott: Very helpful. Thank you.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Chris. Next question, operator.
Operator: The next question operator question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Mark Schoenebaum: Hey guys, thanks for all the detail. I am in agreement with the other analysts on that. A couple of questions. Number one, what was operational HUMIRA growth rates -- operational HUMIRA growth rates quarter on quarter as well as year on year in international markets? The second question is you didn't comment on your tax rate over the long-term. I don't think I saw that in your slides, and I would assume that as the Company diversifies away from HUMIRA, you're going to diversify into more tax optimized drugs -- tax optimized assets. So, I would personally be comfortable modelling a decline in your tax rate. I wanted to hear your thoughts on that and when I do that, and when I use an operating margin of only 51, even though your guidance says, greater than 50, it could be 55 or 60 who knows, I'm getting to an EPS number in 2020 of around $10 a share. I'm just -- I know you're not giving an EPS number, but am I thinking about this all wrong, because most people say I'm not very good with math.
Richard Gonzalez: Why don't you cover the tax rate Bill, I'll cove the --
William Chase: Yeah, so, if you look at this business since we separated from Abbott, the tax rate has been pretty consistently in the 21% to 22% range. That's largely driven by our need for U.S. cash for certain items. So, as we do our LRP again, what we do is, we build it on a fairly conservative basis and what I would tell you is our assumptions are that that tax rate in the 21% to 22% is the right assumption for this business over the next 10 years.
Mark Schoenebaum: That's because of your repatriation needs. So, imagine the tax rate on single assets that are large, like your new JAK and IMBRUVICA, on a P&L basis, a single product P&L basis would be much lower.
William Chase: Yeah, but you've got IMBRUVICA which is largely a U.S. product for us from a tax rate. So, that actually lifts the tax rate the other way. So, I mean, you've got a lot of different things in the mix, Mark.
Mark Schoenebaum: Okay thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: So, on the EPS target, I would just tell you that at the end of the day, we built it up from the bottom up and we don't come up with your number. At the end of the day, you're going to assume 50%, 60%, 70% operating margin profile and get pretty big numbers, but if you're going to drive this level of growth, you have to invest in the business in a way that allows you to be able to do that. So I think the numbers we have forecasted certainly represent the top tier in this industry and they're the numbers that we're willing to stand behind. On operational growth internationally for HUMIRA quarter versus quarter, what I'd tell you is this, we sell HUMIRA in almost 100 countries around the world, right and many of those countries have tenders and tenders don't always fall consistently in the same quarter. So, quarter over quarter, doesn't necessarily give you a very accurate picture of how the brand is growing, although I'll address it here in a moment to answer specifically your question. I think the best way to think about HUMIRA internationally, I'd like to choose this year as the example is the [indiscernible] growth rate is for the first three quarters worth of growth and compare it to what the prior year was, I think that's the most reflective way to look at it, and I would say that revenues are up about 8.3% year to date, year-over-year. Volume is up about 10%, so slightly down in price, which is consistent with what we've seen in previous years, nothing unusual there, and market share is stable at just under 34%, versus the prior year, and I would tell you that's well within the range of what we expected when we did our plan and it's tracking consistently with what we expected as it relates to our plan. So, international HUMIRA is performing the way we would've hoped and expected it to be able to perform. Now, if you look at quarter versus quarter and I'm assuming you're specifically talking about third quarter versus second quarter. If you look at third quarter versus second quarter, it's down about 1.3% or 1.4%. 1.4%, which you have to recognize, I'm sure you're aware of this, the month of August in Europe is the holiday month, right and so most physician offices don't have the same number of office days. In fact, they have very limited number of office days. So you get a significantly lower level of new patient starts in the month of August versus other months in the year and therefore every year the third quarter is lower. In fact, if you look at last year, I think last year, it was down about 4% or 4.4%, and so, that's a common trend that we see. I'd also tell you as I mentioned at the very beginning, this -- if you look at it quarter to quarter and you don't make all the adjustments for any kind of anomaly of tenders between those periods of time. It's not very meaningful information for you. So I think the best way to look at it is year-to-date how are we performing and I'd say when you look at this level of performance, we're pretty comfortable with it.
Mark Schoenebaum: Rick, I've got a bunch of e-mails in from clients to the answer to my previous question about the $10 number where you said, you didn't come up it. Were you trying to suggest that you came up with numbers higher than that or numbers lower than that? Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: No. I was trying to suggest the number that we communicated is the number that we came up with.
Mark Schoenebaum: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Richard Gonzalez: All right. Thanks Mark. Next question operator.
Operator: The next question comes from Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Vamil Divan: Great. Thanks or taking the questions and again, thanks for all the details you provided. So, one more if I could HUMIRA and then one on a different topic. Just to HUMIRA, I think, obviously a lot of focus on the biosimilars and you addressed that pretty well, I thought, just what about the other sort of innovative products that are coming in to target some of the indications -- I'm thinking about the IL-17, competing, oral JAKs, oral products for Crohn's. I know you guys highlighted what you have in your pipeline but, can you just comment on how you think the market share erosion might be for HUMIRA as some of these new innovative products come into these other indications? Then second just on neurology, this is an area of always struggled a little bit for you guys, so, if you can just touch on that a little bit more, you mentioned Duopa could be a big product, maybe a little bit more around sort of the number of patients you think would be willing to use a product like that, Zinbryta and where does that fit in? Most neurologists we've spoken to, [indiscernible] crowded MS space and even Alzheimer's, you kind of highlight that in the total market opportunity for your products. So, just maybe a little more color on how you see your neurology franchise growing would be very helpful. Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: Thanks Vamil. So, let me start with HUMIRA competition. I think, as you know, this is in particularly take RA as an example, it's a pretty crowded field already, and there's the pretty good mechanisms in there, and yet still the TNF still control the vast majority of this market. It's a tough market to break into even with fairly good profiles of drugs. Now, having said that, I'd say there are some good profiles that are starting to emerge. The IL-17s are a good example. I think IL-17s have a pretty strong profile, but what typically happens in this area is those mechanisms for quite a period of time are relegated to the failure patient population, because physicians are comfortable. There are many other factors that are built into it and they tend to take up that failure population for at least a number of years and that tends to be the areas that they grow in. Now, over a longer period of time, they might have a more material impact, but as I mentioned, our assumption is and I think this is a valid assumption based on our experience in the past is that HUMIRA will have some erosion in the United States, but relatively modest erosion over this five-year period of time, and that because we're assuming biosimilars don't come into the marketplace that is driven by these other innovative products that enter the market. So that is our assumption around that. As it relates to neuro, maybe I'll have Mike talk a little bit about some of the earlier stuff, but I'd say our work in Alzheimer's an example there really isn't anything that's built into this planning period, but --
Michael Severino: Certainly, so perhaps to address your question on Zinbryta first. What we see with MS unfortunately is that it afflicts patients, often relatively early in their lifespan. They deal with many, many years of ongoing relapses and ultimately in many patients a downward clinical trajectory and so what that does is it creates a need for different mechanisms. Mechanisms that attack the problem from different directions mechanistically, and mechanisms with considerable efficacy. So, we feel that there is a real place for Zinbryta in the treatment armamentarium particularly when folks are looking for agents that have substantial efficacy as has been demonstrated in that program. When you look at the rest of our neuroscience efforts, apart from Duopa obviously and Zinbryta, they're very early and they're not contributing as Rick said to the financial numbers yet in a large way, but we do feel that we have a number of very promising approaches to go after in the longer-term the neurodegenerative aspects of MS, for example, which is still a large unmet medical need and diseases such as Alzheimer's. So that's a focus on our labs in the early end.
Richard Gonzalez: I'll just add a couple of points on Zinbryta, I mean, we're obviously doing a lot of the work to prepare as we anticipate approval of this product, so we've been doing market research and a fair amount of work in preparation and I'd say the profile of Zinbryta is a pretty compelling profile and as Mike mentioned, the unfortunate thing about this disease is that patients relapse and they relapse on average, probably about every 2 to 3 years on the current agents and this is certainly a high efficacy agent, from an annualized relapse rate, reduction and when you look at it versus the active comparator it has good performance. I think the other thing that is appealing to physicians is the compliance aspect of it that from a dosing standpoint, they know they'll have drug on board for an extended period of time. So, I think Zinbryta will have a very important role in the treatment of MS patients and it's going to be one of the things that physicians are able to go to, a more -- I'd say a higher efficacy kind of agent. We don't view it coming in as the first line but certainly as patients rotate through that, we think it will compete quite effectively in that second line.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Vamil. Operator, next question please.
Operator: The next question comes from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Alex Arfaei: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions and also thanks for all the details. It certainly helps. I have a few questions on HUMIRA if I may. In 3Q, how much of your 30% growth in the U.S. was volume and price? Our audit suggests it was 11% to 14% volume. So, could you comment on the price component and what are your long-term pricing assumptions in the U.S. for HUMIRA? And a follow up for Rick. I just wanted to make sure I understood your comments earlier, are you assuming no biosimilars of products that compete with HUMIRA in the U.S.? I just want to make sure that -- what your timeline for biosimilar competition for other products is in the U.S. And finally, if you could provide your thoughts about the [indiscernible] versus HUMIRA? Thank you very much.
Richard Gonzalez: Why don't you go with the price?
William Chase: So, our numbers for Q3 -- our volume was higher than what you're seeing in the script, so the way you've got to think about price in the U.S. on the quarter was around a third of the overall growth, was related to price. In terms of over the LRP, look, again we've said multiple times, as we build out our LRP, we try to put in conservative and realistic assumptions. So along those lines we don't take what is currently happening in price and extrapolate that out across the LRP. In the U.S. it is -- where we do think we'll be able to maintain some degree of positive price, but what I would tell you is we're modelling a little lower than mid-single digits on that as you go out over the long range plan period. Ex-U.S., it's actually a negative pricing environment. So, when you actually look at the additive of the two across the LRP, we've got very, very, very low levels of price built in to our forecast.
Richard Gonzalez: Then as it relates to biosimilars, I just wanted to clarify, you're talking about a HUMIRA biosimilar or are you talking about a biosimilar to something else?
Alex Arfaei: No, biosimilar of competing products such as Remicade and [indiscernible] in the U.S.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. I'm sorry. So, obviously we're not assuming any -- because of the IP and the litigation strategy we talked about, we're not assuming any HUMIRA biosimilar. I think as you click through the rest of them, as we look at the Enbrel IP, we think they have pretty good IPs, so we're not assuming we'll see Enbrel biosimilars in the United States. Then as it relates to any kind of Remicade, I think it would be a similar scenario to what we see outside the U.S. because it's an infusion product, it doesn't necessarily compete directly against us. Then on Bari, Mike, why don't you cover the head to head on Bari?
Michael Severino: Sure. When we look at the Baricitinib head to head data clearly both agents are very active. When we focus on higher levels of response which we think are the most clinically significant. For example, DAS low disease activity or DAS remission, we really see very similar response rate at week 24, and of course also, consider the very long track record with HUMIRA well understood safety and efficacy profile. So, we feel good about the overall performance of HUMIRA over the course of its lifespan and think it will continue to play a very important role in the treatment armamentarium as Rick has already outlined.
Alex Arfaei: Thank you, folks.
Richard Gonzalez: All right, thanks Alex and operator, we have time for one more question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Colin Bristow of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Colin Bristow: Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in and as others have said, great presentation today. The methods being covered, but on hep C what proportion of your contracts are exposed to competition in 2016 versus in a multiyear and the cargo expectations changed per your performance in 2016 if at all based on the recent label update. Then two, just from a high level, given the sort of focus on drug pricing at utility [indiscernible] recently, could you give us your thoughts on these ongoing debates and whether you anticipate any impact to your business. Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: I'm not sure I could give you the exact percentage of the contracts. I'd say the vast majority of them are protected through -- vast majority of the volume is protected I'd say through 2016, but, let us get back to you with something that's maybe a little bit more specific. As it relates to the label, as outlined in my comments, this was obviously moving from not recommended to contraindicated, and if you look at the patient population in Bs and Cs, it's a relatively small patient population. It's probably something in the 3% or 4% kind of range of U.S. patients. So if you look at it purely from the perspective of that, it wouldn't be a big impact and frankly the fact that we weren't recommended and contraindicated in Cs you wouldn't assume that there was a lot of volume treating those patients anyway. Having said that, I will tell you we've gone out and contacted probably now around 80% of the physicians that prescribed the drug to make sure that they understand the changes in the label. I think that's gone well, and the feedback I'm getting directly back from the commercial organization. So, that is going well. We've gone back to all of our contracted -- our contract managed care contracts and other contracts and that has gone well, they understand it and I think, agree that in the previous label it was outlined in a way that probably there wasn't a tremendous amount of use there anyway. Having said that, I think we have to wait for -- see how this plays out for the next maybe 30 days or so to be absolutely sure, but right now, we are assuming based on everything that we know, that we'll have a material impact on the brand. The drug pricing. Well, certainly, I think if you look at the debate around drug pricing, it's not likely to go away. In fact, I think with a political debate that's going on we'll probably continue to hear more about it and I think, everything isn't consistent across our industry. Certainly a lot of the debate came around taking old drugs and raising the prices a very significant amount. That's not a model that we have or we participate in. I think the important thing for our industry, the innovative industry is that we continue to bring out drugs that have a significant impact and we price those drugs in a way that gets the right value proposition, the right return for the value that those drugs have, both the clinical value but also the economic value and we demonstrate that economic value. I will tell you, in the international markets like Europe, where HUMIRA has competed for a long time, those are markets that looked very carefully at the economic value that their healthcare system pays and obviously HUMIRA has done extremely well in those markets and it's because it is a good value proposition and I think a lot of the areas that we're in, in specialty pharmaceuticals, it allows you to be able to do that. It allows you to be able to create a medicine that has truly outstanding impact for patients and also has the right economic value proposition and then pricing them accordingly. So, I don't fundamentally believe we'll see a significant change, but I think the debate will continue on and I think our industry needs to respond in a way that's appropriate to that.
Larry Peepo: And that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to the replay of the call please visit our website at abbvieinvestor.com. Thanks again for joining us today.

Richard Gonzalez: Thank you, Larry. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. We delivered another strong performance with second quarter results ahead of our expectations including adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 representing growth of more than 31% versus the second quarter of 2014. Our results included strong operational sales growth of nearly 20% driven by a number of products across the portfolio including strong performance from our newly acquired oncology therapy, IMBRUVICA, continued global uptake of VIEKIRA and continued strong growth from HUMIRA as well as other products in our portfolio including Creon, Synthroid, and Duodopa. We are particularly pleased with the high quality of our results in the quarter. We saw significant margin expansion, continued R&D investment and SG&A leverage and we delivered these results despite a significant foreign exchange headwind. We are also pleased with our outperformance and progress year-to-date. We've driven strong commercial, operational and R&D execution resulting in industry-leading top and bottom line performance. During the quarter, we advanced several important strategic priorities, continued to enhance operational efficiency and achieved a number of regulatory and clinical objectives. Importantly, we completed the acquisition of Pharmacyclics augmenting AbbVie's already strong position and growth prospects. I'll discuss our progress with Pharmacyclics in more detail in just a moment. We are also driving strong performance from our current portfolio, including HUMIRA which is off to a very good start in the first half of the year with robust underlying global demand and exceptional performance in the U.S. We made significant progress with our mid- and our late-stage R&D programs. During today's call our Chief Scientific Officer, Mike Severino will provide an update on our pipeline. And we've also continued to improve efficiency across our operations delivering roughly 800 basis points in operating margin expansion this quarter versus the prior year, achieving an operating margin profile of 44.2% and we remain committed to improving this metric across our long-range plan. This quarter and our first half results demonstrate the significant progress that we've made towards our objective of delivering industry-leading growth. As I mentioned, during the quarter we successfully completed the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, a strategic addition to our business that adds another compelling growth platform to AbbVie's strong prospects in immunology and virology and accelerates AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology. While strategically important, the acquisition of Pharmacyclics will also drive strong financial benefits, further diversifying our revenue base, significantly enhancing our revenue growth across our long-range plan and delivering EPS accretion beginning in 2017. And as we have outlined, we expect accretion related to the acquisition in excess of $0.60 per share in 2019 ramping to more than $1.00 per share in 2021. Pharmacyclics will operate from Sunnyvale, California headquarters under the leadership of Erik von Borcke. Erik has held a number of leadership positions within AbbVie since joining the Company in 2001 including his most recent role as Vice President of Global Marketing. The transition has been seamless and we've been impressed by caliber of talent we've welcomed from Pharmacyclics into AbbVie. We saw a strong momentum with IMBRUVICA in the quarter. Full second quarter U.S. IMBRUVICA sales were $234 million. We continue to expect IMBRUVICA to drive U.S. sales of approximately $1 billion for the full calendar year 2015. Since we completed the Pharmacyclics transaction we have seen additional positive data and progress on our regulatory objectives, including positive readouts from two Phase 3 studies, HELIOS and RESONATE-2. With respect to the positive RESONATE-2 data, a significant portion of our valuation for Pharmacyclics was attributed to advancing into first line treatment. And while we assumed a very high probability of success, these data provide strong evidence of IMBRUVICA's dramatic efficacy in the frontline setting and further de-risks this component of our model. Our virology franchise will be a significant growth driver for us in 2015 and in the years to come. With the launch of Viekira we have established a meaningful position in the HCV market. We continue to see progress particularly internationally which is tracking ahead of our planning assumptions. We received approval in 47 markets and we expect a number of additional countries to come online as the year progresses and into 2016. This includes Japan where we continue to expect a regulatory decision during the second half of this year. As a reminder, in Japan we will commercialize a 12-week, two-pill, once a day ribavirin combination. Overall, we continue to see excellent progress across our total pipeline. We've advanced several assets into the regulatory approval cycle, we've moved assets into pivotal trials, reported positive data from several assets and we expect additional regulatory approvals as the year progresses. We are also encouraged with the advancement in de-risking of our mid and our late-stage pipeline. Over the past six months we've reported positive data from several programs. For example, earlier this year we reported positive top line results from the first of two elagolix pivotal trials in endometriosis. Our partner, Galapagos recently reported positive interim topline findings from two Phase 2b studies of our partner in selective JAK1 inhibitor in RA. We've also recently seen data from the six-month extension trial of the first elagolix endometriosis pivotal study and the results were consistent with the previously reported efficacy and safety findings. Several other assets such as venetoclax in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion are demonstrating strong results. We are very encouraged with each of these data readouts. In summary, we delivered another quarter of strong results exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. When we launched AbbVie back in January of 2013, we set an objective for ourselves, to build an innovation driven, patient focused biopharmaceutical company capable of delivering and sustaining top-tier financial performance. We have made significant progress in building the key strategic elements necessary to deliver on that objective. We're driving exceptional performance out of our existing portfolio including HUMIRA. We have a robust pipeline with several assets with multibillion-dollar potential. We're achieving significant operational efficiencies which are apparent in our first half 2015 results and we've added another major growth platform with Pharmacyclics and IMBRUVICA. We've also delivered on our commitments to shareholders with a total shareholder return since launching the company in January of 2013 of more than 125%. We are well-positioned to deliver industry-leading EPS growth in 2015 and we continue to make significant progress advancing our pipeline and other strategic actions that will position AbbVie for top-tier growth through the rest of the decade and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?
Michael Severino: Thank you, Rick. It's an exciting time to be leading research and development at AbbVie. We've got a broad and robust pipeline that includes more than 40 active clinical development programs, including 10 programs in late-stage development or under regulatory review. Our core areas of focus include immunology where we're leveraging our deep expertise to develop next-generation biologics from small molecules that elevate the standard-of-care. Oncology, including assets to address both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, neuroscience with a particular focus on developing disease modifying therapies for Alzheimer's and other neurotic, degenerative conditions, and virology with an emphasis on continuing to evolve the ACB treatment landscape. We are also placing focused investment in our late-stage programs in women's health with elagolix and renal disease with Atrasentan. Today I'll cover each of these areas and highlight some of our most promising programs. In immunology, we've established clear leadership positions across therapeutic categories including rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology and we're leveraging our expertise to build upon these strong positions. Our strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies with the goal of continuing to raise the standard-of-care. We have several promising assets in development including two oral selective JAK 1 inhibitors, several biologics and a bi-specific biologic currently in mid-stage trials. Most advanced are our two selective JAK 1 inhibitors on the cusp of completing mid-stage development in RA. As Rick mentioned, earlier this year our partner Galapagos announced positive topline interim data from two Phase 2b studies in RA. Over the next few months we will evaluate data from our internal program ABT-494 and make decisions about next steps. We also believe our DVD-Ig antibody platform holds tremendous promise in the treatment of immune mediated conditions. ABT-122 is our combination anti-TNF anti-IL-17 two validated mechanisms in Phase 2 trials for RA and psoriatic arthritis. Our early development work with the DVD platform has established as our DVDs have favorable drug-like properties similar to monoclonal antibodies and can be manufactured reliably. We will see data from our mid-stage trial in RA in early 2016. And we have other promising mechanisms in development including an IL-6 Nanobody as well as several early-stage programs. Finally, in immunology we continue to innovate with HUMIRA. We have new indications and formulations in late-stage development. We recently received a positive opinion from the EMA for hidradenitis suppurativa and we expect a U.S. regulatory decision in the second half of this year. We also received EMA approval for a new HUMIRA formulation specifically designed to reduce injection pain and reduce injection volume compared to the current formulation. This new formulation is currently under review by the FDA. And we're on track to submit our U.S. and European regulatory applications for Uveitis in the second half following the recent completion and positive results from our second pivotal trial. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics significantly accelerated AbbVie's clinical and commercial presence in oncology. With IMBRUVICA we've established a leadership position in the treatment of blood cancers and we're well-positioned to build upon that strength with other promising assets in development. Within the hematologic oncology space we have three novel mechanisms that are either on market or in registration enabling trials, DTK, PI 3-kinase and bcl-2 inhibition. We are well positioned to continue to evolve the treatment landscape with innovative combinations of these and other mechanisms. Our goal is to markedly improve efficacy by achieving deep, durable disease control and/or remission. As I mentioned, IMBRUVICA represents our first foray into this therapeutic category and we're pleased with the continued progress we are seeing with IMBRUVICA since the close of the acquisition. At the recent ASCO meeting, we and our co-development partner Janssen, presented data from the Phase 3 HELIOS trial which studied the combination of bendamustine and rituximab or BR with and without IMBRUVICA in relapsed/refractory CLL. The study demonstrated that IMBRUVICA improves outcomes when combined with BR illustrating that IMBRUVICA is not only effective as a single agent, but is also potent safe when used in combination. We also announced topline results from the Phase 3 RESONATE-2 trial comparing IMBRUVICA monotherapy to chlorambucil in patients aged 65 or older with previously untreated CLL. The results illustrate that treatment with IMBRUVICA improved progression free survival in multiple secondary endpoints including overall survival in the first-line setting. We plan to present and publish the full results and will submit the data to regulatory authorities in the second half, building upon our existing set of indications and expanding into the frontline CLL setting. We've also continued to make progress with our first-in-class BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax. At the recent EHA Meeting we presented updated study results showing patients with relapsed/refractory CLL taking venetoclax in combination with rituximab had an overall response rate of 84% with 41% of patients achieving a complete response. While early, these encouraging results speak to the valuable role venetoclax may play in novel combinations with the potential to restate standard-of-care in a variety of these cell malignancies. We recently received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for venetoclax in relapsed/refractory patients with a 17p deletion of genetic mutation. We plan to present the data that supported this designation at the upcoming ASH Meeting and we remain on track to submit our regulatory applications for the 17p deletion indication by the end of 2015. Our hematologic oncology pipeline also includes duvelisib a dual PI 3 kinase gamma/delta inhibitor being investigated for the treatment of a wide range of blood cancers. And we have partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb on elotuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CS1 a protein primarily expressed on the surface of myeloma cells in late-stage development for frontline and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Data from the Phase 3 study in relapsed/refractory patients recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that adding elotuzumab to standard treatment significantly reduced the risk of disease progression. We expect our partner to submit regulatory applications for this indication this year. We are also leveraging this mechanism within the context of our antibody drug conjugate platform with ABBV E3A and anti-CS1 ADC currently in early-stage clinical development. Our pipeline also includes late-stage assets in development for the treatment of solid tumors. Veliparib is our PARP inhibitor being investigated as a treatment for several solid tumor types. In contrast other PARP inhibitors in development which are being evaluated as monotherapy specifically in cancers with inherited genetic deficiencies in DNA repair any later lines of therapy we've taken a different approach with Veliparib. We have numerous ongoing Phase 3 trials evaluating Veliparib in combination with common DNA damaging chemotherapies in a wide range of clinical settings. Veliparib has demonstrated promising signals of efficacy and is currently in late-stage development for breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, we plan to evaluate Veliparib in combination with checkpoint inhibitors with clinical trials planned for 2016. We are leveraging our strong capabilities in protein engineering with ABT-414 our antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme or GBM. GBM is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. The early data for ABT-414 are promising and we recently initiated additional single arm studies and a randomized controlled trial in second line GBM which could provide a pathway to registration if the data are consistent with earlier phase studies. Certainly the area of the immuno-oncology has recently garnered significant attention. We have an active discovery program with an objective to drive the next wave of immuno-oncology development beyond checkpoint inhibitors. We are particularly focused on the use of our bi-specific platform to support conditional activation of the immune system in the vicinity of tumor cells. And we are leveraging the emerging science of soluble T-cell receptor technology as well. We anticipate multiple immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic in the 2016 timeframe. Our virology franchise will be a significant growth driver for us in 2015 and in the years to come. With the launch of VIEKIRA we have established a meaningful position in the HCV market and our current position will serve as a base from which we will launch further innovation. We are on track with our next-generation HCV program to bring to market a ribavirin-free, once-daily, pan-genotypic combination with high rates of efficacy and a competitive duration of therapy. Earlier this year, we disclosed preliminary results from a Phase 2b study of our next-generation protease inhibitor ABT-493 and our next-generation NS5A inhibitor ABT-530. The interim data showed that treatment with our next-generation combination in non-cirrhotic genotype 1a and 1b treatment-naïve and experienced patients receiving the ribavirin-free therapy for 12 weeks resulted in an SVR4 rate of 99%. Today I am pleased to report that the SVR 12 results are really impressive. In fact, the dose we intend to pursue in Phase 3 drove an SVR 12 rate of 100%. Evaluation in other genotypes continues to progress with encouraging results and we are also evaluating shorter duration of therapy with this combination. We expect to present data from the Phase 2 studies at the AASLD Meeting later this year and we remain on track to advancing into Phase 3 development this year with commercialization expected in 2017. In neuroscience we're focused on pursuing transformational therapies for the treatment of conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, MS and other neurodegenerative conditions. Zinbryta, our investigational biologic for relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe with regulatory decisions expected in the first half of 2016. The filings are based upon strong pivotal trial results which demonstrated patients treated with Zinbryta had a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapse rate versus Avonex an established standard-of-care. Given the product profile, novel mechanism of action and its once monthly subcutaneous administration, we believe Zinbryta has the potential to be an important therapeutic option. We're also in the early stages of our U.S. launch of Duodopa for advanced Parkinson's disease which was approved earlier this year. We are continuing to innovate with Duodopa working on drug delivery improvements and moving toward less invasive approaches and continued improvements in the Duodopa pump. We also have numerous early-stage neuroscience programs underway that have the potential to come to fruition in the later years or our long-term plan. For example, earlier this year we entered into a collaboration with C2N Diagnostics to develop and commercialize a portfolio of anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of serious brain disorders. Tau is a key protein associated with the pathologic progression of Alzheimer's diseases and like amyloid tau also has the ability to be imaged and tracked in the central nervous system. We recently received an orphan drug designation and initiated a Phase 1 program in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare and debilitating neurologic disease. We're on track to start clinical development with C2N in Alzheimer's disease in 2016. Finally, as I mentioned, we continue to make focused investment in our late-stage programs in renal disease and woman's health. Atrasentan is our internally discovered selective endothelin antagonist in late stage development for the prevention of progression of diabetic kidney disease. A large global Phase 3 program is currently underway evaluating the impact of Atrasentan on renal outcomes such as the onset of end-stage renal disease, transplantation or death due to renal failure. Elagolix is our compound in Phase 3 development for endometriosis and Phase 2b for uterine fibroids. Given the high prevalence of these conditions and the current lack of treatment options we view elagolix as a significant opportunity. Our goal with elagolix in endometriosis is to bring to market an oral therapy that provides a high level of efficacy with minimal menopausal side effects such as hot flash while preserving bone health. Earlier this year we announced positive top-line results from the first of two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials. Initial results from the study showed that after six months of treatment both doses of elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints with the safety profile consistent with prior studies. We have also now seen data from the six-month extension of the first elagolix endometriosis pivotal study and the results were consistent with previously reported efficacy and safety findings. We will see top line results from the second pivotal study in endometriosis in the first quarter of 2016, and we plan to disclose top-line data from our Phase 2b trial in uterine fibroids in the fall. So in summary, since the start of the year we've made significant progress and are on track to advance several programs in the coming months. We've built a promising late-stage pipeline comprised of potentially transformational medicines which will fuel our future growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the quarter and 2015. Bill?
William Chase: Thank you, Mike. This morning I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2015. As Rick said, we are very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Operational growth on the top-line was a very strong 19.4% excluding an 8.3% negative impact from foreign exchange. Reported sales were up more than 11%. HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.5 billion, up 16.4% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA as the market leader around the world. On a reported basis currency had a negative 8.8% impact on global HUMIRA sales and reduced international HUMIRA sales by nearly 18%. U.S. HUMIRA sales increased nearly 29% driven by prescription volume and favorable pricing impacts. We've seen acceleration in market growth this year in the U.S. with HUMIRA driving double-digit growth in the gastro, rhum and derm segments. Wholesale inventory remained constant at less than half a notch. Internationally HUMIRA sales have grown nearly 9% on an operational basis in the first half of the year consistent with our planning capitalizations [ph]. As we noted last quarter, the first quarter international growth rate of nearly 15% was favorably impacted by the timing of shipments in select markets. Consequently international sales growth in the second quarter was negatively impacted by the shipment timing. Market growth internationally remained strong with most major markets experiencing double-digit growth and HUMIRA's international market share has remained stable despite new competitors and the launch of biosimilar infliximab. HUMIRA's momentum has not been adversely impacted by the biosimilar. For the full year 2015 we continue to expect global HUMIRA sales growth in the mid-teens on an operational basis. This reflects a forecast for the U.S. growth approaching 30% and 9% to 10% operational growth internationally. Global Viekira sales in the quarter were $385 million. In the U.S. we are wrapping share in our exclusive accounts and have now achieved our target level of penetration and our largest contract. As we've said previously, the contribution of the international launch has exceeded our planning expectations, which will lead to a higher mix of international sales this year. International sales of Viekira in the second half will also benefit from an expected approval in Japan where we will commercialize a two-drug, once daily, ribavirin-free combination. As Rick noted, total U.S. sales of IMBRUVICA in the quarter were strong at $234 million. Given the May 26 closing date for the Pharmacyclics transaction, we recorded a partial quarter of IMBRUVICA sales including $97 million of U.S. sales and $10 million of international profit-sharing. For 2015 we anticipate Pharmacyclics adding more than $750 million to our top-line for revenue occurring after the May 26 closing date. Global Lupron sales were $198 million in the quarter, up nearly 10% on an operational basis. For the full year 2015 we expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2014. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $187 million, up nearly 12% versus the prior year quarter. For the full year 2015 we expect modest growth for Synthroid. AndroGel sales were $170 million, down significantly due to continued market declines and the entry of generic competition for the 1% formulation. We expect AndroGel sales somewhat above $500 million for the full year 2015. U.S. Creon sales were $159 million in the quarter, up significantly from the prior year. We continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts in the pancreatic enzyme market. We expect double-digit sales growth for Creon in 2015. Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease grew more than 20% on an operational basis in the quarter. We expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales in 2015. Our U.S. launch will be getting underway this quarter and as we've said previously, we anticipate a gradual ramp for product sales in the U.S. this year as physicians grow familiar with the product. Turning to the P&L profile for the second quarter, since becoming an independent company we placed a high priority on becoming more efficient in driving operating margin improvement. We are pleased with our progress in the quarter as we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 44.2% of sales. Excluding a modest negative impact from Pharmacyclics our operating margin improved 820 basis points versus the prior year quarter. More than 500 basis points of this improvement was driven by efficiencies and P&L leverage. We showed continued improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 85.3%, up 570 basis points from the prior year quarter driven by exchange, operational efficiencies and product mix. Adjusted R&D was 15.9% of sales reflecting funding actions and support of our pipeline assets. Adjusted SG&A was 25.1% of sales in the quarter, down from the prior year contributing to overall continued improvement in operating margin leverage. Adjusted net interest expense was $137 million reflecting the impact of debt issued in conjunction with the Pharmacyclics acquisition. The adjusted tax rate was 21.9% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $1.08, up 31.7% year-over-year and exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.83. Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year we are confirming our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.10 to $4.30. This range reflects EPS growth of 23% to nearly 30%. Our 2015 adjusted guidance range includes the previously communicated $0.20 dilutive impact of the Pharmacyclics acquisition. It excludes $0.84 of intangible amortization of specified costs including Pharmacyclics transaction costs. Regarding the P&L profile for 2015 the following estimates have been updated to include the impact of significant foreign exchange and the Pharmacyclics acquisition.  On the top-line we expect revenue growth on an operational basis of roughly 20%. We are forecasting approximately 7% negative top-line impact from currency this year resulting in a reported sales growth of around 13%. We are forecasting a significant increase in our operating margin profile which we expect to reach approximately 42% of sales in 2015. Excluding the negative impact from the Pharmacyclics acquisition, we expect to deliver roughly 650 basis points of improvement over the prior year, about 500 basis points of this improvement results from efficiency initiatives and leverage across the income statement. We are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 83%. This is an increase from our original guidance reflecting significant year-over-year improvement driven by the impact of exchange, product mix and actions we've taken to further improve our margin profile. We will continue to invest in our pipeline supporting our exiting opportunities in oncology, HCV immunology and other areas. We are forecasting R&D expense of approximately 16% of sales and we expect to continue investing in our growth brands with SG&A levels at approximately 25% of sales. We are now forecasting net interest expense of about $625 million for the full year including the incremental debt from the Pharmacyclics acquisition. And we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate in the 22% range in 2015. Regarding the third quarter we expected adjusted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.07. This excludes roughly $0.14 as specified items in non-cash amortization and includes the impact of Pharmacyclics dilution. We expect third quarter revenue growth on an operational basis in the low 20 percentage range excluding approximately 7% negative impact from exchange. So in conclusion, we're very pleased with the level of quality in the quarter and our performance in the first half of 2015. We’ve driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion while also advancing our strategic priorities. This put us in a strong position to deliver top-tier industry growth this year and in the years to come. And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo: Thanks, Bill. We’ll now open the call up for questions. Operator, we’ll take our first question please.
Operator: Okay, sir. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ms. Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Jami Rubin: Thank you very much. Hope you guys can hear me okay. With respect to HUMIRA international sales you've pointed to shipment timing, tough comparisons and FX as reasons for the underperformance, but wouldn’t REMICADE biosimilars be the real culprit here? What evidence specifically can you share with us that suggests that this quarter performance was more of a one-timer verses a new trend? I mean may be you can share what you're seeing in terms of market share changes et cetera? And then a question for your Rick, on potential for U.S. biosimilars, as you know Amgen filed an IPR on the two long data pats, may be you can talk to those patents that are being challenged and put that into the context of your broader patent defense strategy. Thanks very much.
RichardGonzalez: Thanks, all right Jami. Jami, this is Rick, good morning. I'll take the first question and let Laura Schumacher answer the second question for you. So it’s a good question and I’m going to answer your question, I’d say very directly and very clearly because I want to make sure that there is no misunderstanding or confusion around this issue. But the bottom line when we’ve done is I would tell you that we have seen no impact from Remicade biosimilar on HUMIRA in the international market, but I’ll give you some color to be able to support that. so I'm going to go back to the first quarter, when we announced first quarter results, if you look at Bill’s formal remarks, in his remarks we identified the fact that they benefited from shipment timing and that is exactly what we’re seeing here and I would tell you that the impact we’re seeing here is consistent with what we expected in that. Secondly, I’d tell you that when we put out the original guidance on HUMIRA, both at the beginning of the year and then when we raised guidance, within that guidance range we had assumed international performance growth of HUMIRA at 9% to 10%. If you look at the performance in the first quarter, we delivered 14.9% growth in the first quarter, second quarter was 3.6%, the average for the two quarters or the first half of the year is 8.8%. We are confirming now explicitly that the second half is forecasted internationally to be 9% to 10% which is exactly what it was in the original guidance. We are also confirming the original guidance. So obviously we feel that we were sitting here with our toes hanging over the edge of the cliff that would be an awfully foolish thing to do. So I can tell you we absolutely have no concerns around that. So let’s talk specifically around what we’re seeing with biosimilars and I’ll give you a little bit of facts maybe to support it. So the biosimilar Remicade has been approved now in 46 countries. It is actually launched in about 36 of those countries. They participated in five national tenders and they participated in about 11 regional hospital tenders. If you look at markets that they have been in for more than a year to be able to measure what their market share is, their total market share is 2.8%. So they haven’t any meaningful impact. We measured every one of those markets that they are in, we've been doing it from the very beginning and in those markets HUMIRA continues to grow as we would have expected it. We don’t see any impact from nor did we expect any impact from Remicade biosimilars within those markets. We obviously continue to watch that. If we look at the pricing within those markets, the medium discount versus the innovator is about 25% odd. For the ones that were tendered it is a little over 50% odd which again is in the range of what we would have expected. The reaction that we’re seeing in the market is consistent with what we expected. And so I would just tell you that it is playing out as we anticipated. Now we need to continue to monitor, but I can tell you that we don’t have any concerns in that area as we would have expected. So the reality is, this is nothing more than movement of shipments between a handful of countries. I'll give you a couple of examples maybe to make you feel a little better. So if you take France which I know there has been a lot of public concern about France, if you look at our growth rate in the first quarter and our growth rate in the second quarter they’re almost identical. If you look at Canada our growth rate accelerated between first and second quarter. If you look at the Netherlands our growth rate accelerated between first and second quarter. Now there are countries where clearly we saw tenders move around. There weren’t any countries that we're impacted by biosimilars, they were due to other events. So reality is, this is nothing more than shipment timing. Did I answer your question? I think we might have muted her line.
Jami Rubin: The IPR?
Richard Gonzalez: Go ahead on the IPR.
Laura Schumacher: With respect to your question about Amgen’s IPR, as we’ve said before, we have a broad portfolio of IP covering manufacturing, process, formulation and methods that we use. Amgen’s IPR does not impact our patent strategy. We don’t know why Amgen selected the two formulation patents that it did to challenge, potentially challenge an IPR, but it does give some perspective on the breadth of our IP including over 40 additional patents that are not the subject of the IPR.
Richard Gonzalez: Thanks Jami. Operator we will take our next question please.
Operator: Okay sir. Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Holford of Jefferies. Sir your line is open.
Jeffrey Holford: Hi, there does still seem to be a lot of noise on the line it is not coming from me. First question is on new HUMIRA, the one you just had approved in Europe. Can you just give us a bit more color around some numerical data, whatever you have on the clinical differentiators you seem to have on pain and injection volume, just give us a bit more review whether the label that you are getting is going to help you potentially do hard switches in some of the markets you were thinking about? And how this product could help you in the future potentially as a biosimilar defense mechanism, because that’s not entirely clear from this? And then just on Viekira contracts in the U.S., could you just give us any updates on how these are actually playing out versus how you thought they were going to, just some of the metrics that you are looking at? And then, just last question around Viekira, does your run rate for the last quarter of the year, the $3 billion run rate that you are looking at, does that assume a full quarter Japan, how important is that in your minds at achieving that run rate? Thanks very much.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay, very good. So Jeff, this is Rick. I’ll answer most of the first question. Let me see if Mike may be able to add a little bit of specificy. So there were two benefits that the new formation was designed to do. We know that there are patients who ultimately stop therapy with the current product because of the pain that they feel upon injection. So we know that’s an important driver of adherence of the product and so we designed this product as a differentiation. The clinical data Mike, I don’t recall the specific numbers, do you recall the actually percent?
Michael Severino: This is Mike. So there are data in the studies that were submitted to regulatory agencies. We’re still waiting on a final labeling in the U.S. and Europe. So I think it’s probably a bit premature, numbers that might in labeling, but we assessed this in the course of the clinical development program. 
Richard Gonzalez: But what I would say is, it’s a significant reduction in pain, a very significant reduction in pain. The second part is that this will also allow us to ultimately reduce the volume of injection, volume and therefore potentially over time reduce the number of injections particularly on the loading dose. So as we said before this is an incremental improvement to the product. We think it’s a meaningful improvement. We’ve obviously studied the different kinds of things that we could do HUMIRA. We have other things that we’re continuing to work on. But we think these are a meaningful opportunity to be able to launch the product. We haven’t formally decided exactly how the product will launch or at least formally announced how the product will launch. So I’m not going to talk through any details around whether or not it will a full conversion or ultimately a phased-in kind of an approach based on certain countries. And so that’s essentially how we see the product and we do think it will differentiated in a significant enough way. It will have both a material impact on HUMIRA itself, HUMIRA’s performance itself, as well as a differentiator versus competitors. So on Viekira pack as far as contracting is concerned I think the contracting hasn’t changed a lot in the U.S. from the last time we talked on the call. As we indicated we had a number of exclusive contracts that were coming online. They are now up and running. We are ramping within those particular contracts. I’d say we are ramping within the expectations that we expected. If you look at our single largest customer in the U.S., that’s an exclusive, we’ve now reached peak share there and so ultimately we’ve reached the level of share that we had anticipated, and it’s a very high level of share. And so now the rest of the growth will be around driving these incremental contracts and then also driving additional share gains within the parity accounts and the non-exclusive accounts. And that’s the work that goes on day by day by day. As far as the $3 billion running rate that we’ve talked about before, I’d say we’re still tracking against that U.S. specifically. Is Japan important? It does assume that we have a full quarter of Japan and I would say Japan is an important market for us. Now based on everything that we know today and the competitiveness of that product and where we are in the regulatory cycle, I think we should get a full quarter’s worth of Japan potentially, but maybe a little bit better than that. As we look at Viekira, the other thing I’d say is, when we originally launched Viekira our expectation was that we would build this into a meaningful product for us and then position ourselves so that as we launched a next generation asset which as you know we've described as a pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, QD product and the profile of next generation is maintaining consistent with what we would have expected that then with the launch of that we will continued to gain further share with that product as we introduced that product in that marketplace. If we look at our performance so far, I think we’re up by I don’t know 67% quarter-over-quarter if you look at just the second quarter running rate as the product is tracking at about at about a $1.5 billion product and continuing to grow nicely. The international side of the business obviously has performed better than the U.S. I think the U.S. has not met our expectations and I think we understand why and we’re continuing to work on that, but certainly the international market is performing incrementally better than what we expected. And so, I think everything we are looking at right now would suggest that that should be a solid number. I'd say there are three factors that are important for that to happen and we’re continuing to monitor those three things, one is we have seen patient volumes in the U.S. overall volumes in the market decline. Latest data would suggest genotype-1 patients are down around 175,000 to 180,000 now on an annualized basis. We’re assuming that's the level that it will stabilize at and I think the data would suggest that that is a reasonable assumption. Second assumption is that the VA has run into funding difficulties. So the level of patients that they’re treating is down and we are assuming that starting October 1, that they will get additional funds and they will come back up to the level that we saw in the earlier part of the year. And then the third assumption obviously is Japan that we just talked about. So those are the three things that I think will drive the ultimate performance. I guess the last thing I’d say is, if you look at our overall performance in the first half and both in second quarter, I think it demonstrates the strength of the business that we have here. If you look at consensus we were slightly off the consensus number for Viekira this quarter, but yet we over performed. And we over performed because we delivered better operational efficiency, we delivered over performance in other areas. And the balance of our business and our ability to be able to still deliver strong performance even when there are changes, I think is could be one reassuring our investors and two it demonstrates the strength of the overall business.
Jeffrey Holford: Thanks. That is very helpful color and congratulations on a great IMBRUVICA number.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Jeff. Next question operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Goodman of UBS. Sir your line is open.
Mark Goodman: Yes, good morning. First of all, you have a guidance range that is pretty wide, I was just wondering why you didn’t tighten it this quarter? Second you talked about immuno-oncology you would have multiple assets in the clinic by next year, can you talk about are these going to be similar types of assets to the PD-1 and PD-L1 things like that are they kind of the next wave of products?
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. This is Rick. I will cover the first one. We haven’t narrowed the guidance range yet, we probably will here as we get closer to third quarter narrow the guidance range. And I'd say the primary reason for that is foreign exchange has certainly been more challenging than we anticipated and we want to see how that plays out. We told investors that we were going to cover foreign exchange. That we weren’t going to do – we weren’t going to pass that on and so we just want to see another quarter’s worth of performance here and what foreign exchange does over that period of time to feel more comfortable that when we narrow the range or within a range that we are comfortable with. It is just that simple. And them Mike why don’t you talk about immuno-oncology?
Michael Severino: Certainly, with respect to immuno-oncology, we’re really referring to the next wave of programs. These would be things beyond PD-1 and PD-L1 or perhaps they might combine well with those mechanisms, but we’re looking at driving for treatment results that can't be achieved today. So we would be referring to novel mechanisms.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Mark. Operator, we will take our next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.
Alex Arfaei: Good morning folks and thank you for taking my questions.
Richard Gonzalez: Good morning.
Alex Arfaei: Regarding HUMIRA, you mentioned you are seeing accelerated market growth in the U.S. very impressive U.S. performance by the way. Are you seeing increased penetration of biologics in these markets or is it overall volume growth or both? And can you provide more color on some of the efficiencies we are seeing, some of the operating efficiencies we’re seeing? Where are you cutting and why? Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: So Alex on HUMIRA, if you look at the U.S., it’s really been a remarkable story. If you look at market growth last year, it was in the 6% range. That has now moved to about a 13%. We’ve held that pretty steady across the quarter. So what that’s a sign of is that the SG&A that we put behind the brand continues to work and it continues to give a positive return. And the way that that growth is delivered is in fact by penetration as well as improved patient compliance and a number of other things. But there is definitely a penetration element that is the big growth driver in this market. And as you know all of the autoimmuno segments are relatively under penetrated versus what you would expect given the power of a biologic. So that is a big part of the story. In terms of efficiencies, look, we’ve been focused on efficiencies from the very beginning now they shake on the number of different places. In manufacturing, they are the traditional efficiencies you would expect, whether it be purchasing, better utilization of plants or in some cases even take offline non-productive capacity, we've done all of those sorts of things. Across the P&L though, leverage itself presents a different type of efficiency, right. We’re obviously no longer in a situation where we need to grow expense in at the same rate of the top line. In fact, if you look at our expense growth particularly on SG&A it is far, far, far, below what the top-line is growing and that’s pretty much the new model for this business now that we’ve made the investments we needed to make back in '13 and '14 and we’re on track to start delivering growth through the introduction of new products in '15 and beyond. So there are really two different types of efficiencies in the numbers.
Alex Arfaei: Thank you.
Larry Peepo: Thanks, Alex. Next question please, operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.
Mark Schoenebaum: Okay. Hey, guys, thanks a lot for the transparency, always the most detailed prepared remarks of any company, any big company, so thanks for that. I just want to go back to the central point that others have asked about. Because the stock is off right now and the consistent feedback I’m getting is that people are just very concerned about the rest of the world's HUMIRA numbers. So my question is really simple; one, what was the sequential volume growth for rest of the world HUMIRA? Two, what was the average change in price quarter-on-quarter in the 2Q, please? And then my second question if I may is, you guys I think as mentioned that you might contemplate in the Analyst Meeting or you might provide some long-term financial targets or vision and go over the pipeline, and then you would contemplate this once the PCYC deal is closed. So I’d just like to know what your current thinking is on that? Thank you and congratulations on a great stock move this quarter.
William Chase: Thanks, Mark. So Mark on HUMIRA, the volume growth quarter-over-quarter was slightly above 10%, overall price was 6% on a global basis.
Mark Schoenebaum: Do you have just rest of the world?
William Chase: Rest of the world had negative price of 4.1 and volume was up over 7%.
Mark Schoenebaum: The volume was up over 7%, rest of the world. Okay.
William Chase: Yes.
Mark Schoenebaum: Got it. People are very confused out there. Thank you.
William Chase: Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: And then Mark, this is Rick. On the Analyst Meeting, yes it is something we are still considering, I think as you indicated maybe in one of your remarks, I think timing wise if we decide to do it, it probably will be at the beginning of the year, maybe time with a major meeting where it would be convenient for investors to be able to participate. We haven’t made a final decision yet, but we will communicate something around that at some point here, probably third quarter. 
Mark Schoenebaum: And just to confirm the HUMIRA numbers, those were sequential correct?
William Chase: Quarter-over-quarter 2015 versus '14.
Mark Schoenebaum: Do you have the sequential numbers 1Q this year versus 2Q and then I’ll stop.
William Chase: I don’t have them handy, because we don’t typically look it at that way. I would say price will be relatively flat quarter-to-quarter, price would be probably down about may be 2% quarter-over-quarter. But I don’t have a firm volume number for you. Would you followup with me on that?
Mark Schoenebaum: Was it positive?
William Chase: Yes.
Mark Schoenebaum: It was positive. Okay. Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Was the price positive, he’s asking...
William Chase: No price was negative.
Mark Schoenebaum: Okay.
William Chase: The volume was positive.
Mark Schoenebaum: Thank you.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Mark. Next question please operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.
Chris Schott: Great. Thanks very much for the questions and just couple of quick ones here. First can you just quantify the impact to gross margins from FX in the quarter and in your annual guidance? I’m just trying to get a best sense of what type of underlying growth we are seeing on that gross margin line as we're going through the year here? The second question was on the IL-17 just would be interested in your perspective on what those products are going to kind of mean for the psoriasis market and as you think about HUMIRA over time? And a final one, just so I just come back to clarify some of the earlier comments on the new HUMIRA formulation and launch dynamics, just want to make sure I understood the comments. Should we think about when this product launches it is going to basically fully replace the prior version of HUMIRA in whatever countries it goes out in or is this going to be a conversion type process, we have to go to physicians, get them to select the new version for more of a gradual process? Just wanted to make sure I understood your earlier comments. Thanks very much.
William Chase: So Chris, on gross margins I'm just going to just give you some numbers. So our gross margin was up about 570 basis points. Pharmacyclics diluted that by about 50 basis points. So if you exclude Pharmacyclics we are up 620 basis points, just over half of that was exchanged. And then for the year very similar story, different numbers but similar story, gross margin we are forecasting up around 300 basis points. Pharmacyclics will have about 90 basis points to a full point impact. So net-net excluding Pharmacyclics, you would expect to see about a 400 basis point improvement of which again just slightly over half is exchange.
Michael Severino: Okay. So this is Mike. I’ll take the second component of your question. With respect to the IL-17s, I think clearly the IL-17s in plaque psoriasis demonstrate very strong efficacy. There are areas where their profile is not quite as compelling in psoriatic arthritis for example. The initial uptake of the 17s has been relatively slow. We would expect the dermatologist would take some time to become comfortable with the new mechanism before they would adopt it. So we feel comfortable about the trajectory of HUMIRA in the psoriasis space for quite some time.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay. And on the new formulation, I mean we really can’t talk specifically about what the strategy is because it’s somewhat condition on the regulatory approval and we don’t have regulatory approvals yet all around the world. But there probably will be situations where it will be a replacement product, meaning it will replace not over a very short period of time, but over a relatively short period of time as inventory runs out of the old product, the new product will replace the old product and we will only maintain the new product in the marketplace. I would say that will probably be the predominant model that is out there, but it might not be the exclusive model that is out there depending upon the regulatory approvals.
Chris Schott: Thanks very much.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Chris. Next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mr. Robyn Karnauskas of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.
Robyn Karnauskas: Hello, it’s Mr. Robyn Karnauskas, thanks for taking my question.
Richard Gonzalez: Glad to meet you.
Robyn Karnauskas: All right, so two quick questions, one you didn’t mentioned anything about celiac disease, I am wondering if you could comment on did the program fail or are you still interested in that program? Second question on HUMIRA II, the new HUMIRA, do you think will be able to track that in any way will it be given a different name? Just wondering like how the Street will be able to monitor that as it has an uptick? And then the last question big picture for your RA franchise given that looks like you don’t have to go through the patent dance and Amgen’s filing an IPR which could speed up sort of the clarity around when they are actually going to launch. How do you view the time lines for some of your emerging RA drugs and whether it is important to get them on the market sooner or whether or not you'll still be okay if Amgen’s biosimilar hits ahead of their launch? Thanks.
Michael Severino: So, this is Mike. With respect to celiac disease, we're still evaluating the opportunity and we’ve not reached a decision point yet.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay and Robyn this is Rick. I will cover the HUMIRA formulation. Again it is consistent with what I described to you before. It will depend upon the regulatory approval. So we don’t know the answer to that yet. It could be that it has the exact same name as the current product and therefore you wouldn’t necessarily have any direct visibility to it. It could be HUMIRA plus some designation after HUMIRA and therefore we would be able to track it, or you would be able to track it in some separate fashion. So we’re going to see how that plays out before I can give you an accurate answer. And then, I'd just say on the big picture piece, I'd say the IPR doesn’t necessarily change anything that we thought about before from a timing standpoint. As we've said and as Laura mentioned a momentum ago, we have a broad group of, or portfolio of IP. We have some very important patents in this area and we intend to enforce those patents and this IPR process won’t affect those timelines as we’ve assumed it.
Robyn Karnauskas: Okay, great. Thank you.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Robyn. Operator, we have time for one more question please.
Operator: Okay sir. Our last question comes from Mr. Steve Scala from Cowen. Sir your line is open.
Steve Scala: Thank you and thanks for the R&D overview. AbbVie really does have an impressive pipeline. On the new HUMIRA formulation what portion of the current patients on HUMIRA have issues with pain and or volume? What additional IP protection does it offer? And then third, it sounds like there is a bit of hedging on the prior of Viekira guidance of annualizing as $3 billion exiting 2015 am I wrong? Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Thanks Steve. This is Rick. I guess I’ll do the last one first. I was trying to describe to you the elements that will drive our overall performance in Viekira. If I sounded like I was hedging, I apologize for that. It is our goal to still hit the number that we described to you. So I was trying to describe to you the elements associated with it. As far as the details around percentage of patients, I mean I don’t recall it offhand. I’d say there is a fairly substantial percentage of patients that when they first go on the drug do experience or express concern about pain upon injection. The vast majority of those patients obviously work through it and stay on the drug, but it’s not an insignificant percentage of patients that we see that, that experience at the beginning of their use of the product. And as far as volume, it’s more of a practical thing. At the end of the day if you inject less volume obviously that helps with the pain as well assuming it is not more viscous, so it has some other reason why would have pain. But if you - as you get less volume in the indications where you have loading doses, there would be a substantial benefit there, where you can go from multiple loading doses to one loading dose an example in certain conditions and I think that would be a significant benefit for patients.
Steve Scala: And the IP?
Richard Gonzalez: I mean essentially it has IP associated with it, I'd say this is really a strategy to differentiate the product. Obviously we have IP around this particular formulation. I think that IP will protect this particular formulation. As we've described I think a couple of times before, we don’t view this as an absolute block. When you think about our biosimilar strategy, it’s a number of things that have all been put together, a very large portfolio of IP, some of that IP is very broad and very challenging I think for someone to work around. New formulations, it helps differentiate the product. Our commercial strategy, when and if biosimilar is launched and then our pipeline of new assets to be able to move into this market and I'd say although we tend not to probably be able to get there in any meaningful way, I think one of the exciting things that we see internally is if you look at the data that we’ve seen around the JAK 1 hypothesis that we have its is playing out and its playing out in a very positive way. And I think it’s a profile of a drug that we believe could have a meaningful impact in the marketplace and I think that would be an important product for us to advance and get into the marketplace and then also ABT-122, I think as we talk about an IL-17 combined with a TNF as we see that data, I think that product could have a very meaningful place in the market as well. And so I think we’re gaining a lot of encouragement about de-risking that mid-stage pipeline to ensure that we have some products that will follow on with HUMIRA.
Steve Scala: Thank you.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Steve. And that concludes today’s conference call. If you would like to listen to a replay of the call please visit our website at abbvieinvestor.com. Thanks again to everyone for joining us.
Operator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Rick Gonzalez : Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today we are pleased to report strong results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.94, up more than 32% from the first quarter of 2014 and significantly exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. Our performance included strong operational sales growth of nearly 18%, we delivered these results with growth across the number of products in our portfolio including update of our new HCV therapy Viekira, as well as strong growth from HUMIRA, Synagis, Synthroid, Creon and Duodopa. We continue to see strong underlying demand for HUMIRA with accelerating new U.S. prescription growth and continued market-share gains. We also saw improvement in gross margin to 82.9% and we continue to see our investment in the business deliver strong results. Based on our out-performance, we’ve raised our full year EPS guidance range for 2015 by $0.05, reflecting our strong underlying business performance year-to-date and the expected continued positive trends through the remainder of the year and we’ve also done this despite the negative impact of foreign exchange. In addition to our strong financial results we also have advanced several of our most important strategic priorities during the quarter. Since the start of the year, we’ve achieved a number of important regulatory and development milestones including the EMA approval of our interferon-free HCV treatment. The regulatory submission and priority review of our 2-DAA ribavirin-free once daily combination for genotype 1b HCV patients in Japan. The U.S. regulatory approval for DUOPA our therapy for advance Parkinson disease and the U.S. and EMA regulatory submissions for Zinbryta, our novel treatment relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. We also reported positive top-line efficacy data results from the first goal ex-pivotal trial in endometriosis. And recently our partner Galapagos reported positive data on our partnered selective JAK-1 compound. Each of these milestones continue to underscore the advancement and robust nature of our mid and late stage pipeline. Importantly we recently announced the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, a strategic addition to our business that will provide significant benefit for our shareholders and the patients which we serve. Pharmacyclics acquisition will add another compelling growth platform to add these existing strong prospects in immunology and virology. We'll accelerate AbbVie’s clinical and commercial presence in oncology broadening our portfolio in haematological oncology an attractive and rapidly growing market and a segment where we have several other assets in mid and late stage development. While strategically important this acquisition will also drive strong financial benefits, it further diversifies our revenue base and significantly enhances our revenue growth across our long range plan. We expect the transaction will be accretive beginning in 2017 and significantly accretive in the years to follow specifically as we have outlined we expect accretion in excess of $0.60 per share in 2019, ramping to more than $1 per share by 2021. The addition of Pharmacyclics will augment at these already strong position and growth prospects. We remain on track to complete the acquisition in the second quarter. When we launched AbbVie as an independent company nearly 2.5 years ago it was our stated goal to build an innovation driven patient focused biopharmaceutical company which can deliver strong sustainable performance over the long-term. Our efforts have been focused on developing our culture of innovation and building a strong and talented team, driving strong performance from our current portfolio and building a robust pipeline of innovative new drugs, and enhancing our efficiency and delivering outstanding returns for our shareholders. As we look back at our performance we are pleased to say that we've made significant progress towards all of these objectives. Our 2015 guidance underscores our goal of driving industry leading growth this year. As we expect earnings per share growth of nearly 27% at the midpoint of our guidance range. Our strong first quarter performance certainly supports our ability to deliver on this objective. And we expect to be among the top performers over our long range plan. In fact given our execution across the number of fronts in the strategic actions that we've taken in the business and now the addition of Pharmacyclics we’re well positioned to generate top tier growth through the rest of this decade and beyond. As we look at our business following the acquisition we’re strategically positioned with a number of compelling growth platforms. Clearly we’re enthusiastic about our oncology franchise. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics is highly complementary with our existing oncology pipeline which is comprised of five late stage assets poised to launch over the next few years. This includes our BCL-2 inhibitor [indiscernible] and our dual PI3 kinase inhibitor Duvelisib both being investigated for the treatment of a wide range of blood cancers. So our portfolio will include three novel and promising mechanisms for the treatment of hematological malignancies. BTK inhibition, Bcl‐2 inhibition and PI3 kinase inhibition. We intend to move quickly to explore combination therapies that have the potential to significantly elevate the standard of care and approve efficacy in hematological cancers. The combinations have the potential to reduce or eliminate the toxic chemotherapeutic age being used in the management of these conditions. Our oncology pipeline also includes veliparib our PARP inhibitor being investigated for a wide range of solid tumors and ABT‐414 our antibody-drug conjugate for Glioblastoma Multiforme, both of which have demonstrated promising signals of efficacy. We’re also partnering with Bristol-Myers Squibb on elotuzumab in late stage development for front-line and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We'll see data from a number of our oncology programs as the year progresses including data from genetic labs and lapsed refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion as well as mid-stage data on veliparib in non-small-cell lung cancer, and Phase 3 data on elotuzumab and relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We also anticipate numerous readouts on Imbruvica, including data from RESONATE-2 study in CLL Phase 3 monotherapy data and relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma and additional details from the Phase 3 trial on the last refractory CLL. Our combined late stage oncology franchise will represent a significant source of growth for AbbVie in the coming years with peak year sales estimated to exceed $15 billion.  Our virology franchise will also be a growth driver for AbbVie going forward. With the launch of Viekira we've established a meaningful position in HCV, another large and growing category. Our global launch of Viekira which is been underway roughly three months continues to perform within our expectations. As a reminder the tracking services do not capture all the sources of prescription data for Viekira, including certain managed care organizations and number of government entities.  When all sources are considered Viekira weekly prescriptions are tracking well ahead of reported levels. Our international launch is progressing faster than anticipated. And discussions with government payers in various countries are on the way and advancing rapidly. We are pleased with the pace of our progress internationally which is tracking ahead of our planning assumptions, this will lead to a higher level of international sales this year than we originally expected. Viekira will be a significant product for us and we continue to expect an annualized run rate of more than $3 billion in global sales by the end of 2015. Our current position will serve as a strong base from which we will launch further enhancements and innovations. Our next generation HCV program continues to progress well. It is our goal with this program to bring to market our ribavirin 3 once daily pan-genotypic combinations. Our next generation HCV program is generating promising early SVR data. Earlier this month we disclosed preliminary results from a 79 patient Phase 2b study of our next protease inhibitor ABT‐493 and our next generation NS5A inhibitor ABT-530. The interim data showed that treatment with the two compounds in non-cirrhotic genotype 1a and 1b patients receiving the ribavirin-free therapy for 12 weeks, resulted in SVR4 range of 99%. Full data from the Phase 2 studies will be presented at future medical meetings. Evaluation and another genotypes continues to progress with encouraging results. But also evaluating shorter durations of therapy with this combination the data expected later this year and we remain on track to advance our next generation HCV program into Phase 3 later this year with commercialization expected in 2017. The HCV market is significant and we expect it will remain a large and attractive opportunity for many years to come. Our immunology franchise represents another compelling growth platform for AbbVie, clearly we have established a strong leadership position in the immunology market with HUMIRA, the world’s leading anti-TNF. Behind HUMIRA, we have a rich pipeline of mid and late stage immunology assets in clinical development. This includes our two selective JAK-1 inhibitors currently in mid-stage development. As I mentioned our partner Galapagos recently announced promising top-line 12-week data from the first of two Phase 2b studies in RA supporting our thesis for JAK-1 specificity and drive high levels of efficacy while maintaining an appropriate safety profile. We look forward to seeing additional data from the ongoing trials as well as results from a mid-stage study of our internal JAK-1 inhibitor ABT-494 as the year progresses. We’re also working to advance several other mid-stage immunology programs including ABT-122, our anti-IL-17 TNF combination and an anti-IL-6 nanobody among others. All of our R&D efforts are focused on advancing the standard of care in each of our areas of immunology leadership. As we have said, we expect HUMIRA to continue to drive strong growth and significant cash flow generation for many years. We have a multi-faceted strategy in place which we believe will allow us to protect and grow our immunology position. We had two new indications in late stage development, as well as a new formulation currently under regulatory review in U.S. and in Europe. We have a robust portfolio of intellectual property protecting HUMIRA which we intent to enforce if infringe by a bio-similar applicant. We have hundreds of patents globally covering the formulation, manufacturing and indications for which HUMIRA is approved. As a first fully human monoclonal antibody approved, the extensive clinical trial work, development and investment we undertook led us to many important inventions with HUMIRA. We have important intellectual property covering these innovations and we intend to enforce this intellectual property. And we recently received a commission decision in Europe regarding compliance with the pediatric investigation plan for HUMIRA. With this decision, we’ll now apply for a six-month extension through our composition of matter patent extending the date for this key European patent from April 2018 to October 2018. Beyond the pipeline assets I’ve already mentioned, we have a number of other compelling pipeline programs that have potential to deliver significant peak year sales. All told we have more than 40 active development programs underway, spanning large and growing specialty categories. And our late stage pipeline has been significantly de-risked as a result of our ongoing clinical work are demonstrating safety and efficacy. This includes Zinbryta which as I mentioned is currently under U.S. and EMA regulatory review for relapsing, remitting multiple sclerosis. Elagolix, which is our compound in Phase 3 development for endometriosis and Phase 2b for uterine fibroids. Atrasentan, our internally discovered compound in late stage development for diabetic kidney disease and a number of other attractive assets in mid to late stage clinical trials. We have a number of attractive growth platforms which set within the context of a company that consistently generate strong financial results and consistently meets financial commitments. We believe AbbVie has a unique investment identity, as we are promising pipeline prospects along a strong growth and compelling shareholder returns. Our business generates significant cash flow which we expect will grow in 2015 and beyond with new product introductions. To that end earlier this year, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.51 beginning with the dividend payable May. This increase follows an increase of nearly 17% late last year, since our inception as an independent company in 2013 we’ve increased the dividend nearly 28%. We intend to maintain our strong commitment to a growing dividend going forward. Additionally, we’ve utilized our strong cash flow to enhance our pipeline through licensing and partnering activities. We view these activities as an important component of our R&D strategy and we expect to continue to augment our pipeline from the coming years. And finally, operating margin expansion is a key priority for AbbVie. We have initiatives in place to improve efficiency across our operations and we've delivered significant improvements in our operating margin profile since we launched in January 2013 to the current level today of just over 40%. We’re forecasting additional improvements in operating margin profile in 2015 reflecting these efforts as well as favorable leverage across our income statement, and we remain committed to improving this metric across our long range plan. In closing since AbbVie became an independent company we've been focused on executing our key strategic priorities. We've established a strong track record consistently exceeding our financial commitments, generating strong shareholders returns and driving leading performance of HUMIRA and other products in our portfolio. We have also built a promising late stage pipeline which will fuel our future growth and we gained regulatory approval on several important products and advanced many more. We set a strong foundation for the company. The addition of Pharmacyclics significantly strengthens our long-term growth prospects, positioning AbbVie for top tier growth through the rest of the decade and beyond. With that I will turn the call over to Bill for some additional comments on the first quarter performance as well as our second quarter outlook. Bill?
Bill Chase: Thank Rick. This morning I will review our first quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2015. As Rick said we’re very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Reported sales were up 10.5% despite a challenging foreign exchange environment. Operational growth on the top line was a very strong 17.8%. HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.1 billion up 26% on an operational basis. We continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA with robust growth across categories driving all-time high market share for the brand. U.S. HUMIRA sales increased 39.6% driven primarily by prescription volume increases in excess of 20% and favorable pricing impacts. Wholesale inventory remain constant at fourth quarter 2014 level of less than half a month. International HUMIRA sales grew 14.8% on an operational basis excluding a 14.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. As occurs periodically the first quarter was favorably impacted by the timing of shipments in select markets. For the full year 2015 we continue to expect global HUMIRA sales growth in the mid-teens on an operational basis. International sales of Synagis were $335 million in the quarter up 8% on an operational basis. Synagis which protects at risk infants from severe respiratory disease is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first quarters and fourth quarters. We continue to expect 2015 Synagis sales growth to be similar to 2014 performance. Global VIEKIRA sales in the first quarter were $231 million. In the U.S. many of our contracts have start dates in the April and May timeframe and we expect those to begin to ramp in the second quarter and third quarters and build for the remainder of the year. Our commercial efforts are focused on driving strong penetration in the AbbVie exclusive accounts. We've been successful in this regard with our largest contract which is been in place since the beginning of the year. Internationally we've been able to secure reimbursement in many markets faster than we had originally anticipated. As a result as Rick indicated we expect a higher mix of international sales this year than originally forecasted. Globally we continue to expect an annualized run rate of more than $3 billion in sales by the end of 2015. Global Lupron sales were $192 million in the quarter up 3.8% on an operational basis. For the full year 2015 we expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2014 sales. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $186 million up 18.8% versus the prior year quarter. For the full year 2015 we expect Synthroid sales to be roughly flat from 2014 level in line with market trends. AndroGel sales were $153 million down significantly due to continued market declines in the entry of generic competition for the 1% formulation. As we said previously we expect AndroGel sales of less than $500 million for the full year 2015. U.S. Creon sales were $127 million in the quarter up 18.8%. We continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts in the pancreatic enzyme market, and we expect double-digit sales growth for Creon in 2015. Sales of Duodopa our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease grew 19.5% on an operational basis in the quarter. We expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales in 2015. Our U.S. launch will be getting underway in the second quarter and third quarters and as we said previously we anticipate a gradual ramp for product sales in the U.S. this year as physicians grow familiar with the product. The foreign exchange environment has clearly been challenging for our industry over the last few quarters and like our peers we saw a negative impact on our top-line in the quarter as a result. While we are not completely immune from currency swings, our global business structure and hedging actions we’ve taken will allow us to deliver our bottom-line commitments despite foreign exchange headwinds and protect shareholders from the negative impact. As a result of this mitigation, we will see a favorable effect on our margin profile. We showed continued improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales in the first quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 82.9%, up 450 basis points from the prior year quarter driven by the effects of exchange, product mix and operational efficiencies. Adjusted R&D was 16.1% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our mid and late stage pipeline assets. Adjusted SG&A was 26.7% of sales in the first quarter, down from the prior year contributing to continued improvement in operating margin leverage. The adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 40.1% of sales, up 620 basis points to prior year quarter. The majority of this improvement was driven by product mix and efficiencies. We are on track to deliver an operating margin profile in excess of 40% in 2015. Adjusted net interest expense was $67 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.3% in the quarter. First quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash amortization expense in specified items were $0.94, up 32.4% year-over-year and exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.63. As Rick communicated, this morning we increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2015 by $0.05. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is now $4.10 to $4.30. This range reflects EPS growth of 23% to nearly 30%. The increase in guidance is reflective of the strong underlying performance of the business that we see playing out this year. And we have raised our outlook despite the increasingly negative impact from foreign exchange. We are now forecasting roughly 7% negative top-line impact from currency this year which we have covered in our guidance increase. Our 2015 adjusted guidance range includes the previous communicated $0.20 dilutive impact of the Pharmacyclics acquisition. It excludes $0.53 of amortization in specified costs including Pharmacyclics transaction costs booked in the first quarter. We plan to communicate specific profile guidance for the combined company as well as 2015 accounting impacts of the transaction on our second quarter call in July. Regarding the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 to $1.06. This excludes roughly $0.09 of specified items and non-cash amortization and includes the modest amount of Pharmacyclics dilution based on a partial quarter impact. So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our out-performance in the first quarter and its impact on our full year projection. We’ve driven strong top and bottom-line growth and delivered operating margin expansion, while also advancing on our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to deliver industry leading growth this year. And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo: Thanks, Bill. We’ll now open the call for questions. Evan, we’ll take our first question please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.
Mark Schoenebaum: Congratulations on fantastic P&L management this quarter. Rick I heard during your opening comments you talked a little bit about your long range plan kind of qualitatively about operating margin improvement as part of your long range plan. What I'd like to know perhaps is can you -- are you willing or can you yet quantify where you see operating margins going over the medium to long-term? And if you can’t do that today, well it should be understandable view that plans to maybe said on analyst meeting or some other venue at which you might communicate a long range plan with investors? And then also can you comment on whether or not your assumption for operating margin improvement over the medium to long-term is or is not dependent on revenue, in other words can you commit to your investor base that AbbVie can and will expand its operating margin even if the top-line were to come in below your internal expectations and obviously there the focus will be the HUMIRA bio similar erosion curve?
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick. I think probably the best way to answer your question is to maybe talk for a few moments about the philosophy by which we manage the business and how we think about investment, and how we think about revenue, and ultimately how we try to deal with changes in those dynamics. So let me share by saying, I am sure you understand that our business strategy is really designed to maximize both short and long-term profitability to business. Getting sure the strong returns and strong value over that long period of time, that philosophy really plays out in how we look at investment decisions, whether we’re increasing investment or decreasing investment. And what I’d say is this management team at AbbVie, they came out of Abbott has always been disciplined in our approach to resourcing opportunities as well as overall P&L management. We managed the business with the objective of driving robust growth in both revenue and EPS but at the same time improving operational efficiencies and I think you have seen some of that and I will talk more about that in a moment. In cost, in order to maximize shareholder returns but again short-term and long-term. And the examples I will give you is this. Just take a look at what we you have seen play out since we launched a new company. For example our gross margin profiles improved from 76.2% in the first quarter of 2014 to 82.9% this quarter. Additionally if you look at despite building the infrastructure that was necessary to be an independent public company operating margin profile was improved from 33.7% in first quarter of 2014 to 40.1% in the most current quarter. So we've delivered significant improvement in both of those metrics and we’re committed to continue to do that. And importantly we delivered six points of operating margin profile improvement in the last four quarters. The other thing I would say is we've seen a number of comparisons to various peers group as it relates to AbbVie. And I think it's important to recognize that no two companies are identical when it comes to product mix, geographic coverage, the size of the market that they operate in, the brands responsiveness to investment and many other factors. And I realized it is tempting to do these macro comparisons and I would even agree to some extent that is instructive at some level. But I'll also tell you there are limitations and flaws in doing it. I can tell you that we benchmark and compare ourselves to many companies and we believe that we compare favorably to most of our peers and we will give you a couple of examples here. When you compare AbbVie to the other large cap pharma peers, Bristol, Lilly, Merck, Pfizer, what you would see is the following. Our gross margin profile is on average approximately six points higher. Our R&D profile on average is five points lower. Our SG&A profile on average is three points lower. And our operating margin profile is about 13 points higher. Our geographic footprint is similar to many of those peers but our product mix is different. They have more primary care. And when you compare AbbVie to the pure biotech peers specifically Amgen, Biogen, Celgene, what you see is that our gross margin profile is on average six points lower and as due to differences in the product mix. Our R&D profile is approximately four points lower. Our SG&S profile is approximately five points higher and that’s driven by geographic distribution of our revenues especially the percentage of revenues that come from international sales as you probably know is about 45% for us and many biotech companies have 70% of their revenues coming from the U.S. And there are other anomalies that you have to be careful, such as some biotech companies have a definition adjusted SG&A that excludes the impact of equity-based compensation which we include and there are other accounting differences as well. So finally when you compare to this group and you look at our operating margin profile it's approximately seven points lower as it exists today. But the conclusion of assuming that that’s related to investments spending is not accurate. In fact I would tell you it's misleading. If you look at our total investments spending R&D and SG&A our investment spending on a profile basis is slightly below those peer companies. The entire difference is in the gross margin profile because of the product mix. And we've shown significant improvement there with more to come we’re committed to deliver more but that’s the fundamental difference between those peers groups. And again as we look at this data it is instructive and on balance I would tell you that based on the geographic footprint that we have it's larger than any biotech companies, the product mix and investment in R&D and SG&A the analysis shows us that we’re favorable to both of those peer groups. But in the end what really matters is what investment decisions do you make in the business and what’s the return that you ultimately get from. So you maximize the short-term and long-term value for the shareholder, and our philosophy is we invest in businesses and the brands to maximize that value, meaning we increase investment when we can drive a strong return and we reduce investment when we can't or a product gets to the end of its lifecycle. And I would tell you that I believe we do both very well. And we give you an example of each. If you think about the last two years, we've protected shareholder profitability for the last two years as our $2.5 billion Lupron franchise went generic. We did it by drastically reducing costs in that brand and other parts of the business. We’re doing the same thing right now on AndroGel, it's the obvious decision for us. I would just tell you it's the culture that we have here. Now let’s take the opposite example of that, HUMIRA. HUMIRA is a complex business model. HUMIRA sales and profit contributions come from a broad geographic footprint with about 40% of its sales coming from outside the United States. HUMIRA has an unparallel breath of indications and we use the unique selling model for HUMIRA. We utilize specialized and dedicated sales organizations for all major indications. We manage and invest in HUMIRA to maximize in short-term and its long-term value to the company and to our shareholders. And I think it’s pretty hard to argue with our success when we took the company public a little over two years ago, HUMIRA was $9 billion product. Today in 2015 HUMIRA is a $14 billion product, $5 billion of growth in 2.5 years despite the foreign exchange headwinds, the brand’s 55% larger. If you take Enbrel and Remicade together over that same period of time HUMIRA grew almost twice as much. So we think the performance speaks for itself. And I can tell you that based on the performance the strong potential for future continued growth, accelerating strip trends in the U.S. and strong international growth cutting HUMIRA, spending today is not a prudent long-term strategy for us. And finally, I’d make two last points, we’ve been very clear that we’re committed to driving strong continued improvement in operating margin profile, you saw that this quarter and we’re going to drive further improvements in 2015 and across the long range plan. Our goal is to drive strong growth and operate as efficiently as we possibly can to maximize profitability. We’re not going to make a prediction right now because we just made a significant acquisition and we need to start to integrate that acquisition and we will be in a position to be able to communicate things after that. Second, I get to the final part of your question because I think what you're really trying to ask me is if there was some unforeseen surprise around HUMIRA how we would react to that? So let me begin by saying the following; we do not in any way expect that type of event to happen. In fact I yell you quite the contrary. We anticipate HUMIRA will be a growth driver for us for many years and our investment and new indications like HS and Uveitis speak volumes for our confidence. However to answer your questions, it's a bare scenario played out and threaten to materially impact the profit contributions of HUMIRA we would apply our investment philosophy in an appropriate manner. We will take prompt and appropriate action to reduce our expense base accordingly with an eye to minimize the impact for the investors. To us as I said before, that’s the obvious strategy, it's part of our responsibility to shareholders as management. As a new company, we have met or exceeded expectations in every quarter of our existence including this quarter. We take our responsibility to deliver on our commitments and our performance to shareholders very seriously. If we saw any unforeseen event impact the business, we'd aggressively pursue actions to preserve profitability. As part of the culture and the commitment that we have and in fact I tell you we’re doing that right now. We’re protecting shareholders against significant foreign exchange impact and so that’s the philosophy we run the business and hopefully that answers the question that you asked.
Mark Schoenebaum: I really appreciate it Rick. Look forward to more communication after PCYC closes.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin: And I don’t want to be the dead horse obviously there has been a lot of focus on operating margins, but Rick or Bill maybe just comment on our math here. I mean clearly we see the improvements in gross margins and much about will come from royalties going away on HUMIRA as R&D seems to be in line with other large biotech peers that SG&A seems to be where things appear to be a bit out of kilter. If I do a bottoms-up analysis on HUMIRA it would seem that it will be difficult to spend more than 1 billion maybe a 1.5 billion if you really stretch it, so that leads about 4 billion to 4.5 billion for the rest of the portfolio and when I look at the rest of the portfolio, I mean Synagis, Lupron, Synthroid these are drugs that I don’t think require active promotion and I can’t imagine requires the multi-billion dollars and expenses. Obviously there is other stuff thrown in there, but when I sort of bring it all back to really start it out here, it seems that there is about $2 billion in excess spending. Can you comment on this? And is there anything structural that would prevent you from eliminating that without really touching taking HUMIRA spend? And just maybe another way to go about this is that is there anything structural that would impede you from achieving large cap biotech operating margins which in the next couple of years are forecasted to be in the low 50% range?
Rick Gonzalez: Well, first Jami I disagree with your analysis on the investment expense, because if they take your own report and I had to gather the SG&A and the R&D spend for those three companies that I mentioned were slightly below total investment, when you include SG&A and R&D. So it's a question of how you distribute your investments, I would say the second thing is in any cases, we have a broader portfolio of products and broader geographic spread of our products within some of those companies still. Is there anything structural? No, there is nothing structural, I mean obviously we have a geographic footprint it's much larger than many of those other company companies. We believe that’s a competitive advantage. As far as HUMIRA spending is concerned, we obviously do bottoms up budgeting every single year, we justify what we’re going to spend, I would tell you that the selling model that we have is somewhat unique in the industry, but it also tell you that the performance that it's delivering is unique as well. And products don’t sell themselves and so at the end of the day we believe we’re getting a good return out of the investment that we’re making. And we’re balancing our ability to be able to perform in best long-term as well as short-term significant return, and we may increase all the time. I would also say that when you look at some of those brands the broad conclusion that they don't require promotion is not an accurate conclusion. Lupron has promotional activities associated as an example with it. And so generally speaking what I would say is that there is nothing structural that would cause us not to be able to make significant changes. And as I mentioned in my comments to Mark if we were in a situation where ultimately that was something that we believe it was in the best long-term interest of shareholders then we will make that change. But we’re certainly not in that position now. If you look at our performance this quarter we’re growing rapidly, we expect to continue to grow. We have a number of pipelined drugs, as we believe will be approved over the course of the next two years we’re certainly going to put ourselves in a position to be able to launch those drugs and be effective and we’re going to balance the investment we’re making in other areas against that investment to try to be as efficient as possible. And we believe that is the appropriate way to run the business. And we don't believe it is appropriate to try to hit some margin target whatever the number is by cutting R&D or productive SG&A. We don't think that is in the long-term interest of the shareholders.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
Jeff Holford: Three questions. The first is just a very short one, just wanted if you can comment a bit more in terms of the gross margin uplift you've had there. Just give us a bit more breakdown in terms of what was mix, what was efficiency and what was FX? Second I wonder if you could maybe comment around there are quite a few experts speaking about patents on HUMIRA, really focusing on dosing and formulation and specifically potential weakness is there. Would you say that that’s the key area of the IP portfolio to focus on? Or are there potentially other stronger areas that are being discussed? And then lastly also on IP, I wonder if you can talk to any of the IP that have in the areas of Alzheimer's, it is antibody, and just tell us a little bit more around that?
Bill Chase: So Jeff its Bill Chase I'll start with your gross margin question. I am actually going to expand it to operating margin as well, because exchange impact those profile metrics differently. So on the gross margin basis exchange made up a little bit over half of the improvement in the quarter, the remainder was product mix and efficiency. And I would say you can split those remainder two-thirds, one-third. On the operating margin line where exchange has less an effect, what we saw was about a one-third impact of exchange and the rest being leverage on the P&L product mix and efficiencies.
Laura Schumacher : This is Laura, I'll take the question on IP. As we said before we've a robust portfolio of IP that covers a wide variety of patents including manufacturing patients, formulation patents, process patents and patents that cover virtually every indication for which HUMIRA is currently approved. We think these patents have a very broad applicability to any bio-similar application and the earliest of these patents expires in 2022. When thinking about these patents it's important to note that HUMIRA was the first fully human monoclonal antibody as such little was known about how to use fully human monoclonal antibodies, and the work that we did in the area was foundational. Collectively we think these patents were the subject of extensive prosecution in the patent and trademark office over nearly a decade and we think given the innovative nature of our work and the rigorous prosecution that the patents are strong and will withstand challenge.
Rick Gonzalez: Who wants to talk about the Alzheimer's IP?
Mike Severino: With respect to IP, this is Mike Severino. With respect IP in Alzheimer's disease, we’re active from a research perspective in a wide range variance and we’re active in Neuroscience as well and that work generates IP it's done so in the past and we will continue to do so in the future. So I think you will see us continue to pursue research activities in this area over time.
Rick Gonzalez: Yes, we just haven't provided a lot of detail there yet Jeff. 
Operator: Our next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS.
Marc Goodman: On the VIEKIRA overseas can you give us a sense of what countries the growth came from? And what new countries are coming on, so we can get a sense of just the geographical mix there? And then you mentioned at your -- can you just give us an update on that product we haven't talked about that in a long. Where is it? When do we get to see data? And then third questions is why are there still such significant separation cost that you are excluding from the numbers given that we’re couple of years out from the separation form Abbott. 
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick. I will talk a little bit about the international roll-out. Obviously we've launched in a number of European countries and in a number of other select countries outside of Europe, Germany is a good example of one that has gotten significant uptake. But you will see Italy coming online, Spain has come online and a number of other ones have come on line. So it's the major European countries that you would expect to be the greatest value. And then assume -- we’re assuming Japan we will see in the fourth quarter as well.
Mike Severino: This is Mike Severino. With respect to offsetting status that’s our molecule that's been studied in diabetic neuropathy that is progressing well, it's in the Phase 3 study, that’s an outcome study and it's invent driven. So it's hard to make exact predictions about when it will read out, but I think those data will continue to mature over the next few years and so I think you can expect to hear more from it in that timeframe.
Rick Gonzalez: I think it is fair to say that because it's an outcome driven trial this trial will take a significant period of time to hit the number of events based on the endpoint that we’ve assumed.
Mike Severino: That’s correct.
Rick Gonzalez: Several years.
Mike Severino: And then Mark on separation expenses, when we separated from Abbott, we operated under a number of transition service agreements. It generally had a two to three year timeline. The majority of those were off with the exception of two large ones and that has to do with the rollout of the existing back office in Abbott and how quickly we could create a new back office and we’ve made great progress on that rolling out a very efficient shared outsource model, but we’re not completely done with that, we’ll be done at midpoint of this year. The other major initiative as you can imagine is just entangling the IT environment and infrastructure in general is extremely complex and that will be done by the third quarter and those are the majority of the costs you're still seeing coming through.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO.
Alex Arfaei: Rick or Laura, the intellectual property, the HUMIRA intellectual property that you referred to, will that protect you against biosimilars manufactured outside the U.S.? In other words are there ways for biosimilar companies to circumvent those patents with ex-U.S. manufacturing? And second question on HUMIRA, the U.S. growth is truly impressive, you mentioned I think old time take market-share could you put some numbers around those market-shares in major indications? And then finally on Hep C why did you exclude cirrhotic in your Phase 2 and will you how cirrhotic data that is this year?
Laura Schumacher: I’ll take the IP question first, with respect to the IP the patents that I am talking about broadly are global patents. So we have global patents covering manufacturing and process. The specific indication patents that I referenced are U.S. patents. We have patents pending outside the U.S. right now. Those patents have not issued yet, but we think the portfolio we have is very broad and we think that we will have some protection outside the United States as far as -- certainly right now manufacturing process and formulations.
Rick Gonzalez: In terms of market-share Alex, let me give you just a quick snapshot, rheumatology we’ve got about a roughly 25% share right now and dermatology it's approaching a 40% share and in the gastro space it's kind of around 45% market share for us, so very strong market share.
Mike Severino: So this is Mike Severino, with respect to our next generation HCV program, I think you're referring to comments we made about a 99% SVR4 response rate in genotype 1 non-cirrhotic patients. Those are simply the first data that we have available. We have not excluded cirrhotic patients on our Phase 2 program. You’ll see our Phase 2 program continue to mature a little course of this year and we'll be providing update as appropriate.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
Vamil Divan: So just couple more on the Hep C side; one, can you just share your kind of internal sense of the market share breakdown right now, it's obviously a tougher market than usual for us, you kind of see from the outside between Merck and Gilead any color there in terms of the breakdown would be helpful. And then in terms of the next gen we’re seeing some good day over here at ESOL from competitors. How do you think about duration there, does there need to be any regimen? Are you looking maybe then potentially shorter than that? How do you think about they are giving what the competitors are showing over here?
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick, I’ll cover the market-share piece. So we’re obviously still pretty early on in the launch with three, four months into the launch and maybe the easiest way to characterize it is this, if you actually look I am going to give you a slightly different number than we’ve given you in the past because it will relate better to the overall market-share. So if you look at what we have under contract now and preferred or exclusive contracts total in other words there is still a percentage of covered lives that have not contracted yet and that percentage actually has stayed pretty constant for the last 30 or 45 days. So that’s why I am going to give you a total market-share. You say that we have about 21% of the market that’s under contract as a preferred, well we have preferred agent within those accounts. The vast majority of those have come online roughly in the March timeframe and there actually spread for March, April, May, obviously ESI came on early on and we’ve now demonstrated within the exclusives that we’ve been in for 90 days that we’re able to achieve high share. But ultimately we will deliver the overall share in the U.S. market will be ramping up in these other preferred or exclusive accounts and we’re not going to be able to see that data probably for another 90 days or so as they come online and we ramp. So, I think the best way I need the best way to think about the U.S. just qualitatively would be that you will see this essentially this lighter ramp in the first half of the year for the U.S. and a faster ramp in the second half of the year. Then the parody accounts obviously we've had a number of those under contract and we’re ramping there, they are not ramping as high as the exclusive accounts did. And so the blended share will be determined it's really too early I think to give you a prediction yet, but within 90 days or so I think we will be in a better position to be able to predict that. But it will be a blended share between what we’re able to drive in these preferred accounts, a level we get in parody accounts and then obviously in the areas where our volumes are indicated, we’re getting some share out of their exclusive accounts and it will be the blend of all of those. But now I would say you should be thinking about it in the teens right now, on a low end of the teens but should ramp from there.
Mike Severino: This is Mike Severino. With respect to data coming out of ESOL and short course therapy in the future for Hep C. I think it's still a bit early to say where various regiments around the industry are going to sort out with respect to treatment duration. We've seen hints that six weeks maybe possible but those have sort of come and gone in the past and I think we’re going to need more data to know where treatment durations will really sort out over the next few years. What we do know is that it's very important to have high response rates to very high cure rates and I don't personally believe that people will be willing to sacrifice a lot on secured rates to say for example two weeks of the treatment duration and that’s certainly the philosophy that we’re taking. So I think those data will continue to evolve and we'll keep a close eye and with respect to our next generation program we’re going to study eight weeks and we will go where the data take us. We will go as short as we think the data support. Again while maintaining those very high cure rates. So I think when I look at all the data coming out of ESOL I still see our regimen is very, very competitive and I think treatment durations that we’re exploring are going to be appropriate with the landscape that we see out there in three to five years and beyond.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala: I have a few questions. On the January call AbbVie said it would provide more specific guidance on 2015 VIEKIRA sales expectations as the year unfolds. What uncertainties still exists such that a single point full year guidance number is not being provided now? So that’s the first question. Second question is I thought both the ABT-199, 17p deletion and elotuzumab readouts were supposed to be in early 2015. What does it imply that the data is not yet available? And then lastly what has been the tone and the substance of your conversations with partners J&J, with ibrutinib and Roche with ABT-199 post the news of the Pharmacyclics acquisition. It would seem that there could be some issues and our concerns and I am just wondering if that’s the case.
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick, I'll take the guidance question. It's specifically two things, it's what I just mentioned a moment ago that many of these exclusive accounts are just now coming on and if we look at our experience in the earlier ones that has taken us about 90 days to get to peak share. And so we need to make sure that we can demonstrate that level of share in those accounts to be able to give you an accurate prediction because obviously that drives a significant part of the share and the volume. And then the second thing is it's this issue that we described before and that is clearly we’re having greater success than we had planned in the international markets. And so the mix is different than what we expected in our original planning process. And so we need more time to see that rollout and that’s gated based on how you get reimbursement in those countries. So we don't want to give you an inaccurate number and we want to see it play out a little bit longer. But what we do know is we feel confident that we should be able to hit the greater than $3 billion run rate by the end of the year. And we've looked at that carefully and we've really communicated that. When we’re at a point that we feel comfortable we can give you a full year estimate we will provide that to you.
Mike Severino: This is Mike Severino. With respect elotuzumab and ABT-199 specifically the 17p del data. The question if I can paraphrase is, are we on track? And when we can see more data from these programs? We’re on track with both programs. Elotuzumab you will see an update at ASCO so that’s in a very near future. With ABT-199, and 17p del, we’re on track where we’re working with the data recall that this is an open label study so we’re working with the data. And what we see is consistent with our expectations. We'll look for an appropriate venue and timeframe to share details for those data externally. But we continue to have confidence in that molecule and have a view towards the regulatory submission later on this year.
Rick Gonzalez: The partner aspect of it, first let me start with J&J. Obviously Pharmacyclics is an independent company right now and the relationship that they have with J&J is that something we can interfere with or be directly involved and we've had communication with J&J it's been very, very positive, I think we’ve worked with J&J in other aspects relationships that we've very had and our prior experience with Abbott and they are fine company, I think the relationship will work extremely well. I make similar comments about Roche, I think Roche, Genentech we’ve had very good relationships with and we don’t anticipate any challenges and managing our way through this relationship between the two partners.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.
Robyn Karnauskas: Just two questions I guess for Rick, so first of all I guess are you opposed to an Analyst Day just to help us understand in greater depths your rationale behind the confidence in HUMIRA, how you run your business? And the second question is and I appreciate that your confidence in HUMIRA business, but when you talk about disaster scenario what is that for you, is that a launch of a biosimilar or is that massive share loss? And do you run your business like that is the possibility or do you run your business like we are so confident in HUMIRA that is something we were not really worried about, just trying to understand how you're run your business versus your confidence?
Rick Gonzalez: Two big questions. So the Analyst Day, we had kick around the idea of an Analyst Day, we may do something post closing Pharmacyclics so we -- that was just something we need to plan for and not only we’ll be able to talk about the other aspects of the business that talk about our oncology strategy in more detail. So I would stay tuned on that and we think there a number of things if we could communicate kind of the summer, fall kind of timeframe. I think would be the most appropriate time and now there is a suggested similar suggestion to us about doing an Analyst Day. So that is something we’re considering. What I would tell you on the HUMIRA situation, it is not the launch of a biosimilar, obviously we had a strategy in place that we believe will allow us to continue to drive strong performance out of HUMIRA a post launch of a biosimilar. But what I would tell you is we obviously have contingency plans that we have in place that we will pull the trigger on. Remember it's going to be not just one single launch, right, because HUMIRA is sold all around the world. So there will be different countries, obviously the U.S. is significant part of that and the major European countries are another significant part of it. But we would be evaluating every single country on an ongoing basis and we would make a determination and I’d say the disaster scenario for us would be that ultimately we were significantly unable to achieve the objective that we built into our long range plan. Obviously built into the plan expectations, how we would deal with any price erosion that might occur, any share erosion that might occur and then we have a contingency plan that basically will be built around missing that particular set of assumptions, and you wouldn’t pull it all at once, you basically start to titrate if you are missing in a way to be able to offset or mitigate any financial impact versus what you had planned for. And so I think that’s the way to think about it.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.
Chris Schott: First of all just on HUMIRA, was just interested in your perspective and how you're thinking about the biosimilar Remicade launch in Europe this year. I guess what you're expecting there in terms of uptake? And how should we think about this launch as a comp that if a biosimilar HUMIRA was to enter the market in Europe let's say in late 2018, is the Remicade biosimilar ramp something that we should think about as a reasonable comparison there? Second question was on leverage and business development priorities post PCYC. What is the sense of urgency at this point you add or build upon existing growth verticals with further end market product acquisitions post this deal, is that short of priority or should we think about AbbVie kind of coming back to focusing on some of these earlier stage more R&D focus transaction is going forward?
Rick Gonzalez: So on HUMIRA and the biosimilar launch in -- the Remicade biosimilar launch expanding beyond the countries that has been in now for a couple of years. What it says we’ve been watching these launches carefully in the countries that they have been in for some period of time. If you look at those countries relatively modest share has been achieved by the biosimilar product in most of those countries and its well within the expectations of what we would have assumed. We’re watching the competitive response and learning from how that competitive response works. And I’d say so far that’s been consistent with what we would have expected from a pricing standpoint and a strategy standpoint. And so within the countries we’re in now, where we’re seeing these launches I can tell you HUMIRA is not impacted. We’re continuing to grow patient share within those countries and so there certainly isn’t any direct impact on HUMIRA within those countries what where we see it today. Is it a good metric in order to measure what we could expect with HUMIRA? I think that’s probably a little bit difficult to judge because again it all bodes boils to your position in the marketplace and I’d also say that the European market and international markets are different than the U.S. market for a number of different reasons. And so if you were to assume that a HUMIRA biosimilar would be in the U.S. prior to the international markets then I would say it's not a good surrogate at all to look at because I think U.S. will be a very different kind of competitive situation. And I think even in the European markets each product is positioned a little bit differently within the market and it bodes down to how to stay competitive response handle the launch of that product. So that one is a little tougher for me to answer. But I would say for right now it's tracking the way we would expected it to be. On the BD priorities post deal, if I understand the question correctly, are we looking to go out and find another large growth platform? The answer is no. We've obviously made a significant commitment here with the acquisition of Pharmacyclics and it positions us well in this sector. And ultimately it was platform play for us and it's a platform play that we would assume that we needed or wanted going forward. So now I think you will see us go back to a similar kind of strategy that we had before which is more looking for individual products that we build out. The areas that we had specific therapeutic interest in like immunology, like virology, like oncology and continuing to add on to that potentially some tuck in kinds of acquisitions, smaller acquisitions to add to it, but more of what you've seen from us in the past.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.
Colin Bristow: Just to piggyback on Vamil's question, we’re seeing a new dates that Merck and Gilead ESOL I was just curious how do you see VIEKIRA PAK competitive position as we move into 2016 given the sentence upon competitive landscape? And there is another one on Hep C, there has been some discussion in the Hep C community that new world realize cure rates for VIEKIRA PAK could be a greater delta to those in clinical trial versus Harvoni given the complex measurement. I would like to get your feedback here based on your experience so far. And then just one quick one Imbruvica. Your peers recently entered in a partnership with the BTK inhibitor for autoimmune conditions including RA, is it something you planned to perceive with Imbruvica?
Mike Severino: So with respect to ESOL, we continue to feel confident that VIEKIRA PAK will provide competitive efficacy in the timeframe that’s you are describing in the 2065 timeframe and beyond. Recall that cure rates of VIEKIRA are very high and that duration is been well tolerated and we don't see major shifts for example in duration of therapy in the timeframe that you are describing that would change that picture in any meaningful way. Of course over the longer-term we have our own next generation program which I talked about a little bit earlier in this call, which will continue to drive innovation in this space. And so we feel good about our presence in Hep C today. And we'll continue to do so over the years to follow. With respect real world cure rates with VIEKIRA PAK that doesn't match our experience. And so I really can't comment on that report. Our real world experience is actually a quite good with respect to adherence to the regimen and therefore realizing the cure rates that have been demonstrated in clinical trials.  With respect to Imbruvica, we're each obtaining inhibition in autoimmune disorders, obviously that’s something that has been a focus of research for a number of companies including ourselves. It's something we'll continue to investigate. I think we will be positioned very well to pursue that aggressively given our extensive experience in immunology and post close given PCYC's experience in BTK inhibition. So it's certainly something that we will keep a close eye on something that we would pursue.

Rick Gonzalez: Thanks, Larry. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us this morning. Since becoming an independent company, our strategy has centered around delivering strong results and returns for our shareholders while insuring, we have a strong sustainable growth business over the long term. As we look back over the past year and assess our performance, we’re pleased with the significant progress we've made, not only in delivering outstanding 2014 results, but also in establishing a solid platform for growth well into the future. As we announced this morning, we delivered exceptional results in 2014. With sales and earnings well above our original projections for the year, we delivered 7% global operational sales growth in 2014 and we increased our ongoing earnings per share by nearly 6%. When we launched AbbVie two years ago, one of our key priorities was to return to strong growth in 2015. I’m pleased that we were able to achieve that goal a year ahead of schedule. This performance demonstrates the strength and sustainability of our portfolio and underscores our continued focus and execution. Our performance in 2014 was driven by growth from key products including Humira , Synthroid, Synagis, CREON, and Duodopa. We also delivered year-over-year margin improvement while continuing to invest in R&D and SG&A to drive future growth. In addition to our strong financial results over the past year, we are seeing significant pipeline advancement and have achieved a number of important development and regulatory milestones. We secured US and European approval for interferon-free HCV treatment [inaudible]. We successfully completed several late stage clinical trials including daclizumab and Humira HS registrational programs. We initiated a number of promising phase 3 through programs including several phase 3 studies of our PARP inhibitor Veliparib in solid tumors such as breast and lung cancer and our BCL-2 inhibitor ABT 199 in hematological malignancies. We also made significant advancements with our next-generation HCV program, initiating a broad phase 2 B program which is on track to transition the phase 3 in 2015. We advanced a number of early-stage assets in the mid-stage development including our DB platform and ABT 414R our antibody drug conjugate in development for glioblastoma multiforma.  We augmented our pipeline through strategic licensing and partnering activities. We acquired the rights to [inaudible] now in development for CLL and NHL. And we entered into a novel collaboration with Calico to accelerate the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for age-related diseases such as cancer and neurological diseases. And over the first couple of weeks in 2015 we have seen additional pipeline developments. With the recent US approval of DUOPA, our therapy for advanced Parkinson’s disease and positive topline efficacy results from the first year-to-go ex-pivotal trial in endometriosis.  So we have established a strong foundation and have entered 2015 with good momentum which we intend to build upon. As I outlined earlier this month in 2015 we are forecasting full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.25 to $4.45. It is important to remember that this range reflects EPS growth of 28 to 34% which is well above our peer group. And in the coming year we expect to see significant activity across our pipeline including the potential for several regulatory submissions data readouts and phase transitions that I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Humira was certainly an important driver of our strong performance in 2014 with nearly 19% operational growth for the year. Humira has averaged well over $1 billion of growth per year for the past eight years. For 2015 we expect Humira to once again be an important contributor to our robust performance with the mid-teens global operational growth expected. We also saw strong performance from several other products in 2014 including Creon, Synthroid, Synagis, and Duodopa. We expected each of these products would hold leadership positions in their respective categories, will continue to represent an important part of our business mix in 2015. Clearly another important driver of performance in 2015 will be our interferon-free HCV therapy Viteron [ph] which is now been approved in the US, EU and a number of other countries around the world. We are pleased with Viekira product label and updated AASLD treatment guidelines and we believe both reflect the strength of the product’s clinical profile across genotype-1 patient population. Position reception of Viekira has been positive and in line with our expectations. While we moved quickly upon approval, I would say that the US launch began in earnest in early January and we’re pleased with our progress today. The first phase of the launch securing payer positions and access for Viekira is well underway. As we indicated once a highly competitive alternative was available Managed Care began their contracting for this class. Obviously in this category the contracting process is occurring very rapidly unfolding over a period of weeks versus months. As we embarked on our discussions with payers we applied a standard Managed Care contracting approach with each account, basing our contracting terms upon four key tenants including the volume of Managed Care lives, the level of formulary control, the term of the contract and patient access within the system.  A significant number of payer contracts have been completed in the U.S. with more than half the Managed Care lives in the US now under contract. Based on the outcome of this process today, we estimate that more than 40% of the covered lives will have access to access to Viekira pak including both the exclusive and parity positions we have secured. More than 20% of the lives will be in an exclusive position and we would expect the Viekira pak to capture some portion of the patients in plans that have elected to pursue exclusive contracts with other suppliers, given certain aspects of the Viekira pak profile and product label for certain patients.  We need to see how the remainders of the contracts are finalized, but up to this point we're pleased with our formulary position and we believe we have the potential to capture meaningful share of the US HCV market. As we do with most new product launches, we monitor both prescriptions filled data as well as prescriptions written or claimed to assess our sales effectiveness and the efficiency of the payer administrative and prior authorization processes.  To that end we have data from external sources, which show 11,000 Viekira prescriptions have been written through January 16th, with the majority occurring in the first two weeks of January. These prescriptions are working their way through the administrative and prior authorization process in order to be filled. While some of these claims may not be filled as is the case with all prescription claims, the majority will make their way through the administrative process and should be dispensed in the coming weeks.  This level of Viekira prescription generation is well within our expectations for this stage of the U.S. launch. So based on the full body of data that we have in hand we feel good about the early days of our U.S. launch. Moving forward, our commercial efforts in the U.S. will focus on driving strong penetration in the AbbVie's exclusive and parity accounts while ensuring access to Viekira and non-AbbVie accounts, where our product offerings more appropriately based on the label or medical preference for certain patients.  Our international launch is also progressing well and discussions with government payers in various countries are under way and they are advancing rapidly. We are currently selling Viekira in a number of countries around the world including Germany, U.K, Canada, Austria and Sweden and we are on the crux for beginning promotion in several other countries.  The HCV market is significant and rapidly growing and based on patient prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment rates we expect it to remain large and an attractive opportunity for many years to come. We're excited about the opportunity Viekira offers us in this market and we're committed to this therapeutic category for the long term and we'll continue our efforts to evolve the treatment paradigm with next generation development programs well under way. Based on our current projections we estimate by the end of 2015 we will achieve a global annualized sales running rate for Viekira of more than $3 billion dollars. Given that we are early in our launch and there are numerous factors that play we will be providing more specific guidance regarding our 2015 sales expectation for the product as the year unfolds.  Pipeline development is an important component about these long-term success and we continue to place a tremendous amount of organizational focus in this area. We have a rich and broad pipeline with more than 40 clinical development programs under way spanning large and growing especially categories. Our portfolio is comprised of assets that have the potential to deliver compelling clinical performance, patient benefits and economic value. Many of these products have the opportunity to generate multibillion dollar peak year sales. For a company of our size the sales projections from our late stage pipeline assets represent an impressive opportunity for meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. Over the past year, we demonstrated a strong track record of successful positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes from a number of clinical programs. And we look forward to numerous important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. This includes phase 3 trial initiations, data readouts for multiple programs across our pipeline, the submission of regulatory applications for several major late stage assets and potential product approvals. While I won't cover our entire pipeline in detail today, I thought it would be helpful to review some of the expected milestones in 2015. As I mentioned in 2014 successfully completed our registrational trials evaluating Humira as a treatment for HS. Our US and EU regulatory applications for this indication are currently under review, and we expect decisions from regulatory authorities later this year. Given our strong data and a high unmet need of patience, we believe this will be a significant indication for Humira sales potentially approaching a billion dollars. We’re also exploring Humira as a possible treatment for uveitis, a sight threatening inflammatory eye disease. We expect to complete the phase 3 program and some middle regulatory applications for uveitis later this year. We expect to see data from several of our promising oncology programs in 2015. This data includes data from ABT-199 study in patients with relapsed refractory CLL who had the 17p deletion mutation. We believe this study has the potential to be a registrational trial. Should we see the level of efficacy observed in the earlier studies, and regulatory agencies agreed ABT-199 addresses an unmet medical need, we plan to submit our regulatory applications for this indication later in 2015. We also plan to start a phase 3 study of ABT-199 in Gazyva in frontline fit CLL patients in 2015. This year, we expect to see results from the phase 3 study of elotuzumab in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. Assuming positive results, we expect our partner to submit the regulatory applications for this indication later in 2015. We also expect to present mid stage data from our PARP inhibitor veliparib at medical meetings throughout this year. In addition to the four phase 3 trials already underway in 2015, we’re planning to begin phase 3 studies, evaluating veliparib as a treatment for ovarian cancer. We’re also excited about ABT-414, our anti- EGF monoclonal antibody drug conjugate, which is currently being evaluated in glioblastoma multiforme and has demonstrated encouraging responses in early-stage clinical trials. We will see additional data from the ongoing trial throughout the year and we’re on the cusp of starting a phase 2 study in this aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. With respect to our HCV programs, we expect continued progress in 2015. We’re on track to submit a regulatory application for HCV combination in Japan in the first quarter and anticipate approval in the second half. As a reminder, we expect to commercialize a 12-week, two-pill once-a-day combination for this market. We also expect to see SVR data from our next generation HCV program and transition to phase 3 development later this year. We have significant R&D efforts in place to advance the standard of care in each of our areas of immunology leadership and we’ll see mid stage results from several programs this year. We had two selective JAK1 Inhibitors in our portfolio – GLPG0634 and ABT-494. Both oral compounds are currently being evaluated as potential treatments for RA, and we look forward to learning more about each assets’ profile as the phase 2B data study is complete later this year. We’re working with our partner to complete our regulatory applications for daclizumab or Zinbryta in the first half of 2015. As a reminder we presented strong pivotal trial results last year which demonstrated MS patients treated with Zinbryta at a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapse rates versus Avonex.  Given the product profile and its once monthly subcutaneous administration, we believe this agent has the potential to be an important therapy in this large and growing market. Earlier this month we announced positive topline results from the first of two ongoing phase 3 clinical trials of the elagolix in endometriosis. Initial results from the study show that after six months of treatment both doses of elagolix evaluated met the studies co-primary endpoints of reducing scores of non-menstrual pelvic pain and menstrual pain associated with endometriosis relative to placebo control. We will see additional efficacy and safety data from this trial later this year. Results from the mid-stage trial on uterine fibroids are expected later this year as well.  Clearly, 2015 promises to be another important year with numerous developments and regulatory milestones. We believe AbbVie has a unique investment identity. We offer promising pipeline prospects as described along with strong growth and compelling shareholder returns. Our business generates significant cash flow which we expect will grow in 2015 and beyond with new product introductions. We’re committed to returning cash to shareholders and our primary means to do so will continue to be our dividend. Last year we announced that AbbVie’s quarterly dividend will be increased to $0.49, an increase of nearly 17% beginning with the dividend payable next month. We intend to maintain our strong commitment to growing our dividend going forward.  Additionally last year we also disclosed a $5 billion share buyback program to be executed over the next several years further reflecting our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. We will also utilize our strong cash flow to enhance our pipeline through licensing and partnering activities. As a mentioned in 2014 we entered into several collaborations to add to our pipeline. We view these activities as an important component of our overall R&D strategy and we expect to continue to augment our pipeline in 2015 and in the years to come.  In closing, since AbbVie became an independent company we’ve been focused on executing our key strategic priorities and delivering market-leading returns for our shareholders. One of our primary stated objectives upon our inception was to return the strong growth in 2015. And we’re pleased that we’ve been able to do that a year ahead of schedule. We feel good about the high level of execution of our key strategic priorities, we’ve established a strong track record consistently delivering our financial commitments generating strong shareholder returns and driving leading performance of HUMIRA and other products in our portfolio.  We’ve also built a promising late stage pipeline which will fuel our future growth. So we set a very sound foundation for our company. We were entering 2015 with strong momentum. We intend to build upon to drive a high level performance in our operations and strong growth.  With that I will turn the call over to Bill for additional comments in the fourth quarter and our 2015 outlook, Bill?
Bill Chase: Thank you, Rick. This morning I will start with an overview of our fourth quarter performance and then I will walk through our outlook for 2015. We had an outstanding fourth quarter, getting off the year, a better-than-expected performance. This performance allowed us to raise our people year EPS guidance range of 23 year and ultimately deliver results that exceeded our final guidance. Off note in 2014 we delivered EPS growth despite headwinds from currency in the fourth quarter as well as the loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise.  For the quarter total adjusted sales were nearly $5.4 billion up 8.9% on operational basis. And as I mentioned exchange dynamics in the fourth quarter were significant reducing sales growth in the quarter by 3.8%. Fourth quarter revenue growth by Humira which delivered global sales of $3.4 billion, up 14.4% operationally and up 10.6% on a reported basis. In the U.S. Humira sales increased 15.8% reflecting continued strong prescriptions trends double digit market growth across all three major categories rhum, gastro and derm. Internationally Humira sales grew 12.7% on an operational basis, excluding an 8.4% unfavorable impact from exchange. International Humira performance continues to be driven by double-digit market growth in most countries. Globally Humira sales for the full-year 2014 were more than $12.5 billion, up 18.9% operationally, versus the prior year. Sales of Synagis were $298 million on quarter, up 4.9% on an operational basis. For the full year, Synagis sales were $835 million an increase of 9.3% operationally versus the prior year. Growth in 2014 was driven by continued product uptake and strong commercial execution. As a reminder, this is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first and fourth quarters of the year. AndroGel sales were $230 million in the fourth quarter, down about 20% versus the prior year, reflecting the continuation of recent market trends. Full year sales were $934 million, down 9.7% year-over-year. Global Lupron sales were $207 million in the fourth up 0.6% on an operational basis. For the full year Global Lupron sales were $778 million, roughly flat from the prior year and in line with our expectations. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintains significant share of the market. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $186 million in the quarter, with full-year sales of $709, up nearly 14%. Synthroid maintain strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. U.S. Creon sales were $151 million with full-year sales of $516 million up 25.3% versus 2013. Creon maintain its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with roughly 70% share, and we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. International sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease were $56 million in the fourth quarter up 25.4% on an operational basis. For the full year, Duodopa sales were $220 million, a 24.7% increase versus 2013 on operational basis. And as you know, we launched our VIEKIRA, in the US in mid-December following FDA approval, sales of VIEKIRA were $48 million in the quarter, reflecting the shipment of stocking quantities into the market over the holiday to support our full commercial launch in January. I'll turn now to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 81.2% excluding amortization and other specified items. This represents a significant increase over the prior year due to favourable mix impact across the portfolio, margin enhancing initiatives and the impact of exchange dynamics. Adjust SG&A was 29.1% of sales in the fourth quarter, reflecting investments and support of the recent VIEKIRA launch and in our other growth brands and adjusted R&D was 16.3% of sales in the quarter reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline assets. Net interest expense was $63 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.5% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.89 excluding non-cash amortization expense and specified items. On a GAAP basis, we posted the loss per share of $0.51. Specified items were primarily comprised of various cost associated with the termination of the share transaction, our Calico collaboration and ongoing separation costs. I'd like to now discuss the outlook for 2015. We are confirming the full-year guidance we issued earlier this month including adjusted EPS of $4.25 to $4.45. This guidance excludes $0.34 per share of amortization expense and other specified items. On the topline, we expect high-teens revenue growth on an operational basis. Clearly we have seen significant currency movements in the recent weeks. If the recent rates would remain in effect for the remainder of the year our sales growth would be roughly 5% lower. Given our global business structure and programs we have in place to mitigate exchange impacts, the fall-through from currency to the bottomline is much more modest for us. We are comfortable with our 2015 EPS guidance range despite potential currency swings.  Included in our topline guidance our assumptions for our key products, for HUMIRA, we expect global sales growth in the mid-teens. For Synagis we expect similar performance to 2014 growth rates. Regarding AndroGel we're forecasting continued market declines as well as a negative impact from the recent entry of generic competition for the 1% formulation. As a result we expect 2015 AndroGel sales of less than $500 million. We expect 2015 Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2014 levels. For Synthroid we expect sales to be roughly flat from 2014 levels in line with market trends. For Creon we expect low double digit sales growth in 2015. We expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales in 2015.  Given the underserved patient population and the products profile and efficacy we are excited about Duopa's potential in the U.S. and expect it to be a meaningful contributor over time. That said, we anticipate a gradual ramp for the product sales in the U.S. as physicians grow familiar with the product. And we expect declines in several other products with continued lipid erosion and negative market trends in HIV and other material products.  Turning back to the P&L, we are forecasting in improvement in the adjusted gross margin ratio of around 100 basis points for the year reflecting product mix and actions we've taken to further improve our margin profile. This level of improvement would be considerably higher if current exchange rates were to hold throughout the year given how exchange flows through our P&L profile in 2015.  In 2015, we will continue to invest in our pipeline supporting our exciting opportunities in oncology, HCV, immunology and other areas. We are forecasting R&D expense of approximately 15.5% of sales, and we expect to continue investing in our growth brands with SG&A levels and approximately 25.5% of sales. As a result, we are forecasting a significant increase in our operating margin profile, which we expect to reach 40% of sales in 2015 up roughly 400 basis points reflecting the positive impact of leverage across the income statement, given our ability to moderate bottomline Fx impacts in 2015. Operating margin would be greater than 40% if current exchange rates were to hold throughout the year.  We are forecasting net interest expense of about $275 million for the full year and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate in the 22% range in 2015. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.82 to $0.84. This excludes roughly $0.18 cents of specified items and non-cash amortizations resulting in a first quarter EPS in the range of $0.64 to &0.66 on a GAAP basis. So, as we look back we are very pleased with AbbVie’s performance in our first two years as an independent company.  In 2014, we delivered sales in our names well above our original outlook and returned to growth a year ahead of expectations. And we expect to build on that momentum in 2015 with industry leading growth. And with that I'll turn it back over to Larry Peepo.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Bill. We’ll now open the call for questions. Elon, we’ll take our first question please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] and our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin: Thank you and good morning everyone. I have a few questions related to Viekira, but first Rick, congratulations on an order. So, first if you can clarify your $3 billion Viekira forecast, is that a runway you expect to achieve by the end of the year or is that a forecast for the full year, I am a little bit unclear, I think the street is too. And secondly, if you can provide a little bit more color on the percent of cover to Manage lies or you have an exclude deal with Viekira, I think you said 20%. The only exclusive deal with the PBM that we've seen come across the tape is Express Scripts, and I think they cover around 8%. So, where is the other 12% coming from? Is that on the state side or is that other Managed Care companies that just haven't issued press releases? There is confusion around there. And then just lastly I'm just curious what your assumptions are for pricing in the market, once Merck enters either late this year or early next?
Rick Gonzalez: Good morning Jami. And thank you for the congratulations. Let me address your questions. So let me start with the run rate question. Yes, what we were describing to you is there are exit rate at the end of 2015. It should be above $3 billion. So, and the reason why we're characterizing it that way is because we're still assessing the speed at which the ramp will occur, and because there are many different factors that will impact that.  Obviously, a number a different processes about how the administrative and prior authorization process ramps up in the United States, how we get pricing and reimbursement, many countries around the world, the speed of which we decide and a number of other factors. So what we're basically saying to you is based on our current forecast that we have built in for 2015, as we look at that exit rate it should be above $3 billion.  Second question was around PBM access. So, if you look at our preferred position indeed it is above 20%. That includes obviously significant portion of Express Scripts. It also includes a number of different more regional based PBMs. It includes a number of Blue Cross Blue Shield or Blue Shield plans. And I think as an example Blue Shield of California announced yesterday that position, but there are a number of those they are also in the mix. And so, it's a variety of plans in those areas that make up the 20%.  And then assumptions on price post Merck's entry; I think there is a lot of factors that will play out over time obviously in most markets as you get more competition, there is some additional price pressure. But I wouldn't anticipate that we will see significant price pressure as we see more players come into the market, but it's very early to tell what that looks like going forward. It will depend a lot on the performance of those products and other aspects of the market and how it plays out. So I think, it's just very hard to predict, Jami.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Goodman from UBS.
Mark Goodman: Bill, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how much of the spending is now in there for the HCV. And then on the gross margin you'd mention mix effects, margin enhancing initiatives; can we go into that a little bit more? And then about your commentary about the 2015 guidance you talked about the margins if Fx stays the same, the margins would be even better. Can you just give us an update on what you mean there? And then you had mentioned the infinity product that you are not licensed? And can you just tell us where that is, when will the studies be getting going and when we will see some data? 
Bill Chase: Sure, so it's a lot of different items here, but starting first with the spend for HCV. Yes, as you would imagine in the fourth quarter of 2014, we had fully built out a U.S. sales-force, we had everything basically provided for a strong launch. So those expenses were reflected in the fourth quarter. In 2015, there will be some annualization of those expenses in the U.S. because obviously we didn't have the full organization on board early 2014. The ex-US, we are currently building out and that timing is gated based on expected reimbursement timelines and launch timeline, but the bulk of that has been encompassed in our 2015 guidance. I think what's important on SG&A is we've gotten a lot of questions in the past about operating leverage on this P&L and we are beginning to show it. Our SG&A profile is coming down considerably versus where we’ve been in the last couple of years, so we are pleased on the progress there.  Gross margin is another area, frankly Mark we've been focussed on since our inception. We are benefiting from some product mix but we also have programs underway to drive efficiencies on that line and we are very focussed on it. And that's what you're seeing playing through to a great extent. We were impacted in the fourth quarter by exchange and it was a favorable impact and let me explain like this. It is a little counterintuitive, but we have within our P&L natural hedges that exist on developed market currencies and we do from time to time, when we think prudent, set up other programs to offset exchange fluctuations, primarily around the Euro.  And we are to a great extent in 2014 and 2015 protected from swings in the Euro. The manifestation on profile of course is you have weakness on the topline and an offset on the gross margin line, which actually has the impact of increasing gross margin profile. And we saw that play out in the fourth quarter. That was about 200 basis points. The rest was operating efficiencies and product mix. In 2015, we see the same dynamic playing through in the event that currencies were to remain at where they are at, that said what we have forecasted is 100 basis points of gross margin improvement and that's purely related to the operating efficiency programs we have in place as well as product mix. Is that clear?
Mark Goodman: Yeah, so you're saying that there would be more upside to the gross margin on the Fx, that you just haven't baked that in. 
Bill Chase: No, what I'm saying on a profile bases it would manifest itself as a higher profile because we'd have the weakness on the topline, but the bottomline would be protected based on our internal high dispositions.
Mike Severino: So with respect to Infinity, this is Mike Severino. The Infinity collaboration around duvelisib, this one we're very excited about. There are a number of studies are up and running and the key studies are dynamo which is a phase 2 study in patients with refractory indolent nonHodgkin's lymphoma and the duo trial which is a phase 3 study in patients with relapsed refractory CLL. Those studies are up and running. We don't have a specific timing for readouts there, but they're progressing nicely. Over the course of last year, we would this to continue over the course of 2015, earlier studies are continuing to mature on that molecule and there will be a day-to-day readouts over the course of the year. 
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.
Chris Schott: Just two here. First, coming back to the greater than $3 billion run rate by year-end 2015, is that a number that you expect you can continue to grow over time? So when we think about the year-end run rate in 2015, could that continue to grow in 2016 or do you really think about sales plateauing at that type of level over time? Second question was just on Viekira and just with all the headlines we're seeing regarding contracting. I guess just high level is pricing and the amount of access you're securing, is that progressing as expected or are you at all disappointed in terms of the number of formulary wins you're getting at this point? 
Rick Gonzalez: Okay, Chris, this is Rick. On the $3 billion run rate we would expect growth between 15 and 16 and if you think about the gating of countries coming online over the course of 2015 as an example, you'd certainly expect you'd see some annualized improvement year-over-year. But again, we have to see how that plays out in the timing of that. We're pleased with the progress that we're making so far. On the Managed Care contracting I think we are overall pleased with how it has proceeded. I think it's come within the expectations that we had, having overall 40% coverage for Viekira between our parity positions and our preferred positions, I think it is well within the expectations. But again, as I mentioned in my formal comments we have to see how the rest of it plays out and we're continuing to work on a number of contracts and I think those will conclude over the course of the next 30 days. But so far it's within our expectations. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
Jeff Holford: Just a couple of extra questions around Viekira. Can you give us any kind of sense for the US visit the ex-US mix on the run rate by the end of 2015; just any color on that would be useful? Second you talked about getting potential access, in contrast we don’t have access; how much leakage would you expect of your exclusive contracts to Gilead? And then just lastly we were talking with Roche just the other day, their results about ABT 199, they seem to indicate that the data were almost in-house or were in-house. Can you give any further commentary around near-term timing on that readout?
Mike Severino: Yes, I will take 199 first. This is Mike Severino. 199 is a program that we continue to be very excited about. We are accruing data in the study that Rick referred to earlier that same patients with refractory or relapse CLL with 17P delta lesion. That's a data set that's accumulating. It's a single arm study, so obviously that data builds over time. We’d expect to have a data set that would allow us to draw some conclusions sometime early this year and we continue to make good progress. So again if the level of activity that we saw on earlier studies persists, we’d expect that to support a regulatory filing obviously, in discussion with regulatory agencies later on this year 
Rick Gonzalez: Okay Jeff, this is Rick. If you are asking the question of what will the US/ex-US mix be in 2015, obviously the US will be a much heavier mix based on how the gating will occur across those countries, and that mix will continue, I think going forward. As far as leakage or assumptions around what we will be able to achieve within accounts that are Gilead preferred, I think both of these products, if you look at the labels, if you look at the performance there are clearly a certain number of patients and patient types that will benefit from one therapy versus the other. So as we look at our own, we think that numbers are around 10%, for example, PI failures and decompensated cirrhotics are two examples of patient populations that will be more appropriate for the alternative.  As we look at Gilead are certainly -- as you look at our label and our performance we think there is probably in the neighborhood of about 15% that would be available for therapy, those will be transplant patients, HIV co-infected patients, patient who have significant renal insufficiency, and we also think that there will be some experienced cirrhotic patients. They could benefit from 12 weeks of therapy with Viekira verses 24 weeks of therapy with Harvoni. And so those are some examples of how we see that sorting out. 
Operator: Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
Vamil Divan: Just a couple if I could on the pipeline, with daclizumab, you mentioned some excitement around there. I guess the questions we’re getting a lot from investors, in terms of your future looking at MS having this one product, this partner obviously with a player that’s much bigger than you and MS, and has other products that they are going to be promoting as well, do you think MS is a space where you need to invest more, obtain more assets in order to have a broader impact? Or is this one where you think where you have daclizumab alone is sufficient? And a second just on Duopa. If you can just give a little more color there, where we think a lot more activity in terms of new approaches to treating Parkinson’s, how long or how much of an impact do you think that can really have if you think about, it is more of a formulation plan that you guys have here as these other agents maybe come to the market in the coming years?
Rick Gonzalez: Let me start with daclizumab. Certainly as we look at the daclizumab profile, we are very pleased with how it sorted out. This is a high efficacy agent. We think the subcutaneous dosing based on the market research we’ve done is something that is appealing to positions and will be appealing the patients. And so we think it as a clear fit. As far as the space I would say the MS space is an area that is attractive. It fits the profile of the kinds of markets that we’re interested in and we constantly look for opportunities within all these spaces. I can tell you, we will look at different opportunities that exist there and evaluate those and if we saw the right opportunity come along we could build us some more critical mass in the MS space, I can tell you we would be interested in that. On Duopa we've obviously had a fair amount of experience with that product in the international markets, in particular in Western Europe. And this is a product that is unique.  I mean, when you actually look at the clinical benefit that this provides for these patients it's nothing less than astonishing what the benefit that these patients get from this product. Having said that, it is also a product that has a slow ramp up because it requires a lot of training to get patients on board, to get them titrated to the right level, to get the impact it requires a fair amount of clinical support for those patients that have to be provided. So it's not a product that has a massive ramp. What we've seen in Europe in particular is that it has good strong steady growth. But we do believe that this is a product that over the long term could become a very significant product, $500 million to $750 million range. Certainly we’re seeing some estimates that were even higher than that. But it's gonna have a gentle ramp and obviously the U.S. market is an attractive market for us. So we're pleased that we've gotten it approved in the United States and we can bring that product to patients.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum from Evercore ISI.
Mark Schoenebaum: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for the question. Thanks for all the detailed color; that's super helpful. Out here on Wall Street where we all sit in chairs and watch flashing lights, there's a lot of speculation that the discounts you guys offered in the hep C market were outsized and that you've ignited a pricing war that will only end badly for everybody in the industry. So I'd just love to hear your comments generally on that. I recognize you're not going to give us the extent of the discounts, but just qualitatively I'd like to know if those perceptions out on Wall Street you agree with or you don't agree with and why. And then perhaps for Mike, on elagolix; elagolix is a compound I've become quite interested in lately. Street estimates are around $500 million in the AbbVie consensus model. Why couldn't this be significantly larger than that? Maybe you can talk about the unmet need, how you guys see this fitting in and specifically can this be a chronic therapy for women? 
Rick Gonzalez: Hi Mark, so I'll cover your first question. This is Rick. You know I think the contracting strategy that we put in place was very consistent with the contracting strategy as I said in my remarks that we put in place for all the specialty products. What we say is this, it became very clear to us prior to approval as we were engaging with payers ahead of the launch that payers made it clear was that they were going to contract this category, and there were many payers that said they were going to contract this category with one preferred agent. And so, we had to dial that into our launch strategy and essentially we built the launch strategy, was built around those sets of assumptions. We priced and rebated consistent with the value of our product and what we thought was appropriate for the market and we did it around a disciplined approach around those parameters that I described. And so I don't believe that this is unusual. In fact I believe this is a very typical kind of an approach that we've taken across many specialty categories and the rest of the industry has taken it across many different categories. 
Mark Schoenebaum: Elagolix?
Mike Severino: Okay, so this is Mike. I'll take the Elagolix question. Just a few weeks ago we announced with our partner, topline results from the first of two phase III studies. Now, that's an ongoing study, so we're limited in terms of the amount of detail that we can go into. And we will obviously update you as more data come and present full results in a scientific setting at some later day. But, we're very pleased with what we've seen today. We hit our end points, and these are very difficult end points to hit on pelvic pain and menstrual pain in women who had very difficult to control disease. We did that at both dose levels; we studied with a high level of statistical significance. We are obviously -- we are going to watch as those data mature and as we get additional data on long-term safety that might inform chronic use, but we feel good about what we've seen today and we clearly feel that there is a very large on that medical need, a large number of women live with endometriosis. Current treatment options are not sufficient in many women, a little bit debilitating chronic pain and other symptoms. So it's a molecule that we feel good about long-term.
Rick Gonzalez : Mark, maybe I will add a couple of comments. This is obvious scenario where we have some experience because we have Lupron that’s available for this indication as well. And fundamentally what we liked about this molecule is that we thought we could get to a chronic use claim for this therapy. And we also like the fact that this is fast-on and fast-of, one of the challenges with a with a drug like Lupron is once you inject the patient, the impact last for 6 to 12 months and you basically put the woman in the menopause until you have all the normal side effects associated with that; hot flashes and bone loss. So an ideal profile here would be one that would provide sufficient efficacy but have a safety and side effect profile that was consistent with longer-term use, so minimal bone loss and minimal hot flashes. A product like that, an oral product, that was fast-on and fast-off, we think has a substantial opportunity in the market. And as Mike said, this is a high prevalence disease where there aren’t great options available for these women. So as we as we release more of the data and we see more of the data, that’s certainly the profile we’re shooting for, it doesn’t mean that a slightly different profile wouldn’t be a very competitive product. But the ideal profile is what you’re describing.
Operator: Our next question is from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank.
Robyn Karnauskas: Just one on hep C and one on the pipeline. So we're hearing a lot about volume and there's been some volume restrictions by payers this year, and just trying to get a sense when you've been negotiating, what do you think the volume restriction is or how much do you think the volume -- the number of patients the system can handle this year? Are your contracts incorporating any volume restrictions by fibrosis score? And then the second question is on TNF and IL-17, a lot of excitement in the field. Trying to get a sense of when we will get the next data update? And we've seen very good data on IL-17. Do you expect to have better response rates or would this just work for a dual population that had dual symptoms for psoriasis and RA? 
Rick Gonzalez: Hi Robin, this is Rick. So let me address your first question. As I mentioned in my comments about the four tenants that we operated with our contracting strategy, obviously one of those was access. And we believe strongly that opening up access for all patients regardless of fibrosis score is something that's positive for patients. So certainly as we approached our contracting strategy we offered the greatest benefit to those plans that were willing to do that. Not every plan is willing to do that. I would give as an example Express Scripts a lot of credit for their willingness to open up access. And so they vary by plan. Some are completely open, that’s zero to F4, some are F2 to F4, some are just F3 and F$. So there is quite good variability across the plans as to how they are proceeding with that, but certainly that was something that we pursued with each and every one of the of the payers that we tried to contract with.
Mike Severino: Okay so this is Mike. With respect to TNF and IL-17, I think you’re referring to our program ABT 122 which uses our dual variable domain technology, so a single biologics that blocks the action of those two important cytokines. When you look at that the spectrum of activity of agents targeted against the cytokines, one can see very real potential in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and in particular psoriatic arthritis. The IL17 as we have seen have very pronounced efficacy in skin disease in psoriasis. But the TNF mechanism remains the most highly active in our opinion in psoriatic arthritis. So we have the agent that I described in substantial phase 2 studies, in rheumatoid arthritis and in psoriatic arthritis and those will be progressing over the course of this year and the next and will provide data updates as appropriate.
Operator: Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley 
David Risinger: Yes, thanks very much and thank you for all the detailed comments on HCV. That is very helpful. Just a couple questions. First, could you just provide some more color on the 25 state Medicaid group and how investors should think about the news and specifically what your contract states and what the implications are across those 25 state Medicaid organizations? Second, with respect to ABT-199 data in 17p and filing, could you provide some updates on the timing of both of those? And then, finally, in the past, you provided HUMIRA sales by indication. If you could provide a breakdown of 2014 sales again by indication, that would be great?
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick. We’re in the process of continuing to work with that group so I don’t think it is appropriate that we talk and in detail. There was a public announcement on one of them but the rest of them are still in process and we’re just not in a position to be able to give you a lot more information on that, as they’re finalized my guess is that they will provide some color to their members and through that process you will get some visibility to it but we’re just not in a position where it would be prudent for us to give you that information right now.  With respect 199 were expecting to see data from our study in refractory relapsed CLL in patients with 17p del mutation in the first half of this year. And when we have this data in hand, we will discuss them with regulatory agencies and assuming we see maintenance of effect size that was observed in early trials, and regulatory agencies agree, we would expect to move to a filing in that indication later on this year.  And in terms of the mix David, right now globally we’d estimate that RA is approaching 40% of the sales mix. Derm is about 15%, gastro is about 25% and then other would be the remainder. That would be akylosing spondylitis and the other psoriatic arthritis etc. Indications.
Operator: Our next question is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Colin Bristow: Hey, guys, thanks for squeezing me in. The commentary on hep C over the last 12 months has clearly highlighted the payer sensitivity to high-cost drugs in therapeutic areas. I'm just curious what gives you confidence that HUMIRA won't face an aggressive headwinds posed by a similar entry given the size of this asset? And then just a quick one; additional one on HUMIRA in the additional indications such as HS, how much off-label use is already occurring in the indication? 
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick. Let me cover the payer comment. Obviously we have had lots of experience in interacting with payers with HUMIRA and this class there’s a lot of competition that already exist in the class and obviously we’ve been tremendously successful in securing strong positions with payers in the United States with HUMIRA. With the entry of a potential biosimilar at some point in the future, as I said many times before, I don’t see the competitive dynamics changing dramatically from where they are now. I also don’t necessarily agree that the precedent that occurred in hepatitis C changes the competitive dynamics in any way from the way it was prior to that despite a fair amount of rhetoric that has come out over the last month or so. The thing that’s important to remember in a chronic used drug, that’s different, is you have large groups of patients that are on drug, well-controlled. This is a class where when you move patients from one drug to another, not necessarily all patients do well, and has to be switched again, and so there are different dynamics, different competitive dynamics in each class. In oncology I would tell you, it has very different dynamics. Hepatitis C here you have two products that have tremendous performance and you have basically a product that cures patients is used for a relatively short period of time. Those are different dynamics than you see in many other areas. So, I don't think you can draw a strong correlation from one to the other. Having said that I'm sure one and if biosimilar competition comes along, it will be another opportunity to be able to work with and negotiate with Managed Care organizations and we'd anticipated that in our planning assumptions as we look at our long range plan. Off late we'll use on HS, you know I would tell you I just came back from a European meeting where we brought in a number of HS patients. And the first thing I'll tell you is, it's obviously a disease that most people including myself didn't know a lot about. What struck me is how debilitating this disease really is for these patients and how little therapy there is or knowledge of alternatives that are available out there. And so I would tell you that I think there is probably very-very little use of HUMIRA in a HS today and I think when we launch, when we get approval one of the things we're focussing a lot of attention on will be education of physicians in order to know that there is an available therapy for these patients. And so, I would think it was tiny, if anything at all at this point.  Thanks, Colin. Alright. Operator, we have time for one more question please. 
Operator: Our final question today is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei: On Hep C, what is your estimate for the number of genotype 1 patients treated in 2014 and your expectation for how many are likely to be treated in 2015? Clearly, the size of the pool has a meaningful impact on you. Could you also comment on the early impact of REMICADE biosimilar in Europe and whether you expect this to be a major factor this year as it enters more markets? And then, finally, I just wanted to clarify and make sure I heard this right. The Fx positive impact on gross margin was 2% this quarter and maybe 1% next year. Could you just please remind us of that again? 
Bill Chase: Alex, let me start with the Fx. In the quarter it was 200 basis points. Our guidance in 2015 is an improvement on 100 basis points and that has no effects on it whatsoever. So, we think we can drive that 100 basis point purely through operational efficiencies that we've been committed to over the last couple of years as well as product mix. What I did say was if current exchange rates continued, simple math given that our bottom line is greatly protected from those winds, if the current rates continued it'd have the effect of actually increasing the profile above that 100 basis points. But that basically just math along through as you have a headwind on the topline that we are protecting the bottomline from.
Rick Gonzalez: On HCV genotype 1 patients, you know obviously that is one of the parameters that we were carefully watching as it plays out. We are assuming that we'll see a significant increase in patient access going forward and therefore in the U.S. we'll see more patients treated. I think a reasonable range to think about would be something in the range of may be a 175,000 patients to as much as may be low 200's to 10 to 15 something in that range. Obviously, based on our planning assumptions we've bracketed between those numbers and that's one of the reasons why we don't want to come out with a 2015 number, because we need to see how that plays out. We build obviously a certain base level number into our guidance they were comfortable with. It may end up being more than that going forward. But that's at least our view of what it looks like. On [Rentia] I mean thus far we haven't see a lot of impact, one difference is in European markets self-injectables are treated differently than infusion products, so it doesn't necessarily impact HUMIRA directly in very many markets, I'd say it's tracking for the most part very consistent with what our modelling assumptions were for its level of success and you know we watched that carefully over a period of time and it's proceeding as we would have got. So, we are not assuming that will have any material impact on us in 2015.

Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Third 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. (Operator Instructions). This call is being recorded by AbbVie. I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Larry Peepo: Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the question-and-answer portion of the call are Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President Business Development, External Affairs and General Counsel, and Mike Severino, Executive Vice President of R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Before we get started, I’ll remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie’s operations is included in our 2013 Annual other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today’s conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we’ll take your questions. So, And with that I’ll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Larry. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. During today’s call, I’ll spend a few minutes on our strong results in the quarter as well as our performance since we launched as an independent company. I’ll also discuss our pipeline advancement including forthcoming data and other milestones. I’ll then turn the call over to Bill who will provide additional color regarding the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We’ll also make sure we leave enough time for your questions. Since launching AbbVie 22 months ago, we are focused on driving strong performance, creating shareholder value and building a robust pipeline to derive future growth. To that end, we have delivered a total shareholder return of more than 90%, representing $40 billion of shareholder value creation. Today, we reported robust third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.89, significantly exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. This included operational sales growth of more than 8%, also ahead of our outlook for the quarter. We drove this performance with double-digit growth across a number of products including, HUMIRA, Synagis, Synthroid, Duodopa and Creon. In the quarter, we also delivered improvements in gross margin and continued to invest in the business for future growth. And for the second time this year, we significantly raised our full-year EPS guidance range for 2014, reflecting the robust performance of our underlying business and positive trends we expect through the remainder of the year. This guidance reflects EPS growth for 2014 despite the headwinds created by the loss of exclusivity in our lipids franchise. Our results demonstrate the strength and sustainability of our portfolio and they underscore our continued focus and execution. Our third quarter results were led by HUMIRA, which delivered, nearly 18% global operational growth. HUMIRA’s performance was driven by several factors including continued market growth resulting from increasing penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies. As we’ve indicated in the past, HUMIRA’s broad label and new indications are a competitive advantage. We recently reported positive results from our Phase 3 studies of HUMIRA in HS, a chronic inflammatory skin disease that currently has no approved treatment options. We’re on track to submit our U.S. and European regulatory applications for HS this year. We’ve also spent the last several years, developing and implementing a strategy that we believe will protect and grow our leadership position in immunology including product enhancements and intellectual property. And behind HUMIRA we have a number of promising immunology assets and development. As a result, we are confident in our strategies to defend our position across our immunology categories. Our interferon-free HCV therapy represents another exciting vehicle for strong growth. We’re on the cusp of approval with the regulatory reviews progressing very well. We’re actively engaged with regulators on various fronts and have completed our pre-approval manufacturing and clinical inspections. As we said at a healthcare conference last month, we do not expect that an advisory committee meeting will be required prior to U.S. approval. In anticipation of U.S. commercialization by year-end and European approval in early 2015, we’ve built the appropriate infrastructure and are fully prepared for our launch. Our next generation HCV program also continues to progress well. We’re currently conducting Phase 2b studies and expect to transition the Phase 3 development in 2015. Beyond HCV, we have a robust pipeline of promising development programs. These programs stand especially therapeutic areas and include both biologics and small molecules. All told, we have more than 40 active clinical development programs underway, this includes 12 products in Phase 3 development or currently under regulatory review. We have a high level of enthusiasm in our oncology pipeline, which includes 10 new molecular entities being studied in more than 55 clinical trials. In collaboration with Roche, we will present additional data on ABT-199 at an upcoming medical meeting, including Phase 1 data on AML and early data from a trial combining ABT-199 with Gazyva. We’ll also see data from a large single-agent study in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17-p dilution in early 2015. As a reminder, if the data warn and regulatory authorities agree to ABT-199, addresses an unmet medical need in this patient population. These data have the potential to support an early pathway to registration. Veliparib is our PARP inhibitor in development for a wide range of solid tumors. Over the past year, we have initiated four pivotal studies. This includes Phase 3 trials in neoadjuvant breast cancer BRCA breast cancer and most recently two studies in non-small cell lung cancer than include patients with squamous and non-squamous cancers. We’re also excited about ABT-414, our anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody drug conjugate being evaluated in combination with Chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. We were recently granted orphaned drug designation for ABT-414 by the EMA and FDA. And we are moving aggressively to start a Phase 2 study in patients with GBM by early next year. Also on our late stage development on Oncology pipeline is elotuzumab in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb for multiple myeloma. Results from the pivotal trial in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients are expected in early 2015. Our late stage neuroscience pipeline includes daclizumab and Duopa. Daclizumab is in development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Despite advances in the MS category, there continues to be a significant need for novel, high-efficacy agents with favorable benefit risk profiles. And we believe Daclizumab has the potential to be an important therapy in this large and growing market. We presented promising pivotal trial data earlier this year, which demonstrated patients treated with daclizumab had a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapse rates versus Avonex. We have begun to engage with global regulatory authorities and are working with our partner to complete our regulatory applications in the first half of 2015. Duopa, is AbbVie’s novel therapy for advanced Parkinson’s disease. It is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. with an FDA action expected in early 2015. Elagolix is our compound in Phase 3 development for endometriosis and Phase 2b for uterine fibroids. We continue to expect to see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies in endometriosis later this year and plan to report top line data shortly thereafter. We also see data from the mid-stage program in uterine fibroids next year as well. As I mentioned, we have a number of promising immunology assets in development, including oral selective JAK1 inhibitors, several biologics and two by specific biologics currently in mid-stage trials. We expect to see data from the selective JAK1 inhibitors next year, allowing us to make a decision regarding Phase 3 development. In summary, we delivered excellent performance in the quarter and our pipeline continues to evolve. We’re on the verge of a number of important milestones including the commercialization of our interferon-free HCV combination and we’re prepared for a successful launch. AbbVie is poised to deliver top-tier performance including strong sales and earnings growth beginning in 2015. We have a high degree of confidence in our strategy and our performance. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for a more detailed view of our results. Bill?
Bill Chase: Thank you, Rick. This morning I’ll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2014. This was another very strong quarter for AbbVie as we exceeded our guidance on both the top and bottom line. Total sales increased 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding 0.5% on favorable impact from foreign exchange. HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.2 billion up 17.8% operationally and up 17.5% on a reported basis. In the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 25.3% driven by continued market expansion, strong prescription trends and share gains partially offset by a reduction in retail buying patterns. Internally, HUMIRA sales grew 10.3% on an operational basis excluding a 0.6% unfavorable impact from exchange. International growth was driven by strong underlying trends including the uptake of new indications and share gains but was partially offset by the timing of shipments in international markets. We continue to see double-digit market growth for HUMIRA in most international markets. Certainly we are well on track to significantly exceed our original full-year guidance for HUMIRA. AndroGel sales were $232 million, down 6.7% from the prior year quarter. We continue to see a notable slowdown in the market with overall prescriptions down significantly. However, we did gain share from competitors during the quarter and benefited somewhat from favorable pricing trends. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $200 million, up 24.3% year-over-year. Synthroid maintained strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. The overall market has experienced low-single digit growth with Synthroid growth outpacing the market including product pricing trends. Global Lupron sales were $196 million in the quarter, up 0.4% on an operational basis. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintain significant share of the market. U.S. CREON sales were $148 million in the quarter, up 47.6%. CREON maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where the product continues to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. Growth in the quarter benefited from a favorable comparison to the prior year quarter. Sales of Synagis were $109 million in the third quarter up 18.3% on an operational basis. Synagis which protects at risk infants from severe respiratory disease is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Growth in the quarter was driven by continued product uptake and strong commercial execution. Sales of Duodopa on our therapy for advanced Parkinson’s disease approved in Europe and other international markets were $56 million, up 20.8% on an operational basis this quarter. Performance is in line with recent trends as well as our full year outlook for the product. And sales in our lipid franchise were down significantly due to generic competition. We expect these trends to continue for the remainder of 2014. I’ll now turn to the P&L profile for the third quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 81.1% somewhat above our expectations and up 140 basis points year-over-year. This reflects the loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise offset by favorable mix impacts across the portfolio as well as and margin enhancing initiatives we’ve implemented. Adjusted SG&A was 26.4% of sales in the third quarter, up more than 9% year-over-year reflecting continued investment in our growth brands and preparations for our upcoming HCV launch. Adjusted R&D was 16.2% of sales in the third quarter up more than 14% versus the prior year quarter. As expected our absolute R&D investment was up sequentially over the second quarter as we increased funding of our mid and late stage pipeline assets and additional HUMIRA indications. Adjusted net interest expense was $53 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.4% in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $0.89 well above our previous guidance range of $0.77 to $0.79. On a GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.31. You will recall that in early September we updated our third quarter and full year GAAP EPS guidance to reflect upfront payments related to the infinity and calico agreements which were treated as specified items. Also in accordance with the final regulations issued to the pharmaceutical industry in the third quarter by the IRS, AbbVie has booked an additional year of its branded prescription drug fee which we have treated as a specified item. By way of background, starting in 2011, the pharma industry was acquired under the affordable care act to begin paying a fee based on branded prescription drugs sold to the U.S. government. During the third quarter of this year, the IRS issued final regulations which changed the recognition of the fee from the period in which the fee was paid to the period for which the fee is owed. As a result, the industry is now required from an accounting perspective to recognize in 2014 one additional year of the fee. There is no cash flow impact of this one-time adjustment. Due to the timing of the termination of the Shire transaction, the majority of one-time costs related to that event were reflected in our fourth quarter results. Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year, this morning we significantly raised our adjusted EPS guidance for 2014. We now expect adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.25 to $3.27. As a reminder, our 2014 outlook continues to exclude any potential revenue from the expected 2014 U.S. launch of our HCV therapy. Our revised GAAP guidance for the year includes the full impact of the Shire transaction costs. Given our strong product performance, we now expect sales to exceed $19.5 billion in 2014. We’re forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 79% for the year reflecting product mix and actions we’ve taken to further improve our margin profile. We expect full year R&D expense to be somewhat above 16% of sales as we continue to advance our late stage pipeline. And we expect SG&A expense of around 27% of sales in 2014. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $250 million for the full year, and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate just above 22%. As you know, our business generates significant cash flow and we expect this to grow in 2015 and beyond with new product introductions. As a result, we announced last week that AbbVie’s quarterly dividend will be increased by more than 16% to $0.49 beginning with the dividend payable in February 2015. We intend to maintain our strong commitment to a growing dividend going forward. And we disclosed a new $5 billion share buyback program to be executed over the next several years, further reflecting our commitment to return cash to shareholders. So, overall, we’re very pleased with our strong third quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2014. And with that I’ll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Bill. We’ll now open the call for questions. Elon, we’ll take our first question please.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from Chris Schott from JMPC.
Chris Schott – JPMC: Great. Thanks very much for the questions. First one for Rick, operationally AbbVie seems to be obviously firing on all cylinders here. But with the Shire deal you highlighted the potential for greater access to your cash flow as well as the diversification that deal would bring. So on those two topics, first can you talk about your access to cash flow and your ability to deploy capital on an ongoing basis with your current tax structure and the recent dividend increase? And then second on the business development side, what is the sense of urgency at this point to further diversify AbbVie? And can you give us any color on the range of M&A options you are considering. I guess specifically should we think of Shire as a one-off or would the company still consider pursuing large-cap acquisitions? Thanks very much.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Hi Chris, it’s Rick. I think this question has come up a couple of times now since the termination of the Shire agreement and in the backdrop of the Shire agreement. And so, I think it’s important to put it in perspective and important to acknowledge that at the outset, there are certain attributes of the Shire transaction that made it unique and out of the normal course of our M&A strategy. I’d say specifically the potential for inversion is only offered with target selections of very significant size and the benefit of inversion allowed for an acquisition price that was obviously higher. So, I think one of the things that you must remember as we approach the opportunity with Shire was against the backdrop of where was AbbVie overall, because I think that’s an important perspective to keep in mind. And if you think about the prospects of our business, they were never brighter than it were when we approached the Shire transaction. We’ve cleared most of our significant LOE events, our growth brands are exhibiting extremely strong growth, particularly HUMIRA, we build a deep, mid and late stage pipeline with several potential blockbusters which we believe will allow us to drive top-tier EPS growth starting in ‘15 and beyond, HCV is a good example of that, 199 is a good example of that, Daclizumab is a good example of that and there were many more. And while I think it’s fair to ask a question as our strategy, our M&A strategy changed following the Shire affair, I think it’s also important to acknowledge that we’re a company that’s in even stronger position today than we were before we announced this deal. Today’s earnings show that very clearly, the base business is running stronger than our guidance at the beginning of the year suggested to us. We have a much better idea of the size of the HCV market and our potential to stake out a significant position in that market. We’ve had positive data readouts on DAC 888, 199 continues to perform well. And we’ve continued to be active in the L&A front. So, there are no development really that have happened to our business, in fact any development that’s happened has actually been a positive development. They don’t leave us with a tremendous amount of confidence that we can drive the level of performance that we have projected and the level of performance that we need going forward from 2015 with our base strategy. Which brings me to M&A. If you look at our cash flow and our ability to access that cash flow, we clearly have the where with all to be active in the M&A front. What’s more is we have a track record in our ability and our willingness to pursue and acquire attractive assets, assuming two things, it makes strategic sense and they have a good financial return. That’s essentially the criteria that we use. We’ve always said that our highest priority for our cash is to deploy it to further grow the business and make the business more and more healthy going forward. And I think you’re going to expect us to continue to do exactly that, deploying cash to acquire attractive on-market and pipeline assets to further enhance our growth. But what I don’t think is that we absolutely have an imperative to one out and do another $50 billion deal, in fact I would tell you, we don’t have that imperative. And it’s unlikely that we would do another $50 billion deal. As I said before, Shire is a unique opportunity based on a number of different factors, some of which don’t exist in the same way as they did before. So, the underlying growth prospects for AbbVie don’t require us to do a transaction that size. I’d also say we’re not going to limit ourselves to what we do. We look at individual products, we look at mid-size companies and we look at larger companies. And we’re going to continue to do that and continue to look for those opportunities that strategically fit and give us a strong financial return. And we’ll deploy our capital accordingly. The other thing I’d say is, we have always committed that we’ll return cash to shareholders and that’s a commitment that we’ve made as part of our cash, which I used to do that here recently with the dividend increase and the buyback program. Those are the two priorities for the cash. The cash isn’t trapped, obviously we have access to the cash for offshore acquisitions, we have access to the cash if we choose to repatriate it. Obviously, we have an incentive to look outside the U.S. first if we choose to, but we have total flexibility as it relates to our cash.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Chris. Elon, we’ll take our next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Can you all hear me all right?
Bill Chase: We sure can.
Rick Gonzalez: Yes.
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Congratulations on a terrific quarter.
Bill Chase: Thanks.
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: This is either for Rick or Bill. Clearly 2015 is shaping up to be a huge year. I think 2014 turned out to be a much bigger year that you or anybody else anticipated just given the profitability of the base business. But 2015 is really shaping up to be a very big year with the hep C launch. But as we move out beyond 2015 post the HCV launch, can you comment on the pace of earnings growth? Obviously with bio-similar competition towards the end of the decade for HUMIRA that is going to have an impact on your earnings growth. But will 2015 be a one-off year, or how should we think about the pace of earnings growth going forward? And then a second question for you, Rick. We have a lot more information now about the hep C market. We now know the pricing of the new Gilead combo. We’ve seen the spectacular initial launches of Sovaldi. Can you comment on how I think early at one point you talked about achieving a 20% market share in this massive market, can you refresh us on your expectations just given how much more information we have now? Thanks very much.
Rick Gonzalez: Well Jami, this is Rick. So, first I’d say on the expectations for ‘15 and beyond, obviously we’re not going to give guidance out multiple years. But I think I can frame it this way for you. If you look at what we expect to be able to deliver out of our pipeline including HCV and other assets like 199, we have a high level of confidence that we can continue to drive strong growth over the long-term. As far as the bio-similar impact is concerned, obviously that’s something we have looked at and we have carefully analyzed and we’ve had now a number of years to put a strategy in place that we believe will protect in HUMIRA, through that period of time. And so we’ve obviously modeled what that looks like and I can tell you we have confidence in what we can do in that area. I’m not going to give you a lot more specifics on that at this point. We’ve described in detail what it looks like it is a combination of three major areas, product enhancements, both, formulation as well as device, intellectual property and commercial strategies. And this is a market we understand well. And as I said, I think we have planned this out very well. And I think we have a high level of confidence in our ability to be able to execute that strategy in the face of bio-similar competition. There will be a time where we can give you more color I know this isn’t very satisfying to you. There will be a time where we can give you more color this just is not the time to be able to do that. We have to make sure that we have planned this out appropriately. And so, in the future we will be able to give you a little more detail around that. As it relates to Hepatitis C, what I would tell you is this. If you look at the Hep C market and HCV for us, it’s a very exciting opportunity. And I would tell you it’s a very important opportunity for AbbVie. So, let me say, in the backdrop of we’re getting very close to entering the U.S. market once we’re approved, it wouldn’t be prudent for us to provide a lot of specific details around our commercial strategy or go-to-market strategy. But what I can do is I think frame for you, how we think about the competition in the marketplace, how we think about the marketplace. I’m not going to provide an expectation at this point but I’ll give you some perspective I think. As we said many times before, we believe the clinical performance of our product across all patient types is very strong. And it’s especially strong in the psoriatic and difficult to treat patients. And we believe that will be an important factor in how we compete in the marketplace. We believe relapse rates and SPRs are important. We still don’t believe that minor differences in pill count or shorter duration of therapy in certain patients will significantly change the competitive dynamics in this marketplace. In fact I tell you, in our interactions with many KOLs, they indicate that they’re going with 12 weeks of therapy in patients to minimize the risk of relapse in those patients. As far as the market is concerned to the point you made, we see the market as being even more attractive than we thought about it a year ago. It’s certainly bigger than we thought, it’s far more receptive to high curate therapies that are highly tolerable and the market wants alternatives, that’s clear. So, I can tell you, we feel very good about our ability to compete in this market and create meaningful share for our product. As I said, I’m not going to go through a lot of specifics around the commercial strategy until we’ve launched. Last thing I’d say is, as you know, the 2014 guidance we provided excludes any HCV revenues. So, it’s not counting on any HCV revenues, whenever we get an HCV we’ll obviously be upside. But certainly when we provide 2015 guidance and product specific detail, at that point we will provide you with what our expectation is for HCV for 2015. Thanks.
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: Thanks.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Jami, our next question please Elon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: Yes. Thanks very much. So I missed a little bit of the call. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions about some of the select product upside. I guess specifically maybe you could just make an overall comment on whether inventory levels changed at AbbVie between the end of the second quarter and the end of the third quarter, i.e. was there a buy-in or buy-out for the company overall? And then second, were there any buy-ins for any select products of note? And then third, with respect to Kaletra ex-U.S., I don’t know if you commented but that was unusually strong. Could you just explain that revenue number in the quarter and what we should think about for the fourth quarter head sequentially? Thank you.
Bill Chase: David, its Bill Chase. So, inventory I’ll discuss in really two different pieces. You’ve got inventory at wholesalers and then obviously you’ve got inventory in the retail chain. At the wholesale level, our inventories across all products in the U.S. was roughly consistent between quarter two and quarter three. The retail channels are little tougher to call as you know. In Q2, we did see some speculative buying in advance of the price increase around HUMIRA. We think some of that buying came out in Q3, although obviously it didn’t mute the overall performance of the brand to a meaningful extent. But in general, at the wholesale level everything was consistent quarter-to-quarter. From a Kaletra ex-U.S. standpoint, that product is subject to some volatility based on tender timing. And you saw that in the third quarter. I think in the long-term outlook for this brand is probably somewhat negative from a single digit standpoint. So, I think what you’re really seeing in Q3 was the anomaly of tenders internationally.
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: Got it. Thank you.
Larry Peepo: Thanks David. Elon, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Goodman from UBS.
Mark Goodman – UBS: Yes, I was hoping you could give us a flavor for how much of the, pre-spend for the HCV launch is already showing up in the quarter here? And how much additional we should be expecting in the fourth quarter and the first quarter? And then second, if you could just go through what data we will be seeing at ASH?
Bill Chase: So Mark, Bill Chase. We’re not going to get into specific details on how much of the HCV investment we’ve put in. Sufficed to say, we have obviously begun spending this year and you should expect that spending to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter and that’s been reflected in the profile guidance we’ve given.
Mark Goodman – UBS: Change in sales force, has that started already?
Bill Chase: Excuse me.
Mark Goodman – UBS: Sales force?
Bill Chase: We are all ready to go on HCV. We’re just waiting approval.
Mark Goodman – UBS: So that is already reflected in the third quarter?
Bill Chase: It is.
Mike Severino: On your question regarding ASH, this is Mike Severino, I’ll take the question regarding ASH. There is going to be a number of important presentations on ABT-199 or BCL-2 inhibitor. This includes initial single-agent data in AML. And we’ll also provide a number of updates on our ongoing earlier studies, and update on our Rituxan plus 199 Study in CLL, including an update on patients who have stopped therapy. And we’re going to have first data on Chemo combination study bendamustine plus Rituxan plus 199 in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in DLBCL. And there will be a number of other updates including 199 and GA-101, and CLL from early phase studies.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Mark. Elon, we’ll take our next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
Jeff Holford – Jefferies: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So just on your HCV program you mentioned do you expect to bring a new – at any point into your next-generation program and give us any updates on how you think you might go about that if that is the case? Secondly around margins, other results of some of the cost savings you would’ve looked at as part of the Shire transaction going forward, did you see any opportunities in the base business going forward that you can look at for further margin enhancement? And then just lastly, this will be for Rick, of course, are you concerned that by highlighting your underlying tax situation that you could have potentially made the company vulnerable to a takeover by a foreign company going forward? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: So, Mike, why don’t you cover the first question?
Mike Severino: Sure. This is Mike Severino. With respect to our plans with hep C, we feel very good about both our current generation hep C program and our next-generation hep C program which is advancing very nicely to the clinic. We’re currently in Phase 2b studies with our next generation program. Back in mind is our next-generation protease inhibitor and our next-generation NS5A inhibitor. Things are progressing very well. We’re going to continue to evaluate these data as they roll-out and we’ll be providing updates and appropriate scientific settings over the course of the next year. We’re always looking at promising mechanisms in our early discovery efforts and we’ll continue to evaluate those efforts in light of the clinical results as described as well. Overall though, I feel very good the progress we’re making in hep C. And I think we’re going to have a compelling offering with first generation and it’s an area that we’re committed and it’s an area that we’ll remain active.
Bill Chase: Jeff, on cost savings, yes, I can tell you this is an organization that has always been focused on driving cost out of the business. I think you can see that to an extent on the progress we’ve made on gross margin. And certainly we keep our eye open for those things all the time. I think in 2015, if you look at some drivers behind the business, the dynamics trend favorably for operating margin expansion. Obviously the TriCor/Trilipix LOE event is fully behind us at that point. You’re seeing the efficiency efforts play out on gross margin. And we would obviously expect a strong positive impact of the HCV launch which offers both a high gross margin as well as SG&A profile improvement. So, too early to get into a specific operating margin number for you for next year, but I’m confident we’re going to have a nice story to tell on this when we get into it next year.
Rick Gonzalez: And on your question about potentially being a takeover target, let me address it this way. If you look at our situation about offshore cash, we’re certainly not unique in our industry in fact I’d say we’re pretty consistent with how our industry tends to operate. So I don’t know that we flagged anything in the process. But essentially I’d tell you that our goal as a company is to stay a strong sustainable independent company. We’ve demonstrated that we can drive strong shareholder value you see that in the GSR that we’ve delivered, you see that in our market cap. So I can tell you my focus is on driving the business at top-tier performance, building out a robust pipeline and delivering strong returns to shareholders. My philosophy is if you do that well, the market will reward you both in your PE as well as your market cap. And that’s the focus that we have for the business and that’s what we pay attention to going forward.
Jeff Holford – Jefferies: Thanks very much.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Jeff. Elon, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.
Colin Bristow – Bank of America: Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Just on hep C, arguably you’re most competitive versus Harvoni in the treatment experience cirrhotics with the TURQUOISE-II data. Given your excluded prior protease inhibitor patients, how should we be thinking about this from a labeling perspective and can tell you help us quantify the size of this population? And then just a little more on the label. I know it is hard but how confident are you that you can get a 12-week label in the treatment experience cirrhotics and how important is this for you from a commercial perspective? It seems like the FDA has a very high bar for the SVR sacrifice versus duration of therapy? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: We’re in the midst right now of dialog with the agency over labeling so we’re not going to, it’s not just appropriate to talk about a lot of the specifics that we’re talking through with them. I can tell you, we feel comfortable with our data set in cirrhotics and across all the other patients. We certainly feel comfortable when we look at our 12-week and 24-week data in cirrhotics, both have excellent SVR performance. And so, we don’t feel at all uncomfortable with the direction that our labeling is going in. PI failures.
Mike Severino: Yes. Treatment, this is Mike Severino, treatment regimens are obviously evolving considerably. I think that I would point to the overall breadth of our data both in cirrhotics and outside of cirrhotics, we feel very good with our profile we have, very high SVR, very high cure rates. And again, we feel very good about the profile that we see. I think that’s probably it.
Colin Bristow – Bank of America: Thanks a lot.
Larry Peepo: Okay. Thanks Colin. Next question Elon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei – BMO Capital Markets: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Bill, could you please build on your earlier comments about gross margin. What specifically are these margin-enhancing initiatives that you are referring to? And is this what we can expect going forward because we would only expect gross margin going up with hep C? And a follow-up, could you please give us an update about your efforts to simplify your current hep C regimen with fewer pills, please? Thank you.
Bill Chase: So, Alex, regarding the gross margin, there are a couple of things are in play on that line. First and foremost as you know we have obviously lost TriCor/Trilipix which had a higher than average gross margin than the corporate rate. So that’s some headwind we’ve actually been facing over the last couple of years. And you can see we’ve negotiated that nicely. Offsetting that there has been a couple of things. First of all, there is an impact of product mix in pricing. But equally important there have been efforts that we’ve put in place to reduce cost and that could be manufacturing cost, supply chain cost as well as of course to address some of our royalty burden on HUMIRA as well. And you’re seeing some of that play out this year. Next year obviously with HCV coming online, we would expect that to have a gross margin that would be higher than the corporate mix. And HUMIRA obviously has been performing very, very nicely as well and that ought to have a benefit on that line item as well.
Rick Gonzalez: Alex, this is Rick. You kind of broke off when you said the last question, but I think what you asked was what are we doing to work on simplifying the regimen for HCV, is that what you asked?
Alex Arfaei – BMO Capital Markets: That is correct, yes.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Well, let me start with what I commented on before. We don’t believe the difference in pill burden is going to be a competitive disadvantage. So, first and foremost I’d tell you that. The second thing is we are working on some ways to be able to simplify our regimen with the current generation and that has continued to progress well. Next generation obviously has significant simplification associated with it as well, and that would be advancement as well. So, we have an active program in both areas to move it forward. We’re not at a point where we want to talk a lot about it beyond that but we are working on ways to simplify the regimen and continue to make sure that we’re advancing the regimen. This is a market that I can tell you we’re absolutely committed to for the long-term. And obviously we’re investing in a way to be able to continue to sustain our position in the market.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Alex. Next question please Elon.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.
Mark Schoenebaum – ISI Group: Hi guys, thanks a lot for taking the question.
Larry Peepo: Sure.
Mark Schoenebaum – ISI Group: Number one, do you guys happen to have data out there in the hep C it around how many patients are actually under the active care of a treating specialist, that is a data point that one of your competitors historically has provided and declined to provide in the most recent quarter, just wondering if you have a view on that? And then number two on hep C, have you generated yet any data for your regimen in Victrelis or Incivek failures? And then finally on HUMIRA, could you just give us the year-on-year price versus volume change please? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Thanks Mark. As far as the data of the number of patients under active care was specialist, I’m assuming you’re talking about hepatologists and infectious disease specialists. Our people know that but to be honest with you, I don’t know that number. Does anybody else in the room know that number?
Bill Chase: Yes, I don’t think we have that on for you Mark.
Rick Gonzalez: So, maybe as a follow-up we’ll try to provide that. I can tell you that as we’ve geared up commercially, we obviously believe that it’s important and I’ve seen the numbers that a significant percentage of the patients are under the care of specialists. But I’d also tell you that based on the massive number of GI specialists, that’s also an important commercial channel to cover. And we have scaled our sales force to cover both aspects of it, both specialists as well as GI physicians as well. But I don’t remember Mark, the actual split between the two.
Bill Chase: Mark on HUMIRA, you really have a tail of really two different markets. In the U.S. we have typically been able to take some price along with the category. And if you really look at volume trend, script trends, which this quarter we’re very, very strong. You can pretty much get back to the 25.3% growth on the quarter by looking at that strong TRX and really reconciling it back to the price increases we’ve taken this year. Ex-U.S., we typically see negative price so actually that’s primarily more than 100% volume. On a total brand basis, yes, I think you can think of price this quarter netting out in the mid single-digits and the rest being volumes.
Mark Schoenebaum – ISI Group: And the PI failures?
Mike Severino: This is Mike Severino, with respect to data on PI failures, those aren’t data that we’ve generated yet, something that we would look at and maybe do it in the future.
Mark Schoenebaum – ISI Group: Thanks a lot.
Larry Peepo: All right, thanks Mark.
Operator: And our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala – Cowen & Company: Thank you. I have two questions. First on hep C, AbbVie would appear to have a potential competitive advantage in the sickest patients where treatment to 12 weeks might be necessary and I know that AbbVie isn’t going to reveal pricing today. But given this possible competitive advantage, what are reasons that AbbVie would not price at a premium? Maybe you can provide at least one reason why AbbVie wouldn’t price at a premium? And then second, a bit of a broader issue, AbbVie has done a terrific job maintaining HUMIRA’S position as the leading TNF despite very similar competitive products and very high price points. It seems that your competitors that sell basal insulins and inhaled asthma products could have learned from your strategies. But as managed care seems to be rotating among the big therapeutic categories and attempting to extract price, why won’t we see this happen in TNFs? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay, this is Rick. I’ll try to answer two questions. Although I would say your first question basically asks me about our pricing strategy which I’m not going to go into any detail. But what I would say to you is, we looked very carefully at the overall market how our products would be positioned in that market, our ability to be able to take share. And we’ve come up with the strategy that we believe optimizes our ability to take a meaningful share position. We’ve looked at alternatives that were different, some of which similar to what you described and some of which weren’t similar to what you described. And so, we’ve come up with what our commercial strategy will be and we’re going to execute that upon launch of the product and the approval of the product. And at that point we’ll provide you more color. On HUMIRA and payer actions, what I would tell you is this we’ve competed in this market for a long-long time. Obviously in the U.S. market the payer component is a very critical component. In scenario where we have good relationships with payers, there have been lots of competitive entrants into this market. And I take predictions of HUMIRA’s market share erosion and that hasn’t occurred. And it’s partially because if you look at the product and its ability to be able to perform clinically, if you look at the breadth of the menu of applications and indications that it has, that plays a very important role. And so, I don’t see the payer dynamic changing significantly in anti-TNS going forward. This has been a competitive market for many years now. And we’ve done quite well in that market and there is always price pressure and you have to work through that in the appropriate way.
Larry Peepo: I would say Steve, this is Larry that we certainly feel good about how 2015 settles out for us with payers on HUMIRA.
Steve Scala – Cowen & Company: Thank you.
Larry Peepo: All right. Thanks Steve, next question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
Vamil Divan – Credit Suisse: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. A couple here. One, you recently announced this $5 billion buyback program. Can you just let us know if you’ve already started executing on that program and if so how much buybacks have you completed this quarter? I guess specifically I’m just wondering in terms of your – what your share count expectations might be that are baked into your new 2014 earnings guidance and is it a very different number from what we saw at the end of the third quarter? And the second one kind of following up on Chris’s question earlier on M&A. You talked about size, can you talk a little bit about maybe therapeutic areas that might be of a priority now, for example rare diseases where Shire is obviously strong? Is that an area in particular that you may wish to invest more? Any thoughts around areas of investment would be helpful. Thanks.
Bill Chase: So, Vamil, obviously the quarter is not done yet, the fourth quarter that is. We do intend to when the year finishes, you’ll see that we have repurchased shares that I can’t give you exact guidance on what that number is going to be at this point in time.
Rick Gonzalez: Vamil, on the M&A strategy, this is Rick. I mean, I think if you look at what our strategy is for AbbVie, we want to build leadership positions in specially focused areas. If you look at what we’re good at, what we’re really good at is taking products that have strong clinical data and the decision making process is driven around clinical data and being able to – be able to go out and commercialize that effectively. And so, we really have two primary goals, when we look at M&A. One is to build out those areas where we currently have leadership positions like immunology is an example. And other areas where we have leadership position, our goal is to try to restate standard care in those segments. And in many cases, we’re looking at multiple different mechanisms of action to be able to try to do that, standard of care restatement in the areas that we have leadership positions in. And then we have areas where we have emerging strengths where we want to build out leadership positions and expand more aggressively, oncology is a good example. 199 and we believe will create a good anchor position for us in that market. AAA, 414, we have a number of assets coming behind them. Certainly we would be interested in looking for more oncology assets. If there was the right kind of opportunity with on-market products in oncology and had some commercial infrastructure in place that would be attractive to us moving forward. Rare diseases, is certainly a profile of the specialty market. It’s consistent than what we look at. And I’d hepatology is the other area that would be of strong interest. I’m not giving you a complete list but I’m giving you sort of the top of mind areas that we focus on.
Bill Chase: Vamil, one other thing, Bill Chase again. Just in the event that you’re inferring something to your question. Our increase in the guidance for the year is purely based on the business fundamentals as we see them. We’re not anticipating that being significantly moved by our buyback activity, just wanted to be clear on that.
Vamil Divan – Credit Suisse: Okay. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Thanks Vamil, and Elon, we have time for one more question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from March Purcell from Barclays.
Mark Purcell – Barclays: Thanks for taking my question. On HUMIRA could you help us understand the benefit from the royalty roll-off in Q3 from the cessation of payments to Merck KGA I think was in June and how that schedule of roll-off changes going forward through the plan expiries in both U.S. and Europe? Secondly, could you help us understand the size of the international shipment timing effect for HUMIRA in terms of how much growth it took off the ex-U.S. sales? Third, the IL-17 is about to launch in psoriasis, I think it is about 15% of HUMIRA sales. Could you help us understand the impact you feel those will have, or otherwise, on your business for next year? And then lastly on debt $9 billion of long-term debt. Can you help us understand your plans to restructure that and that is with respect to potential capital employment going forward.
Bill Chase: So, Mark, on the dynamics in gross margin, I guess this is a simple way to think of that. We in the quarter had about 1-point headwind from related to TriCor/Trilipix LOE event. Obviously we made that up and then some. Our ability to make that up was driven probably somewhat equally by product mix and cost efficiency as well as including royalty – the royalty stack. I’m not going to get into specifics on how much that royalty stack impacted it. What I can tell you though is it’s not all royalty stack, we have a lot of activities going on right now, to streamline our supply chain and our overall manufacturing base. In terms of adds the same plays out over the LRP, we’ve never been specific on what the exact royalty stack is, some have estimated it’s between 5% and 10%. We’ve said those are good estimates. And one of the benefits of that royalty stack is, it will be largely removed at the point that we lose exclusivity on HUMIRA. So that’s an important upside to the product when we come to that point in time. In terms of the impact of international shipments on HUMIRA, obviously that puts some volatility quarter to quarter in the XUS HUMIRA number. This quarter it was about 1%, it wasn’t huge.
Rick Gonzalez: Debt question.
Bill Chase: From a debt perspective, what I would tell you is we’re pretty happy with our balance sheet right now. Obviously we’re building cash, we’re looking at ways to deploy that cash whether it be through M&A or giving it back to the shareholders as you’ve seen in our recent announcements. I don’t think there is any compelling reason to necessarily reduce the amount of debt on our balance sheet. So, as those maturities come up, obviously we’re looking to term those things up. But as whole, we think we’ve got a very, very strong balance sheet.
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick, on the IL-17 obviously we study every new mechanism that comes into this market and developer strategy to deal with that mechanism going forward. We understand the IL-17 very well and the data that we’ve seen so far. What I’d tell you is if you look at many other mechanisms that have into all the different categories we compete in whether it’s RA or GI or psoriasis, this is a tough market to break into and gain significant share because there is a reluctance to ultimately go to a new mechanism very quickly. These are very potent drugs and have sometimes unknown side-effect profiles until there are in large populations. And that tends to make physicians more reluctant to switch in mass patients. And so, we view IL-17 as a good mechanism, there is no question it’s a good mechanism. And, but we view it early on it would be like other mechanisms that would come into this market, it will probably be more for failures, TNF failures, and eliminate some of that rotation that would have occurred. But we don’t assume that is going to have a dramatic impact on our psoriasis share going forward.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-07-25 09:00:00) =====
Executives:  Larry Peepo – VP, IR Richard Gonzalez – Chairman and CEO William Chase – EVP and CFO 
Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only. This conference is being recorded by AbbVie. I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin sir.
Larry Peepo: Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. On the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Rick will begin by discussing AbbVie’s results from the second quarter and then provide an update on our pipeline and some of the key milestones we expect this year. Bill will give a more detailed review of our quarterly performance and then provide an overview of our 2014 outlook. As a reminder we are currently operating under the UK takeover code and will be until the Shire transaction is completed. The UK takeover code governs what we are able to disclose regarding the specifics of the transaction as well as the various aspects of AbbVie’s underlying business, including operating performance, product details and pipeline milestones. To help investors we have added a Q&A section to our earnings news release today which addresses a number of typical questions we receive. Due to the UK takeover code we will only be providing prepared remarks during our conference call today. There will not be a question-and-answer portion of today’s call. Before I turn the call over to Rick I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie’s operations is included in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today’s conference call as in the past non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our regulatory filings which can be found on our website. And with that I’ll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard Gonzalez: Thank you, Larry. Good morning and thank you for joining us this morning. We’re pleased to report a strong second quarter result with adjusted earnings per share of $0.82, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. This included sales growth of nearly 5% also ahead of our outlook for the quarter despite the positive impact from loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise. Sales growth was led by continued robust performance from HUMIRA and other key products including Synthroid, Sevoflurane and Duodopa. We have been pleased with our performance in the first-half of the year and as a reminder last month we raised our full year 2014 earnings per share guidance range to $3.06 to $3.16 on an adjusted basis, reflecting strong underlying business performance. Beyond our strong financial performance we had a very productive second quarter with a number of important pipeline advancements, clinical trial results and other strategic activities. We submitted our U.S. and EU regulatory applications for interferon-free HCV combination. Both applications are currently under active priority review. We continue to anticipate U.S. approval later this year and EMA authorization in early 2015. We are also working to advance our Next-Generation HCV assets which are currently in Phase 2 development. We expect data from the Phase 2/b program in 2015 and plan to start Phase 3 development next year as well. We have also made progress with several assets in our oncology pipeline. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings we presented interim-results from our Phase 1 clinical trial of ABT-199 our BCL-2 inhibitor in combination with Rituxan in relapsed refractory CLL patients. The data showed an overall response rate of 84% and a complete response of 36% which compares favorably to trial results from other therapies in this patient population. This combination is being investigated in an ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed refractory CLL. We are also evaluating ABT-199 in a variety of other cancer types including AML. We expect to present data from the AML study at an upcoming medical meeting. Also at ASCO AbbVie released preliminary results from an ongoing Phase 1 study of ABT-414 an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody drug conjugate used in combination with chemotherapy. The study showed a level of response not typically seen in patients with recurrent or unresectable GBM. GBM is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. Patients currently have few treatment options and the five year survival rate for this type of cancer is less than 3%. We are working quickly to advance ABT-414. We recently announce the initiation of a Phase 3 study of our PARP inhibitor ABT-888 in patients with HER2 negative breast cancer containing BRCA gene mutations. The start of this trial follows initiation of Phase 3 clinical work in two other settings; non-small cell cancer and neoadjuvant treatment of triple negative breast cancer. This fall we will present data from the mid-stage trial on lung cancer that supported our decision to advance the Phase 3 development. We have a number of other mid-stage trials that we expect to read out in the coming months. In June we announced positive top line results from our Phase 3 daclizumab study. It demonstrated that patients treated with daclizumab had a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapsed rates versus on active comparator. We are excited about these results and we are in the process of working with our partner to complete our global regulatory application. In our immunology pipeline we recently advanced two bispecific DVDs in to Phase 2 development; ABT-122 for RA and ABT-981 for OA. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our selective JAK-1 inhibitor programs. We recently initiated a second Phase 2 trial in RA with our internal JAK-1 compound ABT-494 and we look forward to seeing data from the Phase 2/b Galapagos collaboration early next year. Since becoming an independent company 18 months ago AbbVie has built a strong and sustainable strategy for the business. Last week we announced an important step in taking that strategy to the next level, the proposed merger with Shire. The combination of AbbVie and Shire represent a compelling opportunity to create a new world-class biopharmaceutical company. The combined company would have leadership positions within multiple important areas of medicine, a deeper and broader pipeline and greater access to its global cash flows. This transaction offers significant strategic and financial benefits for our respective shareholders and companies as well as the patients that we serve. The combined company would be larger more diversified company with significant financial capacity for future strategic investment. Additionally the proposed combination offers an opportunity for enhanced shareholder return of capital and shareholder value creation. We’re currently seeking the relevant approvals for the transaction and are working towards our stated goal of closing in the fourth quarter of 2014. In summary we’re very pleased with the strong performance we’ve had in the first half of 2014. In the second quarter we saw strong performance across our portfolio, including double-digit growth from Humira, We made significant progress advancing our pipeline and expect a number of additional milestones over the next six to nine months. And with the recent agreement to merge with Shire I believe we’ve taken an important strategic action to enhance our position as a world class biopharmaceutical company. With that I’ll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?
William Chase: Thank you Rick. This morning I’ll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2014. As Rick said we are very pleased with our results this quarter. We exceeded our guidance on both the top and bottom line. Total sales increased 4.8% on an operational basis, excluding 0.2% favorable impact from foreign exchange. Excluding sales from our lipid franchise, due to loss of exclusivity total sales increased 12.3% on an operational basis. Humira delivered global sales of nearly $3.3 billion, up 25.4% on an operational basis and 26.2% on a reported basis. In the United States Humira sales increased 35.6% driven by continued market expansion, share gains and particularly strong growth in the gastro segment. Growth in the second quarter also benefited from retail buying patterns and a favorable comparison to the prior year. Second quarter wholesaler inventory levels remain at roughly two weeks consistent with the first quarter. We expect third quarter Humira sales growth in the U.S. to be reflective of underlying product demand and pricing trends, partially offset by a reduction in retail buying patterns. As a result we are forecasting high teens growth in the U.S. for Humira in the third quarter. Internationally Humira sales grew 16.2% on an operational basis and 17.8% on a reported basis. International growth continues to be driven by the uptake of new indications, share gains and double digit market growth in most markets. Performance in the quarter also benefited modestly from the timing of international shipments. We are forecasting low double digit growth for Humira internationally in the third quarter driven by strong underlying trends, partially offset by the timing of shipments in international markets. On a global basis we continue to expect double digit sales growth for Humira in 2014. AndroGel sales were $218 million, down 15.6% from the prior year quarter. We continue to see a notable slowdown in the market with overall prescriptions down more than 20% in recent months. We expect these market trends to continue. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $166 million, up 8.7% year-over-year. Synthroid maintain strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. The overall market has experienced low-single digit growth with Synthroid growth outpacing the market including product pricing trends. U.S. CREON sales were $110 million in the quarter, up 4.1%. CREON maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where the product continues to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. Global Lupron sales were $186 million in the quarter, down 5.2% on an operational basis. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintain significant share of the market. Performance this quarter is roughly in line with our full year expectation and is also consistent with recent market trends. Sales of Synagis were $74 million in the second quarter up 16.3% on an operational basis. Synagis which protects at risk infants from severe respiratory disease is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Growth in the quarter was driven by continued product uptake and strong commercial execution. Sales of Duodopa our therapy for advanced Parkinson’s disease approved in Europe and other international markets were $56 million, up 24.2% on an operational basis this quarter. Performance in the quarter is in line with recent trends as well as our full year outlook for the product. And sales of Niaspan and TriCor /Trilipix were both down significantly due to generic competition. We expect these trends to continue for the remainder of 2014. I will now turn to the P&L profile for the second quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 79.6% in line with our expectations. This reflects loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise offset by favorable mix impacts across the portfolio and margin enhancing initiatives we’ve implemented. Adjusted R&D was 16.1% of sales in the second quarter. R&D spending was up sequentially over the first quarter as we increased funding of our mid and late stage pipeline assets and additional Humira indications. Adjusted SG&A was 27.1% of sales in the second quarter. As expected SG&A spending increased from the first quarter, reflecting continued investment on our growth brands and preparations for our upcoming HCV launch. Net interest expense was $69 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.2% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash amortization expense and specified items were $0.82 exceeding our previous guidance range of $0.75 to $0.77. On a GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.68. Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of 2014, for the full year we are confirming our recently increased adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.06 to $3.16. For the third quarter we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 to $0.79. We are forecasting low to mid-single digit operational sales growth in both the third and fourth quarters of 2014. As a reminder our 2014 outlook excludes any potential revenue from the expected 2014 U.S. launch of our HCV therapy. We expect the third quarter gross margin ratio to be approximately 79%. For the fourth quarter the ratio is expected to be somewhat lower than the third quarter driven by product mix particularly an increase in lower margin Synagis sales. As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call in January we are forecasting a higher level of SG&A expense in 2014 driven primarily by investments we are making for the upcoming launch of our HCV regimen in the U.S. and Europe. For the third quarter we expect a modest sequential increase in absolute SG&A expense from the second quarter. For the fourth quarter given the proximity of the U.S. HCV launch we’d expect a more meaningful sequential increase in absolute SG&A expense from the third quarter level. This has been reflected in our recently increased adjusted earnings per share guidance. We currently have a significant number of Phase 3 programs in active development including exciting opportunities in oncology, HCV immunology and other areas that warrant investment. As a result we expect R&D expense to be above 16% of sales for the full year 2014 reflecting a meaningful increase in the spending over the prior year. For the third quarter we expect a sequential increase in absolute R&D investment from the second quarter level. For the fourth quarter we are forecasting a more modest sequential increase from the third quarter level. This has been reflected in our recently increased adjusted earnings per share guidance. So overall we’re pleased with our strong quarter performance in the second quarter as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2014. And with that I’ll turn it back over to Larry.

Richard Gonzalez: Thank you, Larry. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today, we’re pleased to report strong results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.71, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. This included strong operational sales growth also ahead of our outlook for the quarter. We delivered this performance with strong growth across a number of products in our portfolio, including Humira, Synagis, Synthroid, and Creon. Our performance this quarter illustrates our ability to grow our business despite the impact of generic competition. It also provides confidence in our ability to deliver meaningful sales and EPS growth starting next year as we launch our HCV therapy.  In 2014, our focus remains on continued strong commercial and operational execution as well as pipeline advancement. Today, I’ll briefly discuss our first quarter performance and provide an update on our pipeline and some of the key milestones we expect to occur throughout the year. Then I’ll turn the call over to Bill, who will provide you additional detail on our performance and our second quarter outlook. Our first quarter performance was led by Humira, which delivered more than 18% global operational growth. We continue to see increasing penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies which is driving strong market growth. Additionally, Humira continues to gain market share across segments. Humira is off to a strong start and we’re well on our way to achieving our sales growth outlook. Beyond Humira, we also saw a strong performance from other products in our portfolio, including Creon, Synthroid, Synagis, and Sevoflurane. We continue to be pleased with the performance of these durable and growing brands.  In addition to our strong commercial performance in the quarter, we also made significant progress advancing our pipeline. So far in 2014, we have achieved a number of key regulatory and clinical objectives. This includes an important milestone for our interferon-free HCV combination. As you may have seen, earlier this week we announced the submission of our U.S. regulatory application for HCV therapy for genotype 1 patients. Our European regulatory application will occur in early May based on specific dates allowed for submitting applications to the CHMP. In anticipation of U.S. commercialization in late 2014 and European approval in early 2015, we’ve continued to make good progress in building the appropriate infrastructure.  Detailed results from several of our Phase III registrational studies were recently presented at EASL and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The comprehensive body of data demonstrates that our combination provides high rates of cure across genotype 1 populations, including difficult-to-treat patients. As we evaluate the HCV market and consider which patients which likely be treated in 2015 to 2017 time frame, we believe the most advanced patients – those with cirrhosis, fibrosis, and patients who have previously failed treatment – will be treated sooner. This view is consistent with feedback we’ve received from payor organizations and physicians around the world, and based on the high level of efficacy demonstrated by our therapy in these difficult-to-treat patients, we believe we’re well positioned for success in this market.  Further, because we’ve conducted independent studies across specific genotype 1 patient populations, we’re able to characterize the performance in each patient type with a very high degree of confidence and we believe this will be an important point of differentiation. During the quarter, we also presented results from our mid-stage HCV trials in Japan as well as initial data on our next-generation HCV assets. Given patient characteristics and the prevalence of genotype 1b in Japan, we are evaluating a 12-week 2daa once daily ribavirin-free treatment for these patients. Data from our Phase II study with this combination in Japan demonstrated SVR12 rates in the mid-90% range. Our Phase III program is ongoing and enrolling rapidly, and we expect to submit our regulatory application in the first half of 2015. Japan represents the second-largest HCV market globally, and given our commercial presence and the potential product profile, we believe we’re well positioned relative to the competitive offerings.  At the recent CROI meeting, we presented initial data from our next-generation HCV assets, including ABT493, a potent protease inhibitor, and our new NS5A inhibitor, ABT530. As we’ve said before, it is our goal with our next-generation program to bring to market a ribavirin-free, once daily pan-genotypic combination. As I mentioned last quarter, we have ongoing efforts to further simplify our initial offering with a once-daily formulation, and we’ve continued to make progress in this regard. Certainly there has been significant attention regarding the competitive landscape for this market. While we can’t make direct comparisons between studies, we do believe there are important differences between the clinical trial designs across various programs. This includes significant differences in cohort size for specific subgroups and patient populations, and the confidence intervals around trial results. We believe these factors will be important considerations for physicians, payors, and patients. Based on the large body of data supporting our therapeutic profile across genotype 1 patients, our global footprint and our ability to execute commercially, we continue to believe we’re in a strong position. AbbVie will be an early entrant into this market where there is clearly a strong desire from both physicians and payors for multiple therapeutic options. Well-tolerated treatments like ours that demonstrate high levels of efficacy, particularly in difficult-to-treat patients, will fare well; and considering the number of patients afflicted and both the physician and payor capacity, we believe there will be a steady cadence of patients treated annually, making this a very attractive market for many years to come.  While HCV certainly garners significant attention, today I’d also like to highlight some of the other important pipeline programs and milestones that we expect throughout the remainder of 2014.  We continue to have a high level of enthusiasm on our late-stage oncology assets, including our BCL-2 inhibitor, ABT-199, in development for a number of hematological malignancies, including our late-stage trials for our vanguard indication, CLL; our PARP inhibitor, ABT-888, in development for more than a dozen different cancer types; elotuzumab in Phase III development for multiple myeloma. The ABT-199 clinical program, which is partnered with Roche Genentech, continues to progress very well. As a reminder, last spring we refined the dosing and monitoring approach with ABT-199 in CLL to minimize the risk for tumor lysis syndrome. Since initiating the new protocol, we’ve collected and analyzed data on a significant number of patients. There have been no clinically significant events of TLS reported. We recently shared these findings with the U.S. regulatory authorities and reached agreement to remove the hospitalization requirement for a significant portion of patients going forward. We plan to present these safety data at an upcoming European Hematology Association meeting. As you know, last year we initiated a large Phase II single agent study in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion. The initial date readout from this trial is expected in the first part of 2015. If the data warrants and regulatory agencies agree that ABT-199 addresses an unmet medical need, these data have the potential to serve as a path to early registration.  We have a number of ABT-199 data presentations and other activities that are also expected this year. We plan to present initial Phase I combination data with Rituxan in relapsed refractory CLL patients at the upcoming AASCO and EHA meetings. Later this year, we expect to present initial single agent AML data and multiple myeloma data, and also later this year in collaboration with our partner, we plan to start a Phase III combination study of ABT-199 plus GA101 in first-line CLL patients.  We’ve also seen good progress with ABT-888, our PARP inhibitor. We recently announced the initiation of a global Phase III trial evaluating ABT-888 in patients with previously untreated squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The data supporting the decision to advance the Phase III development will be presented at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Earlier this year, we started a Phase III study of ABT-888 for neo-adjuvant treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. Several other mid-stage trials will complete in 2014 with the potential for additional Phase III transitions yet this year.  Also in late stage development in our oncology pipeline is elotuzumab for multiple myeloma, the second most common blood cancer, in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Two Phase III studies are ongoing in relapsed refractory and first-line patients. Results from the event-driven trial are expected in early 2015.  Now turning to our other late-stage pipeline assets. This summer, we’ll see data from the second of two registrational studies on daclizumab. As a reminder, the DECIDE trial is designed to show a reduction in annualized relapse rates and disability progression in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis versus an active comparator. Despite advances in this category, there continues to be a significant need for high efficacy agents and we believe daclizumab has the potential to deliver the right balance of clinical activity and an acceptable safety profile. In our neuroscience pipeline is Duopa. Regarding our U.S. regulatory application, we recently received questions on the submission. FDA did not identify safety issues in the clinical data and no new clinical trials were requested. The questions were primarily related to the use of the delivery system. We’re in the process of addressing the questions and plan to submit a response when that process is complete. Moving on to Elagolix, our compound in Phase III development for endometriosis and Phase IIb for uterine fibroids, we’ll see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies in endometriosis in the second half of 2014. Finally, we look forward to seeing Phase IIb data in RA in our partner-selected JAK1 inhibitor. Beyond our partnership with Galapagos, we have a robust pipeline in mid-stage immunology assets, including an internal selected JAK1 inhibitor, an IL6 nanobody, and DVD bispecific biologics, among others. In closing, we’re off to a strong start in 2014. We delivered strong performance in the quarter and we continue to make good progress executing on our key strategic priorities, including pipeline advancement. As we evaluate our pipeline prospects, including a number of potential opportunities, we believe our pipeline is the strongest it has ever been. We’re on the cusp of a number of important data milestones, phase transitions, and product launches. Given the progress we’ve made, we continue to expect strong sales and earnings growth beginning in 2015. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for a more detailed view of our results.
William Chase: Thank you, Rick. This morning, I’ll review our first quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of 2014. As Rick said, we’re very pleased with the strong quarter we delivered. Total sales increased 6.7% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Excluding sales from our lipid franchise due to loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 13.5% on an operational basis. Humira delivered global sales of more than $2.6 billion, up 18.4% on an operational basis. In the U.S., Humira sales increased 24.7% driven by continued market expansion, share gains, and particularly strong growth in the gastro segment. Internationally, Humira sales grew nearly 14% on an operational basis and more than 12% on a reported basis. International growth is being driven by continued uptake of new indications, share gains, and double-digit market growth in most key countries. On a global basis, we continue to expect double-digit sales growth for Humira in 2014.  International sales of Synagis were strong in the first quarter at $354 million, up 9.3% on an operational basis. Synagis, which protects at-risk infants from severe respiratory disease, is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first and fourth quarters. Androgel sales were up 6%, benefiting from a favorable comparison versus the market dynamics of the prior year quarter. While Androgel continues to gain share, we have seen a notable slowdown in the market this year with overall prescriptions down roughly 10%. We expect Androgel performance for the year to be in line with these market trends. Global Lupron sales were $189 million in the quarter, up 5.6% on an operational basis. For the full-year 2014, we expect sales to be down modestly from 2013. U.S. sales of Synthroid were up $157 million with the year-over-year growth rate aided by a favorable comparison to the first quarter of 2013, which was unfavorably impacted by customer ordering patterns. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full-year 2014, we expect low double-digit sales growth for the brand. U.S. Creon sales were $107 million in the quarter, up 18.4%. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. We expect low double-digit sales growth for Creon in 2014.  Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson’s disease, grew nearly 30% on an operational basis this quarter. For the remainder of 2014, we expect continued double-digit growth in Europe and other international markets where Duodopa is currently approved.  All of the products in our lipid franchise are now experiencing generic competition. Sales of Niaspan were $47 million and TriCor Trilipix sales were $23 million, both down significantly versus the first quarter of 2013. We expect these trends to continue for the remainder of 2014. I’ll now turn to the P&L profile for the first quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 78.4%, in line with our expectations and up 220 basis points from the prior year quarter. This reflects loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise offset by favorable mix impacts across the portfolio and margin-enhancing initiatives we’ve implemented. Adjusted R&D was 16.9% of sales, up 22% from the prior year driven by increased funding of our mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional Humira indications. The level of R&D investment in the quarter was above our guidance.  Adjusted SG&A was 27.6% of sales in the first quarter, reflecting continued investment in our growth brands and preparations for our upcoming HCV launch. Adjusted SG&A investment increased 4.6% from the prior quarter. We remain on track for a full-year adjusted SG&A profile approaching 28%.  Net interest expense was $65 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.3% in the quarter. First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash amortization expense and specified items, were $0.71, up 4.4% year-over-year and exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.61.  Moving on to our full-year 2014 outlook, we are confirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3 to $3.10. This guidance range excludes $0.37 per share related to amortization expense and ongoing separation and restructuring costs. We continue to expect sales of approximately $19 billion this year with growth from our key marketed products offsetting the decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of roughly 1% for the year. We’re committed to improving our gross margin ratio in 2014 despite the loss of high-margin lipid sales. As a result, we continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 79% for the year, reflecting actions we’ve taken to further improve our margin profile. As you know, we have a record number of Phase III programs in development, including a number of exciting opportunities in oncology, HCV, immunology and other areas that warrant investment. We now expect R&D expense to be somewhat above 16% of sales as we continue to advance our late-stage pipeline. As I noted during our call in January, we expect to see an increase in SG&A this year as we invest in our key brands and our upcoming HCV launch. As a result, we continue to expect SG&A expense to approach 28% of sales in 2014. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $270 million for the full year and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22%.  Regarding our second quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.77. This excludes roughly $0.10 of specified items and non-cash amortization resulting in a second quarter EPS in the range of $0.65 to $0.67 on a GAAP basis. Our second quarter outlook reflects a flat to slightly increasing top line, including a modest negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin as a percentage of sales to be in line with our full-year guidance. The amount of investment in R&D and SG&A in the second quarter is expected to increase sequentially from the first quarter as we accelerate spending, particularly for our upcoming HCV launch. This has been captured in our EPS guidance range for the second quarter.  In conclusion, we’re pleased with our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2014. With that, I’ll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Bill, and we’ll now open the call for questions. Elan (ph), we’ll take our first question, please.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question today is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
Steve Scala – Cowen & Co.: Thank you so much. I have three questions. First regarding the hep-C opportunity, has your strategy on how to approach the market changed at all in the past six months, and if so, in what ways? Secondly on Duopa, I assume the PDUFA date will be pushed out from the early May time frame. Do you have visibility on for how long? And then thirdly, maybe a bit of a bigger picture question. Some companies are philosophically opposed to changing full-year EPS guidance at the end of Q1 because it’s simply too early in the year to do so. Does AbbVie share this view, or would the company have increased its full-year EPS guidance already if it thought that was prudent? Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay Steve, this is Rick Gonzalez. I’ll take the first one and the last one – let me start with the last one. Yeah, I think we are in a position where it just doesn’t make sense based on first quarter to change guidance. I wouldn’t say we have a philosophy where we won’t change it if ultimately we believe it should be changed going forward, but it’s just too early in the year to ultimately make that decision today.  As far as hep-C is concerned, I think it is a very interesting market as it’s evolved over time, but the one thing I’d roll out is we said early on in the process that we thought we had a very competitive profile on our product and we thought we could position this product well in the marketplace. If you recall, one of the things that we talked about is that we had done a significant amount of market research in this area and there were really three key drivers of success. One was clearly cure rates – SBR12 rates in both naïve patients but more importantly in difficult-to-treat patients; and second was therapies that were highly tolerable. Those two factors alone drove the vast majority of physician prescribing patterns. Convenience was a distant third – a very, very distant third is what we said.  At the same time, we also said that this was a large market and would stay a large market for a long period of time because of the clinical capacity and the triaging of patients over time, and that physicians and payors would want multiple options in the marketplace. We also said that we believe that the patients that would get treated first were cirrhotics, fibrotic patients, and experienced patients, that they’d be a significant amount of the treatment in the first several years. When you look at the way the market is playing out today, it’s playing out pretty close to what I just described to you, and that’s what we articulated more than a year ago. If you look at our product profile against that, we have very strong SBR12 rates in cirrhotic patients and experienced patients. We have strong individual patient data around sub-populations with very tight confidence intervals. We have extremely high tolerability with or without ribavirin. We have very low relapse rates in these patients, and we’re going to be an early entry into the marketplace and provide an alternative to the other competitive offerings. So when I look at it, it’s playing out very similar to what we expected, and I think we’ll be in a very good position to compete very effectively in this market. 
Scott Brun: This is Scott Brun and I’ll take the second question on Duopa regarding the PDUFA date. So certainly through our interactions with FDA, they acknowledge the importance of Duopa in providing an option for patients with severe Parkinson’s disease who other than deep-brain stimulation really have no other options, so we’ve been working very closely with them to address some questions predominantly related to the use of the delivery system. Really, we’ve gotten no concerns with regard the safety efficacy profile of the product. I think this is more a factor that this is a very unique drug-device combination and we’re working with multiple constituent parts of the FDA beyond just the drug review division, so certainly there are some additional questions related to patient use, instructions for use. We’re working through those with the various FDA divisions, our partner who manufactures the pump, and our own internal AbbVie experts.  I don’t want to give you guidance on the PDUFA date right now. Certainly it will extend beyond May, but we’re working very expeditiously in partnership with the FDA to address those questions.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Just a couple questions – Rick, I’m not even really sure where the question is here, but maybe you can comment on this. As you know, Sovaldi sales this quarter were $2.2 billion. J&J’s Olysio sales this quarter, one single agent protease inhibitor generated $350 million in sales annualizing at $1.4 billion, and I look at consensus numbers for AbbVie’s hep-C regimen next year and they’re under $800 million. What do you think the world is missing here, because we’ve seen really good data, et cetera, but I don’t know – maybe you can just comment on what you think the gaps and misunderstanding are. Secondly, Scott to you on your second-generation hep-C regimen, clearly I think one of the key messages at EASL is just how aggressively your competitors are moving in this space, and I’m wondering if you can give us an update on your development timelines for your second-generation hep-C regimen and if we will see data at AASLD. Then just lastly on the news, Rick, on ABT-199, so are you saying that we are now out of the woods on TLS with respect to ABT-199? Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: Thanks Jami. Okay, so I’ll cover the question on hep-C. I’m not sure what the gaps are. I mean, I just went through how I think our product fits against the market criteria, and I think that’s consistent with our view of how we’ll compete in the marketplace. I will say, look – the data is evolving here very rapidly. We just saw a lot of the competitive subset data at EASL, and the market probably needs a little time to digest that over a period of time and make some determinations as to how they want to value each of the competitive alternatives in the marketplace. But I can tell you from our perspective, we feel pretty good about our position and we feel it’s playing out very consistently with what we thought would play out in the marketplace. Having said all that, it’s certainly better to delight than disappoint, and so the number that’s out there I think is a number that certainly is one that we have confidence we can beat.
Scott Brun: Jami, it’s Scott. Maybe I’ll go on with the HCV second-generation. So as Rick said, we presented data at CROI showing the characteristics of our new protease inhibitor, ABT-493 and our new NS5A, ABT-530. Both are pan-genotypic with very balanced activity against genotypes 1 through 6, activity against the first generation compound typical mutations that we see arise, and frankly very interesting characteristics with regard to their barriers to resistance. So certainly if you compare these against other next-generation compounds, these compounds are ranking near the top – extremely favorably. We are in Phase II right now. We have established to our confidence that these are indeed once daily compounds without the need of ritonavir. We are very pleased with regard to what we’re seeing in patients, and we are moving forward with our Phase II program that’s going to incorporate elements of, let me say, much of what we’ve been learning about where the competition is moving with the next wave of therapy. We certainly feel we are on track for these therapies to be available in the 2017 time frame. Moving on to ABT-199, as Rick said, after we changed our dosing protocol to start at a somewhat lower dose and ramp up more slowly, we had been hospitalizing all of our CLL patients with the initiation of 199. We had monitored them very carefully, collected a very significant body of data, and certainly have seen no TLS – clinically significant TLS – with that approach. As a consequence of our analyses of these data, moving forward with the FDA we’ve been able to remove the hospitalization requirement for, I will say the majority of patients. We’re continuing hospitalization for those patients at highest risk with the most bulky disease, who frankly are also the ones who have the fewest options and the greatest ability to benefit from ABT-199 therapy. So the program is expanding rapidly with Phase III studies having initiated, so we’re going to be getting a lot more patient experience. You’re going to see what we’ve seen at the upcoming AASCO meeting. Always want to be careful about saying out of the woods, but I will say strongly off to the races based on what we’ve been seeing.
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
Jeff Holford – Jefferies: Hi, thanks very much for taking my questions. Just on the once daily formulation of the current offering, wondering if you can just give us a bit more color around timing of that and what you’re required to do for that in terms of any clinical studies or work with the FDA. Secondly, can you just let us know if you’ve had any indication around guideline advantage potentially in patient groups like cirrhotics or any other hep-C population where you think you have a higher level of evidence than he competitors so far in terms of specific trials? And then just a last question, what do you guys think the percentage of the global hep-C opportunity that’s driven by tender or preferential access based pricing, just to give us a sense of how important pricing might be in this market? Thank you.
Scott Brun: It’s Scott Brun again. So with regard to our once daily formulation of our first generation regimen that will take our twice daily non-nuke polymerase ABT-333 and coformulate with the once daily 450 267, we are finishing up some of our pharmacokinetic work to make sure that we’re selecting the optimal candidate formulation. Certainly based on what those data look like and how similar the PK profiles are to the regimen with (indiscernible) will drive exactly what our next steps are going to be. Certainly if there is additional clinical work required, we fully anticipate that we’re going to be beginning that work before the end of the year, and this regimen will slot in between the entry of the first generation regimen and, as I referred to, the second generation. With regard to guidelines, certainly we work very closely with the various groups that drive the prevailing global guidelines, certainly to make sure that they understand the breadth and depth of our program. I think typically guidelines are driven by weight of evidence. Certainly you can see ADC gradings with regard to how strong evidence is, and having dedicated data in some of the most important patient groups – those that are the hardest the treat – in very significant numbers that shrink your confidence intervals and provide you greater certainty, I think is going to resonate with these guideline groups. Again, those guidelines haven’t been written yet, but if you look at how these are conventionally put together, it’s a weight of evidence approach and I think we feel very, very confident in our body of data, particularly in the groups that you referenced, such as the cirrhotics.
Richard Gonzalez: Jeff, this is Rick on the tender question. Well, as you know, the U.S. is a big part of this market, which isn’t a tender-driven kind of market, and then obviously a lot of the major European countries would be the other significant part, and Japan. So if you look at pure tenders across the G7, it will be a relatively small percentage of the overall revenue in this market as it exists today. 
Jeff Holford – Jefferies: Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: Yes, thanks very much. Good morning. I have a number of questions but I’ll try to just ask three, if that is okay. The first is relatively straightforward, just a simple numbers question. IMS has been reporting mid to high single digit TRX growth for Humira in the U.S. in the first quarter. Could you just break down the reported 25% U.S. Humira sales growth to give us some better perspective on underlying demand as you see it, in case the IMS TRX growth is misleading, and then also on price and any inventory stocking. Second, with respect to HCV on pricing, maybe Rick, you could just give us your thoughts at a high level about how competitive one needs to be on price in a duopoly. I would think that in the initial duopoly, it would make little sense to price aggressively when you have just one competitor, but just wanted to get your perspective on that.  Then third, with respect to HCV diagnosis, I think the HCV bulls are talking about significant diagnosis increases in the U.S., but I don’t have a good perspective on what the real numbers are. So maybe you could talk about the number diagnosed in terms of whatever number you have recently, and how that number is really going to grow annually in the next three years. We think about the number diagnosed in the United States growing in the low single digit percentage annually or mid-single digit percentage. Any color on that would be helpful.
William Chase: So David, it’s Bill Chase. I’ll start with your Humira question. As you pointed out, the IMS scripts on Humira are high single digit. The numbers we see are actually a little higher than that typically on an annual basis. This thing is doing high single to low double digits, and then obviously you’ve seen it when we’ve taken price increases, so price does remain a component of the U.S. growth.  Inventories – we try to minimize fluctuations from quarter to quarter on inventories as much as we possibly can. In both the fourth quarter and the first quarter, Humira inventories were about half a year. There were some impacts—half a month, rather, I’m sorry. There were some impacts in the first quarter of 2013 but that was maybe four to five points on the growth altogether. This is a brand that continues to perform very, very strongly in the U.S. You saw the numbers last year and certainly we expect continued performance this year.
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: I’m sorry – I don’t know if you can hear me. Sorry to interrupt, but with respect to four to five points in the first quarter of ’13, did you say there was a negative impact resulting in a somewhat easy comp for the first quarter of ’14, given what happened in the first quarter of ’13?
William Chase: There was a favorable comp versus the first quarter of 2013 related to ordering patterns.
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Richard Gonzalez: Okay David, this is Rick. I’ll cover the HCV one. As it relates to pricing, as we’ve said before, if I look at the product profile that we have and I look at the mix of patients that are going to be treated first, we have a product profile that stands up quite nicely in the marketplace, so that’s not our strategy going forward. So we’re not going to talk specifically about how we’re going to deal with pricing, as I mentioned on the last call as well, but I’ll just tell you the product attributes of the AbbVie therapy, I think stand up quite nicely to what the market wants, and certainly that will be the driver of how we try to educate the market and market the product. As far as diagnosis rates are concerned, I don’t have the numbers directly in front of me but last time I recall we thought they were about 3.5 million patients in total in the United States. About half of those were currently diagnosed, and I’d say in our LRP modeling we’re not modeling out dramatic increases in newly diagnosed patients. I mean, there are obviously patients that are being diagnosed and coming into the system, but it’s probably in that high single or low double digit kind of rate. You have to remember, there’s a certain level of clinical capacity here to begin with just to get through the people that are already diagnosed that need treatment, so I think everybody will have campaigns to go forward and try to diagnose more patients, but the governing factor may be the level of clinical capacity that exists in the marketplace anyway. 
Scott Brun: David, it’s Scott. I completely agree with Rick. You see some varying numbers with regard to, say the U.S., how many patients are actively in care with HCV. I’ve seen numbers on the order of 400,000 –again to Rick’s point, maybe 1.5 to 1.7 diagnosed on the total of 3 million. But I think the more relevant question, as Rick laid out, if you’re trying to see how this market is going to evolve is all the various factors in the patient, their journey not only diagnosis, clinical capacity, but then some of the things certainly both in the U.S. and globally with regard to how payors are going to be looking at the cadence of treatment with certainly all the signaling that we’ve been seeing, those with the most advanced fibrosis and/or prior treatment experience coming in first. So I agree with Rick. We have not modeled and don’t need to model very aggressive diagnostic uptake in our forecast.
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott from JP Morgan.
Chris Schott – JP Morgan: Great, thanks very much. Following up on the pricing topic here on the HCV side, I guess your competitors price and launch have obviously attracted a lot of attention from payors and some politicians. Can we have a little bit more on your view on how this all plays out? If price doesn’t come down in this market, do you think we’re going to see more efforts to restrict usage of these products that it medically makes sense at all to do, and I guess finally, does that attention at some point give AbbVie better negotiating position with payors? I guess it’s a couple questions there, but just any thoughts would be appreciated.  My second question was on ABT-199. I guess two clarifying questions there – first, how many patients have been dosed on the new regimen at this point? And the second question is, it looks like you could have a best-in-class product here but one that’s going to be coming to market a few years later than some other highly effective, novel agents. How do you see that playing out commercially, the time to market issue here? Thanks very much.
Scott Brun: Chris, it’s Scott Brun, so maybe I can talk about--. Obviously I don’t want to be giving away exact numbers with regard to where we’re at on our Phase II program, again just because of the competitive fervency here. But to your point, when I look at the characteristics of these drugs – and again, we’re comparing in your minds the preclinical information that’s out there and then certainly what I know about from what we’ve seen in patients so far. No, I absolutely think that this particular regimen has the potential for best-in-class. We will know more over the ensuing years as we—ensuing year as we continue our Phase II program.  But when I say for a regimen that’s going to be out in 2017, referring back to the prior question, this epidemic is going to be far from over, okay, and I’m talking in the developed markets. You just look at our throughput, even if you assume in the G7, say, on the order of 250,000 patients coming through, they are going to be a number of patients still in need and certainly this number, as you made the point, is going to be affected by healthcare system decisions on how are patients going to be prioritized. Now certainly this is a disease where the consequences occur decades after initial infection, so you do have some time before you have to act. You don’t have to treat everybody with no or little evidence of liver scarring right off the bat. Certainly I think those patients who have more advanced fibrosis or scarring or other factors that are medical indications for treatment, I cannot imagine any healthcare system is going to be making the decisions to deny that care.
Richard Gonzalez: Chris, this is Rick. The only thing I would add to that is what will really drive access and who is treated is capacity, guidelines, and then ultimately whatever criteria the governments or managed care organizations put in place. I think those will be responsible and appropriate clinical guidelines that are put in place because they tend to come together, and the governing factor may be more one of capacity than it is other kinds of things.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse. 
Vamil Divan – Credit Suisse: Yes, thanks for taking the question. So just following up a little bit on the pricing question there with hep-C, I just actually wanted to ask you a question as it relates to Humira. Obviously hep-C, there’s some unique components here, but are you seeing or do you expect to see any greater pressure across other specialty care markets, I guess specifically with Humira in a class of anti-TNS where we do have a number of different competitors. I think we’re starting to see some of these concerns maybe extend to areas that have been immune to this issue before, so just curious to hear your thoughts. And then separated and unrelated question, just on Androgel – appreciate what you said about 2014. Just what do you think about the longer term potential for this class and your drug specifically, just given some of the safety concerns that have been raised? Do you see any potential to re-establish growth for this category, or not? Thanks.
Richard Gonzalez: This is Rick. So if you look at Humira and the class of anti-TNS, I think you have to reflect back on there have been many, many competitors in this market for a long period of time, and you still see Humira have a leadership position in this category. Obviously a component of that is working with governments and working with managed care organizations to ensure that you’re demonstrating the right value proposition for the product and it is priced appropriately against that value proposition, and that’s something we deal with every single day, every single year. I wouldn’t say that we’ve seen dramatic changes in the approach that we’ve had to take with those organizations. Even recently, I wouldn’t say we’ve seen dramatic changes. As it relates to Androgel, certainly we’re not projecting going forward that the market will accelerate dramatically, and so I think we’re assuming in our modeling per our long-range plan that ultimately the market will be relatively slow growing to flat going forward. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital.
Alex Arfaei – BMO Capital: Good morning and congratulations on the quarter, folks. Three questions, if I may. Regarding your hep-C regimen, are you having discussions with payors already, and specifically I’m wondering if your (indiscernible) Phase III in cirrhotics is resonating with payors given the importance of this group. Second, could you comment on the enhanced gross margin initiatives that you were talking about earlier? What are those initiatives, and what is your longer term outlook on gross margin given your plans to establish manufacturing in Singapore? Then third, when can we expect data from your own JAK1 inhibitor? Thank you.
Scott Brun: So maybe, Alex, going on with regard to our data particularly in cirrhotics and the payor community, look – we’ve been sharing the specifics on these data with a variety of different stakeholders that are involved in the care of these patients, ranging from again clinicians to various payor groups around the world. As I’ve said before, yeah, when you have been the only company that has done a dedicated study in a population that traditionally has had lower rates of response with any other HCV therapy that’s been seen, there’s great interest in how therapies are going to perform in this population, and I will say great appreciation to the fact that we did a very comprehensive 400-patient study in these patients to be able to provide them some granularity in terms of how sub-populations of cirrhotics will perform. Their view is we’re not—we understand there’s a population, but the individual clinician is going to be treating the 1a cirrhotic relapsed patient – they're not going to be looking at a blended population when they make their choice, and that’s exactly what payors want to be seeing. So I’d say there’s been a very robust interest in those data. Maybe I could go ahead with regard to the JAK question. Certainly we have two selective JAK1 programs ongoing, our partnered program with Galapagos and then our own internal ABT-494 selective JAK inhibitor. Certainly we’re looking at both of these in rheumatoid arthritis. We’ve also been studying Galapagos in Crohn’s disease. We will be seeing data on our JAK inhibitor on the first part of 2015.
William Chase: On gross margin, I would say that our gross margin profile has been a focus of emphasis on this business going back actually many, many years, even pre-spin. The way we drive those savings is a combination of everything from manufacturing efficiencies to purchasing efficiencies to even lean manufacturing techniques – that sort of thing. Certainly we’re keeping our eye on all of those balls as we move forward through the LRP. We expect over the next few years that you’ll see some gross margin profile expansion. A lot of that is going to be driven by the launch of HCV, which as you can imagine, will be a higher margin product relative to our base, so I think you’ll be very happy watching that line develop over the next couple years.
Alex Arfaei – BMO Capital: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Colin Bristow – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks for taking the questions. Another one on hep-C – just with regards to what you are seeing in terms of the Solvadi Olysio numbers, how has this changed your internal expectations regarding the number of patients treated and launch ramp? And you talked a little bit about capacity – where do you think we are now with regards to the sort of percentage of capacity, and what do you assume the limit is here? On Humira, previously you’ve given some good color on the share and trends in each of the indications. If you could give us an update on this, that would be great. And just one on ABT-199 – what are your expectations now for potential post-approval monitoring requirements? Do you envisage a scenario where patients are stratified based on tumor bulk regarding whether they need monitoring? Thanks. 
Larry Peepo: Thanks Colin – this is Larry. I’ll start with some Humira overview, as you mentioned. Certainly we’re seeing very good growth by indication. In general, I would say we’re seeing the rheum growth in kind of the mid to high single digit range. The derm area is growing probably close to mid single digits, and in gastro we’re seeing more strong double-digit growth there. Ex-U.S., it’s a little bit harder to cut it by indication, but as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we continue to see nice double-digit growth across the major markets ex-U.S. In terms of share at this point in time, we would say that we’re seeing gains in rheum – we’ve got about a 25% share there. We see steady derm share at about a 40% share, and gastro we’re seeing share gains there and we’re probably about a 45% shareholder there, toggled between number one and number two there, number one in derm. So very pleased with the progress that we’re seeing, strong commercial execution across the board. The mix of sales right now, we see RA in the U.S. is actually just a little bit below 40% of our overall sales. Ex-U.S., it’s probably around 35%. The gastro space is probably around 25% or so of the overall sales mix, both here in the U.S. and ex-U.S. The derm space is probably in the range of 15% or so of sales in both geographies, and then the remainder is a little heavier ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis component ex-U.S. – call it 25% or so, and in the U.S. that component is around 20% of our sales mix, so it’s becoming a nicely diversified book of business for us overall in both geographies. 
Scott Brun: Colin, it’s Scott. I’ll go ahead and take the 199 question. So with regard to speculating on post-approval monitoring, obviously a little bit early but as we’ve said today, we’ve been able to successfully remove the requirement for hospitalization for both the low and medium risk patients, which accounts for the majority of the patients, be it either first line or later line. We’re going to continue with hospitalization for the time being on the high risk patients, which as you said are those with the bulkier tumors, but as we include more data on those patients, we’re going to continue to see how we can refine any requirements for that type of monitoring. So I just think we need some more patients under our belts for us to be able to really say what it’s going to look like at the time of launch.
Richard Gonzalez: Colin, this is Rick. I’ll cover the hep-C one. We’re obviously pretty early into this launch, so it’s a little difficult, I think, to project off of one quarter. I’d say it is relatively consistent with how we modeled it. If you go back to the initial PI launches, what you saw was some de-warehousing occurring and then in the first quarter or two it was high, and then it started to flatten out a bit and come down a little bit. So if you think through that and you say that was a model that you wanted to follow, that ultimately you might see it peak, come down, flatten out a bit and then you see another peak occur with the launch of all orals where you see more de-warehousing occur. But at this point, you’re looking at one quarter, you’re looking at one data point, so it’s a little hard to model against that; but I wouldn’t say it was out of the realm of what we anticipated. As far as capacity is concerned, I think we’ve talked before about the capacity. We do anticipate that there will be some expansion of capacity with all oral coming into the marketplace, so I think we will see, particularly in the United States, some expansion of capacity going forward, so we will see more patients being able to be treated by the time those products get to the marketplace.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Colin; and Elan, we have time for one final question.
Operator: Our final question today is from Mark Goodman, UBS.
Mark Goodman – UBS: Yes. Can you talk about the PARP and the market, and how you view your product in comparison to the other products?
Scott Brun: Yeah, definitely. Mark – Scott Brun. So Veliparib, our PARP, one of the things we’ve tried to do differently from the competition is to not just limit the use of the PARP mechanism as monotherapy in genetically deficient tumors, such as breast cancer with the BRCA mutation. So I think you can see from the Phase III trials that we’ve started so far, as a neo-adjuvant therapy in triple-negative breast cancer, these are for women who have been initially diagnosed with breast cancer where we treat with the Veliparib-based regimen prior to therapy to de-bulk the tumor. And then certainly in non-small cell lung cancer which is an area that no other PARP inhibitor has explored, we’re able to go there because we found a way to successfully combine with carboplatin-based chemotherapy. So we’re really looking to more broadly leverage the potential of PARP by using it in combination with chemotherapies reflected in our initial Phase III trials. We have an ongoing Phase II trial where we’re using it in combination with whole brain radiation in patients who have brain metastases from lung cancer. That study is going to be reading out later this year. Looking at a variety of other solid tumors in combination with other chemotherapies as well. So I’d say through a lot of the work that we’ve been doing, we’ve been able to set the stage to be able to do things with our PARP that, frankly, the competition is not currently pursuing, so I think it really broadens our opportunity for Veliparib as a consequence.

Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry Peepo, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Larry Peepo: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the question-and-answer portion of the call are Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President of Business Development, External Affairs, and General Counsel; and Scott Brun, Vice President of Clinical Development. Rick will begin by discussing AbbVie’s results from 2013 as well as highlights from our late stage pipeline. Bill will give a more detailed review of our fourth quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for 2014. Following our comments, we’ll take your questions. Before we get started, I remind you that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Additional information about the factors that may affect AbbVie’s operations is included in our 2012 annual report on Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today’s conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie’s ongoing business performance.

So, with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Larry. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. As our first year as an independent company, 2013 certainly was an important year for AbbVie, one in which we set a strong foundation for the future. We’re pleased with our performance, and as we look back of the year, we believe we exceeded expectations on all the goals we established for the organization. We completed a seamless transition to operating as an independent country. We drove continued strong growth of Humira and several other key products in our portfolio. We delivered operational efficiencies, including improvements in gross margin. We made notable progress advancing our pipeline, including our late-stage HCV program as well as promising assets in our oncology portfolio. We expanded our pipeline with the addition of several novel assets, and we exceeded our financial commitments to shareholders, generating strong financial results. As detailed in our earnings release, we delivered 3% global operational sales growth in 2013, despite losing nearly $1.1 billion in revenue due to generic competition in our lipid franchise. Excluding sales from our lipid franchise, sales in 2013 increased nearly 10% on an operational basis. And we exceeded our original EPS guidance range, with full year 2013 adjusted earnings per share of $3.14, demonstrating the strength of our underlying business. Our performance was led by Humira, where we added more than $1 billion in sales growth again in 2013 with more than 15% in operational growth for the year. And the dynamics are favorable for continued sales growth from Humira again in 2014. This year, we expect to deliver low double-digit global operational growth for the brand. We also saw strong performance from several other products in 2013, including Creon, Synthroid, Synagis, and Duodopa. We expect that each of these products, which hold leadership positions in their respective markets, will remain important contributors to our performance in the coming year. As we look forward to the future, one of the biggest priorities we have as a company is restoring our legacy of strong growth in 2015 and beyond. To position ourselves to achieve this objective, we view 2014 as a year of investment in our pipeline, our leading brands, and our upcoming product launches. This includes preparation for the launch of our interferon-free HCD combination, which we now expect to occur in the U.S. in 2014. From a revenue perspective, as we’ve said before, 2014 is a year of transition, as we absorb the remaining impact from the loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise. We expect growth from our key brands to roughly offset the decline in lipids, and at this point, we have not included any potential revenue from our U.S. HCV launch in our 2014 revenue forecast. As a result of all of these dynamics, we expect adjusted 2014 EPS of $3.00 to $3.10. Bill will provide more specific details regarding our planning assumptions for 2014 during his remarks. We believe AbbVie has a unique investment identity, as we offer both a strong return to shareholders along with promising pipeline prospects. As you know, our business generates significant cash flow, and we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. Our primary means to do so will continue to be our strong dividend. We recognize the importance of a growing dividend to our shareholders, despite a flat top line and investment trends in 2014. As a result, upon final board approval, we expect a 5% increase in our quarterly common dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in May 2014. We’ve also utilized our strong cash flow to enhance our pipeline through licensing and partnering activities. In 2013, we added promising assets to our mid-stage pipeline. We view licensing and partnering as an important component of our R&D strategy, and we expect to continue to augment our pipeline in 2014 and in the coming years. As a biopharmaceutical company, pipeline advancement is an important component to our long term success. We place a tremendous amount of organizational focus in this area, and over the past year we’ve achieved a number of important development milestones. Certainly, one of the more significant near term pipeline opportunities is our interferon-free HCV combination. AbbVie’s multinational HCV program is the largest all-oral interferon-free clinical program in genotype 1 patients conducted to date. Genotype 1 is by far the most prevalent genotype in the developed world, and is roughly evenly distributed between genotype 1a and genotype 1b in the G7 markets. Our Phase III program includes more than 2,300 genotype 1 patients and clinical sites in more than 25 countries around the world. The comprehensive program was designed to characterize the performance of AbbVie’s therapy across genotype 1 populations. And importantly, because we have conducted independent studies in specific patient populations, we will be able to characterize performance in each patient type, with a very high degree of confidence and certainty. Our goal is to maximize SVR rates across various patient types, from naïve patients to the most difficult to treat, such as nonresponders to interferon-based therapy or patients with advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis. The large body of data we’ve collected and presented thus far certainly supports our objective and demonstrates that we have a very compelling offering for patients and for physicians. We’ve now disclosed top line results from all six of our registrational studies. Late last year, we announced results from our two placebo controlled studies, the SAPPHIRE trials, which showed that in both naïve and treatment experienced patients, our therapy, plus ribavirin, produced very high SVR rates of 96%. Our combination produced consistent and virtually identical efficacy results across both naïve and experienced patients and there were no differences observed between genotype 1a and genotype 1b patients. Additionally, the therapy was well-tolerated, with discontinuations due to adverse events reported in only 1% of patients receiving the combination. This morning, we reported top line results from the four remaining Phase III trials. Our 380-patient TURQUOISE-II study is the only dedicated trial of an all-oral therapy in the difficult to treat cirrhotic patient population. Results from the trial show that 92% of the patients treated with our combination for 12 weeks achieved SVR 12 and 96% of the patients treated for 24 weeks also achieved SVR 12. Results from the PEARL-II study showed that 100% of genotype 1 experienced patients treated with our combination without ribavirin achieved SVR 12. Results from the PEARL-III trial showed that 99% of genotype 1b naïve patients treated with our combination with or without ribavirin achieved SVR 12. We’re particularly pleased with the high level of efficacy demonstrated in the genotype 1b population, which represents roughly half of the genotype 1 patients in the G7 markets. The PEARL-IV study showed that of even the more difficult to treat genotype 1 patients, 97% of patients treated with our therapy and ribavirin achieved SVR 12, and 90% of the patients in the ribavirin free arm achieved SVR 12. So these data clearly demonstrate that our interferon-free offering provides a very high level of efficacy across genotype 1 patients with ribavirin providing additional benefit in some patients. As we look at the HCV market, and we consider which patients will likely be treated in the 2015 to 2017 timeframe, we believe the most advanced patients, those with fibrosis, cirrhosis, and patients who have previously failed treatment, will be treated first. Given that these patients tend to be more difficult to treat, we believe most physicians will likely continue to use ribavirin to optimize the likelihood of cure. Based on the high levels of efficacy demonstrated by our therapy in these tougher to treat patients, we believe we’re very well positioned for success in this market. And while our initial combination represents a simple therapy, we’re working to further simplify our initial HCV combination with efforts underway to reduce the number of pills through coformulation of all the components into a once-daily combination. We’ve begun the necessary pharmacokinetic studies and are working to advance this enhancement. We also continue to make good progress with our HCV program in Japan, where we recently started Phase III development. Japan represents the second largest HCV market globally, and we believe we’re well-positioned relative to competitive offerings. Given the prevalence of genotype 1b in the region, we’ve advanced our 12-week 2DAA ribavirin free treatment in Japan. As a result, we expect to have a two pill once a day combination for this market. We’ll present data from our Phase II program later this spring, and expect to submit our regulatory application in Japan in 2015. We believe the HCV market will remain very large and attractive for many, many years to come. to that end, we’ve recently begun a Phase II study of our next-generation HCV program, which includes a potent protease inhibitor, ABT493, and our new NS5A inhibitor, ABT530. It’s our goal with our next-generation program to bring to market a ribavirin free once daily pangenotypic combination. In preclinical studies, our next-generation assets have shown pangenotypic activity and excellent activity against key resistant mutants. They also support once daily dosing without ritonavir as well as the ability to coformulate. We’ll present data from these promising assets later this year. While HCV represents a significant and important opportunity, our pipeline includes many other promising assets. As we evaluate our pipeline prospects, including the number and potential of the opportunities, we believe our pipeline is the most robust it has ever been. We’re particularly enthused about our late stage pipeline, where we currently have 10 programs in Phase III development or in for registration. And we’re on the cusp of transitioning several additional programs into late stage trials. Our late stage oncology pipeline includes several mid and late stage assets in development for more than a dozen different cancer types. Earlier this month, we entered Phase III development for two internally discovered assets in our oncology pipeline: ABT199 and ABT888. In collaboration with our partner, we recently began a Phase III comparative combination study of ABT199 in relapsed refractory CLL patients. We view ABT199 as an exciting compound within our pipeline and we’re working quickly to advance this asset. In addition to our vanguard indication of CLL, we’re exploring ABT199 in a number of different hematological malignancies, including non-Hodgkins lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and AML. Following the encouraging efficacy results from the I-SPY 2 clinical trial, we recently started a Phase III study of our PARP inhibitor, ABT888, for [unintelligible] treatment of triple negative breast. We’ll learn much more about the efficacy and utility of ABT888 across a variety of cancer types this year, as our ongoing studies complete. We expect to start registrational studies in other indications in 2014 as well. Elotuzumab is currently in Phase III development for multiple myeloma in collaboration with our development partner. Data to date have shown promising efficacy in terms of tumor responses and delay of disease progression. Two Phase III studies are ongoing with results expected in early 2015. Daclizumab is our biologic in development for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Results from the second registrational study will read out in mid-2014, supporting regulatory submission for daclizumab later this year. Despite advances in the MS category, there continues to be a significant need for safe, high-efficacy agents, and we believe daclizumab has the potential to deliver the right balance of high efficacy, a manageable safety profile, and a high level of patient compliance. Elagolix is our compound in late stage development for the treatment of endometriosis. Elagolix has a unique profile, with the potential to provide symptom relief and reduction while avoiding adverse effects that can sometimes be associated with current treatments. We’ll see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies in endometriosis in the second half of 2014. The Phase IIB study in uterine fibroids, which we initiated last year, also continues to progress well. Altrasentan is our internally discovered compound in development for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. In 2013, we initiated a large global Phase III registrational study. This trial, which will serve as a single global registrational trial, is expected to complete in 2017. We also have two new Humira indications currently in late stage trials, and we have Duodopa currently under regulatory review. And in addition to the late stage programs I just outlined, we also have numerous promising mid-stage programs across therapeutic areas that we focus on, including several in immunology, where we have two JAK1 programs and several biologics in development. We’ve been pleased with our pipeline program over the past year, and we look forward to a number of important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. This includes numerous Phase III initiations, data readouts from multiple programs across our pipeline, the submission of regulatory applications for two major late stage programs, and potential product approvals. So in closing, we’ve had a very successful first year. We feel good about the high level of execution on our strategic priorities. We’re focused on continuing to drive leading performance with our flagship product, Humira, as well as other products in our specialty focus portfolio, and we continue to make good progress advancing our pipeline, which includes a number of exciting programs that have the potential to address significant medical need. As we look forward to 2014, we’re focusing on maintaining our momentum while investing appropriately to ensure a successful future. We’ve set an excellent foundation for the company in order to deliver strong growth in 2015 and beyond. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the fourth quarter and 2014. Bill?
Bill Chase : Thank you, Rick. This morning, I’ll start with an overview of our fourth quarter performance and then I’ll provide our outlook for 2014. We delivered a strong fourth quarter, capping off a year of excellent performance. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.82, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items. This exceeded our outlook for the quarter. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.70. Total sales in the fourth quarter exceeded $5.1 billion, ahead of our outlook. Sales decreased 1.1% on an operational basis, which excludes an unfavorable 0.7% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding sales from our lipid franchise due to loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 7.9% on an operational basis. Fourth quarter growth was led by Humira, which had global sales of more than $3 billion, up 13.4%. We continue to see strong growth in the underlying markets, and a positive impact from the global launch of the UC indication, which continues to progress very well. In the U.S., Humira sales increased 18.1%, reflecting continued market expansion as well as share gains, particularly in the gastro segment. Internationally, Humira sales grew 8% on an operational basis. As we forecasted in October, international growth was somewhat lower in the quarter, due to the impact of tender timing with [unintelligible] growth in the third quarter. International growth is being driven by continued uptake of new indications, share gains, and double digit growth in most countries. For the full year, international Humira sales increased nearly 12% on an operational basis. Global Humira sales for 2013 were $10.7 billion, up roughly 15%, exceeding our original forecast for the year. As Rick mentioned, in 2014 we expect global Humira sales to grow at a low double-digit pace, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Androgel sales were $289 million in the fourth quarter, down versus the prior year, reflecting continued moderation of market growth and other dynamics. Androgel remains the testosterone replacement market leader, with more than 60% market share and achieved share gains during the second half of 2013. In 2014, we expect Androgel to be flat to somewhat down, as market conditions stabilize and we lap the impact of [rebating] actions and account losses in early 2013. As expected, all of the products in our lipid franchise are now experiencing generic competition. Sales of Niaspan were $31 million and TriCor/Trilipix sales were $29 million, both down significantly versus the fourth quarter of 2012. As forecasted, the decline in the lipid franchise was most pronounced in the fourth quarter, and in 2014 we expect these trends to continue. Global Lupron sales were $209 million in the quarter, roughly flat on an operational basis. For the full year 2013, Lupron sales were $785 million. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintains significant share of the market. In 2014, we expect Lupron sales to be down modestly from 2013. U.S. sales of Synthroid were $189 million in the quarter, up 12.8%, with full year sales up roughly 13%. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership, despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. In 2014, we expect to see similar growth trends for Synthroid. U.S. Creon sales were $115 million in the fourth quarter, up 9.3%. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the majority of new prescription starts. We expect high single digit sales growth for Creon in 2014. Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson’s disease, grew 15.7% on an operational basis this quarter. Duodopa is currently approved in Europe and other international markets. In 2014, we expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa, and in the U.S. we expect a regulatory decision on our filing in the first half of this year. Moving on to our fourth quarter P&L profile, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 77.1%, excluding intangible amortization and other specified items. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter, and reflected operational efficiencies and product mix across our portfolio, including Humira. Adjusted SG&A was 26.5% of sales in the fourth quarter, reflecting heightened investment in our growth brands. And adjusted R&D was 15.6% of sales, driven by increased funding of our emerging mid and late stage pipeline and the continued pursuit of additional Humira indications. Net interest expense was $68 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 22.2% in the fourth quarter. Now I’d like to discuss our outlook for 2014 and specifically how we’ve constructed our plan for the year. As Rick mentioned, we are now expecting a U.S. approval for our HCV regimen in 2014. As you know, we’ve seen these types of products launch quickly, generating significant sales early in the launch. Since we cannot yet forecast the specific date of our approval, our guidance for 2014 excludes any revenue benefit associated with the upcoming HCV launch. We have, however, included the appropriate level of investment to launch the brand, reflected in higher SG&A expense this year. We’ll keep you apprised of our program status as the year progresses. In the meantime, you should model the year as follows. We expect the total company 2014 sales of approximately $19 billion, reflecting growth from our key marketed products offsetting the remaining decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of roughly 1% for the full year. We’re committed to improving our gross margin ratio in 2014, despite the loss of high margin lipid sales. As a result, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 79% for the year, reflecting actions we’ve taken to further improve our margin profile. As we’ve noted, we currently have a record number of Phase III programs in active development, and are on the cusp of transitioning additional programs in 2014. We have a number of exciting opportunities in oncology, HCV, and immunology, and other areas that warrant investment. As a result, we expect R&D expense to be around 16% of sales, reflecting an increase in R&D spending over the prior year. We also expect to see an increase in SG&A as we invest in our key brands, including Humira, where we’re pursuing opportunities to further increase penetration rates across indications and drive both disease and brand awareness. And, as I noted with our U.S. HCV launch in 2014, we’ll be making the appropriate investments this year to maximize the potential for this important program. Therefore, we expect SG&A expense to approach 28% of sales in 2014, an increase over the 2013 profile. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $275 million for the full year, and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2014. Given this profile, we are forecasting an adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $3. 00 to $3.10. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for the year excludes $0.37 per share, primarily related to noncash amortization expense and ongoing separation costs. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter of $0.67 to $0.69. This excludes roughly $0.08 of specified items and noncash amortization, resulting in a first quarter EPS in the range of $0.59 to $0.61 on a GAAP basis. Our first quarter outlook reflects a flat top line, including roughly 1% negative exchange. We expect a gross margin ratio somewhat in line with our full year guidance and we expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to be higher than our full year outlook, consistent with historic quarterly trends. So, as we look back, we are very pleased with AbbVie’s performance in our first year as an independent company. We delivered on our commitments, and exceeded our original forecast for earnings per share. Looking forward, 2014 will be an exciting year, with numerous data milestones, key product submissions, and continued execution across the organization. The investments we’re making this year are expected to drive meaningful growth in 2015 and beyond. And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo: Thanks, Bill. We’ll now open the call for questions. Operator, we’ll take our first question, please.
Operator: [Operator instructions.] Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs: Question is regarding the whole hep C marketplace. Now we’ve seen all of your data, we’ve seen all of Gilead’s Phase III data. We’ve also seen the initial launch of Solvadi, which is clearly very, very strong. And then I’m just wondering if you can sort of opine with us, how do you see the market shaping up? And just in terms of, I don’t know if you’d want to provide any of your views in terms of market share differences, but how do you see the market share playing out between these [unintelligible]? And then secondly, if you could talk about Humira and if you could confirm some of the [unintelligible] patents on Humira and what that might mean longer term for biosimilar competition.
Rick Gonzalez : As far as the launch that we’ve seen so far in the ramp in the HCV market, with the Gilead product, I think it’s going as we would have expected it. This is a market, as Bill pointed out, that you get very rapid uptake. It will be important to see how much of the uptake is in genotype 2 and 3 patients, and how much of it is the impact of the existing PIs that are in the market today. And so it doesn’t surprise me at all, but it doesn’t take a lot of patients to get that level of sales with these kinds of products. And it’s one of the reasons why one, we’re excited about the market, and two, ultimately it’s one of the reasons why we chose not to build into our forecast the launch, because even a couple of months different can have a substantial impact on the performance of the business. As far as how we’ll compete in the marketplace, you’ve seen all of our data, you’ve seen the competitive data. We feel very good about the data. As we look at this market, as I indicated in my comments, and the dynamics of the patients that are likely to be treated first, and the other capabilities that you’re going to need to have to be successful in this market from a commercial standpoint, from a market access standpoint around the world, I think we’re very well positioned. And as I said, if I look at the profile of our therapy, if I just go through each of the category of patients, you look at our cirrhotic data, it’s the only trial that’s ever been done in dedicated cirrhotic patients, clearly unprecedented results compared to standard of care. And I think we’re very pleased with what we saw out of that trial for cirrhotic patients. If you look at our experience data, 96% [SER12]. When I look at that in comparison with the published ION2 data, with ribavirin, it matches up very nicely against that at 96.3 or 96.4. If I look at genotype 1b naives, 99% without ribavirin. If I look at genotype 1b experienced without ribavirin, 100%. And 1bs represent 50% of the total population that we’d be going after. Hard to beat 99% and 100%, so we obviously feel very good about that. And if you look at genotype 1as, with ribavirin, at 97%, highly tolerable therapy, very low adverse event rates, we feel good about our ability to stack up against anything that we’ve seen out there and be able to compete very effectively against that. It’s a big market. It’s a market I think that very clearly, if you look at payers, if you look at health systems around the world, if you talk to physicians and patients, they want alternatives, especially alternatives that perform at this level. And so I think we’ll do very, very well. And what we’re focusing on now is getting our submission in, getting the product approved, and launching the product aggressively in the marketplace. Humira, as far as the patents are concerned, we haven’t disclosed publicly a lot of the patent data. We’ve obviously aggressively worked to not only take the existing patent portfolio that we have, which we have a fairly large patent portfolio around process patents, formulation patents, some method patents. But we have a very large number of applications, in the neighborhood of a couple hundred. Many of those we’ll issue. We believe that those are important patents, and certainly we will make sure that we enforce any patents that we have in this area, and it’s one of the lines of defense that we have put in place, and I think we feel pretty good about it. But we’re not prepared to give you a lot of specifics on any individual patents at this point.
Operator: Our next question is from Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
Jeff Holford - Jefferies : Just first off, on the guidance, assuming obviously you’re not including any revenues in the guidance, can we just safely assume, if you do get revenues that flow through in 2014, that would essentially be upside for the earnings guidance as well? Secondly, I wonder if you can just help us think about your SG&A phasing through the year. When would you anticipate that we start to see the load from the hep C cost savings in the SG&A? Also, just in terms of the fixed dose combination, on the current [unintelligible] regimen, are you assuming you’ll have to do a full Phase III there or would your development plan on that just be more like a bridging study?
Rick Gonzalez : Maybe I’ll take the guidance question, and then Bill, you can talk about the gating and SG&A, and Scott, you can talk about the fixed dose combination. So maybe let’s walk through and give you a little perspective on the timing. As I think you know, we have been given breakthrough therapy status for this product, and we expect to get priority review. With priority review, we will have an 8 month PDUFA clock. And so we know the outer limits of when approval could occur based on when we’re estimating that we’ll submit to the agency, but as we look to priority reviews - and we’ve seen priority reviews that are as short as 4.5 months, and we’ve seen some that have gone all the way out to 8 months. And so there’s this window that we’re operating in that’s just not clear to us at this point where we will be in that window. So our goal is to get the submission in as rapidly as possible, and then start to work with the agency on answering any questions that they have. As we get closer through that review process, we will begin to get more clarity as to the timing of that, when we would get that approval, and we’re obviously prepared to be able to launch as soon as we gain approval of the product. So depending upon when that word would occur, if it was appropriate to adjust a quarterly guidance, we would go ahead and make that adjustment during that quarter. So we’ll just have to see when we hit in that window that I just described to you.
Bill Chase : On SG&A, obviously we’re going to be doing everything we can to make sure that we live up to the opportunity that we have here. We’re investing right now, but that said, the investment will grow over the course of the year, and we’ll see, on a relative basis, more investment in the back half of the year than the first half.
Scott Brun: On our fixed dose combination, which takes all three of our direct acting antivirals and coformulates them into a once-daily presentation, we’ve got a prototype formulation that has been performing very nicely with our pharmacokinetic assessments in humans. And right now we’re moving forward very aggressively with the program. We’re in discussions with regulatory agencies with regard to exactly what the program will take. And that’s all I want to say about that right now.
Operator: Our next question is from Steve Scala with Cowen.
Steve Scala - Cowen & Company : Of the 2014 guidance for Humira, of low double-digit, can you dissect that by geography, so what we should be looking for in the U.S. and OUS? And in the U.S., how much of that might be from price and how much might be from volume?
Scott Brun: We are obviously guiding low double-digit for the entire year on Humira. It will be a little higher growth in the U.S. than ex-U.S. The pricing on this brand, as you know, we do see pricing pressures ex-U.S. that mute the overall growth ex-U.S. We have had the ability to take some price over the past couple of years in the U.S. So in that double digit guidance, I would expect slightly higher growth in the U.S., because of that pricing effect, but both markets will be above double-digit growth.
Steve Scala - Cowen & Company : For many reasons, your P&L in 2014 is quite unusual, but it would appear that 2015 promises standout top line growth and substantial margin improvement. At this early juncture, would you have any objection to that thinking?
Bill Chase : I think it’s obviously a little early to be giving 2015 guidance. There certainly is a dynamic that’s going to play out in ’15 as we see the full brunt of HCV kick in. So that would certainly expect some gross margin expansion, because we’d expect that to be relatively above our overall corporate mix. Likewise, on gross margin, we will remain committed to driving additional efficiencies. You’ve seen some of that play out in 2013, and certainly we’re signing up for some of that in 2014. On the investment side, I think a lot’s going to depend on what we have in our pipeline. We’ve made it clear today that we’re expecting to have 10 programs in Phase III or registration this year. We’ve got a very robust pipeline. We’ve got things moving into Phase III in the subsequent years. And then likewise, on the SG&A side, what we know is Humira is the most promotionally responsive. We’ve driven very, very nice growth on that brand. We have our HCV launch kicking into full gear in 2015, and then of course we’ll have new products launching in the period right after ’15, and we want to make sure that we provide appropriately for those products and opportunities as well. So we’ll have to see.
Operator: Our next question today is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital.
Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets : A follow up to your comments on TURQUOISE-II. To what extent do you think that trial, having that dedicated Phase II trial in those important patients, is a marketing competitive advantage? And then a couple of followups, if I may. Are we going to see ABT199 data this year? And can you give us some color on the market opportunity for Elagolix?
Scott Brun: With regard to the TURQUOISE-II, when you consider the fact that cirrhotic patients have traditionally been the hardest to treat, and certainly as we see the aging of the HCV population and the rates of cirrhosis going up, we thought it was extremely important to well characterize the response in this patient population. And so absolutely. We feel these data are going to be of critical value to clinicians, to patients, to payers, in really demonstrating the characterization and certainty of response that you can achieve in this population. And as Rick said, we’re extremely pleased. The results certainly surpassed my initial expectations. They’re unprecedented, and provide considerable benefit over anything that’s currently available. With regard to 199 data flow, we’re going to be presenting some initial Phase I combination data with ABT199 and Rituxan this year. Remember that that’s the combination that’s being studied in a Phase III trial that’s getting underway that Rick referred to. We’ll also be showing some additional data in CLL that will demonstrate the longer term durability of our monotherapy, building on the very strong results that we’ve already showed, where we had a 24% complete response in CLL with 199 as a single agent in lapsed refractory patients comparing extremely favorable to the new agents that are currently being studied there. And we’re also hoping to be able to get some AML data out later this year. Elagolix, currently in Phase III on endometriosis and Phase IIB in uterine fibroids. When you consider endometriosis, a condition that affects millions of women worldwide, resulting in considerable symptomatology for which there are really no good therapies right now. Existing ones, while they may be able to control symptoms, create their own set of problems by really putting women into a menopausal like state. We feel there is significant potential for elagolix as a chronic therapy in endometriosis, certainly allowing patients to avoid more extreme measures such as surgery, which, when you consider the population of women here who are of an age where they’re considering childbirth, certainly they don’t want to have to take that type of option. So with regard to its overall tolerability and efficacy profile, certainly we feel that there is very significant opportunity in endometriosis, as well as fibroids. Again, there’s no chronic therapy available and all the other limitations that exist in therapy that I outlined in endometriosis are also present.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMC.
Chris Schott - JPMorgan Chase: I just wanted to follow up on your expectations for the HCV market. Can you talk about how you’re thinking about competition based on price? Is that a lever that you consider to gain share?
Rick Gonzalez : As we’ve said a number of times, when you look at the attributes of this product, the performance speaks for itself. This is a highly competitive product against anything that we’ve seen out in the marketplace. If you look at our capabilities from a commercial standpoint, and a market access standpoint, I think they speak for themselves as well. You only have to look to Humira, which has a lot more competitors than this market is going to have. So I think from that standpoint, we feel good about our ability to be able to go into the market and compete effectively. Having said that, I’d also tell you this is a highly competitive market and it’s not prudent for us to lay out what our commercial strategy is going to be, and we’re not going to lay out what our commercial strategy is going to be. And that includes we’re not going to lay out what our pricing strategy is as part of that. So that’s probably not the answer you were looking for. Sorry, but certainly I think if you were sitting in our chair, that would be the prudent way to deal with this.
Operator: Our next question is from Colin Bristow of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Colin Bristow - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hep C in TURQUOISE-II, can you comment either quantitatively or qualitatively on the rates of anemia you’re seeing? Just wanted to get a sense of the tolerability as you think about the real world setting. Also, on TURQUOISE-II, could you speak to the relapse and breakthrough rates in the genotype 1a population and/or the treatment experience? And with regard to Androgel and the testosterone replacement market, script trends have indicated a modest decline over the last few months, and I just wanted to get your sense or what you’re hearing from the front line regarding this, and your expectations for the overall market in 2014.
Scott Brun: Regarding TURQUOISE-II, first, getting at the tolerability, when you look at the results in both the 12 and the 24 week arms, we saw very low rates of discontinuations for adverse events, only on the order of 2%. Certainly, when you look at rates of anemia, while I don’t want to quote specific numbers, certainly they were not different from what we’ve seen in the non-cirrhotic populations within our program. Again, I don’t want to parse the TURQUOISE-II data to any greater extent than we’ve released. We’re going to be providing more detail on that at EASL, but you know, what I can say is that we anticipate that the majority of patients will only require 12 weeks of therapy to achieve these very high SVR rates, and certainly the 24 week therapy will likely only be applicable to a very limited minority subset of patients.
Rick Gonzalez : And on Androgel, certainly the market has slowed, particularly versus what we saw in 2012. That said, we are picking up share and we’ve seen nice progress on that in the back half of ’13. And frankly, a lot of the pricing pressures are now behind us, and pretty stable. So we’re pretty pleased with our position. That said, we are taking a realistic view of that market and brand in 2014, which is really the logic behind the guidance that we provided this morning.
Operator: Our next question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse : On the pipeline, one on the ABT888. Just wanted to get a sense of how you see that potentially differentiating itself from other agents in the breast cancer space. Obviously some interesting data so far. But how do you see that playing out? And when will we actually see the data behind that one in breast cancer and the other indications that you mentioned? And the other one, just on 199, do you see any change in your expectations around that being competitive in the front line or relapse [unintelligible] setting just given the strength we’re seeing with [unintelligible] and the new data they’ve commented on with the early stop of their study there, the strong data?
Scott Brun: With regard to 888 and its ability to differentiate itself from other agents in breast cancer, and certainly it’s important to mention other malignancies as well, certainly there’s some characteristics of [unintelligible] 888 relative to other PARP inhibitors that suggest it may actually be superior. It’s able to cross the blood-brain barrier. And perhaps even more importantly, we’re able to combine effectively with other chemotherapies, where some of the other PARP inhibitors really had challenges with that. So as a consequence, the other PARP inhibitors are really limiting themselves to cancers with genetic susceptibility to PARP, those with the BRCA mutation, and certainly are also going more into late stage populations. We feel that, again, particularly with veliparib’s abilities to combine with other modalities like platinum chemotherapies and radiations that also damage DNA, that we’re able to have a much broader opportunity with our PARP. Certainly the [Neoadjuvant] study allows them to take advantage of treating patients with earlier stage triple negative breast cancer. And going even beyond breast cancer, we’ve got ongoing studies with combination therapies in ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and in use with [whole brain] radiation in the case of brain metastases from lung cancer. So we feel that we’re able to fully leverage the full potential of the PARP platform with veliparib as a consequence of these characteristics. With ABT199, when you look at the exquisite potency of the agent, its ability to drop CLL malignant cell counts in the blood by 90% within 8 hours, we feel that this factor is what’s going to allow us to differentiate. Indeed, later in 2014, collaboration with our partner. We’ll be starting a Phase III study in first line CLL, in combination with GA101. And the thought here is that through the potency of 199, we can drive disease state to an extremely low level. I referred earlier to the very promising complete response rate that we’ve seen, 24% with 199 as a single agent in patients who have cycled through, on average, four prior therapies. When you look at ibrutinib, in a similar population, those complete response numbers as a single agent are in the low single digits. And so what we’re doing is working on study designs to, again, really be able to take advantage of the potential to drive to very low levels of disease activity and potentially move away from chronic therapy, which is going to be the case with ibrutinib and [unintelligible], and really look at can we achieve disease free remissions and possibly even functional cures.
Operator: And sir, I am showing no further questions at this time.
Larry Peepo: Okay, terrific. Well, thanks, operator. We’ll conclude today’s call with some final remarks from Rick before I wrap up the call today.
Rick Gonzalez : Thank you, Larry, and I’d like to thank everyone for joining us. As we indicated when we launched the company, we had a primary objective for making sure that we set up the organization in a way that we could be successful in 2013, and I think we accomplished that. And I think we’re off to a good start in 2014. We always said those would be transition years for us, and that we were setting ourselves up to be able to return to strong growth in 2015 and beyond, and that is still our intent, and I think we’re tracking well against that objective. If you think about 2015, as Bill mentioned to you, it’s early to talk about guidance, but although we’ll get a positive impact on HCV in 2014, as we launch the product, we will get a very significant impact in 2015. And we’ll be in a position to be able to drive that product and see significant margin drop through in the 2015 timeframe from that product. In addition, we will have worked our way through the loss of exclusivity of our lipid franchise, which is obviously creating a significant headwind for us in both 2013 and 2014. That will be gone, and we’ll see the emergence of strong Humira growth again driving the bottom line, and we should start to see some efficiencies again in that area as well. By the same token, we’ll be in a position to be able to start to launch some of the new products that we have in our pipeline. We’re particularly excited about our oncology pipeline with 199, and I will tell you personally I’m excited about what I’ve seen about 888 as well. I think it will have a significant opportunity for us going forward. Daclizumab will also be a product that we’re excited about that can launch in that 2015 timeframe, and elagolix following that. So I think we have built a robust pipeline that should give us an opportunity to be able to deliver on the expectation that we have for ourselves, and the one that we communicated to you. So we’re looking forward to doing that.

So, with that, I’ll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Yes. We are offline. Thank you, Larry Peepo. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.82 exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. Our performance demonstrates the strength and durability of our portfolio, as we deliver these results despite the continued impact of generic competition on our lipid franchise. Today, we also raised our full year EPS guidance for 2013 reflecting the high level of execution we’ve demonstrated this year. As we embarked on this year, we set forth several key priorities for our business, including, a seamless transition to operating as an independent entity, maximizing the performance of our current product portfolio, advancing our pipeline including our late-stage HCV program and other key assets and delivering operations efficiencies. As we assess our progress, I believe we have met or exceeded expectations on our strategic objectives. I’m pleased with the performance of our product portfolio including HUMIRA, which delivered more than 19% global operational growth in the quarter. This strong growth was driven by several factors including continued robust market growth resulting from increasing penetration across therapeutic categories and geographies. Market share gains particularly in the GI segment where our UC launch is progressing ahead of our expectations. And we delivered this performance despite the entry of new competitors into the category. As we’ve indicated in the past, HUMIRA's broad label and new indications are a competitive advantage and UC is the latest example of that. We’ve launched UC indication in a number of key countries and it quickly gained meaningful market share and we’re working to secure market access and reimbursement in a number of additional markets in the coming months. Today, in Western Europe, we’re currently capturing roughly 25% of the UC market. And in the U.S. the UC indication has contributed significantly to our strong performance in the IBD market as HUMIRA is now the market leading biologic in the GI category. We continue to pursue HUMIRA in several other indications which are currently in late-stage developments. Earlier this month, we presented Phase 2 data in patients with HS, a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Our Phase 3 trials are fully enrolled and we’re targeting commercialization of this indication in the 2015 timeframe. Given the lack of effective treatment options, we believe HS could represent a several hundred million dollar peak year opportunity for us. HUMIRA continues to gain or hold market share across all indications. As I mentioned earlier, our strong UC launch has helped us attain the number one position in the GI category. We also hold the number one market share position in dermatology. And we continue to hold steady share in rheumatology despite the entry of new competitors. We’ve been very pleased with HUMIRA's exceptional performance this year and we’re well on track to achieve our 2013 guidance for the product. Beyond HUMIRA, we also saw a strong performance from several other products including CREON, Synthroid, Zemplar, Synagis and Duodopa. Though certainly not as high profile as HUMIRA, we’ve been pleased with the performance of these durable and growing brands. In the quarter, we also made good progress on other key strategic objectives. We continue to drive operational efficiencies including gross margin improvement, which Bill will discuss in more detail in his remarks. And we’ve begun the process of creating our own efficient back office infrastructure that is more appropriate for an independent biopharmaceutical company. In addition to our strong commercial and operational performance, we’ve also made significant progress on our pipeline, where we have placed a tremendous amount of focus. As we evaluate our pipe line prospects including the number and potential of the opportunities, we believe our pipeline is the healthiest it has ever been. In addition to assets currently in late-stage such as HCV, daclizumab, elagolix, (inaudible) and elotuzumab were on the cusp of transitioning several additional programs in the Phase 3 development, including but not limited to ABT-199 per CLL and ABT-888 per select solid tumors. And we expect continued pipeline advancement between now and the end of 2014 including late-stage trial completions, regulatory filings and new product approvals. Let me now provide you with an overview of some of the key highlights in our pipeline. We expect numerous HCV data milestones to be achieved, including the results from our six Phase 3 interferon-free combination studies starting later this year and into early 2014. We also present data from these studies at EASL in April and other medical meetings throughout the course of 2014. We remain on track with our U.S. and EMEA regulatory submissions in the second quarter of 2014, an anticipation of early 2015 commercialization, we are actively building the appropriate infrastructure, including medical care personnel and our sales organizations. We’ll present data from our Phase 2 HCV program in Asia and plan to start our Phase 3 program in Japan in the first half of 2014. Japan represents the second largest HCV market globally and we believe we’re well-positioned relative to competitive offerings. Given the prevalence of genotype 1b in the region, we plan to advance our 12-week two DDA treatment in this area. We also have a strong commercial presence in Japan which we’ve has been in place for a number of years. We remain on track to start our Phase 2 studies of our next-generation HCV compounds by the end of this year. As a reminder, our next-generation assets include a potent protease inhibitor, ABT-493 and our new NS5A inhibitor ABT-530. In preclinical studies, these promising assets have shown pan-genotypic activity and excellent activity against key resistant mutants. These assets also support once-daily dosing, as well as the ability to co-formulate. Commercialization of our next-generation compounds could occur in the 2017 timeframe. Now moving to our oncology pipeline, we’ll see continued dataflow from our Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199. The Phase 2 single-agent study in previously treated CLO patients with 17p deletion, will likely read out at the end of 2014. Additionally, the Phase 3 comparative study of ABT-199 plus Rituxan versus Rituxan plus chemotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL will begin in early 2014. The ongoing studies of ABT-199 will continue to collect data and in 2014 we’ll present data demonstrating the durability of the treatment effect. We also expect to present combination treatment data, as well as results from some of our ongoing studies in other cancer types. A number of our mid-stage studies of our PARP inhibitor ABT-888 will also read out in the coming months and throughout 2014, beginning with data that will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium this December. From our neuroscience pipeline, in 2014 we will present data from our Alpha-7 NNR agonist ABT-126, which is currently being studied in Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. We also see data from the second of our two registrational studies for daclizumab in mid 2014. As a reminder, that study the DECIDE trial is somewhat unique and that is designed to show reduction of annualized relapse rates and disability progression in patients with the relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis versus an active comparator. Assuming favorable results, we plan to submit the regulatory application for daclizumab in the second half of 2014. We will also see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies of the Elagolix in the endometriosis in the second half of 2014. And finally, we look forward to seeing Phase 2b data in RA from our partnered selective JAK1 inhibitor late next year. We continue to augment our pipeline through a conservative focused effort on strategic licensing, acquisitions and partnering activity. We have targeted large and growing specialty focused therapeutic areas that enhance our current franchises and our emerging pipelines. In the recent years, we have added more than a dozen promising assets to our portfolio. Last month, we announced two new collaborations. First, we entered into a global licensing agreement with Ablynx to develop and commercialize an anti-IL-6 Nanobody for autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Early clinical work in RA shown promise and given the molecule’s unique characteristics, we believe there is room for therapeutic differentiation there. In addition, we entered into a global alliance with Galapagos to discover and develop novel therapies for cystic fibrosis, but there is still a significant unmet need.  In closing, as we approach the end of our first year as an independent company, we feel very good about the progress we’ve made, executing our key strategic priorities. We’re pleased with our performance this quarter, while we saw strength across our portfolio including double-digit growth from HUMIRA and growth from a number of other products. We’re taking the necessary steps to build a more efficient organization, as we move to a fully independent operating environment beginning in 2015 and we have made significant progress advancing our pipeline and look forward to a number of key milestones in the months ahead. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bill for a more detailed view of our results, Bill.
Bill Chase:
Larry Peepo: Thanks, Bill. We’ll now open the call up for questions. Wendy, we’ll take our first question now, please.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) The first question today is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger - Morgan Stanley: Yes, hi. Can you hear me?
Bill Chase: Can hear you David. How are you?
David Risinger - Morgan Stanley: Great. Good morning. So I have a couple of questions. First of all, on Hepatitis B, could you just update us on the topline press release strategy and potential timing, so what studies we’re likely to see topline releases on the frontend of the schedule versus for example, in early 2014? That’s my first question. Second, could you talk about the FC pill burden from payer and physician perspectives? It’s not clear to me that payers and physicians will care about the number of pills for twelve week treatments and I’m guessing that’s your view point as well, but just wanted to hear your perspective on what's your hearing about pill burden for short duration treatments and whether payers and physicians will care or not. And then third, with respect to ABT-126 as an add-on for both Alzheimer's and schizophrenia, could you just remind us when we should expect topline press releases in both Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. Thanks very much.
Scott Brun: David, good morning, it’s Scott Brun. So why don’t I go ahead and take those. Again, with regard to the Phase III Hepatitis C program, all 6 studies as you know are fully enrolled and we’re very pleased with the progress that we’re making there. We will be releasing data as topline press releases later this year and moving into early 2014. I don’t want to get into the specifics with regard to which studies are going to be released, but certainly when you look at all 6, each of them is quite large involving several hundred patients. Again, looking at a variety of different contacts from treatment, naïve treatment experience, cirrhotic patients, so I think certainly each study or set of studies that we release will certainly help to provide some very solid evidence with regard to the performance of the regimen. But again look for us to start those releases later this year.  With regard to the pill burden, I think as you noted David -- with regard to the payers as well as clinicians that we’ve spoken to, cure or sustain virologic response is really keen here. And when you consider a short term regimen whether or not you’re talking 1pill, 4 pills, really what’s going to trump everything is, how well is it going to perform with regard to eliminating the virus. And certainly with regard to the performance that we’ve seen so far of our regimen in Aviator, involve treatment naïve and treatment experience patients , SVR 12 rates ranging from the mid-to-high 90% range as well as tolerability reflected by discontinuation rates for adverse events less than 2%. We really don’t feel that the pill burden is going to be material to clinicians, the payers or for that matter to patients who’re really looking to eliminate this virus.  Finally, with regard to ABT-126, the Alpha-7 NNR, we are looking in Alzheimer's disease both as a mono therapy treatment as well as an add-on to donepezil and then in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, we are looking -- we are evaluating the drug as a mono therapy. We will begin to see data in Alzheimer’s very late this year and certainly releases would probably be expected sometime within the first part of 2014, the schizophrenia's data likely coming a bit later within 2014.
David Risinger - Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Scott Brun: Thanks, David.
Operator: Thank you. The next is from Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
Jeff Holford - Jefferies: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just firstly, I wonder if you can just give us a bit more color on the HUMIRA sales potentially splitting them by the main indications if you can for the quarter. Secondly on ABT-199, I was interested just the way you put it in the press release today, it’s a large single agent study you described it as a -- with ABT-199 in the 17p deletion patients. Now that’s likely to read out by the end of next year, could that potentially be an early filing for that specific population, that’s my question. And then just lastly, I noticed that share count was down more than expected during the quarter, can you just talk a little bit about capital allocation and just how you are thinking about share repurchases going forward. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. Thanks Jeff. Let me start with the HUMIRA sales breakdown. Scott will cover the 199 question and Bill can talk about capital allocation at the end with Rick, if necessary. In terms of our mix right now, it’s interesting that in U.S., RA is now in the high 30% range. It’s a little below 40% of our total U.S. sales. Gastro is about a quarter of our sales. Psoriasis right now is about 15% or so of sales and the remainder is kind of in the spondo area of psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, those types of indications. It’s similar ex-US. I’d say RA is probably in the mid 30% of the ex-US franchise. Psoriasis again is down in that 14%, 15% range. SPA ex-U.S. is protein 30% and again gastro is probably about a quarter of our sales. So hopefully that gives you a pretty good feel of how the sales mix up today. So I would characterize it as a pretty diverse basket of sales across those four different categories.
Scott Brun: Jeff, I want to go ahead and take your question on ABT-199, our first-in-class BCL-2 inhibitor. So you’re right, we’re currently enrolling a large study in relapsed refractory CLL patients with the 17P deletion mutation, certainly a very hard to treat population. And if the results from this study looks similar to results in this population that we presented before with a overall response rate above 80%, complete response rate of 18%, we certainly think that there is the potential to be able to move forward with a filing on the basis of addressing an unmet medical need. Certainly, as Rick noted though, we’re also beginning a -- in collaboration with our partner a large Phase 3 traditional study that will compare 199 with Rituxan and a chemotherapy free regimen to a more standard chemo containing regimen.
Bill Chase: Jeff, it’s Bill Chase. We’ve been pretty consistent on our capital allocations story this year. First and foremost, this is a business that generates very, very healthy cash flow. The first thing we’re going to do with that cash flow is make sure that we reinvest in the business. You’ve seen some good progress on the deal front this year with a number of compounds announced. And certainly we continue to build out our infrastructure with capital expense that sort of thing. So that’s first and foremost. Second, the dividend is a very, very important piece of our investor identity. We have set the dividend in a very competitive payout ratio relative to our peers. And we've been pretty clear that we intend to grow that dividend over time probably more modestly in 2014, given some of the challenges with the lipid business but growing it nonetheless. And I think you can expect to see that payout ratio creep up as a result. After that, we like -- try to pay down a little bit of debt. We think that would be the right thing to do, given our balance sheet. And then above and beyond that, capital cash will build and that will be a valuable source of liquidity and flexibility for the company.
Jeff Holford - Jefferies: Thank you.
Bill Chase: We do have a buyback program, Jeff, but that is primarily geared to offset dilution of competition programs.
Jeff Holford - Jefferies: Thanks very much.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Scala with Cowen.
Steve Scala - Cowen: Well, thank you. I have two questions. I appreciate that you’re not giving guidance for 2014 but when we think about this spending levels in 2014, given the need to develop and rollout the pipeline, how would you compare spending in 2014 to 2013 on a percent of sales basis? And secondly, you’ve done a good job of downplaying the 250,000 pending patents around HUMIRA. Is that how you want us to view the patent stated as of limited ability to blunt potential biosimilars as patents expire in 2017 or ’18? I must admit I’m surprised that your state has no patents which could provide obstacles for biosimilars when they come around? Thank you very much.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. So this is Rick, Steve. So let me start with your investment question. We’re obviously going through our planning process right now. So we haven’t finalized any investment decisions yet as to how we’re going to proceed forward in 2014. But what I would say is you should think about it from this perspective. One, as I indicated in my remarks, we’re going to prepare to have a very effective launch of HCV and we need to build that infrastructure in 2014 to be prepared to launch in the early part of 2015 and that’s going to require incremental investment. The second thing is, we could have as many as seven or eight assets in Phase 3 development during 2014 and we’re obviously going to fund those Phase 3 assets to be able to get them to the market as quickly as possible. So I think there will be some increased investment, but we’re just not in a position yet to be able to tell you what that looks like. And so I think that’s how you’ve got to be thinking about it and we’ll give more guidance in the fourth quarter as to what that looks like. The second thing is -- maybe I’d answer your question a little bit differently. As you look at how we think about bio-similars, maybe let me walk you through our thought process around, because I think it helps answer your question. We certainly feel good about the patent portfolio that we have and I would not interpret it as we don’t believe that it provides a level of protection. Quite the contrary, I believe it does and will provide a significant level of protection. And we certainly intend to enforce our patents and make sure no one violates those patents. But we’re not going to talk a lot about specific patents. But more importantly, I think you have to look at the whole bio-similar situation in a broader perspective. And I tell you that we fundamentally don’t view the bio-similar market as a very attractive market. And frankly, we could get into the bio-similar market easily. We looked at it actually a couple of times as to whether or not we wanted to get into. We certainly have the capabilities for an R&D standpoint as well as a manufacturing standpoint. And we decided not to get into it for three fundamental reasons. If you look at bio-similars and you really analyze the ability of bio-similar to perform in this market, I think it raises a lot of questions, patents are only one of those. There are three basic areas that we had looked at and made a determination that it’s not a very attractive business. Number one is the predictability of commercial success. Number two is the return on the investment versus other pipeline opportunities that we have. And number three is the risk around patents and other things as well as the fact that you don’t control your own destiny. So let me walk you through each one to at least give you our view of it. If you think about the predictability of commercial success in bio-similars, you take the anti-TNF market as an example. It’s a difficult market even for differentiated innovative products to carve out much share. I mean literally, six or seven products have been introduced into that market in the last six or seven years and they’ve all gotten 2% or 3% market share. So it’s a tough market to break your way into. And these are differentiated products. Bio-similars have no differentiation at all from an efficacy or safety standpoint. In fact, I could argue with using bio-similar because they don’t have a long safety database. They’re at some disadvantage from a safety standpoint. And if they ran non-inferiority trials, they can basically say, they is no worse than X versus the innovator product. And so they really have no differentiation. The only way they can compete for market share is on price and if the innovator chooses to respond to that in some form or fashion, it’s very difficult to build models that suggest that you’re going to get any significant share in this market. So that really brings you to the second part of the analysis and that is the return on investment. So if you think about modest share gains and what kind of pricing you would have to go at with the bio-similar strategy, in our analysis, it says you have to make six or eight different bio-similars to have a meaningful impact on the business. When you develop six or eight bio-similars, the investment to be able to do that is more than a single innovative product and it approaches pretty close to two innovative products. So I guess if the only thing you had in your pipeline was this, you might invest in it. But frankly when we stack it up against the things that we have, we wouldn’t trade off six to eight bio-similars for a couple of our innovative products. And so we just don’t see a good return on investment there.  And then, frankly, then there is the last part that you pointed out and that’s risk in controlling your own destiny. If you’re going to do six or eight bio-similar products, you’re going to be walking your way through an absolute mine field of IP, thousands of patents around all of these products. And you have to make sure that you don’t step on any one of them along the way because that’s going to create a big problem for you because I can assure you just like us, every innovator is going to protect their patent position. The second thing is, you’re at the mercy of the innovator that if they change the formulation or they change the device, so they somehow innovate the product along the way, then you’re at a disadvantage. And so as we look at all these things, we ultimately don’t believe that it is a good place to be and frankly it probably gives you some picture into how we view some of our defense strategies as well as how we view how we compete in this marketplace. So hopefully, that gives you some perspective on it.
Steve Scala - Cowen: That’s great. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Thanks Steve.
Operator: The next question is from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions.
Rick Gonzalez: Sure.
Vamil Divan - Credit Suisse: One on the HUMIRA, again I appreciate the color you gave on the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the payor dynamics there, if there is anything specific in the quarter? We saw some stuff from the (inaudible) around formula decisions, anything that impact in the quarter and also maybe more looking out near to medium term, how do you see that changing? And then second one just on 199 if I could. Appreciate the comments around the studies that are ongoing. Just wondering, when we might start thinking about you looking at other non-CLL indications and from only potentially moving this product in general. And in an all over the 199 question for you so you are ongoing in non-CLL indications, which seems to make segment from, while this is about potentially moving this about potentially moving this product into those areas. Thanks.
Scott Brun: I will start with the 199 question. Scott Brun, again. So we already have some studies ongoing in non-CLL indications such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma and certainly you will be seeing some more of those data next year. And we continued to look at other opportunities within hematologic malignancies for things like potentially AML as well as looking at multiple myeloma, plus we are assessing the potential for the Bcl-2 mechanism, do have applicability in solid tumors. So all of that work, some of that is already ongoing and much to be initiated in the not-too-distant future.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay. And this is Rick. I will take the HUMIRA payer dynamics. I think if you look at one of the strengths of HUMIRA, it has been the payors and governments around the world recognized the value of this product. And so I would say, we've been in the fortunate position that we have a very strong position in the standpoint of payors. In fact, in the U.S. managed care environment, the number is around 70% preferred status, meaning they have to go through HUMIRA first as your first anti-TNF. That dynamic hasn’t been changing it all. In fact, if anything I would say is probably improving a little bit over time but we don’t see any negative dynamics occurring in that area if that’s what you were looking at. Thanks.
Scott Brun: Thanks, Vamil.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Arial Herman with Goldman Sachs.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [Ayan] in for Jami Rubin. I just have two pipeline questions. The first on ABT-199, how should we think about the potential to do some additional combo studies with GA101 or something like ibrutinib and then also with Elagolix, can you just help us understand the market dynamics and the potential size for this product? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Right. I’ll go ahead and I will start with 199. So with regard to additional combos, we are working with Roche. As you said first of all, looking at combinations with Rituxan as well as with GA101. With regard to ibrutinib and other new agents on the horizon, we are certainly interested in those types of combinations and we are talking about how best to pursue that with regard to the timing of availability of ibrutinib. Certainly with combinations like 199 in other agents or even a single agents, those are the potential that really changed the way CLL is treated, moving it from something that requires chronic therapy to a situation where you could have a well-tolerated combination that perhaps result in drug free remissions or even functional tumors.
Scott Brun: With regard to Elagolix, the opportunities, so certainly we are in Phase 3 in assessing patients with endometriosis, a very common condition affecting millions of women in the developed world. Certainly, the current treatment options available have limitations with regard to tolerability because of the very dense estrogens suppression, they result in you get menopausal-type symptoms like hot flash and bone loss and with Elagolix’s mechanism you get a more guided or partial suppression sof estrogen, which through Phase 2 studies we've seen reduced impact on symptoms such as hot flash or certainly bone loss. So we think that combination of the efficacy and tolerability profile will provide a very nice option for women when you consider you have the types of surgical alternatives such as hysterectomy which are quite extreme. We’re also in Phase II for uterine fibroids, a condition that can lead to very heavy marked bleeding as well as other symptomatology and again with regard to the type of estrogen suppression we’re seeing, we feel very confident in the ability to markedly impact that rate of bleeding and provide women an alternative to hysterectomy, which again represents the majority of surgical solutions for this condition. 
Scott Brun: Certainly from a commercial perspective, we’ve talked about the endometriosis indication being a potential greater than a $1 billion opportunity and certainly fibroids could be a significant opportunity as well as for us if you’re looking from a modeling perspective. 
Rick Gonzalez: This is Rick. I think the key here and what we’re working towards is, if you get sufficient pain suppression in endometriosis and a strong safety profile where this can be used as a long term and more chronic kind of therapy, it's a very big opportunity and that is why we designed the trial the way we designed it where we have two doses that were running to Phase II to determine which one of those doses best fits that profile long-term.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks all of you.
Operator:
Chris Shad - JP Morgan:
Rick Gonzalez:  Okay, this is Rick. I’ll cover the questions so. If you look at the building out the infrastructures associated with HCV I’d say for the most part it's incremental. There is -- there are certainly areas around the world where we’ll have an opportunity to be able to add some synergies with our existing structures, but I’d say for the bulk of it, you’re going to -- you should be thinking about it as incremental build. And as I said we’re going through our planning process right now, we literally have not finalized again, probably won't finalize it for another month or so, but we’re going to make sure that we’re in a position to be highly effective in that area.  As you talk about HUMIRA spend, one of the things I’d say to you is, as we approach the beginning of this year one other things that we knew is that we were going to face some new competitive challenges and in anticipation of that, we did some things from an investment standpoint that we thought would put us in a position to be able to defend and still grow our share and I’d say if I look at the results nine or ten months into it, we’re pretty happy with the investment that we made there because it's given us back a pretty healthy return and it's really -- it has allowed us from a competitive standpoint to really deal with new competition in a very effective way.  As far as HCV is concerned, I think as Scott pointed out, a significant part of this is really built around the performance of the product, We’ve done a lot of market research. And when you look at prescribing preference of physicians, the first five, six attributes are all related to performance of the product, cure rates in different populations. And so as the competitive environment rose out and as we get to our second generation product, I think we will then take another incremental step in this particular disease treatment paradigm there will be difficult to beat. I think it's incredibly difficult to get performance that’s better than this or at least what we anticipate and then it will be all about how you built through infrastructure, how well establish it is, that will make it difficult. You look again at the (inaudible), think out difficult it is for a new competitor break into that market. And it’s because of both the performance of the product and the value that it provide and the established infrastructure that in place that has a lot of experience have been able to drive those products. And so, I think HCV will play out the same way and I don’t think there’s enough head room left that anybody can truly have a very differentiated product after second generation. So, that’s how we view it.
Larry Peepo: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Marc Goodman with UBS.
Marc Goodman - UBS: Yeah. Good morning. First, can you talk about the cystic fibrosis product and what exited about that, what’s the hope there, obviously that’s interesting market. Second, HUMIRA in the emerging markets, just give us a little color there, you had mentioned something about tenders, if you can quote that a little more. And then third, I know you are working on some early stage HUMIRA combos, for like next gen technology, life cycle strategies. Can you update us on where you are there? Thanks.
Rick Gonzalez: Sure. I want to go ahead and start around with the cystic fibrosis Galapagos collaboration. So, I mean, certainly, with regard to the genetic understanding of cystic fibrosis in the mutation that lead dysfunction in the ion channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor lead to the symptomatology. We have seen introduction of a therapy like (inaudible) that can have marked impact on patients. But really is only applicable to small minority of patients. What we are exited about is, can we go ahead and take this even further by addressing patients with the much more common F-fiber weight nutrition. Really looking at combinations of two drugs, a so called the potentiator that helps the malfunctioning channel, ion channel to both proper way, as well as the corrector that helps to affect the defolding in the transport of the receptor to the cell surface. And so, we feel that Galapagos, it’s got some very, very interesting science and even though there is a timing element here, we won’t be entering clinical trials until late next year. We are using analogy of Hepatitis C, where certainly we did not begin in the lead but by leveraging certain scientific insights and taking full advantage of the ability to combine different mechanisms to get where we are now. So again I think, that’s really what excites us, the ability to make a remarkable impact on a very devastating disease and to follow on the science that -- that is already out for the minority of patients. With regard to, we’ll say, HUMIRA next generation, certainly we built a very, very strong foundation with HUMIRA and rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology. And the question is what can you do as a leader in these areas to improve upon what the anti-TNF HUMIRA specifically have been able to achieve. And so we are looking at the potential to improve efficacy, power ability, convenience across the whole patient journey within those various diseases. And we are approaching it strategically with the combination of both internal and external innovations, small molecules and biologics. So for example, we have a selective JAK1 platform. You’re certainly familiar with that, Tofacitinib which non-selective JAK. It’s consequence has limitations in its ability to dose to really get significant efficacy before you start running and decide effects. With our Galapagos collaboration, we’ve got a selective JAK1 inhibitor in currently dosing in Phase 2b in rheumatoid arthritis as well as Crohn's disease. And we feel that the ability to be able to dose these molecules higher without running in the JAK2-3 related side effects provides the potential for significant improvement in efficacy in these diseases. We also have our own internal JAK ABT-494 that’s recently entered Phase 2 studies and we think that with these two JAK mechanisms, we have the ability to have a portfolio of compounds that can address multiple disease states in -- again patients who have various stages of treatment experience. Moving on, we’ve got other external collaborations, other mechanisms like our Biotest work in Phase II with anti-CD4 mechanism. We’re very excited about the Ablynx deal that’s an Anti-IL-6R Nanobody. These Nanobodies, because of their size, have the potential for improve that tissue penetration, also the Ablynx Nanobody binds the serum albumin, which is present during information which will help the traffic to the tissues where you want it to go. So again, we think the potential for differentiation (inaudible) currently available IL-6 based therapies. And then certainly, we’re extremely excited about our Dual Variable Domain technology, DVDs which allows us really to buy specifically target two biologic mediators in disease. We’ve got ABT-122, which targets both TNF as well IL-17, which is -- have been shown probably significant role in various auto immune diseases. And so again the idea is, can we improve upon anti-TNFs with this molecule that’s currently in early development in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients, so really a wide portfolio of various approaches to build upon our current strength in auto-immune disease.
Bill Chase: Mark, its Bill Chase. As you acknowledge, we did have some tender activity in the third quarter and that did lift our international HUMIRA results a bit. The way you got to look at that, it does occur from time to time in certain markets. When it occurs, it’s generally about a 2% to 3% lift. That’s certainly what we saw in Q3 and what we’ll try to do and we have been doing is to be transparent, so let you know when that’s occurring to a way, to better understand both the quarter that’s occurring as well as the next.
Larry Peepo: Thanks Mark. Operator, we have time for one more question please.
Operator: Thank you. Our final question today is from Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.
Tony Butler - Barclays Capital: Thanks, very much. Rick, you outlined very nicely on HUMIRA and the various indications, you guys have done a phenomenal job in growing the [x-RA] indications in particular, but I wanted to just focus on RA only. Is that a market that continues to grow in volume or has it ever really reached a negative. Two very small questions for you Scott, one is what’s the strategy around other genotypes, genotype 2, 3 in particular and then lastly is ABT-493, is that boosted or non-boosted. Thanks very much.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay, maybe quickly on the RA market. RA market has penetration rates that is still under 30%, so there’s still clearly an opportunity to grow and we continue to see in most markets around the world that the RA market is continuing to grow. So it’s not growing as fast as some of the other markets like the GI market as an example, but it is continuing to grow.
Scott Brun: Tony, its Scott. With regard to our strategy on other genotypes, we are currently doing work with ABT-450 and ABT-267, which we do have activity beyond genotype 1, in genotypes 2, 3 as well as 4. So we’re currently in Phase II with those genotypes and we’ll continue to move forward, but it’s really our pan-genotypic ABT-493, ABT-530 combination that we think has the most balanced pan-genotypic activity. To your question, neither ABT-493 nor ABT-530 in the next generation requires return of your boosting. From what we’ve seen in ongoing clinical development there, pharmacologic profiles are both conducive to QD, once daily dosing without boosting.
Tony Butler - Barclays Capital: Thanks, very much.
Rick Gonzalez: You’re welcome.
Scott Brun: Thanks, Tony. And that concludes today’s conference call.

So with that I’ll now turn the call over to Rick.
Rick Gonzalez: Thank you, Larry. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We’re pleased to report strong Q2 results with adjusted earnings per share of $0.82, exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. This included strong operational sales growth of more than 5% ahead of our outlook for the quarter and adjusted gross margin ratios of more than 80%.  We delivered this performance with strong and balanced growth across our product portfolio despite the impact of generic competition. And today we raised our full-year EPS guidance for 2013, reflecting continued momentum from HUMIRA and better than expected results from our other pipeline products including our lipid franchise. We’re now seven months into our first year as an independent company and we continue to make good progress executing our key business priorities including maximizing HUMIRA’s full growth potential and advancing our pipeline. Our Q2 performance was led by HUMIRA which drove nearly 13% global operational growth. We continue to see strong underlying demand globally with particularly robust growth in dermatology and GI categories.  As we’ve said previously there are several factors we expect will continue to drive momentum, including increased biologic penetration rates, further geographic expansion, and new indications. HUMIRA offers the broadest label in the category. Our expanding list of uses includes nine approved indications in Europe and seven in the US, and we have several indications currently in late-stage trials. All told we expect new indications including those approved in 2012 to add roughly $1.5 billion in incremental global (inaudible) sales. HUMIRA’s utility and label supporting use across the broadest spectrum of autoimmune conditions is one of the many attributes that sets it apart from other products in this category. As we track new competitive entrants, performance continues to be in line with our expectations with HUMIRA continuing to gain or hold market share across indications. As I said, HUMIRA is off to a strong start in the first half of the year and as a result we now expect global HUMIRA sales growth of 14% to 15% on an operational basis in 2013. This is an increase from our previous outlook of low double-digit growth.  Beyond HUMIRA we also saw a strong performance from several other products including double-digit growth of CREON, Synthroid, Zemplar and Duodopa. Bill will provide more color on HUMIRA’s performance as well as some of the other products in our portfolio. So today I’ll spend some time discussing a few of our pipeline programs. Certainly pipeline development is critical to our long-term success and we’re very pleased with the progress we’ve seen across our mid- and late-stage pipeline programs so far this year. Over the past year and the past several months we’ve also presented important data that support our advancing pipeline and illustrate its potential to address some of the most pressing areas of medical need. I’ll start with our late-stage HCV program where we recently completed enrollment in all six of our Phase III studies that will be included in our initial regulatory submissions. Over the past several months we presented additional data from our large Phase II-b Aviator study which enrolled as a reminder 571 non-cirrhotic patients. Data presented at the EASL and DDW meetings showed patients with high SVR cure rates regardless of baseline characteristics associated with lower response to interferon therapies including baseline viral load and level of fibrosis. As I said before, our goal is to maximize SVR rates across various patient types, from naïve patients to the most difficult to treat with the simplest possible therapy, and large body of data that we’ve collected and presented thus far certainly support our objective. Recently our direct-acting antiviral combination was designated as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA, underscoring its promise in the treatment of HCV. As I’ve said, we’re very pleased with the progress that we’re making in our Phase III program. We expect registrational studies to begin to read out later this year and early into 2014 supporting regulatory submission in Q2 2014 and market entry in early 2015. In addition to our late-stage efforts we’re also advancing a compelling next-generation HCV program including a potent protease inhibitor, ABT-493, and a new NS5A inhibitor ABT-530. In preclinical studies these promising assets have shown pan-genotypic activity and excellent activity against key resistant mutants. These next-generation assets also support once daily dosing as well as the ability to co-formulate.  Our development program is progressing well and we’re on track to begin Phase II studies this year. Suffice it to say we are very committed to this therapeutic category and will continue to work to evolve the treatment paradigm. Now turning to our oncology pipeline which includes several mid- and late-stage assets in development for more than a dozen different cancers. At the recent ASCO and EHA meetings we presented additional data on ABT-199, our first-in-class Bcl-2 inhibitor in development in partnership with Roche Genentech. These data showed strong single agent activity across a number of hematological malignancies including CLL, NHL, and mantel cell lymphoma.  We recently started a large Phase II single agent single arm study in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17P chromosome deletions. We believe this study has the potential to be a registrational trial and plan to engage with the FDA to confirm our view. While these patients represent the most difficult to treat early data have been promising. In collaboration with our partner we also expect to begin a Phase III comparative trial, a combination study in relapsed refractory CLL that will evaluate ABT-199 plus Rituxan versus Rituxan plus chemotherapy. We plan on starting that in the next six to nine months. We believe that ABT-199 represents a potentially transformational approach to the treatment of CLL and other hematological malignancies and are working to quickly advance this asset. Now moving to our next oncology asset, ABT-888, our PARP inhibitor. We believe this compound holds promise in enhancing the effectiveness of common chemotherapy and radiation. We have a number of mid-stage studies underway including trials evaluating 888 plus chemotherapy in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer as well as a study of 888 in combination with whole brain radiation in patients with brain metastases.  We’ll learn much more about the efficacy and utility of this compound as we expect a number of studies to complete over the next six to twelve months. It’s likely that we will initiate Phase III studies with ABT-888 in the same timeframe as well. Moving on to ABT-126, our Alpha-7 NNR agonist in development for Alzheimer’s and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia or CIAS. Earlier this month results from our initial Phase II-a proof of concept study in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s dementia were presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference.  These data demonstrated evidence that ABT-126 treatment effect on measures of cognition were present as well as a safety and tolerability profile that supports continued development. We’re exploring a higher does range in our ongoing Phase II-b study where we’re evaluating ABT-126 both as monotherapy and in combination with standard of care. The Phase II-b trial results are on track to complete later this year, and if successful we plan to start a Phase III development in 2014.  We’re also actively evaluating ABT-126 in mid-stage trials for CIAS. We’ll present Phase II-a proof of concept data for this indication in 2014 and the ongoing Phase II-b study will read out next year as well. Now moving on to Atrasentan, our internally discovered compound in development for diabetic kidney disease, a common complication of diabetes and the leading cause of chronic kidney disease in the developed world. We presented results from our Phase II-b study at the European Renal Association Congress in May. The mid-stage trial showed treatment with Atrasentan showed significant and sustained reduction of albuminuria, the presence of protein in your urine – a symptom that is predictive of renal function. We recently initiated a large, global Phase III program which will evaluate the impact of Atrasentan on renal outcomes such as onset of end-stage renal disease, transplant, or death due to renal failure progression. This study will serve as a single global registration trial for the compound. While I won’t cover our entire pipeline today we have a number of other promising products in development which I’ll mention briefly here. Daclizumab, currently in Phase III development in partnership with Biogen for multiple sclerosis – our second pivotal study will read out next year and we’re planning global registration submissions in 2014 as well. Elagolix is being evaluated in Phase III for endometriosis and in Phase II-b for uterine fibroids. We have mid-stage trials on ABT-719 for acute kidney injury which are ongoing. We have two select JAK2 inhibitor programs in development for autoimmune diseases including our partnered asset with Galapagos as well as an internal candidate ABT-494, and we have a number of other exciting programs. I’ll conclude my remarks this morning with an update on our licensing activity where we continue to be very active. We recently entered into a global collaboration with Alvine Pharmaceuticals to develop a novel, mid-stage oral compound for the treatment of celiac disease, a common autoimmune disorder. The compound ALV-003 is currently in Phase II development and has the potential to be the first therapy to treat celiac disease.  Currently there are no approved therapies for this condition and the only option for patients is to attempt to follow a strict lifelong gluten-free diet. Total exclusion of dietary gluten is difficult because gluten is one of the most common food ingredients. Further despite a gluten-free diet up to 60% of celiac patients still have symptoms underscoring the acute need for non-dietary therapies. Alvine will begin a Phase II-b study for this promising compound in the coming months. We also recently extended our clinical development collaboration with Galapagos to include Crohn’s Disease. Galapagos plans to begin a Phase II in this indication by early 2014. The Phase II program in Crohn’s will be performed in parallel with the Phase II-b study in rheumatoid arthritis which was recently initiated. So in summary we’re pleased with our performance in the first half of 2013. In Q2 we saw another strong performance across our portfolio including double-digit growth from HUMIRA, CREON, Duodopa, Zemplar and Synthroid. We delivered higher than expected gross margin ratios and we continued strong levels of investment spending across both our marketed products and our pipeline opportunities.  And we made significant progress in advancing our pipeline. We presented compelling data on a number of compounds, we moved a promising asset into Phase III development, and we augmented our mid-stage pipeline with two opportunities to build upon our expertise and our leadership in the GI field. We expect continued pipeline advancement over the next 12 to 18 months including late-stage trial completions, regulatory filings, and new product approvals. With that I’ll turn the call over to Bill.
Bill Chase: Thank you, Rick. Today I’ll spend some time talking about our Q2 performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2013. As Rick said, we feel very good about the strong quarter and year-to-date performance we delivered. Q2 adjusted earnings per share, excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $0.82, exceeding our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.66.  Total sales in the quarter increased 5.1% on an operational basis which excluded an unfavorable 0.7% impact from foreign exchange. Excluding TriCor and Trilipix which are experiencing a loss of exclusivity, total sales increased 10.3% on an operational basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by HUMIRA which had global sales of more than $2.6 billion, up nearly 13% on an operational basis. In the US HUMIRA sales increased 16% driven by continued market expansion and share gains in dermatology and gastroenterology. We’ve been particularly impressed with HUMIRA’s performance in the gastro segment following our strong UC launch where we’ve already gained significant share globally. Internationally HUMIRA sales grew 10.1% on an operational basis. As expected we saw a modest negative impact from tender timing in some markets, particularly Brazil. Looking ahead to Q3 we expect global HUMIRA sales to grow in line with our updated full-year outlook of 14% to 15%. AndroGel sales were $258 million in the quarter, down 6.5% versus the prior year. AndroGel continues to maintain a roughly 60% share of the testosterone replacement market. Sales this quarter reflect the year-over-year impact of rebating actions implemented in mid-2012 and certain account losses. We are now forecasting full-year AndroGel sales to be roughly flat versus 2012 levels. Moving on to our lipid franchise we saw stronger than expected performance in Q2, particularly with Niaspan and Trilipix. US sales of Niaspan were $232 million, up 10% versus Q2 2012. Triplipix sales were $107 million, down 66% due to the entry of generic Fenofibrate in November of 2012. We continue to forecast 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid franchise, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion. As we said previously this decline will be most pronounced in Q4 this year due to the expected entry of generic competition for Niaspan in September and the recently announced entry of generic Trilipix earlier this month. Global sales of Lupron were nearly $200 million in Q2. Lupron continues to hold a leadership position and maintains significant share of the market. For the full year 2013 we expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2012.  US sales of Synthroid were $153 million in the quarter, up strongly. Snythroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full year we expect to see Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits.  US sales of CREON were $106 million in the quarter, up more than 20% compared to Q2 2012. Performance in the quarter was impacted by the launch of our new 36,000-lipage unit dose. CREON maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. For the full year 2013 we expect CREON sales to grow at a double digit pace. Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson’s disease which is currently approved in Europe and other international markets performed well in Q2 with growth of nearly 23% on an operational basis. We are pursuing regulatory approval for this product in the United State and expect a PDUFA date in the first half of 2014. Moving on to our P&L profile, Q2 adjusted gross margin ratio was 80.7% excluding intangible asset amortization and other specified items. This was above our expectations for the quarter due to the impact of product mix across our portfolio including better than expected performance of our lipid franchise which as you know includes some of our highest margin products. Adjusted R&D was 14.8% of sales in Q2 driven by increased funding of our mid- and late-stage pipeline assets and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. Adjusted SG&A was 27.9% of sales in Q2 reflecting heightened investment across our growth brands. Net interest expense was $75 million in the quarter and other income was $7 million. The adjusted tax rate was 22.3% in Q2. Turning now to our full-year 2013 outlook we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $3.07 and $3.13. This updated guidance contemplates sales of approximately $18.5 billion reflecting strong, balanced performance across our portfolio offsetting the decline in lipids from generic competition. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of approximately 1%. Given our performance year-to-date including the better than expected sales of our high-margin lipid franchise we are now forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 77.5% for the full year excluding non-cash amortization and specific items. In addition to raising our EPS guidance our performance this year has also allowed us to increase the level of investment behind both our pipeline opportunities and marketed products.  As a result we now expect R&D expense to be approximately 15% of sales reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline. And we now expect SG&A expense to be around 26.5% of sales in 2013 reflecting increased investment for continued growth of our key brands including HUMIRA where we’ve identified opportunities to further increase penetration rates across indications. We continue to forecast net interest expense of approximately $300 million for the full year and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range excludes $0.41 per share of non-cash intangible amortization expense, acquired in-process R&D, and certain specified items primarily associated with operations and ongoing restructuring activities. We expect that earnings per share will be $2.66 to $2.72 on a GAAP basis. Regarding our Q3 outlook we expect adjusted earnings per share of $0.76 to $0.78. This excludes roughly $0.13 of specified items and non-cash amortization resulting in a Q3 GAAP EPS of $0.63 to $0.65. Our Q3 outlook reflects sales growth in the low-single digits on a reported basis including a modest negative impact from exchange. Our sales guidance for Q3 includes the estimated impact of Trilipix going generic earlier this month and Niaspan going generic in September. We expect the gross margin ratio for the quarter to be somewhat above our revised full-year guidance and we expect R&D and SG&A as a percent of sales to be in line with our revised full-year outlook. So in conclusion we’re very pleased with AbbVie’s performance in our first six months as an independent company as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. And with that I’ll turn it back over to Larry.
Larry Peepo: Thanks, Bill. We’ll now open the call up for questions. Elan, we’ll take our first question. 
Operator: Thank you. (Operator instructions.) And our first question today is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: A couple questions for you, Scott – are you there Scott Brun? Great. Okay, so a couple pipeline-related questions. Based on your now Q2 2014 filing timeframe for your all oral Hep C regiment, can you confirm that you are now neck-and-neck with Gilead in this horserace of bringing the all oral regiment to the market? And really most importantly if you could help us to think about what the trajectory might look like, because clearly initially I think people think there’s a lot of low-hanging fruit and how are you and Gilead going to compete in the marketplace? I also think the market assumes that they’re going to get the lion’s share of the market. And then secondly on ABT-199 the potential registrational trial, can you tell us if the FDA does accept that filing what is the timeframe for bringing ABT-199 to the market? And now since Pharamacyclics’ Exchange A have already filed CLL indication how do you see that marketplace shaking up? It seems that it’s getting somewhat crowded. Thanks a lot.
Scott Brun: Sure thing, Jami. Why don’t I go ahead with the timing and such on the HCV and then I’ll get Rick to talk a little bit about the market potential. So you know, as you said we’re on track for a Q2 ’14 filing. Acknowledging it’s a very tight race we’re feeling very, very good about our position. We’re very pleased with the progress on the program and certainly it is a top priority for us to be able to move as quickly as possible on the filing. But things are going extremely well in that regard.
Rick Gonzalez: Jami, this is Rick. As far as the market launch obviously we’re planning that these two products will launch very close to one another and we do agree there will be a fair amount of pent-up demand so we’re certainly building up all of the assets we need to be in a position to be able to have an aggressive launch and feel good about our ability to be able to compete effectively in this market. You want to go back to the 199 question?
Scott Brun: Yeah, sure. So with regard to 199, yes – we just started a large trial looking at ABT-199 as an agent in the treatment of relapsed refractory CLL in patients who have the 17p deletion mutation, which is certainly traditionally a very hard population to treat. Indeed, if this trial is acceptable as a registration trial this could allow us to commercialize ABT-199 in the 2016 timeframe.  Now Jami, as you said certainly there’s a lot of activity going on with regard to development in the CLL space. We feel that with the exquisite activity of ABT-199, its ability to rapidly reduce tumor burden, it really provides us a number of opportunities to really transform the way that this disease is treated, looking at different paradigms in terms of raising the bar on response with measures such as minimal residual disease where you are clearing the body of tumor to a greater extent than we see with traditional response endpoints; and also looking at the potential to perhaps move away from chronic therapy into more limited-duration and bringing the concept of remission into CLL.
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Greg Gilbert – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, good morning, just a couple. I’m hoping you can quantify that modest tender timing effect on HUMIRA sales. Secondly, sort of a bigger picture question on long-term growth for HUMIRA: as bio-similar versions of products that will compete with HUMIRA become available around the world I’m curious on your view as to whether we will see more or less therapeutic substitution relative to what we’ve seen in the small molecule world. And then I have one follow-up.
Bill Chase: So Greg, it’s Bill Chase. The tender effect internationally was about 4%, so if you normalized for that ex-US growth would have been about 14%.
Greg Gilbert – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks. 
Rick Gonzalez: Greg, this is Rick. On the therapeutic substitution, I mean certainly as we’ve said all along we don’t believe that in the area of biologics we’ll see therapeutic substitution that’s similar to oral solids – that’s for sure. And we still believe that based on the safety track record of a product like HUMIRA, the broad indications and all the other attributes of that product that we would see certainly more modest kinds of erosions compared to anything that you’d see in oral solid deals.
Greg Gilbert – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So safe to say you don’t expect bio-similar versions of other products to create a negative growth scenario for HUMIRA, even if the HUMIRA bio-similar is years off?
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah, I don’t believe it will have a dramatic impact on HUMIRA as an indirect bio-similar competitor.
Scott Brun: Especially if it’s a bio-similar to Remicade for instance which is an infused product relative to an injectable. So we think that anything in that space would not have an impact on injectables like HUMIRA and/or Enbrel.
Greg Gilbert – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And last is a question on the testosterone market – you’re obviously big there and may be for some time depending on what you do on biz dev and lifecycle management. What’s going on in that marketplace other than jockeying for contracting positions, formulator positions? What’s up with the growth rate there and when can you get that turned around? Thanks.
Bill Chase: This is Bill Chase again. The growth rate has definitely slowed down versus what we saw last year. The growth in the market year-to-date through May is around 9%. We are seeing some account losses due to competitive pricing but that said we’re maintaining over 60% share. There’s a fair amount of churn in the market. We still think AndroGel is a very, very important brand and we’re confident that the sales will remain flat through the year.
Scott Brun: You know, the 1.62% version of the product now accounts for about two thirds of the overall AndroGel franchise as well.
Greg Gilbert – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: Yes, thanks very much. I have a couple questions. First, in terms of our model the international HUMIRA sales were slightly above, the US were slightly below. I’m just hoping that you could provide a little bit more color on the US performance of up 16% year-over-year. Was there any stocking or destocking in the year-ago quarter or in this quarter? And how should we think about second half US sales growth for HUMIRA? And then my second question is with respect to Duodopa, could you just update us on the potential approval timing and whether to expect a panel? Thanks very much.
Bill Chase: So David, this is Bill Chase. On HUMIRA I think the clearest thing to look at is the scrip trends which in the quarter were about 10% to 11% up in HUMIRA. We obviously did have an impact of price, so when you add it up that 16% was impacted somewhat by some channel changes in the quarter. We’re very, very pleased with that growth and we’re seeing no slowdown whatsoever in the United States. For the full year we expect growth to be in the mid-single digits, roughly split between price and volume in the US and things are going very, very well.
Rick Gonzalez: Did you say mid-single digits?
Scott Brun: Well, the outlook for HUMIRA globally is 14% to 15% this year, and as Bill said in his remarks in Q3 we also expect global growth to be in the 14% to 15%. But US specifically, David, there really shouldn’t be a whole lot of deviation from scrips plus price. And as Bill mentioned there’s obviously always a little bit of puts and takes with the channel as well.
Bill Chase: And David, the US growth was mid-double digits, not mid-single. I’m sorry. 
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: Got it.
Rick Gonzalez: Made you a little nervous for a second, huh?
Bill Chase: Sorry about that.
Scott Brun: And David, hi, it’s Scott Brun – I can take the Duodopa question. So as you know with Duodopa we’ve got a somewhat unique drug device combination system. Consequently we did have some data formatting questions of an administrative nature from FDA. We worked through those, addressed them. The NDA is filed. We’re on a 2014 timeline. Right now we don’t have any sense that there is going to be a panel but certainly as the review progresses we’ll be able to update you on that front.
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: And in terms of the 2014 timeline any more clarity – first half, second half?
Scott Brun: I think we can go ahead and say first half on that.
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Scala of Cowen.
Steve Scala – Cowen and Co.: Thank you. I have two questions on HUMIRA. You mentioned that the company has identified opportunities to further penetrate existing markets. I’m wondering if you would elaborate and quantify the magnitude of those opportunities. And secondly AbbVie has previously said that HUMIRA has a patent portfolio including over 250 granted or pending patents. Are there any patents in that estate that if investors knew their full nature and content then investors would have a substantially different view of the duration and potential of the franchise beyond 2016 and ’18? So I’m not asking for you to identify the intellectual property or tell us what it is but since you know what it is I’m just wondering whether we would have a very different view if we were aware of that data. Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay, this is Rick, Steve. So first on the penetration, we’ve talked extensively about these markets still are penetrated at relatively modest levels. So a lot of our activity that is really driving the growth of HUMIRA across most indications is driven to a great extent by increased penetration and new indications. So I don’t know that I can quantify it for you much more than that but I’d say it’s a substantial part of what we do see in growth as well as in certain markets we’re seeing some additional market share. As far as the patents are concerned, obviously that’s a highly sensitive issue for us from a competitive standpoint. So I wouldn’t give you any more color other than to say obviously we’re looking at our patent estate in a very appropriate and aggressive way and we will ensure that no one violates those patents. And I’m probably not willing to give you much more color than that.
Steve Scala – Cowen and Co.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
Jeff Holford – Jefferies & Company: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. So just first of all on HUMIRA, following the [Axio SPA] panel do you have any different view coming out of that on what the potential [bold form] indication, revenue potential is for HUMIRA? Just secondly do you have in mind based on what you know about Phase III readouts of when you would actually present your Phase III registration set of data for Hep C? Would we expect EASL next year to be the most likely venue for that? Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Why don’t you cover HCV first?
Scott Brun: Hi Jeff, Scott Brun. Why don’t I go ahead and take the HCV first. So yeah, certainly – it is our plan to have some significant data disclosures of the Phase III Program at EASL for next year. Certainly our full data disclosure plan is still in the works.
Rick Gonzalez: And then Jeff, on [Axio SPA] is a relatively modest opportunity from our perspective in the US. We’d still like to get a label claim going forward but it’s something less than $100 million. Really the big opportunity for [Axio SPA] is in Europe where it’s already approved, and so it doesn’t have any kind of significant magnitude of impact on the overall growth of HUMIRA.
Jeff Holford – Jefferies & Company: Thanks very much.
Scott Brun: Thanks, Jeff.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shad from JPMC.
Chris Shad – JPMC : Great, thanks very much, just two questions here. First on ABT-126, can you talk a little bit about the doses you’re looking at in the Phase II-b relative to the data that was presented a few weeks ago? And then secondly on that product, it seems like the use here most likely might be in combination with Aricept in Alzheimer’s. Can you just talk about your confidence that there’ll be an additive benefit on top of Aricept? I think the data so far has been in a monotherapy setting.  And then the final question coming back to bio-similar Remicade and the recommendation of full label there, were you surprised at all with the full label? And what are the implications of that for HUMIRA as we think about potential bio-similar competitors, the amount of clinical work they’ll need to get a broad label as we look at the European market? Thanks very much.
Scott Brun: Scott Brun, Chris. On the ABT-126, as you referenced we recently presented proof of concept data looking at ABT-126 as monotherapy in the mild to moderate Alzheimer’s Disease segment. And certainly what we saw there prompted us to move into our Phase II-b trials. I will say we are studying a higher dose range. I don’t want to specifically disclose the doses that we’re looking at right now because this as you know is quite a competitive area. But the Phase II-b program has both monotherapy as well as add-on to Aricept trials. Certainly with regard to the mechanism of a nicotinic neuronal agonist, we certainly think that there is a potential for add-on or synergy with regard to the cholinergic mechanism by which Aricept results in its activity.
Rick Gonzalez: Okay, and then Chris, this is Rick on the bio-similar. I’ll tell you we were surprised by the recommendation being broad without at least to our knowledge any clinical data to be able to support it. I’d say our position is we don’t think that’s in the best interests of patients. I mean it’s clearly unprecedented to have a biologic that you’re going to get ultimately an indication for that you’ve never studied in humans. And I’d say most of the feedback we get from physicians in Europe, particularly GI physicians I’d say is that they want to see data in here. So we’ll have to see how it plays out. There’s a lot of time between now and the time HUMIRA will potentially face bio-similar competition so it’s a little early to speculate how that might impact HUMIRA one way or the other. I think we’ll have to see how it plays out.
Chris Shad – JPMC : Thank you.
Scott Brun: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Marc Goodman of UBS.
Marc Goodman – UBS : Yes, good morning. So you were talking about extra spending because you were doing better on the top line, so that spending, it looked like it was in the $100 million range in the quarter and it’s going to be several hundred million for the year. So is it all HUMIRA or are you going to spend it on other things? Are you increasing sales forces there or is it just marketing? And can you give us a sense is it US or is it overseas? The second question is on HUMIRA – can you just give us a sense of the GI part of it, the indication and how much that’s helping? If you can quantify it that would be great. And then third on [Synergist], can you just help us understand how this product does quarter to quarter, what kind of timing we need to be thinking about just in modeling it quarter to quarter. And what happened this quarter relative to last quarter? Thanks.
Bill Chase: Okay, Marc, it’s Bill Chase. On the spending you’re correct – in our guidance we are raising profile for both R&D and SG&A, and what you’re seeing there is really two different things. First of all on the R&D front we’ve got a lot of programs that are very, very exciting. We’re moving to continue to develop those as rapidly as we possibly can and we think that’s the right thing to do for the long-term.  On the promotional front, on the SG&A front I think the strong performance of our growth brands has shown that that’s been a very, very effective use of investment and we are going to continue to invest heavily in those brands to make sure that we reach their full-year potential. So that’s what you’re seeing. The expense is really on a global basis on the marketing side and certainly on the R&D side it’s across the entire pipeline. [Synergist], you had asked about the timing of the quarters. What you’ll see with this product is typically the sales are more heavily weighted to the fourth and first quarters of the year. This quarter was obviously much lower based on that gating but typically the bulk of those sales fall in Q4 and Q1. And then with GI again, the gastro segment winds up being probably the fastest growing segment of HUMIRA. We’ve been very, very pleased with both the market growth and our share growth where we’re actually capturing share, and that’s going to be a big part of the HUMIRA story as it develops over the next couple of years.
Rick Gonzalez: Yeah, you know the blended gastro share for us in the US is up about five points, and a lot of that has to do with not only the strength of the UC launch but just in general the marketplace around gastro. In ex-US markets, in Europe in particular we’ve probably gained about a 20% share already in the UC space. So the launch of UC is off to a great start for us. 
Operator: Our next question is from Tony Butler from Barclays.
Tony Butler – Barclays : Thanks very much. Scott, could I get you to outline for us the HCV program in Japan? Rick, may I ask you a question around the market in HCV in the US – do you know the net number of patients that are actually treated today under the care of a physician? And then finally, Bill, one for you: the $70 million Alvine payment was not counted in the non-GAAP earnings – I think that obviously was cash. And so I’m just curious would that be a consistent practice that you would do with respect to royalty payments and upfront payments for collaborations, not only in this quarter but in the future? Thanks very much.
Scott Brun: Tony, it’s Scott Brun, I’ll start with the HCV Japan question. So as you know the epidemiology of HCV in Japan is very specific, very highly weighted to genotype 1b and then genotype 2. As a consequence our regiment under Phase II study there is a co-formulation of the protease inhibitor ABT-450 with the NS5A 267 and the Ritonavir boost resulting in a two pill once a day regiment. We’re far advanced in our Phase II program and in ongoing discussions with PMDA regarding the transition to Phase III.
Bill Chase: And on the Alvine payment you’re correct. IP R&D we treat as an item which we exclude from our non-GAAP estimates and that is our practice.
Rick Gonzalez: And Tony, as far as the number of patients being treated, the data obviously moves around a little bit but the latest data that we’ve looked at historically, if you look at 2011 roughly 175,000 patients in the G7 were treated. We expect that to grow with these next-generation products to somewhere in the neighborhood of 2x that based on the capacity that we see in the marketplace from a clinical standpoint.
Tony Butler – Barclays : Thank you very much.
Scott Brun: Thanks, Tony.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
Alex Arfaei – BMO Capital Markets: Good morning, thank you for taking the questions. First on ABT-199, based on what we saw at ASCO you seem to have a pretty compelling argument in the relapsed refractory CLL setting. I’m just wondering if there’s been any progress on tumor lysis syndrome that’s concerned there. And then a follow-up on the Galapagos JAK1. The Phase II-a in RA at [Euler] was a bit disappointing. I’m just wondering if you can just comment on the potential of that drug in RA from your perspective? Thank you.
Scott Brun: Sure, Scott Brun. So let me start with the ABT-199. Yeah, we agree that actually 199 has promise not only in relapsed refractory CLL but across a number of hematologic malignancy. With regard to tumor lysis syndrome which is a direct consequence of the explicit potency of 199 we have been enrolling CLL patients with a revised dosing schedule where we start at a lower dose and ramp up at a more slow rate, and so far so good with regard to the patients that we have been treating under that new protocol. So again, we have a number of CLL studies that are actively enrolling right now and we will continue to accrue more data with this new approach. With regard to the Galapagos data, we’re certainly not disappointed in the results. I think you need to be aware that the data that was generated included relatively small cohorts of 15 to 20 patients. And while yes, you can single out specific response metrics and bring up some questions with regard to what they mean, if you look in aggregate across all of the measures included in this study – the deaths, 28; the various ACRs – we feel that there is a very clear dose response relationship. But again, we’re going to characterize much more clearly in the large Phase II-b study that includes a variety of doses.
Alex Arfaei – BMO Capital Markets: Thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Thanks, Alex. Operator, I think we have time for one more question.
Operator: And our final question today is from Damien Conover with Morningstar.
Damien Conover – Morningstar : Great, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I have two questions. The first one, given the recent recommendation by the US Preventative Taskforce to provide Hepatitis C diagnostic testing, I was wondering if you thought there’d be an increase in the relatively low amount of patients that are currently diagnosed; and also whether or not you think Medicare will start to pay for the sort of diagnostic testing outside of folks that are currently higher risk patients.  And then just one other quick question on the Patient-Centered Outcome Research Institute, one of their first head-to-head studies is looking at comparative effectiveness from an anti-TNF-alpha versus steroids for Crohn’s and UC. And I just wanted to see how well you feel HUMIRA is positioned against steroids. And then also just generally speaking within this patient group, these patients have refractory to steroid treatment or do they generally move right on to HUMIRA? Thank you.
Scott Brun: Scott Brun, why don’t I go ahead with the HUMIRA questions. So certainly I can’t speak to details of the comparative effectiveness trial that you’re referring to, but certainly we feel the data that we have generated to date demonstrates the very compelling activity that HUMIRA provides in these steroid refractory patients. I think you need to be somewhat careful depending on the design of these comparative effectiveness trials. Certainly we’ve seen other type trials that again, with real world experience if you’re not carefully randomizing there can be biases with regard to how patients are included in certain treatments that could limit interpretation. And again I apologize I can’t provide more specifics on this design since I’m not familiar with it.
Rich Gonzalez: Okay, and Damien this is Rick Gonzalez. As far as the HCV diagnosis, I mean it’s fairly well known that there are a large number of patients in the G7 that are still undiagnosed, in the US as well. And so I think screening more patients to find out those patients that are infected are a good thing, both patients as well as the market itself. I think as far as the expansion, I mean clearly we could see greater numbers of patients being treated as more and more physician capacity comes online, and we’ll have to see how that plays out over time. Even without that this is a very, very large market. So and your final point was as far as Medicare paying for it, I think that’s a little tough for us to call one way or another. With the recommendation I think there’s certainly a higher likelihood of that but it’s a little hard to judge at this point.
Damien Conover – Morningstar : Great, thank you.
Rick Gonzalez: Thanks, Damien. And that concludes today’s conference call. If you’d like to listen to a replay of the call after 11:00 AM Central Time today go to AbbVie’s Investor Relations website at www.abbvieinvestor.com, or call 888-568-0512, passcode 72613.

Operator:  Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce Mr. Larry People, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Larry Peepo:  Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today is Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Bill Chase, Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Joining us for the question and answer portion of the call are Laura Schumacher, Executive Vice President of Business Development, External Affairs and General Counsel and John Leonard, Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer.  Today, Rick will discuss AbbVie's results from the first quarter as well as highlights from our commercial portfolio and pipeline. Following Rick's comments, Bill will give a more detailed review of the quarter and then provide an overview of our outlook for 2013 and the second quarter. Following our comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements may be forward-looking statements for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Richard A. Gonzalez:  Thank you, Larry. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for AbbVie's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call.  Today, we're pleased to report strong results in our first quarter as an independent company with adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. We delivered this strong performance despite the decline in TriCor sales due to generic competition.  During the quarter, we executed on AbbVie's key priorities. We drove continued growth of HUMIRA with more than 17% global operational growth. We advanced our pipeline with continued progress across our mid and late state R&D programs. This includes our Phase III HVC program, which is well underway and enrolling rapidly. And we delivered return to our shareholders through a strong dividend.  As we said before, 2013 is a year of transition as we absorb the impact from the loss of exclusivity of our lipids franchise. But 2013 is also a year of execution across both our commercial portfolio and our pipeline. And we're off to a strong start on all fronts.  As I mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA, particularly robust growth in dermatology and GI. Our global launch of UC is going well with strong uptake in both the U.S. and Europe. Beyond UC, we continue our development efforts for HUMIRA with several new indications currently in late stage trials. We expect a cadence of data, registrations, and regulatory approvals over the next few years. This includes our U.S. regulatory application for (Axiospa), which is currently under review. And we also expect to submit our U.S. regulatory application for pediatrics' Crohn's disease in the coming months.  HUMIRA currently offers the broadest label in the category. Several of the new indications we are pursuing will be unique, unique to our label and will help us further differentiate from competitive products and add to the sustainability and future growth of HUMIRA. All told, we expect new indications including those approved in 2012 to add roughly $1.5 billion in incremental global sales.  As we track new product entrance, performance continues to be in line with our expectations with HUMIRA continuing to gain or hold market share across all indications. Bill will talk more about HUMIRA and our other product performance in the quarter as well as our expectations for the year. But it's fair to say that HUMIRA is off to a strong start this year, well on track to achieve our sales growth outlook for the product in 2013.  Now moving to our pipeline, as a bio-pharmaceutical company, advancing our pipeline is paramount to our long-term success. We're focused on delivering innovative therapies to address the most pressing areas of unmet clinical need. And we're encouraged with our progress. Over the past year, we've advanced two promising programs into Phase III development including our Interferon free HVC program, which I'll discuss in more detail here in a moment.  We also expect to advance seven additional programs into late stage clinical trials over the next 12 to 18 months. For example, Atrasentan, our newly discovered compound in development with diabetic kidney disease. We'll present results of our Phase IIB study at the European renal association meeting next month. And we're on track to initiate the Phase III program in the first half of this year.  ABT-199, our next generation BCL-2 inhibitor in development in partnership with Roche Genetech has shown strong activity in hematological malignancies. Earlier this month, we presented Phase I data showing patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with ABT-199 experienced rapid tumor reduction. We'll present additional data at the upcoming ASCO and EHA meetings in June.  As discussed on our last quarterly conference call late last year, we paused dose escalation and recruitment in several ABT-199 studies as we worked to refine the dosing and monitoring approach for patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome. We recently proposed an amended study protocol for ABT-199 in CLL. Upon approval by the FDA, dose escalation and new patient recruitment will resume.  It remains our goal to initiate Phase II and Phase III studies in relapse or refractory CLL patients this year. We continue to have a high level of enthusiasm for this compound, which we believe holds promise in a number of hematological malignancies.  ABT-888 is another compound within our oncology pipeline poised to advance into Phase III in early 2014. ABT-888 is a PARP inhibitor. It has shown promise in enhancing the effectiveness of common cancer therapies such as chemotherapy and radiation. It's currently in Phase IIB for bracket deficient breast cancer and other cancers.  ABT-126 is our alpha-7 NNR agonist, currently in Phase IIB trials for Alzheimer's disease. And cognizant impairment associated with schizophrenia. Data from our Phase IIA proof of concept study in Alzheimer's disease will be presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in July. And we'll present results from the schizophrenia study in 2014. Provided our Phase IIB clinical work is successful, we'll initiate Phase III trials in both indications in 2014.  ABT-719, our novel investigational compound for the prevention of acute kidney injury. Additional confirmatory Phase IIB study is currently ongoing. And we'll enable Phase III initiation in early 2014.  Elagolix is compound with a unique profile currently in development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids, both prevalent conditions with few treatment options. Our Phase III program for endometriosis is ongoing. And we recently initiated a Phase IIB study in uterine fibroids. Again, pending success in our mid-stage trial, the fibroid program is also poised to advance to Phase III next year. So as you can see, we have a number of exciting programs on track to advance to Phase III development over the next year or so. In addition to these assets, we have several other promising compounds already in late stage development. This includes Daclizumab, which is in Phase III development in partnership with Biogen, for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Data from the first of two registrational trials, the select study, were recently published in the Lancet. And results of the second year extension of that study called Selection were recently presented at the American Academy and Neurology meeting. We expect results from the second pivotal study in 2014. And finally, a central program within our late stage pipeline is our Interferon free HCV combination. All the Phase III studies that will be included in our initial registration are now underway and enrolling very well. In fact, ahead of expectations. As we said before, the primary focus of our program is on delivering Interferon free treatments and offer patients the best chance for cure. Our approach is to maximize SBR rates across various patient types from naïve patients to the most difficult to treat with the simplest possible therapy.  Earlier this week at the ESO meeting in Amsterdam, we presented data from our large Phase IIB Aviator study showing that conditions with reduced response to Interferon base therapies, such as the level of fibrosis or IL28B genotype do not impact response to our Interferon free therapy. We expect our Phase III study to begin to read out later this year and into 2014. Reporting registration submission in mid-2014 given that our compounds have been granted fast track status by the FDA, we expect market entry in early 2015.  So in summary, we've delivered a strong first quarter. And we continue to drive strong performance with our flagship product, HUMIRA as well as other products in our specially focused portfolio. And we continue to make notable progress in advancing our pipeline, which we believe includes a number of exciting programs that have the potential to address significant medical need. For a company of our size, the potential sales projections in our late stage pipeline represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth beginning in the 2015 timeframe.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.
William J. Chase:  Thank you, Rick. Today, I'll spend some time talking about our first quarter performance. I'll then turn to our outlook for the remainder of 2013. As Rick said, we're very pleased with the strong first quarter we delivered. Total sales increased 5.1% on an operational basis excluding an unfavorable 1.4% impact from foreign exchange.  Excluding TriCor/Trilipix due to loss of exclusivity, sales increased 8.6% on an operational basis.  The first quarter adjusted gross margin ration was 76.2% excluding intangible amortization and other specified items in line with our expectation for the quarter. This reflects both the loss of exclusivity within our lipid franchise as well as the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange on the ratio.  Adjusted SG&A was 27.9% of sales in the first quarter including continued investment in our growth brands and the incremental costs of becoming an independent company. This level of investment was in line with our expectations for the quarter. And we remain on track for a full-year adjusted SG&A of around 26% of sales.  Adjusted R&D was 14.6% of sales in the first quarter reflecting funding actions in support of our emerging mid and late stage pipeline and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications.  Net interest expense was $66 million in the first quarter. And other income was $18 million. The adjusted tax rate was 22.2% in the quarter.  First quarter adjusted earnings per share excluding non-cash intangible amortization expense and specified items were $0.68, which exceeded our previous guidance range. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.60 per share.  Turning to product sales in the quarter, HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $2.2 billion, up more than 17% on an operational basis. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased nearly 24% driven by continued market expansion and share gains in the (duram) and gastro segments.  Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 13% on an operational basis and nearly 11% on a reported basis as a result of strong market growth and some modest benefit from tender timing. As we look to the second quarter for international HUMIRA sales specifically, we would expect a modest negative impact from tender timing in some markets, particularly Brazil. On a global basis however, we expect low double digit sales growth for HUMIRA in the second quarter in line with our full year outlook.  AndroGel sales were up low single digits in the quarter following strong 2012 performance. AndroGel continues to maintain more than 60% share of the testosterone replacement market.  Growth in the quarter was impacted by a moderation in the rate of overall market growth as well as the year-over-year impact of rebating actions implemented in mid-2012. Based on current trends, we're forecasting AndroGel sales growth in the mid-single digits for 2013.  Global sales of Lupron were approximately $180 million in the first quarter. For the full year 2013, we expect Lupron sales to be roughly in line with 2012.  Moving onto our lipid franchise, TriCor/Trilipix sales were $128 million in the quarter, down roughly 50% due to the entry of generic Fenofibrate in November of 2012. U.S. sales of Niaspan were $186 million in the quarter, down 2.6%. As a reminder, we're forecasting 2013 sales of less than $1 billion for our combined lipid franchise, reflecting a decline of roughly $1.2 billion, which will be exhibited more acutely in the second half of the year. We plan to offset our lipid franchise decline through growth of key marketed products including HUMIRA.  Moving onto Snythroid where U.S. sales were $119 million in the quarter. Synthroid maintains strong brand loyalty and market leadership despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. For the full year, we expect to see Synthroid sales growth in the mid-single digits.  U.S. sales of Creon were $90 million in the first quarter, up more than 32% compared to the first quarter of 2012. Creon maintains market leadership in the pancreatic enzyme market where we continue to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. This quarter, we received FDA approval for a new dosage strength of Creon. The new 36,000 lipase unit dose is the highest available, which may help to reduce pill burden for some patients. This approval further strengthens our leadership position because we are able to offer patients the broadest range of dosage strengths in the class. In 2013, we expect U.S. Creon sales to grow at a low double-digit pace.  Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease performed well in the first quarter with growth of more than 8%. Duodopa is currently approved in Europe and other international markets. We completed registrational studies last year. And are in the process of pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.  Turning now to our full year 2013 outlook, we are confirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.03 to $3.13. This guidance continues to contemplate sales somewhat above $18 billion reflecting growth from key brands offsetting the expected decline in lipids. Included in our sales guidance is an estimated negative impact from exchange of slightly less than 1%.  We're forecasting a gross margin ratio of around 76.5% for the full year excluding non-cash amortization. This forecast reflects both the impact of loss of exclusivity events and the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange.  We anticipate R&D expense to be approximately 14.5% of sales reflecting funding actions in support of our emerging mid and late state pipeline and the continued pursuit of additional HUMIRA indications. And we expect SG&A to be around 26% of sales.  We're forecasting net interest expense of approximately $300 million for the full year. And we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 22% in 2013.  Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range excludes $0.37 per share of non-cash intangible amortization expense and certain specified items primarily associated with separation related costs and ongoing restructuring activities. Earnings per share would be $2.66 to $2.76 on a GAAP basis. We're still in the process of quantifying certain one-time costs related to the separation. And we will look to further refine our forecasts of these specified items as the year progresses. Finally, we expect approximately $6 billion of operating cash flow in 2013.  Regarding our second quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share or $0.78 to $0.80. This excludes roughly $0.12 of specified items and non-cash amortization resulting in a second quarter GAAP EPS of $0.66 to $0.68.  Our second quarter outlook reflects sales growth in the low single digits on a reported basis including a modest impact from negative exchange. We expect the gross margin ratio for the quarter to be somewhat above our full year guidance. And we expect R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales to be in line with our full year outlook.  So in conclusion, we're pleased with our first quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Larry Peepo:  Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Elan, we'll take our first question.  
Operator:  (Operator instructions). Our first question today is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. 
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Just a couple of questions. First, can you hear me okay? 
Richard Gonzalez:  We can. 
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: Great. So on HUMIRA, sales were up 17% on an operational basis. Bill, you talked about tendering that could impact international sales, but still, your guidance for the full year of low double digit growth does assume a, you know, decline in the pace of growth throughout the year. I’m just wondering if you could talk about why you expect such a slowdown or if it’s just too early in the year to make adjustments to your forecast?  And secondly, if John Leonard is on the phone, I just wanted to ask a question on ABT-199. It sounds like you’re making progress with the FDA in refining the trial so that you can remove the pause, but what gives you confidence that the tumor lysis syndrome is based on a dose response mechanism and not based on the drug mechanism itself? Thanks very much. 
Richard Gonzalez:  Thanks, Jami. 
John Leonard:  Jami, it’s John Leonard. I will go first. Thanks for the question. Just for everybody on the phone, let me remind you, we had, at the very end of last year some instances of tumor lysis syndrome in some of our early studies with ABT-199.  We voluntarily paused enrollment in some of the studies that we were doing and with the FDA, went on a partial clinical hold for the CLL studies. In the last couple of months, we’ve very carefully gone back retospectfully looking at all those patients to understand what might be any risk factors for TLS and now we’ve been working with the FDA. So let me give you a sense of exactly where we are.  We’ve identified risk factors that we think are clearly related to the tumor burden itself. In other words, those patients that had experienced any evidence of POS all had large tumor burdens associated with it. And with that, we have taken that into consideration going forward.  So I’m pleased to report that in the instances of multiple myrloma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, we’ve resumed enrollment, that site is actively going on. And we’re in the very final stages of working with the FDA to resume enrollment in the CLL studies.  Essentially what’s going on is some final work to refine the actual prophylactic regiment for handling some well-known side effects of TLS.  I think to your question, Jami, we’re pretty confident that one can step through dosing in a graded fashion and have tumor dye at a controlled rate and well-known, well-characterized prophylactic measurements – or measures. We believe that we should be able to readily handle TLS. 
Richard Gonzalez:  Jami, this is Rick. So let me answer your HUMIRA question. Certainly, we’re off to a strong start. Now, one of the things that Bill pointed out in his remarks is we did have some tenders move from second quarter into first quarter, so first quarter is, you know, slightly up and we’ll see that reverse in second quarter. But all in all, still overall, if you looked at the average, we have very strong growth. We’re also only a quarter into 2013, so it’s probably a little early to change any projects that we have for the product. But I – suffice to say, we’re confident with the performance that we’ve projected for HUMIRA and we’ll just have to see how the rest of the year plays out. 
Jami Rubin – Goldman Sachs: Thank you. 
Richard Gonzalez:  Thanks, Jami. 
Operator:  Thank you. And our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. 
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: Thanks very much. 
Richard Gonzalez:  Good morning. 
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley: I have three questions on separate drug candidates. First, and, you know, I don’t think it’s worth going into a lot of detail because there would be too much ground to cover on HCV, but if you could hopefully just frame, as you see it, the timing of launch for your all-oral regimen and if you could position that relative to Gilead’s timing, that would be helpful in terms of the all-oral regimen.  And then second, with respect to ABT-199, I’m just curious about whether there’s any risk of the lower dosing constraining the efficacy? I.e. yielding lower efficacy. And then finally, with respect to ABT-126, I noticed in the press release that you’re hoping to start Phase III trials next year. Could you just talk about the timing of news flow for ABT-126 for Alzheimer’s and also for cognition and schizophrenia? Thank you. 
John Leonard:  Okay, I’ve been scribbling notes with your questions. :Let me take them in reverse. So ABT-126, let me give you a sense of where we are, David. We’re doing Phase IIb work as we speak and that’s meant to extend the proof of concept, call it 2a work that was done with modified studies and limited dosing. So what we want to do is more fully flush out what the efficacy curve might look like and with that, characterize even higher doses that we were not in a position to test when we did our first study.  Two different indications, you’re correct. Alzheimer’s disease as well as cognitive disorders, so schizophrenia or CIA as it’s now called.  With respect to the news flow, we will share the data from that first 2a study in Alzheimer’s disease in July at the Alzheimer’s meeting and our plans right now for the CIS data would be in 2014. We haven’t chosen a venue yet, but as we have that, obviously, we’ll share that with you.  Let me move onto 199. It’s sort of an extension, I think, of Jami’s earlier question. The premise of your question, I think, is a little incorrect if I understood it. I took it to imply that what we’re doing is giving lower doses on a continuous basis of the patients, and therefore, the higher doses that we might want to get to may not be reached and therefore, efficacy might be constrained a bit. That’s not what we’re doing. Essentially what we’re doing is a walking up doses and we’re convinced that as tumor dies the risk of tumor lysis syndrome will recede because there’s less material from the tumor to be dealt with and therefore you can get to those higher doses that have been associated with the outstanding activity that we’ve observed today.  So it may take a little bit longer to get there, which is what we’ll be working out here as we go, but in terms of being able to deliver what we want to deliver for these patients, we’re very confident we’re going to be able to get there.  And then finally HCV was the first question, launch timing. I mean, it’s no secret that we’re all working as fast as we can. It’s a very competitive space. We have an excellent team on that. They’re working flat out. We’ve communicated along the way that we would expect a very early 2015 launch. We’re confident that we will meet that and we’ll see where Gilead is with respect to that timing as well. 
David Risinger – Morgan Stanley:  Thank you. 
Richard Gonzalez:  Thanks David. 
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies. 
Jeff Holford – Jefferies & Company: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just got two really. First off, on the additional HUMIRA patents that you have submitted to the patent office already, I think they’re mainly manufacturing and formulation patents, can you give us any update on any expected timing of when we might see some more news on those? And also, just around that as well, when you might begin to flush out how the new formulation work around HUMIRA and when we’ll get some more visibility on that too.  And then the second question is just some dated thoughts really from you if you have any on the competitive positioning of your Hep C cocktail following these updates from Gilead and in particular, Bristol Myers as well. Thank you. 
William Chase:  Thanks, Jeff. I’ll take the HUMIRA patent question and the reformulations and I’ll let Dr. Leonard or Rick go with the latter question.  You know, certainly we do have a number of patents that we have submitted at this point in time. You’re right to characterize those as process manufacturing, etcetera. You know, obviously, this is very competitive space and you know, we’re not going to provide a lot of granularity around what those look like and the timing, but it’s safe to say that we do have a fairly significant and robust portfolio of applications in right now. Obviously trying to do as much as we can to protect HUMIRA in the event that bio-similars do find a pathway to market.  In terms of reformulation, again, a similar story. You know, we’ve talked about opportunities to enhance the product both from a delivery mechanism as well as the product itself. We’re not going to be very specific in terms of what that looks like and the timing, but again, we are working on those. We have a window here, our patents don’t expire until later in the decade and we’re putting forth as much effort as we can right now to enhance the products such that if someone is working towards a bio-similar of today’s product, that may not be the product that exists down the road.  So I think I’ll leave it at that, Jeff. Hopefully that’s helpful. 
Jeff Holford – Jefferies & Company: Thank you. 
Richard Gonzalez:  Jeff, this is Rick. So on the competitiveness of the HCV, you know, as I said in my comments, you know, our goal is to basically deliver therapy to the marketplace. It gives patients the greatest opportunity to be cured. And we want to do that as broadly as we possibly can across [inaudible]. We want to be able to do that for naïve patients and we want to do that for even the very difficult to treat and all those fibrotic patients, et cetera.  I think as we look at our data and the data we just presented last week at EASL, I think we’re demonstrating that. You know, you look at the fibrosis data and the aisle 28b data that we presented at that meeting and I think we have outstanding performance, right. It doesn’t degrade at all. So I think we feel very good about the competitiveness of our program based on the objectives that we have for it and we feel good about the timeline that we’re operating against.  And so, I think we have a high level of confidence in our HCV program. 
Jeff Holford – Jefferies & Company: Thanks very much.
Richard Gonzalez:  Thanks, Jeff. 
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Gilbert from Bank of America.  
Greg Gilbert – Bank of America: Thank you, good morning. A couple quick ones. First, is there any color on HUMIRA outside the U.S. you can offer in terms of lumpy order patterns or tenders as we progress through the remaining quarters of the year?  Secondly, I was curious if you’re willing to quantify your royalty burden on the product and how that changes over time?  And third, for John, I wanted your take on your strategy for – and sort of your take on overall the breakthrough status versus fast-track status that is available to the industry and how that might apply to your novel portfolio. Thanks. 
John Leonard:  It’s John. The regulatory question of breakthrough status, you know, it’s an avenue that the Food and Drug Administration has opened up that we think is a valuable one in that it permits more access and more opportunity to discuss data as it emerges and to have good planning. It doesn’t necessarily predict a regulatory outcome, however, or accelerate the review. So we filed for breakthrough status on some of our products and we’re looking forward to hearing from the FDA so that we can, as always, welcome additional interaction with them.  But I think in terms of planning for review status and all that, I would treat it essentially the same way that we always have until now. 
William Chase:  And Greg, it’s Bill Chase. On the – on your HUMIRA tender question, as you know, tenders occur fairly choppily throughout the year. If you look at Q1 in international, even if you exclude those tenders, international still had double digit HUMIRA growth. The tenders actually gave it about a 3% lift. We’d see that basically coming out of Q2 and then the second half of the year, a little difficult to call at this point in time, but it does have a tendency to move around a little bit on us and we’ll certainly give you visibility as that occurs. 
Greg Gilbert – Bank of America: Okay, so a few percentage points in a given quarter is a decent way to think about it? 
William Chase:  Yeah, I think that’s the right way to look at it. 
Greg Gilbert – Bank of America: Okay. Thanks. 
Richard Gonzalez:  And Greg, this is Rick on the HUMIRA royalties. You know, we don’t provide product level P&L detail, so we’re not going to go through the royalties in any level of detail. What I would say is there have been reports put out, Jami’s report in particular that came out recently. I think the premise behind that report, we would feel is accurate, is appropriate. And the range that was characterized in that report of 5 to 10%, if you looked at it across on a global basis I think is a reasonable range to think about it. So I think that should give you some clarity around the royalties and the expiration of those royalties. 
Greg Gilbert – Bank of America: Thanks. 
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Shad from JPMC. 
Chris Shad - JPMC: Great, thanks very much. Just a couple questions here. The first is, just with the negative opinion from [inaudible] last night in Europe, just mention any thoughts you might have of kind of what that means to the dynamic impact to the HUMIRA business, et cetera.  The second question, just coming out of EASL, I think there was some comments in the company that they would consider looking for partners in the [inaudible]. I just wonder if you could elaborate a little bit on that and talk about any priorities there.  And then finally on the oral [inaudible] programs, just update where we are there maybe as you’re considering that, just maybe longer-term, how important do you see having an oral agent in the portfolio and maybe second, how much differentiation you believe you believe you’re going to see between the various jacks that are out there. Thank so much. 
John Leonard:  Thanks for the question, it’s John Leonard. Let me start with the EASL comments. Scott’s comments were taken out of context and are not accurate. We’re very confident in the work that we have with our first generation program. We’re also extremely excited and confident about the elements of our second generation program. We’ve not been actively looking for partners. I think the story was essentially a distraction.  With respect to Jack, the importance of having an oral jack, we’ve shared our longer-term strategy in the immunology space is to try to enhance the overall benefit risk profile and I think we’ve seen some evidence of how important that is. Our goal is to take some of the learnings that have come from the jack space and try to tease that apart and build that into our own oral program with the intention of getting to higher levels of efficacy than achieved in the space. That’s our primary goal and of course, that’s what we’re striving for.  With respect to where we are, you undoubtedly know that we have a relationship with Golopogas, they’ve shared some early information on their compound, which we think is very, very exciting and they’re moving into 2b work the middle of this year. That will be dose ranging that will test q.d. and b.i.d regimens. We’re very excited about its profile, particularly with respect to what we think is a very attractive adverse event profile and the efficacy, oh well, based on small patient numbers for a short duration, we think is definitely intriguing and worth pursuing.  Our own internal jack program goes for great specificity to select out the jack 2 activity, which we think has been dose limiting in some of the first generation compounds and that’s well into its Phase I program and progressing well. 
Richard Gonzalez:  All right, Chris, this is Rick. I’ll cover the Pfizer comment. I mean, basically we don’t know much more about the Pfizer situation than you do, than what’s been publically reported. So you know, I think as far as the dynamics are concerned, our projections would have been a relatively modest impact in 2013 anyway in Europe, based both on the timing and how difficult this market is to break into. I think you’re seeing that in the U.S. launch today. The challenge is that any competitor coming into this market tends to face. I don’t think it has any dramatic impact on what we had forecast and we’ll just have to see how it plays out longer term as Pfizer continues to pursue approval of that product in Europe.  Thanks, Chris. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS. 
Marc Goodman – UBS: Yes, first on Duodopa, which we haven’t talked about yet, can you just give us the sense of what are the major countries that it’s doing well in in Europe and just flush out how you’re doing on the new delivery system that you’re working on? 
John Leonard:  With respect to Duadopa’s launch, primarily in Europe, and it’s used most in the Nordic countries, I think that’s where it’s getting most of its use.  Thanks, Marc. 
Operator:  Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Tong from Wells Fargo
Michael Tong – Wells Fargo: Hi, good morning. I actually want to ask an AndroGel question. You made the comment about a slowdown in the growth of that market. Do you think that’s temporary or is that permanent and are you surprised that the market growth has actually decelerated with a couple of new entries or, you know, recent entries into the marketplace?  And then second question is, from Bill, if you can remind me your CapEx expectations for 2013? Thanks. 
Richard Gonzalez:  Michael, this is Rick. On AndroGel, you know, we have seen the markets slow down. You have to remember, this is a market that grew very rapidly in 2012, so if you look at the average in the first quarter, I think it’s down around high-single to 10% kind of range. You know, I think that’s probably a reasonable expectation to think about going forward from a market growth standpoint, that this market will grow roughly in the high-single digits kinds of ranges going forward. I don’t think that surprises us that much. You know, every market tends to slow down over time and I think if you look at the fundamentals of this market, that’s what we would expect going forward.  And so that – our planning assumptions are now built around that kind of market growth going forward for 2013. 
William Chase:  And Michael, it’s Bill. On a CapEx, this is a business that runs pretty lean on CapEx. We are, over the next couple of years, obviously going to have to separate from Abbott, which will increase CapEx somewhat, but this year we’re anticipating about 500 to $600 million. 
Michael Tong – Wells Fargo: Thank you. 
William Chase:  Thanks, Michael. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. 
Alex Arfaei – BMO Capital Markets:  Good morning. Thank you for talking the questions. Just a follow-up on HUMIRA. I was wondering if I could ask a higher-level question. We’d love to get your insight about some of the trends you’re seeing in different geographies, for example, are things getting better in Europe? You know, if you could elaborate a little bit more on emerging markets. We know there are a few smaller biosimilars in a couple of emerging market countries, if you see that a, you know, what your outlook is with that in general. Just an overall picture on, not just so much for arthritis but also different indications. Thank you. 
Richard Gonzalez:  Alex, this is Rick Gonzalez. So I think if you look at Europe and you’re seeing this for a number of years now, we continue to see good strong robust growth in Europe in this particular area. I think one of the things that Europe has really adopted and valued is the ability to be able to put the disease in remission and be able to hold it in remission for long periods of time. So you know, we continue to see market growth in the double digit range in that market. When you look at the penetration rates across all three major areas, the penetration rates are still relatively low and so we would expect that we’ll continue to see that growth going forward in the programs that we have I place I think have been demonstrated to be very effective at both helping market growth as well as driving improvement in share, growth in share in the indications particularly [inaudible] as I indicated. But also we’re continuing to hold our own from an RA shares standpoint. And so I think we feel good about the dynamics in Europe. You know, there’s still problematic countries in Europe, for sure, but I think overall, if you look at Europe in general it’s performing within our expectations and I think it’s a market that we think is a good market for products like HUMIRA.  As far as the emerging market, I think one of the things that’s important to remember is that, you know, the majority of our business is still in the developed markets, roughly 85% of our revenues come from the developed markets. There are some emerging markets like a Brazil that are relatively large markets for us but there are also a number of markets that are relatively small. And so we have not seen any material impact from any biosimilar competition in the emerging markets or anything what we would perceive to be any kind of an issue for the business going forward in those emerging markets. 
Alex (Arfaei) – BMO Capital Markets: Great. Thank you very much.
Larry Peepo :  Thanks, Alex. We have time for one more question today. 
Operator:  Thank you. Our final question today is from Damien Conover from Morningstar Investment Services. 
Damien Conover – Morningstar Investment Services: Hey, good morning. Thanks for talking my question. Just two questions. One on HUMIRA sales in the U.S.A., very strong growth, but in the press release, rheumatoid arthritis wasn’t really called out for the support of that growth. I was just wondering if you could talk through some of the dynamics there.  And then secondly, when you’re looking at the hepatitis C market in a broad picture, as these next generation of [inaudible] come to the market with very strong efficacy and lower side effects, I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on the expected treatment rates for this space given that it’s very low right now, just so to take a look at the overall market growth. Thank you. 
Unidentified Company Representative:  On HUMIRA U.S. sales, you know, on RA we called out the more rapid growers and that would be gastro and dermatology. Certainly we do still see growth in RA, it’s certainly more modest than those other two areas, call it mid-single digit growth for the market, maybe a little bit stronger for us. And again, holding share despite new entrance into the RA space, but certainly a lot of our growth continues to come from dermatology and gastro, derma on the low end of penetration rates, we continue to see a lift in penetration rates, which, as you know, are still only in the single digits at this point in time in dermatology. So we called up the two biggest growers but RA continues to grow and we’re holding share in that space. 
Richard Gonzalez: And Damien, this is Rick. On the HCV question, you know, as we look at this market, we do expect to see some acceleration, significant acceleration in market growth. I mean, I think to frame the size of the market and give you some perspective on it, you know, today if we look at geno-type 1 and the G7, we would estimate somewhere around 2.5 million people are currently diagnosed as being infected with the disease. If you go back to 2011, roughly 175,000 patients were treated. And so there is some clinical capacity constraints that exist today with the current therapies. As we bring these next generations of products to the marketplace in that 2015 timeframe, there’re obviously simpler protocols to be able to administer from a physician’s standpoint and the side effect profile is dramatically improved from the generation of products that exist today.  So you would expect that you would be able to increase the number of patients who are treated at that point. We’re estimating that that number could grow to the 350 kind of thousand range per year.  As far as the patient types, I think, you know, our perspective on it is, this is a disease that progresses very slowly and as these new therapies come to market, we think that healthcare systems and physicians will prioritize those patients that need the therapy the most and I think particularly if you can bring a therapy to market that has a 90% plus kind of mature rate for those patients, which hasn’t been seen before with the current therapies that exist today, there’ll be motivation to go treat those patients. And so we think in the early parts of the launch, the first few years, that we should see a significant number of those patients being treated. Obviously, that makes us feel good about our particular therapy. Thank you. 
Operator:  That concludes today’s conference call.
